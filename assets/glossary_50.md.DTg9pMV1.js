It was painted between 1505 and 1506, during Raphael's stay in Florence, Italy. It is now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The portrait depicts a woman who is pregnant sitting with her left hand resting on her stomach. Paintings of pregnant women were unusual in the Renaissance period. History The work is mentioned for the first time in an early 18th-century inventory of Palazzo Pitti, as from an unknown artist. In 1813 it was transferred to the Grand Ducal wardrobe of the Uffizi, before returning again to Palazzo Pitti where it should replace several works robbed by the French. In the 1815 inventory it is attributed to Innocenzo da Imola, while in that of 1829 it is again listed as by an unknown painter. It was first ascribed to Raphael in 1839: it is now nearly unanimously considered by the Umbrian painter, with the exception of Italian 19th century art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, who assigned it to Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio. The identification of the portrayed woman is disputed. She could be a member of the Bufalini family of Città di Castello, or Emilia Pia da Montefeltro, due to similarities with the Portrait of Emilia Pia da Montefeltro, now at Baltimore Museum of Art in the United States.

He captained Derbyshire in his last two seasons in the game, and scored over 12,000 runs for the club. Lee was born in Eastwood, Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, and became a schoolteacher after leaving the RAF in 1947. He appeared for Yorkshire Second XI for a couple of seasons before making his debut against Scotland. He played his only County Championship game for Yorkshire against Surrey in August 1952, deputising for Len Hutton, and was an instant success, opening the batting and scoring 74 and 14 as Yorkshire cruised to a nine wicket win. Despite this bright start Lee was not retained by the county, and his county career might have ended there. He played in a match for the Minor Counties against the Australian tourists at Stoke on Trent in 1953 and, though he only scored 23, he was their sole source of resistance as they crumbled for 56 and 65 against Ray Lindwall and Richie Benaud. Derbyshire were impressed by his knock, and he joined the county for a ten-year stint in which he played 268 matches and rose to the captaincy. Lee's new start was initially impeded by a broken leg, suffered while playing football, but he soon established himself in the team in the 1954 season and was awarded his cap in the 1956 season. A canny right-hander, he made 1,000 runs for eight successive seasons, nudging the ball into the gaps without often dominating the bowling. He cut loose in the occasional run chase, hitting five sixes off Jim McConnon at Swansea in the 1958 season and five more at Lord's in the 1961 season. In the 1963 season, he became county captain but, with their fast bowler Les Jackson in decline, he had little ammunition to work with. Derbyshire took the wooden spoon in his first season at the helm, but recovered to 12th in the 1964 season under his genial leadership before he decided to return to teaching. A right-handed batsman, Lee scored 12,129 runs in all matches, with eight centuries and a best of 150 for Derbyshire against Gloucestershire and 147 against Nottinghamshire. He averaged 26.59 and took 202 catches. He took 21 wickets at 34.33 with his occasional right arm medium pace, with a best of 2 for 9 against Surrey. He played in just two Gillette Cup matches, scoring 42 against Northamptonshire.Charles Lee at Cricket Archive Lee played cricket for Swinton C.C. and was captain of Rotherham C.C. in 1971. As a footballer, he was on Hull City's books at one time. Lee died in Leicester at the age of 75.

His artwork reveals a deeply personal world that explores the relationship between painting and sculpture.  Biography  Man Tearing his Heart Out, oil on linen painting by Charles Garabedian, Honolulu Museum of Art Garabedian was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Armenian immigrants who had come to the U.S. to escape the Armenian Genocide. Garabedian's mother died when he was two and his father was unable to take care of the three children. Garabedian lived in an orphanage until age nine, when he, his father, and siblings moved to Los Angeles, California. From 1942-1945, Garabedian served as a staff sergeant in the United States Air Force and was an aerial gunner in the European theater during World War II. Under the auspices of the G.I. Bill, Garabedian studied literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1947 to 1948. He then went on to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history in 1950. He received his master's degree in 1961 at the University of California Los Angeles. He did not, however, become an artist until later in his life. When in his forties, Garabedian began to explore the relationships between painting and drawing. His fascination with China is reflected in many of his pieces incorporating dragons and ornate grillwork and pattern. Although his most prolific period was in the late 1960s, later in his life he still continued to paint. The first solo exhibition of his work was held at the Ceeje gallery in Los Angeles (1963) and subsequent one man shows followed at the Fine Arts Gallery at California State University, Northridge (1974), and The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City (1976). His group exhibitions include the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition: Contemporary American Art, New York (1975) and others. In 1979, he was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. In 2011, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art hosted a retrospective of Garabedian's work.

Alvarez's painting Las Cuatas Diego has been featured in books and exhibitions around the world. Alvarez has also illustrated the bilingual children's book Antonio's Card authored by Rigoberto González. Her work is collected by the Mexican Fine Arts Museum, the Seattle Art Museum and by the Kaiser Foundation.  Biography  Alvarez was born in National City, California to a Cuban father and a Mexican mother. She was raised by both of her parents in San Diego, California and Tijuana, Mexico. Her art draws inspiration from her diverse upbringing within a variety of cultural and political settings. Alvarez is a self-taught artist. Alvarez started studying at San Diego State University, however, she did not complete her education because she felt that it wasn't necessary. She had been told by faculty that because she was a Mexican-American woman, her work would never be considered \\"fine art.\\" Alvarez began to help her family financially at the age of twenty-three, after leaving college. In 1975 Alvarez moved to Washington state where she has created the majority of her artwork. From 1978 to 1981, she attended Eastern Washington University. She currently resides and works in Seattle, Washington with her husband and two children.  Art  Alvarez is primarily a painter, but she has worked on large public artwork and on helping youth to create murals to raise cultural awareness. Alvarez uses personal imagery in her art in order to critique issues that are politically and culturally important to her. She has stated that she hopes to \\"create discourse through her art, on issues of entitlement, poverty and who is expendable in our collective.\\" Alvarez attempts to redefine the cultural values assigned to women and the concept of family using her art. Her duality as a woman and Chicana define her art as she states, \\"how we fit into the universe, telling jokes, music, laying tile, whatever it was that evolved that whole ability to think of our humanity.\\" The recurring use of female images in her work relates to the artists close relationship wither her mother and her aunt, both of whom bestowed upon her the values of family and human connection. Through her art, she hopes to spark dialogue on the societal importance placed on notions like beauty and power. In 1991, Alvarez gifted a color print of her painting \\"Las Cuatas Diego\\" to The Mexican Museum's permanent collection located in San Francisco. In 1994, Alvarez was commissioned by the Washington State Arts Commission for a large public art project where she designed and created art and architectural elements in the Student Activities Center at Seattle Central College. She worked closely with the building's architects. These elements are etched windows, sandblasted concrete patterns, ceramic tiles, and exterior cladding. She noted, “The intent of these patterns was not only to pay homage to the cultures represented, but to attempt to infuse the structures and the site with a sense of belonging and intimacy.” She created the illustrations for the children's book Antonio's Card written by Rigoberto Gonzalez published in 2005.

Because of their genetic diversity and use in traditional Asian medicines, they are a genus with possible economic value. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores because they have a double-walled basidiospore. They may be called shelf mushrooms or bracket fungi. Etymology The name Ganoderma is derived from the Greek ganos/γανος \\"brightness, sheen\\", hence \\"shining\\" and derma/δερμα \\"skin\\".

A. 1902. The Polyporaceae of North America, genus I Ganoderma. Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 29:599-608. Patouillard revised Karsten's genus Ganoderma to include all species with pigmented spores, adhering tubes and laccate crusted pilei, which resulted with a total of 48 species classified under the genus Ganoderma in his 1889 monograph.Patouillard, N. 1889. Le genre Ganoderma. Bull. Soc. mycol. Fr. 5:64-80.Atkinson, G. F. 1908. Observations on Polyporus lucidus Leys and some of its Allies from Europe and North America. Botanical Gazette 46:321-338. Until Murrill investigated Ganoderma in North America in 1902, previous work had focused solely on European species including, for example, G. lucidum, G. resinaceum Boud. (1890) and G. valesiacum Boud. (1895).Adaskaveg, J. E. 1986. Studies of Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae (Delignification, Mating Systems, Root Rot, Cultural Morphology, Taxonomy). Dissertation. The University of Arizona.Murrill, W. A. 1908. Agaricales (Polyporaceae). North Amer. Flora 9:73-131. Description Ganoderma are characterized by basidiocarps that are large, perennial, woody brackets also called \\"conks\\". They are lignicolous and leathery either with or without a stem. The fruit bodies typically grow in a fan-like or hoof-like form on the trunks of living or dead trees. They have double-walled, truncate spores with yellow to brown ornamented inner layers. Phylogeny The genus was named by Karsten in 1881. Members of the family Ganodermataceae were traditionally considered difficult to classify because of the lack of reliable morphological characteristics, the overabundance of synonyms, and the widespread misuse of names. Until recently, the genus was divided into two sections – Ganoderma, with a shiny cap surface (like Ganoderma lucidum), and Elfvingia, with a dull cap surface (like Ganoderma applanatum). Phylogenetic analysis using DNA sequence information have helped to clarify our understanding of the relationships amongst Ganoderma species.Hibbett DS, Donoghue MJ. (1995). Progress toward a phylogenetic classification of the Polyporaceae through parsimony analysis of mitochondrial ribosomal DNA sequences. Can J Bot 73(S1):S853–S861.Hibbett DS, Thorn RG. (2001). Basidiomycota: Homobasidiomycetes. The Mycota VII Part B. In: McLaughlin DJ, McLaughlin EG, Lemke PA, eds. Systematics and evolution. Berlin-Heidelberg, Germany: Springer-Verlag. p 121–168. The genus may now be divided into six monophyletic groups: *G. colossus group *G. applanatum group *G. tsugae group *Asian G. lucidum group *G. meredithiae group *G. resinaceum group With the rise of molecular phylogenies in the late 20th century, species concept hypotheses were tested to determine the relatedness amongst the nuanced morphological variabilities of the laccate Ganoderma taxa. In 1995, Moncalvo et al constructed a phylogeny of the rDNA, which was the universally accepted locus at that time, and found five major clades of the laccate species amongst the 29 isolates tested.Moncalvo, J.-M., Wang, H.-F., and Hseu, R.-S. 1995. Gene phylogeny of the Ganoderma lucidum complex based on ribosomal DNA sequences. Comparison with traditional taxonomic characters. Mycological Research 99:1489-1499. It turned out that G. lucidum was not a monophyletic species, and further work needed to be done to clarify this taxonomic problem. They also found that G. resinaceum from Europe, and the North American 'G. lucidum', which Adaskaveg and Gilbertson found to be biologically compatible in vitro, did not cluster together.Adaskaveg, J. E., and Gilbertson, R. L. 1986. Cultural studies and genetics of sexuality of Ganoderma lucidum and G. tsugae in relation to the taxonomy of the G. lucidum complex. Mycologia:694-705. Moncalvo et al. reject biological species complexes as a sole tool to distinguish a taxon, and suggested using a combination between biological and phylogenetic species concepts to define unique Ganoderma taxa. In 1905, American mycologist William Murrill delineated the genus Tomophagus to accommodate the single species G. colossus (then known as Polyporus colossus) which had distinctive morphological features that did not fit in with the other species. Historically, however, Tomophagus has generally been regarded as a synonym for Ganoderma. Nearly a century later, phylogenetic analyses vindicated Murrill's original placement, as it has shown to be a taxonomically distinct appropriate genus. Significance =Crop diseases= Some Ganoderma species can cause major long-term crop losses, especially with trees: *G. orbiforme (= G. boninense), G. zonatum and G. miniatocinctum are responsible for basal stem rot disease in Asian oil palm plantations.Ling-Chie Wong, Choon-Fah J. Bong, A.S. Idris (2012) Ganoderma Species Associated with Basal Stem Rot Disease of Oil Palm. American Journal of Applied Sciences 9(6): 879-885 (ISSN 1546-9239) *G. philippii and G. pseudoferreum are responsible for the root rot of cacao, coffee, rubber and tea trees. =Industry= Ganoderma are wood-decaying fungi with a cosmopolitan distribution. They can grow on both coniferous and hardwood species. They are white-rot fungi with enzymes that allow them to break down wood components, such as lignin and cellulose. There has been significant research interest on the wood-degrading enzymes of Ganoderma species for industrial applications, such as biopulping and bioremediation. =Phytochemistry= Ganoderma lucidum For centuries, Ganoderma species have been used in traditional medicine in many parts of Asia. These species are often mislabeled as 'G. lucidum', although genetic testing has shown this to be multiple species such as G. lingzhi, G. multipileum, and G. sichuanense.Hennicke, F., Z. Cheikh-Ali, T. Liebisch, J.G. Maciá-Vicente, H.B. Bode, and M. Piepenbring. 2016. “Distinguishing commercially grown Ganoderma lucidum from Ganoderma lingzhi from Europe and East Asia on the basis of morphology, molecular phylogeny, and triterpenic acid profiles.” Phytochemistry 127:29–37.Hapuarachchi, K., T. Wen, C. Deng, J. Kang, and K. Hyde. 2015. “Mycosphere Essays 1: Taxonomic Confusion in the Ganoderma lucidum Species Complex.” Mycosphere 6:542–559. Several species of Ganoderma contain diverse phytochemicals with undefined properties in vivo, such as triterpenoids and polysaccharides, an area of investigation under basic research. Although various Ganoderma species are used in traditional medicine for supposed benefits and have been investigated for their potential effects in humans, there is no evidence from high-quality clinical research that Ganoderma as a whole mushroom or its phytochemicals have any effect in humans, such as in treating cancer.  Notable species *Ganoderma applanatum - Also known as the artist's conk. An infestation of this species was the main factor in the loss of the Anne Frank Tree. *Ganoderma lingzhi - Also known as red reishi, a mushroom used extensively in traditional Asian medicine. *Ganoderma lucidum - A polypore with limited distribution in Europe and parts of China, often misidentified on products labeled reishi or lingzhi that actually contain Ganoderma lingzhi, because of the persistence of outdated naming conventions. * Ganoderma sinense - Also known as black reishi or zizhi. *Ganoderma tsugae - A polypore which grows on conifers, especially hemlock, giving it its common name, hemlock varnish shelf. Similar in appearance to Ganoderma lucidum and a close relative, which typically grows on hardwoods.Kuo M., MushroomExpert.Com, Ganoderma tsugae. (2004, February). Retrieved June 15, 2007.

She was the first African-American graduate from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1918 and later studied at L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris during the early 1920s. She became noted for her work in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1934, Prophet began teaching at Spelman College, expanding the curriculum to include modeling and history of art and architecture. Prophet died in 1960 at the age of 70. Prophet faced many struggles through her lifetime. Prophet had a difficult time financing her work and appealed to various foundations for funding and was often turned down. She also struggled with having her work exhibited and at times using the name Eli Prophet when she entered works into exhibition. Throughout her time in Paris, Prophet was constantly on the brink of starvation. Nevertheless, Prophet retained a strong work ethic passed down from her parents. A perfectionist who did all her own carving, her surviving output is small. Biography = Early life = Nancy Elizabeth Profitt was born on March 19, 1890 in Warwick, Rhode Island to William H. Profitt and Rosa E. Walker Profitt. (She changed the spelling of her last name to Prophet in 1932.) She was the second of three children and the only daughter of her parents. Her parents were of mixed Native American and African American ancestry; her father was Narragansett. From an early age, Prophet demonstrated a serious interest in drawing and painting. Where her interest in these fields originated from is still unknown. At the time, her parents considered her creative leanings to be impractical. Her parents were proponents of hard work; her mother was a cook and her father was a city worker. They passed their hard work ethic onto their daughter, expecting her to eventually work as a housekeeper or teacher. Despite this pressure, Prophet still found time to pursue her creative passions. When she was 15 years old, Prophet used her small earnings from a part-time housekeeping job to pay for art tutoring. After graduating from high school, Prophet remained in Rhode Island. For five years, she worked as a domestic in private homes in Providence. Following this, she worked at a local law office as a stenographer. Using the wages earned by these two jobs, Prophet was able to attend an art school. = Life at RISD = In 1914, at the age of 24, Prophet enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. She was the only African American student amongst a predominantly white female school population. Despite this, Prophet integrated herself well both academically and socially. In 1915, during her sophomore year, Prophet married Francis Ford, who had briefly attended Brown University. Ford was ten years Prophet's senior and worked as a waiter at a restaurant in Providence while Prophet continued her studies at RISD. They had no children and eventually separated in 1932.Cary D. Wintz and Paul Finkelman, \\"Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance,\\" Taylor and Francis, 2004. While at RISD, Prophet studied painting and free-hand drawing, especially portraiture.Alisha Pina, \\"Sculptor Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, RISD's First Black Graduate...,\\" Providence Journal, 14 April 2014. She graduated from the school in 1918. = Post-Graduation = During the following year after her graduation, Prophet took additional courses in sculpture at RISD. At this time, Prophet was living in a rooming house with both her husband and recently widowed father. She attempted to work as a portrait painted full-time but was not successful. Unable to get any exhibitions or gallery representation, she ended up painting only a few portraits of Providence residents. Prophet returned once again to domestic work in order to earn funds to travel to France in 1922. = Work in Paris = Prophet moved to Paris in 1922 to study sculpture. Most of the evidence for the twelve years she spent in France comes from her diary, a forty-six page hand-written manuscript, in which she portrays periods of intense activity contrasting with periods of extreme depression. Although she claimed to have studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, they have no record of her, and she probably studied at one of the connected ateliers. Prophet arrived in Paris in August of either 1921 or 1922 and obtained a studio on Avenue du Chatillon in Montparnasse. In the Fall of 1922 or 1923 to the Spring of 1924 or 1925, she studied with Victor Joseph Jean Ambroise Segoffin at the École des Beaux-Arts, a sculptor noted for his statues, tombs, and portrait busts. Under his mentorship, she created two different busts, one of which was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in 1924. It is thought that because the Salon was at that time more rigid in acceptances, Prophet most likely avoided radical themes in her work, and avoided avant- garde work in order for her sculpting to be shown. She later left the École because she believed she could teach herself faster than working under a supervisor, and she bought her own sculpting tools, doing all the carving with no assistance due to her lack of funds. Prophet also studied woodcutting under Oscar Waldmann, a Swiss German sculptor, and marble cutting from Kousouski, a Polish sculptor. In the Fall of 1925, she took on a six-month sublet in a studio on the famous \\"Vercingetroix,\\" where other famous painters, such as Maurice Sterne and Patrick Henry Bruce in 1904, and Per and Lucy Krohg (who worked in Gauguin's former studio in the 1910s) lived and worked. Her move into this studio was precipitated by her willingness to leave her husband, who she believed lacked ambition. In this studio, she began La Volonté, her first lifesize statue. In November 1925, she described feeling soothed from her anxiety and depression while sculpting the head of a man she met in a café. This may have been her work Discontent. left Her polychromed wood head Discontent reflected what she described as \\"a long emotional experience, of restlessness, of gnawing hunger for the way to attainment\\" during this time in her life.Lisa Farrington, \\"Creating Their Own Image: The History of African American Women Artists\\" (NY: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 113. In November 1925, she also began her second life size figure, Le Pélerin. In English, this means The Pilgrim. It is evocative of medieval church statuary and provides nostalgia for the Middle Ages in French art. Le Pélerin, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, (American sculptor, 1890-1960); Bernes, Marouteau& C. (Photographer); Date: c.1922-1929 Her marble bust Silence, a companion piece to Discontent, expresses “months of solitary living in her little Paris apartment, hearing the voice of no one for days on end.” In June 1926, Prophet moved into a new apartment on Rue Broca where she lived for the next eight years. In this new studio, she created her sculpture Prayer (or Poverty), a nude woman in contrapposto, with her right hand on her breast, her head thrown back, and a snake slithering between her ankles resting on her legs. Along with Silence and Discontent, Prophet created a series of other busts; among these are Poise and Head of a Cossack. The visage of Poise is similar to that of Discontent, while Head of a Cossack bears a resemblance to the visage of Poise but is warmer, made of wood, and identifiable with a long hat.Silence, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, (American sculptor, 1890-1960); Bernes, Marouteau& C.

Prisco, ed., Rhode Island Women Speak, East Providence, RI: Rhode Island Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1997, 42 Prophet exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the Societe des Artistes Francais in Paris. W.E.B. Du Bois and Countee Cullen helped submit her work to exhibitions in the United States as well. Prophet won the Harmon Prize for Best Sculpture in 1929. Her wooden sculpture Congolaise imitates noble conflict and \\"speaks to the ancestral legacy articulated by Locke and Du Bois\\" during this time. Congolaise, Nancy Elizabeth Prophet (American sculptor, 1890-1960); Date: 1931 Returning to the United States in 1932, Prophet saw her work continue to gain attention. She was invited to exhibit her art in galleries located in New York and Rhode Island. She won the Best in Show prize from the Newport Art Association in 1932. In 1935 and 1937, she participated in the Whitney Museum Sculpture Biennials, and the Sculpture International exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1940. Congolaise became one of the first works by an African American acquired by the Whitney.Lisa Farrington, \\"Creating Their Own Image: The History of African American Women Artists\\" (NY: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 114. = Work in Atlanta = Prophet moved her studies down to Atlanta, Georgia, and began a career as a professor teaching art students enrolled at both Atlanta University and Spelman College in 1934, in hopes of encouraging the creative minds of youth, the encouragement she was not presented with during her early years. At Spelman, she developed the curriculum in fine arts and art history and welcomed students to her own home. In 1945, Prophet returned to Rhode Island to escape the racial segregation and rejection she had faced in the South. Prophet became a Roman Catholic in 1951. She attempted to regain her status as an artist but had to turn to other employment, including in a ceramics factory and as a domestic work. Her exhibit at the Providence Public Library proved to be the last during her lifetime. = Later years and death = Near the end of her life, Prophet faced an internal conflict about her identity involving her dual ancestry. She proclaimed her Native American heritage alone, refusing to acknowledge her African-American ancestry.

He won the 1970 Salón de Artistas Colombianos. Rayo worked with abstract geometry primarily employing black, white, red and yellow. He was part of the Op Art movement. Rayo's work shows that geometric art is as much a part of the past as it is of the future. He used traces of the past to discover new ways to present visual and geometric sketches. The Museo Rayo de Dibujo y Grabado Latinoamericano was founded on January 20, 1981 by Rayo in his hometown of Roldanillo with funds the artist himself provided. The museum was also funded with help from the Colombian government and others so that this site would remain a permanent exhibit of his works of art during the late 1980s.

Lites (born 1953 in Pentwater, Michigan) is an American sports executive who currently serves as CEO and alternate governor of the Dallas Stars of the NHL. He was formerly the president of Hicks Sports Marketing Group, and as such was president of the Stars and Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball, both of which were holdings of Tom Hicks, from 1993 to 2002 and from 2003 to 2007. Lites was briefly President and COO of the Phoenix Coyotes from March through December 2002. He was brought back as president and CEO of the Stars on November 18, 2011 when the club was sold to Tom Gaglardi. He has since yielded the presidency to Brad Alberts, but is still operating head of the franchise. Lites had previously served as an executive in the front office of the Detroit Red Wings during the 1980s. Biography Lites graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor of arts degree in 1975 and graduated cum laude from Wayne State University Law School in 1978. When he practiced law, he specialized in litigation and labor contract negotiations. Hicks Sports Marketing Group The Dallas Stars had a mediocre start to the 2007–2008 NHL season, initially going 7–7–3. On November 13, 2007, after a meltdown by the team in Los Angeles (losing 6–5 in OT after leading 4–0 with 7 minutes remaining in the game), Lites dismissed General Manager Doug Armstrong, and replaced him with the tandem of Brett Hull and Les Jackson. The next day, team owner and chairman Tom Hicks reassigned Lites to head Hicks Sports Marketing Group. Lites oversees the sponsorship and marketing of the Dallas Stars and did so for Texas Rangers, Liverpool Football Club and Mesquite Championship Rodeo until they were sold. Controversial comments On December 28, 2018, while serving as CEO of the Dallas Stars, Lites made detrimental and controversial comments to The Athletic regarding two of the team's star players, Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn. In reference to the duo, Lites was quoted as saying \\"They are fucking horse-shit, I don’t know how else to put it,\\" singling out the pair after a 2 - 0 Dallas win over the Nashville Predators a day earlier. The comments were made during an invitation-only Q&A; session with the media which Lites allegedly convened strictly for the purpose of publicly berating Seguin and Benn. During the same session, Lites also urged the local sports media to rip the players as well. Benn responded by telling the media \\"When there is a situation within the organization, I try to keep it within the organization and deal with it face to face\\", adding \\"I don't play for (Lites). I play for every player in this room, the coaching staff.\\" On December 30, 2018, the NHLPA commented on the issue in a press release, referring to Lites' comments as \\"reckless and insulting\\" and \\"unprofessional\\" while adding that \\"In professional sports, all individual players and teams go through highs and lows, but this is not how professionals handle adversity.\\" At the time, the Stars sat fourth in the NHL's Central Division with a 19-16-3 record.

Paste has been described as \\"a framework for web frameworks\\".http://blog.ianbicking.org/its-not-another-damn-framework.html The Python Paste package contains Python modules that help in implementing WSGI middleware. The package includes a WSGI wrapper for CGI applications. It also includes a simple webserver that can produce WSGI requests. WSGI middleware The WSGI standard is an interface that allows applications to use Python code to handle HTTP requests. A WSGI application is passed a Python representation of an HTTP request by an application, and returns content which will normally eventually be rendered by a web browser. A common use for this is when a web server serves content created by Python code. There are, however, other uses: WSGI middleware is Python code that receives a WSGI request and then performs logic based upon this request, before passing the request on to a WSGI application or more WSGI middleware. WSGI middleware appears to an application as a server, and to the server as an application. This is analogous to the function of pipes on Unix systems. Functionality provided by WSGI middleware may include authentication, logging, URL redirection, creation of sessions, and compression. Paste helps in developing such WSGI middleware systems. For example, it is used in the Pylons web application framework. Subcomponents of Paste  Paste has been a long- running open source project, dating from at least 2005. As it has grown, it has unbundled several other utilities from the Paste core. These utilities are part of the Paste project, but form their own packages and have their own version numbers. They include: * Paste Deploy is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications and servers. * Paste Script, ScriptType, INITools, Tempita, WaitForIt, WPHP, WSGIFilter, and WSGIProxy are other notable bundles. * WebTest * WebOb is a wrapper around the WSGI environment.

The refuge protects mixed habitat types including oak savanna, Big Woods, and wetlands. The St. Francis River flows through the eastern side of the park. Over 230 species of birds, 58 species of mammals, and 25 species of reptiles and amphibians have been recorded in the refuge. History Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge, Minnesota Native American village sites dating back to 1300 CE have been found within the refuge, although the area is assumed to have been inhabited for much longer. The mixture of habitats and abundance of water bodies produced a large and diverse wildlife population. The first European settlers arrived in the 1870s. As land use was altered for agriculture, wildfire was suppressed and drainage ditches were cut. This had the effect of reducing the number of year-round wetlands and increasing the density of the wooded areas. By the 1940s conservationists and sportsmen recognized the former quality of the area and its potential for restoration. Minnesota's conservation department investigated the possibility of creating a state wildlife area. It was ultimately conceded that the state simply did not have the funds to acquire the land from its nearly 300 separate owners, and in 1960 a formal request was made to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to consider the site for federal protection. This was formally approved on May 18, 1965, and purchase of refuge lands was begun with revenue from the sale of duck stamps. Recreation Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge In winter most of the refuge lands are open for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and hiking. From March 1 to August 31 visitor access is restricted to the following areas so that wildlife can breed without disturbance. * Prairie's Edge Wildlife Drive, which is open to automobiles, bicyclists, and hikers from late April through October. This gravel road loops through wetlands and prairie and features three observation decks and three short loop hikes. * Blue Hill Trail, with three loops and a short spur to the top of Blue Hill, the highest point in the refuge. * Mahnomen Trail, with another three interconnected loops through wooded uplands. * Canoe route on a stretch of the St. Francis River and its tributary Battle Brook. * Designated fishing access points. Hikers can pick berries and mushrooms for personal consumption within 100 feet of the trails. Big game, small game, and waterfowl hunting seasons are held in the fall. The entire refuge is for day-use only. Overnighting visitors are referred to a campground in the adjacent Sand Dunes State Forest. References *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

He is a political activist known for his libertarian views. Despite that, he is also known for his support of the Constitution Party (United States) and endorsement of several of their Candidate's From 2001 to 2006 Drolet served in the Michigan House of Representatives. Drolet also served as a Macomb County, Michigan county commissioner from 1999–2000 and from 2006–2008.  Michigan Civil Rights Initiative chairmanship  In the 2006 election he acted as statewide Chair of the successful Michigan Civil Rights Initiative. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative used the petition process to place a state constitutional amendment (Proposal 2 of November 2006) before voters that prohibits governments in Michigan from discriminating against, or giving preferential treatment to, any citizen on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of government hiring, contracting, or state university admissions. The amendment was approved by 58% of voters despite the fact that proponents were heavily outspent in the campaign by opponents who supported race-based government preference programs.  Eminent domain reform During his final term in the state legislature, Drolet co-authored a state constitutional amendment that prohibited governments in Michigan from using their power of eminent domain to seize citizens' private property and turn it over to new owners for their private use. This proposed amendment was Proposal 4 in the November 2006 election and was overwhelmingly adopted by voters.  Michigan Taxpayers Alliance recall effort After serving his final term in the Michigan state House, Drolet founded the Michigan Taxpayers Alliance, which he Chairs. In 2008, Drolet served as Treasurer of Michigan Recalls, which sought the recalls of several state legislators for their votes in favor of income and business tax increases during Michigan's budget crisis in 2007. After a highly acrimonious petition drive and numerous local and federal court battles, Drolet was successful at obtaining the needed signatures to force a recall election against the Speaker of the Michigan House, Andy Dillon (D-Redford Twp.). Drolet and recall proponents were also successful in having the federal courts invalidate as unconstitutional Michigan's highly restrictive laws governing recall petition circulators. The prolonged court battles, however, had the effect of postponing the recall election from the targeted August 2008 primary ballot to the November 2008 general election ballot. Speaker Dillon survived the recall vote by a significant margin and was reelected to office. = Case law= Legal disputes over petition irregularities cited in challenges by Representative Dillon lead to the case of Bogaert v. Land. In the ruling, United States District Judge Robert Holmes Bell agreed with recall supporters that part of Michigan's law governing recall signature gathering was unconstitutional because it infringed on political speech rights protected in the First Amendment. Bell ruled that signatures from voters inside Dillon's district should be counted even if they were collected by petition circulators who lived outside the district or weren't registered to vote. Under Michigan law, those signatures were not previously considered valid. = Award= Drolet received the 2008 Defender of Liberty Award from the Libertarian Party of Michigan. Drolet's work on the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, eminent domain reform, the Andy Dillon Recall effort, and legislation he authored relating to third-party ballot access were cited as reasons for the award. Related write-up  2010 State Senate campaign In 2010, Drolet ran for an open state senate seat in Michigan's heavily-Republican 11th district. The GOP primary pitted Drolet against incumbent state representative Kim Meltzer and former state representative Jack Brandenburg, and was widely portrayed by media as the most contentious primary in the state (political newsletter Gongwer News described the race as, \\"The Macomb County Chainsaw Massacre\\"). Drolet was attacked by opponents for his vote against placing a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the 2006 ballot and for his opposition to the drug war. Meltzer mailed literature to voters accusing Drolet of introducing legislation to legalize \\"gay sex in public\\" and Drolet sued Meltzer for libel. Brandenburg won the primary and was elected to the senate seat, Drolet finished second and Meltzer placed third. Meltzer and Drolet settled the libel suit when Meltzer issued a public apology for her campaign's untrue allegations against Drolet and paid Drolet an undisclosed sum of money.  Arizona's Proposal 107 management After his senate primary defeat, Drolet became campaign manager for Arizona's Proposal 107—a proposed constitutional amendment on the November, 2010 state ballot. Proposal 107 would prohibit governments in Arizona from employing affirmative action policies that discriminate against, or grant preferences to, any individual or group based on race, ethnicity or gender in government hiring, contracting, or public university admissions. Arizona voters passed Proposal 107 by a 59.5% to 40.5% margin.  Defeat of 2016 RTA millage  In 2016, after defeating incumbent Macomb County Commissioner Joseph Sabatini in the August Republican primary election, Drolet led the campaign to defeat a millage initiative to fund the Regional Transit Authority of Southeast Michigan on the November ballot. The proposal would increase property taxes in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and Washtenaw counties for the purpose of increasing regional mass transit spending by $4.7 billion over 20 years. Drolet organized the committee to oppose the tax increase as Treasurer of NoMassiveTransitTax.org. Proponents of the initiative spent over $3.1 million on the 'yes' vote campaign and Drolet's opposition campaign spent less than $65,000. The RTA proposal was defeated by an 895,306 yes to 913,392 no vote.  Personal life Drolet is openly gay.

Common wastewater contains small amounts of oils which enter into septic tanks and treatment facilities to form a floating scum layer. This scum layer is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as lard solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes. Grease traps have been used since Victorian days: Nathaniel Whiting obtained the first patent in the late 1800s. The traps reduce the amount of fats, oils and greases (FOGs) that enter sewers. They comprise boxes within the drain run that flows between the sinks in a kitchen and the sewer system. They only have kitchen waste water flowing through them, and do not serve any other drainage system, such as toilets. They can be made from many different materials, such as stainless steel, plastics, concrete & cast iron. They range from 35 liter capacity to 45,000 liters and greater. They can be located above ground, below ground, inside the kitchen or outside the building. Types Manhole covers of a grease trap outside a restaurant. There are three primary types of device. The most common are those specified by ASME (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary inlet diffuser. Grease trap sizing is based on the size of the 2- or 3-compartment sink, dishwasher, pot sinks, and mop sinks. The cumulative flow rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US. This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGs. It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and approved testing laboratory. The most common passive grease traps are smaller, point-of-use units used under three-compartment sinks or adjacent to dishwashers in kitchens. The second most common type of interceptor is the large in-ground tank, which is usually . These units are constructed of concrete, fiberglass or steel. They have greater grease and solid storage capacities for high-flow applications such as a restaurant or hospital store. They are commonly called gravity interceptors. Interceptors require a retention time of 30 minutes to allow the fats, oils, grease and food solids to settle in the tank. As more waste water enters the tank, the grease-free water is pushed out of the tank. The rotting brown grease inside a grease trap or grease interceptor must be pumped out on a scheduled basis. The brown grease is not recycled and goes to landfill. On average of brown grease goes to landfill annually from each restaurant. A third system type, GRDs (grease recovery devices), removes the grease automatically when trapped. The recovered grease or \\"yellow grease\\" is recycled with the waste vegetable oil from the kitchen's deep-fryers. Restaurants need not effect grease trap pumping as do restaurants with conventional grease traps or grease interceptors. Passive grease traps and passive grease interceptors must be emptied and cleaned when 25% full. As the passive devices fill with fats, oils, and grease, they become less productive for grease recovery. A full grease trap does not stop any FOG from entering the sanitary sewer system. The emptied contents or \\"brown grease\\" is considered hazardous waste in many jurisdictions. Uses In-ground grease trap outside of a shop Restaurant and foodservice kitchens produce much waste grease which is present in the drain lines from various sinks, dishwashers and cooking equipment such as combi ovens and commercial woks. If not removed, the grease can clump and cause blockage and back-up in the sewer. In the US, sewers back up annually “an estimated 400,000 times, and municipal sewer overflows on 40,000 occasions”.Whitman, D. (2000). The sickening sewer crisis. U.S. News & World Report, 128(23), 16. Retrieved Friday, May 04, 2007 from the Business Source Corporate database. The EPA has determined that sewer pipe blockages are the leading cause of sewer overflows, and grease is the primary cause of sewer blockages.EPA. (2004). Report to Congress: impacts and control of CSOs and SSOs (EPA 833-R-04-001). Washington, DC; United State Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water, p. 4-28. http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cso/cpolicy_report2004.cfm Even if accumulated FOG does not escalate into blockages and sanitary sewer overflows, it can disrupt wastewater utility operations and increase operations and maintenance requirements” Mero, C. & Wilkerson, J. (2007). Reduce Sewer Congestion. Water Environment & Technology, 19(7), 44-52. For these reasons, depending on the country, nearly all municipalities require commercial kitchen operations to use some type of interceptor device to collect grease before it enters sewers. Where FOG is a concern in the local wastewater system, communities have established inspection programs to ensure that these grease traps and/or interceptors are being routinely maintained. It is estimated 50% of all sewer overflows are caused by grease blockages, with over of raw sewage spills annually. Method of operation When the outflow from the kitchen sink enters the grease trap, the solid food particles sink to the bottom, while lighter grease and oil floats to the top. The relatively grease-free water is then fed into the normal septic system. The food solids at the bottom and floating oil and grease must be periodically removed in a manner similar to septic tank pumping. A traditional grease trap is not a food disposal unit. Unfinished food must be scraped into the garbage or food recycling bin. Milkshakes, gravy, sauces and food solids must be scraped off dishes before entering the sink or dishwasher. To maintain some degree of efficiency, there has been a trend to specify larger traps. Unfortunately, providing a large tank for the effluent to stand also means that food waste has time to settle to the bottom of the tank, reducing available volume and adding to clean-out problems. Also, rotting food contained within an interceptor breaks down, producing toxic waste (such as sulfur gases) - hydrogen sulfide combines with the water present to create sulfuric acid. This attacks mild steel and concrete materials, resulting in \\"rot out\\", On the other hand, polyethylene has acid-resisting properties. A bigger interceptor is not a better interceptor. In most cases, multiple interceptors in series will separate grease much better. Because it has been in the trap for some time, grease thus collected will be contaminated and is unsuitable for further use. This type of grease is called brown grease. Disposal of trapped grease Waste from passive grease traps and gravity interceptors is called brown grease. Brown grease is rotted food solids in combination with fats, oils, and grease (FOG). Brown grease is pumped from the traps and interceptors by grease pumping trucks. Unlike the collected yellow grease, the majority of brown grease goes to landfill sites. New facilities (2012) and new technology are beginning to allow brown grease to be recycled.

Haslam is a common stop off for campers as they make their way across the Nullarbor Plain. The town itself has no major industrial or commercial connections anymore and contains limited resources including a camping ground and the town jetty.  History  Haslam was established in 1893 as a deep sea port reportedly under the name of Port Carawa to allow the shipping of supplies of machinery and food to the local settlers, as well as providing transport of local products to other parts of the state. When road transport took over in the 1960s, this service died out. The town was proclaimed on 9 October 1913 and takes its name from William Haslam who served as the north-east representative of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1891 to his death in 1898.Manning, Geoffrey H. (1986) The Romance of Place Names in South Australia, p. 87. Adelaide, South Australia: published by the author, Haslam had a post office (originally a receiving office under the name Port Haslam) from 1913.Walker, Martin (2004) The Post, Telegraph and Telephone Offices of South Australia and the Northern Territory, p 142, p. 257. Torrensville, South Australia: published by the author. The area is now served by a community postal agency. The long town jetty was originally built in 1912 to allow ships access to the coast. It was reduced in length by half in 1972. The Haslam Township School opened in 1920, before having its name changed to \\"Maildaburra\\" in 1921. A new school was built in 1930, and was renamed \\"Haslam\\". The school finally closed on the opening of Miltaburra Area School near Wirrulla in 1983, and now serves as a museum. On 15 March 1934, the area of the town was extended by proclamation to include a \\"police reserve\\". The locality's boundaries which were created on 12 April 2001 includes the government town of Haslam. Governance Haslam is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Flinders and the local government area of the District Council of Streaky Bay.

The area is accessible by 2WD vehicles. The bay itself, including two small secluded beaches, faces due east and is protected from the Southern Ocean by a headland formed by the granite massif of Mount Gardiner. The nature reserve was established in 1967 to protect the threatened noisy scrub-bird and its habitat.  History  Sign at Two Peoples Bay Car Park Mt Gardner, Two Peoples Bay Granite point Point across to Mount Gardner Waterfall Beach in Two Peoples Bay 2015 The name \\"Two Peoples Bay\\" is from an incident in 1803 when an American whaling ship used the sheltered waters to lay anchor at the same time as a French vessel that was exploring the coastline east of Albany. John Gilbert, a naturalist, surveyed the area in the 1840s giving his name to the Gilbert's potoroo. Whaling activities were conducted in the bay during the middle of the 19th century.Martin Gibbs, The shore whalers of Western Australia: Historical Archaeology of a Maritime Frontier, Sydney University Press, 2010, p.137-8. Two Peoples Bay was declared a nature reserve in 1967. A bush fire broke out on private land near the reserve on 12 October 2012 and a team of about 20 fire-fighters arrived to combat the blaze. Following a sudden change in wind direction a truck carrying two of the fire crew was engulfed in flames. The two DEC firefighters, both female, received terrible burns. One, 45 years old, received burns to 60% of her body and was admitted to hospital in critical condition; the other, 24 years old, had burns to 40% of her body and was also critical. Both were transferred from Albany via the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Perth. Three other fire crew were injured, a second truck was burnt out and over of bushland were burnt before the fire was contained later the same day. The older woman, Wendy Bearfoot, died in Royal Perth Hospital on 1 November as a result of her injuries. WorkSafe launched an investigation into the circumstances. In late 2015 a fire burnt through of the reserve destroying an estimated 90% of the Gilbert's potoroo habitat. Facilities Two Peoples Bay boasts unspoilt coastal scenery and is a vital area for threatened animal species. There are beaches with path access that are suitable for fishing, swimming and snorkelling. Facilities within the reserve include a visitors centre with information and audiovisual presentations, car parking on and off the beach near the barbecue area, a boat ramp, toilets, rubbish bins at the picnic area, gas barbecues, a water tap near the barbecue area and toilets, and seating. However, there is no drinking water available elsewhere and it is recommended that visitors need to take their own. There is an entry fee for the reserve. The biggest attraction in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve is Little Beach, which is popular with tourists, and consistently appears in TripAdvisor's top three attractions of the Albany area.\\"The 10 Best Things To Do in Albany\\" TripAdvisor.com.

Flora and fauna =Plants= Far western end of Two Peoples Bay proper The vegetation that is found in the park can be classified as follows: low forest is found north of Moates Lake, the wetland margins and close to the reserve offices. The trees reach 15 m in height and are dominated by Eucalyptus species including coast gum, jarrah and yate as well as other species such as marri and juniper myrtle. The understorey of the low forest includes species such as swamp banksia, pea-flowered narrow-leaved water bush and the porungurup wattle. Low woodlands in the broad valleys north of Moates Lake mainly consist of Albany blackbutt and the area between Moates Lake and Gardiner Lake is mostly populated with swamp banksia. Dieback has eradicated a population of the threatened granite banksia. =Animals= Two Peoples Bay is home to Australia's most threatened mammal and one of the rarest animals in the world, the Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii). This potoroo was thought to be extinct until the population at Two Peoples Bay was discovered in 1994. It is estimated that there are fewer than 40 individuals left in the wild. Other threatened mammals in the area include the southern brown bandicoot, western ringtail possum, Australian sea lion and the New Zealand fur seal. Quokkas are also known to inhabit the park and Two Peoples Bay is thought to be near the eastern limit of their range. Several reptiles can be found in the park including little brown snake, carpet python, beautiful skink and mournful skink. Birds The reserve forms part of the Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-11-18. It supports a population of noisy scrub-birds, a species that was thought to be extinct until rediscovered in 1961. The population then was estimated at less than 100, while in 1994 it was thought to be around 1100 (of which 450 occur in the reserve). Other threatened birds inhabiting the reserve are the western ground parrot, western bristlebird, western whipbird and Australasian bittern. Other threatened bird species that have been observed within the park include Carnaby's black cockatoo, peregrine falcon, hooded plover, little bittern and red-eared firetail. Seabirds nesting on the islands around the bay include the great- winged petrel and flesh-footed shearwater.  Geographic features  The total area enclosed by the nature reserve is .

In landscape mode it features a QWERTY keyboard and VCAST music on the Verizon Wireless network within Australia and the USA. The phone runs on Verizon Wireless's digital and Ev-DO networks. The Samsung Alias 2 was released on May 11, 2009 to the United States.  Features  The phone in call mode The phone in keyboard mode Its external features are a postage stamp sized front display, touch sensitive music control buttons and a 2.0-megapixel camera. On the right side there is the power button, a \\"hold\\" button, and a microSD card slot. On the left, there is a Voice Activation button, an up/down volume rocker button, a headphone jack, and proprietary charger/data transfer port. Opened in portrait mode, a standard numerical dialing pad along with two soft keys, send and end keys, a camera button, a voice command button, and four-directional buttons with an OK key in the center are all available. When in portrait, a user could input text using T9 (predictive text) or flip the phone horizontally for its full keyboard. The phone's 2.0 megapixel camera can take up to 1200 x 1600, and can record video at 176 x 144 at 15fps for the maximum of 10 minutes. The user could also use features in the camera like Night Shot, multi-shot, panorama, self-timer, and various filters. The smaller 128 x 128 1.3 inch display would also display what the camera would be showing when taking pictures of yourself. Opened horizontally, the full QWERTY keypad is usable and a simple button press allows switching between the various alphanumeric functions. Stereo speakers are mounted on either side of the 2.6-inch TFT display, with a resolution of 240 x 320 (QVGA). The battery is an 880 mAh which will give you 5 hours of talk time and 14 days stand-by. It had basic features, such as a tip calculator, alarm, calendar, voice memos, and a music player, which supported the MP3, WMA, ACC, and ACC+ formats, and could be controlled by the three touch sensitive buttons on the front of the display when the phone is closed. However, it lacked standard hardware that other manufactures were using at the time, such as micro USB and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also had a built-in e-mail client that was compatible with Yahoo!, Windows Live, AOL, Verizon.net, and POP. It also supported Mobile IM through AIM, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger. The u750 is compatible with all Verizon services, such as VCAST. It is also equipped with voice recognition, text message dictation, and two flash-based display themes, as well as the standard red Verizon Wireless themes. The phone was discontinued in October 2010. Series The Samsung Alias 2 was the successor of the original Samsung Alias, which did not feature the unique \\"magic\\" e-ink display. The keys were cramped up with all the functions of the e-ink display, which disappointed many users. After the Alias 2, the Samsung Zeal took over.

The number of people converted to Christianity as a result of his ministry was estimated by one biographer at 30,000.Tyler, Bennet and Andrew Bonar, \\"The Life and Labours of Asahel Nettleton\\" (Carlisle, Pennsylvania: The Banner of Truth Trust, reprint 1975) He participated in the New Lebanon Conference in 1827, during which he and Lyman Beecher opposed the teachings of Charles Grandison Finney.Thornbury, John F., \\"God Sent Revival\\" (Darlington: Evangelical Press 1993) Early years Nettleton was born 1783 into a farming family in Connecticut. During his early years, he occasionally experienced religious impressions. \\"One evening while standing alone in a field, he watched the sun go down. The approaching night reminded him that his own life would some day fade into the darkness of the world beyond. He suddenly realized that he, like all other people, would die.\\" These impressions were only temporary.Thornbury, God Sent Revival, 27. In the autumn of 1800 Nettleton came under powerful conviction of sin. This conviction deepened as he began to read the writings and sermons of Jonathan Edwards, but yet he remained unconverted.Tyler, Bennet and Andrew A. Bonar, Nettleton and His Labours (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark 1854), 20-27 It was in 1801 that a revival came to North Killingworth, and by December of that year, 32 new converts were added to the Church; by March 1802 \\"the congregation had been swelled by ninety-one professions.\\" Among them was Nettleton, who, becoming \\"exceedingly interested\\" in missions societies soon had \\"a strong desire to become a missionary to the heathen.\\"Tyler and Bonar, Nettleton and His Labours, 34-35. He attended Yale College from 1805 until his graduation in 1809 and was ordained to the ministry in 1811.Thornbury, God Sent Revival.  Career  Nettleton led many Congregationalist revivals in New England in the first decade of his ministry. Operating in contrast to many modern evangelists, he would often move into a community for several weeks or months and study the spiritual condition of the people before attempting any revival work. His preaching was said to be largely doctrinal but always practical. Nettleton often filled the pulpits of churches where there was no pastor present. This allowed him to engage in pastoral care for the people. This practice is typically absent in modern evangelists' ministries. He also refused to preach in any community where he had not been invited. He witnessed early in ministry the problems that can result from a pastor who feels as though he is competing with an evangelist. He also would sometimes refuse to preach in a church if he believed the request was not sincere. He rejected the idea that he was the cause of any revival and shunned those who looked to him rather than God to bring revival to their community.Thornbury, God Sent Revival, 78. During these early days of his career, in 1813, he is believed to have written the music for the gospel song eventually to be called \\"I'm a Soldier Bound for Glory\\" (music by Asahel Nettleton 1813, words by William R. Phillips 1922), a hymn in the Songbook of the Salvation Army.https://hymnary.org/hymnal/SBSA1953 https://library.timelesstruths.org/library/music/I/Im_a_Soldier_Bound_for_Glory/Im_a_Soldier_Bound_for_Glory.pdf Beginning in 1821, and frequently for the remainder of his life, health problems limited Nettleton's travels and ministry. During one of those periods he compiled and edited \\"Village Hymns for Social Worship,\\" a popular hymnal in New England for many decades.Tyler and Bonar, Nettleton and His Labours. In 1826, he became alarmed by the \\"new measures\\" being employed by many Presbyterian ministers in western New York state, especially by Charles Grandison Finney. Nettleton's theology was distinctly Reformed. He believed that salvation was a work of God alone and therefore rejected Finney's practice of giving altar calls during church services and revival meetings. The introduction of the altar call, Nettleton believed, exemplified a denial of the doctrines of original sin and total depravity.Thornbury, God Sent Revival. He became Finney's most vocal critic and was the driving force behind the New Lebanon Conference in July, 1827, in which he, Lyman Beecher, and other more conservative ministers attempted to persuade Finney and his allies to change their methods. The conference essentially ended in a stand off, and Finney's approach to evangelism became increasingly popular among Presbyterians and Congregationalists, to Nettleton's frustration.Hambrick- Stowe, Charles E., \\"Charles G. Finney and the Spirit of American Revivalism\\" (Wm. B. Eerdmans 1996) Legacy Nettleton mentored many young ministers, including James Brainerd Taylor (1801-1829), the Connecticut-born Second Great Awakening evangelist and primary founder of Princeton University's Philadelphian Society of Nassau Hall (1825-1930, spiritual parent of the Princeton Christian Fellowship).Rice, John Holt and Benjamin Holt Rice, Memoir of James Brainerd Taylor, Second Edition (New York: American Tract Society, 1833) Although the means and theology of Charles Grandison Finney were to have a greater impact on the history of American evangelism,Sweeney, Douglas A., The American Evangelical Story (Baker Academic 2005) Bennet Tyler wrote of the effects of revivals of which Nettleton was the instrument:Tyler and Bonar, Nettleton and His Labours, 331-333 *(1) Re-established Calvinism. Calvinism seen as thoroughly evangelical. *(2) Impact on society: revivals had a good name. *(3) “Fruits of these revivals were permanent. They were not temporary excitements. . .”; “there were but few apostasies.” Another historian has written of the effects of the Second Great Awakening as a whole (although not specifically of Nettleton): \\"Could Thomas Paine, the free-thinking pamphleteer of the American and French Revolutions, have visited Broadway in 1865, he would have been amazed to find that the nation conceived in rational liberty was 'in the grip of' the power of evangelical faith. The emancipating glory of the great awakenings had made Christian liberty, Christian equality and Christian fraternity the passion of the land. The treasured gospel…passed into the hands of the baptized many. Common grace, not common sense, was the keynote of the age… Religious doctrines which Paine, in his book The Age of Reason, had discarded as the “tattered vestment” of the past, became the wedding garment of many.\\" Timothy L.

A reusable spacecraft is a class of spacecraft that have been designed with repeated launch, orbit, deorbit and atmospheric reentry in mind. This contrasts with conventional spacecraft which are designed to be expended (thrown away, allowed to burn during reentry) after use. Examples of reusable spacecraft are spaceplanes (such as the Space Shuttle orbiters and the Dream Chaser) and space capsules like the SpaceX Dragon. Such spacecraft need mechanisms to prevent the disintegration of the spacecraft and its occupants/cargo during reentry. Failure of such systems may be catastrophic, as what happened in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.  Design  = Atmospheric entry = Reusable spacecraft include mechanisms to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere in a controlled fashion. For this purpose, the Space Shuttle included OMS pods, and the SpaceX Dragon included its own engines, used for deorbiting. Deorbiting slows the spacecraft down, causing it to descend. As a rough rule of thumb, 15% of the landed weight of an atmospheric reentry vehicle needs to be heat shielding. Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) can be made of a variety of materials, including reinforced carbon-carbon and ablative materials. Historically these materials were first developed on ICBM MIRVs. However, the requirements of reusable space systems differ from those of single use reentry vehicles, especially with regards to heat shield requirements. In particular the need for durable high emissivity coatings that can withstand multiple thermal cycles constitutes a key requirement in the development of new reusable spacecraft. Current materials for such high emissivity coatings include transition metal disilicides.High emissivity coatings on fibrous ceramics for reusable space systems Corrosion Science 2019 Ablative heat shields are reliable, but they can only be used once, and are heavy. Reinforced carbon-carbon heat tiles like those used on the Space Shuttle are fragile, and this was proved on the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Making a resistant yet lightweight and effective heat tile poses a challenge. The LI-900 material was used on the Space Shuttle. =Landing and refurbishment= Spacecraft that land horizontally on a runway require wings and undercarriage. These typically consume about 9-12% of the spacecraft mass, which either reduces the payload or increases the size of the spacecraft. Concepts such as lifting bodies offer some reduction in wing mass, as does the delta wing shape of the Space Shuttle orbiter. Vertical landings can be accomplished either with parachutes or propulsively. spaceX Dragon was an example of space capsule with parachute reusability. Its derivative, Dragon 2, was originally intended to propusively land on land. However, such concept of reusability was canceled on 2017 and now use parachutes to land on sea. After the spacecraft lands, it may need to be refurbished to prepare it for its next flight. This process may be lengthy and expensive, taking up to a year. And the spacecraft may not be able to be recertified as human-rated after refurbishment. There may also be a limit on how many times a spacecraft can be refurbished before it has to be retired.

In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed foreign minister in December 1994, replacing Prasong Soonsiri.Asia Times, Grumbles, revelations of a Thai coup maker, 22 December 2006 The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of Chuan Leekpai to collapse. PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister in the Banharn government Chamlong, strongly criticized for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time in July 1995, winning a parliamentary seat from Bangkok. However, the weakened and internally divided PDP won only 23 seats, compared to 46 in the 1992 elections. Thaksin joined the government of Banharn Silpa-acha and was appointed deputy prime minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, Thaksin and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn cabinet (while retaining their MP seats) to protest widespread allegations of corruption, prompting a cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest. Chamlong lost the election. He and incumbent governor, former PDP- member Krisda Arunwongse na Ayudhya, were defeated by Pichit Rattakul, an independent. Chamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified internal divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's \\"temple\\" faction and Thaksin's faction. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics. Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government. Soon afterwards, Banharn dissolved parliament in September 1996. Fall of the PDP Thaksin announced that he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections, but would remain as leader of the PDP. He claimed that he wanted to devote his energies to campaigning for political reform and supporting other PDP candidates. Some speculated that Thaksin wanted to resign from the party leadership. The PDP suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only 1 seat in parliament. The PDP soon imploded, with most members resigning. However, the PDP is still in existence, with a different leadership and an insignificant presence in the political sphere. Although there was much controversy about the root causes of the fall of the PDP, most agree that it was due to internal divisions in the party. Particularly divisive were conflicts between the Chamlong \\"temple\\" faction and subsequent generations of outsiders, including Thaksin. Deputy Prime Minister in the Chavalit government On 15 August 1997, Thaksin was invited to become Deputy Prime Minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government. This occurred soon after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the Asian Financial Crisis. Thaksin held this position for only 3 months, leaving on November 14 after Chavalit resigned. During an unsuccessful censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of profiting on insider information about the government's decision to float the baht. However, this accusation was not investigated during the subsequent Democrat or TRT governments.Pasuk Phongpaichit & Chris Baker, Thaksin: The Business of Politics in Thailand (Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books, 2004), pp. 57-59. During 1997, Thaksin's flagship company, AIS, suffered 1.8 billion baht in foreign exchange losses and saw its debt more than double due to the devaluation. However, critics have alleged that Thaksin's businesses suffered much less from the devaluation than rival companies.Pasuk & Baker (2004), p. 58. Formation of the Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections Thaksin founded the Thai Rak Thai (TRT) (\\"Thais Love Thais\\") party in 1998 along with Somkid Jatusripitak, PDP ally Sudarat Keyuraphan, Purachai Piumsombun,MSU Today and 19 others. With a populist platform often attributed to Somkid, TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and one million baht locally managed development funds for all Thai villages. After Prime Minister Chuan dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the January 2001 elections, the first election held under the People's Constitution of 1997. It was called the most open, corruption- free election in Thai history.Robert B. Albritton and Thawilwadee Bureekul, Developing Democracy under a New Constitution in Thailand , National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica Asian Barometer Project Office Working Paper Series No. 28, 2004 Thai Rak Thai won 248 parliamentary seats (more than any other party previously) and needed only 3 more seats to form a government.

Description  Rhaponticum species are perennial herbaceous plants with simple, rarely branched stems. The leaves are simple to pinnatifid. The inflorescence is on the apex of the stem. The fruit is an achene with a hairy pappus.Rhaponticum. Flora of China.  Medicinal use  The Maral root is used in folk medicine: * to increase physical and mental stress. * to strengthen the efficiency of body. * to restore vigor. * to reduce feelings of fatigue, irritability. * to increase libido and potency (due to the high content of ekdistena). Maral root can be used for athletes preparing for a competition, because: * it increases the amplitude of the pulsation of the heart. * it expands peripheral blood vessels and increases blood flow velocity. * it displaces the lactic acid from the muscle. * it improves endurance exercise capacity, reduces the feeling of fatigue.

The theory, proposed and named by New Enterprise Associates partner and former Sun Microsystems CTO Greg Papadopoulos, categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems. Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting) According to the Redshift theory, applications \\"redshift\\" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&fr;_story=FEEDROOM178646&hl;=false In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600 According to Dell Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring hyperscale computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&l;=en&s;=corp While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes: = ΣBW (Sum-of-Bandwidth) = These are companies that drive heavy Internet traffic. This includes popular web-portals like Google, Yahoo, AOL and MSN. It also includes telecoms, multimedia, television over IP, online games like World of Warcraft and others. This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high- bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a DSL or cable modem. A simple way to understand this market is that for every byte of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network. = High performance computing (HPC) = These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations. This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every \\"available\\" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage. = *prise (or \\"Star-prise\\") = These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS). For example, companies that deploy CRM are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as Salesforce.com, grow faster than Moore's Law. = The eBay crisis = A prime example of redshift was a crisis at eBay. In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single Oracle Database running on the fastest Sun machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth. The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It! (Bob Warfield, SmoothSpan Blog, 2007-08-30)Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. \\"The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost.\\" SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006. Traditional computing markets (blueshifting) Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving enterprise resource planning or customer relationship management applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations. Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow gross domestic product growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time. Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems. Consequences and industry commentary Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur. When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time. If computing is to be delivered as a utility, Nicholas Carr suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with Microsoft researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in shipping containers.Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets. According to International Data Corporation vice president Matthew Eastwood, \\"IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507 History and nomenclature Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz in late 2006.Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&fr;_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&rf;=bm Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit in February 2007. The term Redshift refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer. Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe. Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563 Notes External links * Greg Papadopoulos: Original Redshift presentation video * Official Greg Papadopoulos biography * InformationWeek feature story on Redshift * Nicholas Carr, \\"The future of computing demand\\" * Nicholas Carr, \\"Showdown in the trailer park II\\" * Microsoft's Jim Hamilton: paper and presentation * ZDnet Blog on Redshift Category:Adages Category:Rules of thumb Category:Computer industry Category:Digital media Category:Futures studies Category:Technology strategy Category:Computing culture ","title":"Redshift (theory)"},{"id":"10721286","text":"The Odebrecht Foundation (Portuguese Fundação Odebrecht) is a private Brazilian institution created in 1965.

Background Gregori, often called The Dark One, knows he’s very close to turning. He has always known that a child of Mikhail will be his lifemate, so when Raven, Mikhail's lifemate, is attacked, he gives her his blood to build a bond between them. Raven is attacked again while she carries the baby, and Gregori gives blood to the fetus, even communicates with it, further sealing the bond between him and the child. When Savannah comes of age, she refuses to mate with Gregori out of fear. Knowing he will dominate her life once he takes her, he gives her five years of freedom before he claims her. So Savannah goes to America and becomes an illusionist. But this promise costs him dearly. In case he turns vampire, he appeals to Aidan not to hunt him alone, but to get his brother Julian to join him. After Gregori said this he told Aidan that he would “go to ground” (When a Carpathian shuts down heart and lungs in order to sleep in soil). Plot The five-year period has passed; Gregori has come to San Francisco, where Savannah has ended her tour to claim her. The bombardment of new emotions prevents him from detecting the presence of a vampire. Before he can stop it, the vampire kills Savannah’s friend Peter and attempts to claim her for himself. Gregori is forced to kill him in front of her. Savannah still refuses to bond with him; however Gregori informs her that there is no choice for either of them. Knowing that she’s in shock and grief because of her friend, he takes her to his property to heal, intending to complete the mating ritual the next day. However, their closeness is too powerful to ignore and they begin to mate. Unfortunately, Gregori has waited to long and loses control and nearly kills Savannah. It is only her acceptance of him that pulls him back from the abyss. Now Savannah and Gregori must learn how to live with and love one another while staying one step ahead of the vampires and the human vampire hunting society who have targeted them.

Built during the years of 1935 to 1938, it was built exclusively for low income blacks in Indianapolis. The complex was closed in 1976, and a number of structures were demolished in the early 1980s. Today, the only original structures remaining are those along Blake Street. History Central mall looking northwest, lined with apartments Due to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Public Works Administration started funding fifty low-cost public housing projects in twenty states from what were previously slum areas. Indianapolis was chosen to have one of these renovations; it would be the first major public housing within Indiana's capital city. This land originally had 363 residences, of which only one was seen as \\"habitable\\". Another goal of the project was to provide temporary construction jobs in the area, 9,000 in total. This was done despite the wishes of Indiana congressmen, as they feared that private enterprises would be hurt by federal projects such as this.Bodenhamer, David. The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis (Indiana University Press, 1994) pg. 926-927. Site plan, prior to partial demolition in 1983. Three million dollars was spent on the Lockefield Gardens project, which opened in February 1938. Twenty-two acres along Indiana Avenue were chosen to become 748 separate housing units, under the direction of the Russ and Harrison architecture firm, built by N. P. Severin Company of Chicago, based on European prototypes. The twenty-four buildings which made up the complex ranged from two to four stories. \\"Corner\\", \\"strip\\", and \\"tee\\" models used by the Public Works Administration in other projects were used here. Among the amenities of this housing were a central mall, four playgrounds (with thirteen smaller play areas), a school (William D. McCoy Public School #24), and a small shopping arcade. It featured plenty of ventilation, abundant natural sunlight, and pleasant views of the area. Rents ranged from $20.80 to $30.10 a month. Lionel Artis was chosen as the original apartment housing manager, a position he held until his retirement in 1969, a span of over thirty years. After construction, it was considered one of the best of the New Deal housing projects. The spacious, wide-open areas of Lockefield Gardens were an oddity; other New Deal housing projects were cramped.Bodenhamer, p. 927.Lockefield Gardens Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs When it originally opened, Lockefield Gardens was racially segregated, but it allowed blacks something they rarely had: a community-oriented residence. Lockefield Gardens became the nucleus of black community located immediately northwest of downtown Indianapolis. In the 1950s, as racial equality improved, blacks began moving to what were residential areas mostly inhabited by whites. Due to income restrictions and more prosperous blacks leaving for the white residences, Lockefield Gardens began its decline. A redevelopment plan in the 1970s was hoped to revitalize the district, but federal judge S. Hugh Dillin thought it would lead to continued segregation of an educational and residential level. As a result, the apartments closed in 1976. In 1980 it was decided that, in addition to an immediate need to house athletes from the Pan Am Games being hosted in Indianapolis, part of the Lockefield Gardens area would be used for the expansion of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), a campus of both the Indiana University and Purdue University systems. In 1983, after demolitions, only units along Blake Street and Locke Street (now University Boulevard), out of the original twenty-four buildings, remained, despite protests by Indianapolis preservationists. Even still, the remaining structures were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Eleven new buildings were made, and the original buildings were renovated. The new total housing units of the complex was 493, with 199 of this total being within the original structures. Today The area now serves as an apartment complex on the IUPUI university campus, although urban professionals are invited to live there as well.:: Properties > Indiana > Indianapolis > Lockefield Gardens References External links * Historical American Buildings Survey photographs and data *Indianapolis, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Category:African-American history of Indianapolis Category:Apartment buildings in Indiana Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Residential buildings completed in 1938 Category:Neighborhoods in Indianapolis Category:Public housing in Indianapolis Category:National Register of Historic Places in Indianapolis ","title":"Lockefield Gardens"},{"id":"10721495","text":"Publius Furius Sp. f. M. n. Philus was a consul in 223 BC, a praetor in 216, and a censor in 214. He died the following year, before resigning his office. Family and background Furius was a member of the patrician gens Furia, an ancient and noble house at Rome. Many members of his gens had previously held the highest offices of the state, most famously Marcus Furius Camillus. However, the branch or stirps of the family known as the Furii Phili had not previously held any curule magistracies. From his filiation, we know that Publius' father was named Spurius and his grandfather Marcus, but nothing is known of them. Publius had a son, likewise named Publius, who was a young man at the time of his father's death. It is not known how they were related to the later Furii Phili.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Consulship Furius was a consul with Gaius Flaminius in 223 BC, the third year of the Gallic War. Both consuls marched to Northern Italy. However, no sooner had they set out, than the aristocratic party at Rome devised a means for depriving Flaminius, who had earned their ire by passing an agrarian law as tribune of the plebs in 232, of his office. The aristocrats declared that the consular election was not valid on account of some fault in the auspices; and a letter was forthwith sent to the camp of the consuls, with orders to return to Rome. But, as all preparations had been made for a great battle against the Insubres on the Addua, the letter was left unopened until the battle was gained. Furius obeyed the command of the Senate, and laid down his office. His colleague continued the campaign and celebrated a triumph over the Gauls before laying down his command.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Praetorship Furius was elected praetor urbanus in the third year of the Second Punic War, BC 216; and after the fatal Battle of Cannae in this year, he and his colleague Manius Pomponius Matho summoned the senate to take measures for the defense of the city. Shortly afterwards he received the fleet from Marcus Claudius Marcellus, with which he proceeded to Africa, but having been severely wounded in an engagement off the coast he returned to Lilybaeum.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxii. 35, 57, xxiii. 21.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Censorship In 214 BC, Furius was a censor with Marcus Atilius Regulus, but he died at the beginning of the following year, before the solemn purification (lustrum) of the people had been performed; and Regulus accordingly, as was usual in such cases, resigned his office. These censors visited with severity all persons who had failed in their duty to their country during the great calamities that Rome had lately experienced. They reduced to the condition of aerarians all the young nobles who had planned to leave Italy after the battle of Cannae, among whom was Lucius Caecilius Metellus, who was a quaestor in the year of their censorship. As, however, Metellus was elected tribune of the plebs for the following year notwithstanding his degradation, he attempted to bring the censors to trial before the people, immediately after entering upon his office, but was prevented by the other tribunes from prosecuting such an unprecedented course. Furius was also one of the augurs at the time of his death.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, xxiv. 11, 18, 43, xxv. 2.Valerius Maximus, Factorum ac Dictorum Memorabilium libri IX, ii. 9. § 8.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.

Juan Pascual Pringles. Juan Pascual Pringles (May 17, 1795 – March 10, 1831) was a distinguished military leader in the Spanish American wars of independence, with the rank of colonel, and later a leader of the Argentine Unitarian Party. Pringles was born in San Luis, Argentina on May 17, 1795. From 1811 until 1814 he worked in Mendoza before joining a militia in 1815. In 1820 he joined the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and departed for Peru as part of an expeditionary force of liberators and on arrival fought in many major battles, including the Battle of Junín and the Battle of Ayacucho. In 1829 he returned to Buenos Aires, and was soon drawn into the civil wars between the Unitarian Party and the Federalists. He died in battle at Chañaral de las Ánimas against Facundo Quiroga's forces on March 10, 1831. Rather than surrender his sword to Quiroga's subordinate and not to the general in person, he broke it in half before being shot and killed. Quiroga later reprimanded the soldier who took Pringles' life without consulting him. Pringles in modern Argentina Today, the main square of the provincial capital of San Luis bears the name Plaza Pringles in his honor, and also features an equestrian statue of him. A small square in the centre of Rosario is also called Plaza Pringles.

This photograph is by Ansel Adams. A farmworker is a hired agricultural labourer. In labor law, the term \\"farmworker\\" is sometimes used more narrowly, applying only to a hired worker involved in agricultural production, including harvesting, but not to a worker in other on-farm jobs, such as picking fruit. In the United States =Farm structure= The development of a particular kind of agriculture is dependent on the characteristics of the farming region. The soil type, climate, slope, and distance to markets all help in shaping the type of agriculture that thrives in any particular region. For instance, the Midwestern United States has rich, fertile soil, and so it produces corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs, and dairy products and has become known as the Corn Belt of America.USDA Agricultural Fact Book ’98: Chapter 2, In contrast, agriculture in California’s Mediterranean and moderate climate produces more than half of the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts, which require hand-harvesting and a large labor force.A Look at California Agriculture. http://www.agclassroom.org/kids/stats/california.pdf Over the last century the amount of farmland in production has remained relatively steady, but the number of operating farms has continually dropped, signifying a consolidation of farm enterprises. Around the 1930s hard economic times hit the country with the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era, forcing some farmers off the land. From 1950 to 2001 the amount of U.S. farm land used for major commodity crop production has remained about the same while over half of the farms are gone. A farm's reliance on farmworkers greatly depends on the quantity and the type of crop in production. Some crops require more labor than others, and in California, many labor-intensive crops are produced such as dairy products, fruits, tree nuts and vegetables. Although the domestic farm labor force has decreased in the last century, the proportion of hired workers has grown. Increased competition among agricultural producers and consolidation have created a need for a large, inexpensive, and temporary workforce that increasingly comes from abroad. =Demographics= Mexican American worker circa 1939 According to the National Center for Farmworker Health in 2012, there were an estimated 3 million migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the United States. Migrant farmworkers are considered to be temporary workers who move to an area for work, cultivating a crop during the harvest season. Seasonal farm workers, however, live in an area from year to year. The states with the highest percentage of both migrant and seasonal farm workers include; California, Florida, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. The Agricultural Resource Management Survey conducted by the USDA found that one third of the farm worker population is between the ages of 35–54 years old with an average age of 33. The Department of Labor and Statistics discovered that the median pay is averaged to be $23,730 a year and $11.42 per hour in 2017 for farmworkers. Only 49.2% of all farm laborers are United States citizens, and nearly 3/4 farm workers are foreign born, with nearly 70% have been born in Mexico. Since 1991 to 2001, the general trend is an overall increase in the number of foreign born, unauthorized farm workers. The U.S. Department of Labor has reported in the National Agricultural Workers Survey that the number of foreign born, unauthorized farm workers has plateaued and kept steady over the past decade around 50%. Substantial demographic change among farmworkers has occurred since the mid-20th Century. In 1954, there were 2.73 million hired agricultural workers in the US The 61 percent reduction in farmworker numbers between then and 2012 occurred despite an agricultural output increase of about 140 percent, serving a population that increased by 93 percent over that period. Whereas 74.7 percent of hired farmworkers were seasonal in 1954, 74 percent were year-round employees in 2012.United States Department of Agriculture. Farm Labor. http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm- labor/background.aspx =Wages= According to the US Department of Agriculture, the average wage rate for US [hired] agricultural field and livestock workers in 2014 was $11.29 per hour. This figure does not include the average value of perquisites, such as cash bonuses, housing or meals that are provided to some agricultural workers.United States Department of Agriculture. Farm Labor. (Released 20 November 2014). http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/FarmLabo/FarmLabo-11-20-2014.pdf The average exceeded the median. For 2014, the median hourly wages of $9.17 for \\"Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery, and Greenhouse\\" and $11.02 for \\"Farmworkers, Farm, Ranch, and Aquacultural Animals\\" can be compared with the median for all US occupations of $17.09, and with the federally mandated minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 2014, of US private sector workers paid hourly wages, the fraction paid less than minimum wage was 1.3 percent of workers in \\"agriculture and related industries\\", versus 2.5 percent of those in \\"nonagricultural industries\\".US Dept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Characteristics of minimum wage workers, 2014. http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/characteristics-of-minimum-wage- workers-2014.pdf In 2014, for US \\"Farmworkers and Laborers, Crop, Nursery and Greenhouse\\", the median annual wage was $19,060. The 10th and 90th percentiles were $17,280 and $27,890, respectively. For \\"Farmworkers, Farm, Ranch and Aquacultural Animals\\" the median annual wage was $22,930. The 10th and 90th percentiles were $17,080 and $37,360, respectively. These figures can be compared with some of the poverty thresholds for 2014 published by the US Census Bureau: single person under 65: $12,316; two people (householder under 65): $15,835; same, but with one child under 18: $16,317. =Working conditions and workplace issues= For most agricultural workers, much work is outdoors and may involve extremes of weather. Crop harvesting may require bending and crouching. Because machinery and animals can cause injury, workers must take precautions and be alert. Although crop workers may risk exposure to pesticides, exposure can be minimal if appropriate safety precautions are followed. Heat stress is a serious concern. Heat-related illness is often mistakenly characterized by death only, however heat-related illness very much resembles an exposure-response curve, where severity worsens as exposure increases and persists. As a typical exposure-response relationship suggests, conditions become more debilitating with prolonged heat exposure. Ultimately, heat-related illness encompasses a variety of symptoms and conditions. The first, most mild stage is heat cramps, and as heat stress persists severity increases to heat syncope, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, then heat stroke. Unfortunately, sufficient data is not available on the intermediate phases with respect to farmworkers. This is because the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Survey on Occupational Injuries and Illnesses collects OSHA reportable cases only when they result in one or more days lost in work, and agricultural workers have some of the lowest report rates. This is assumed because most workers do not report any cases less severe than heat exhaustion and typically treat themselves in the event of any degree of heat-related illness. According to the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, between 2003 and 2008, Agriculture accounted for 20% of heat-related deaths. A common statistic used in expressing the rate at which heat-related death occurs among farmworkers is 0.39 deaths per 100,000 full-time employees in 2008. This fatality rate is astronomical compared to the rate of 0.02 per 100,000 full-time employees in all other industries. The Centers for Disease Control has recommended: \\"Agricultural employers should develop and implement heat stress management measures that include 1) training for field supervisors and employees to prevent, recognize, and treat heat illness, 2) implementing a heat acclimatization program...3) encouraging proper hydration with proper amounts and types of fluids, 4) establishing work/rest schedules appropriate for the current heat indices, 5) ensuring access to shade or cooling areas, 6) monitoring the environment and workers during hot conditions by assessing heat stress conditions and individual heat strain status using Large-face thermometers, military style flag systems that indicate current conditions, tools to measure heart rate and assess hydration sufficiency, also providing workers training to avoid heat-illness and recognize the symptoms in themselves and other coworkers, and 7) providing prompt medical attention to workers who show signs of heat illness...\\"Centers for Disease Control. Heat- related deaths among crop workers – United States 1992-2006. MMWR 20 June 2008 / 57(24);649-653. Potential health and safety issues that may be associated with farm work also include vehicle rollovers, falls, musculoskeletal injuries, hazardous equipment, grain bins, pesticides, unsanitary conditions, and respiratory disease among others. In 1998-99, 468 individuals employed in agriculture were identified with acute occupational pesticide-related illness in six states participating in the SENSOR program (AZ, CA, FL, NY, OR, TX), which include states where large numbers of crop farmworkers are employed. This compared with 441 individuals employed in non-agricultural occupations who were identified with acute occupational pesticide-related illness in those states.Calvert, G.M.et al. 2004. Acute occupational pesticide-related illness in the U.S. 1998-1999. Surveillance findings from the SENSOR-Pesticides Program. Am. J. Industrial Med. 45: 14-23. The US Environmental Protection Agency's Worker Safety Program provides educational materials facilitating implementation of the Agricultural Worker Protection Standard established under federal regulation. In 2009-2010, NAWS (the National Agricultural Workers Survey, conducted under the US Bureau of Labor Statistics) found that 84 percent of workers received training in safe use of pesticides within the past 12 months from their current employers.National Agricultural Workers Survey. https://naws.jbsinternational.com/ NAWS found that \\"Almost all farm workers reported that their current farm employer made drinking water, toilets and washing water available on a daily basis. Of the small percentage of farm workers who reported not using the employer-provided toilets on a daily basis (3% in 1999-2000), three-fourths indicated that the bathroom was 'too far away' to use.\\" The survey asked: If you are injured at work or get sick as a result of your work, does your employer provide health insurance or pay for your health care? In 2009-2010, 74 percent of survey farmworkers answered yes, 15 percent did not know. In 2007-2008, 60 percent of farmworkers considered it \\"easy\\" to get access to US health care. In 1999-2000, roughly 2 per hundred farmworkers 18 and older reported having been a victim of violence (e.g. pushed, slapped, hit, etc.) within the past year, whereas violent crime victimizations were 2.61 per hundred of the US population in 2012. In 1999-2000, roughly 0.14 percent of farmworkers 18 and older reported having been a victim of workplace violence within the past year, whereas the rate of workplace violence was 0.5 percent for all US employed persons over the age of 16 in 2005-2009. Sexual harassment and sexual exploitation of female farmworkers have been reported and are an important concern.Tamayo, W. R. 2000. Forging our identity: transformative resistance in the areas of work, class and the law: The role of the EEOC in protecting the civil rights of farm workers. 33. U. C. Davis Law Review 1075 However, there is a dearth of statistics to indicate the extent of these abuses, and undocumented foreign workers may be especially reluctant to report them.Oxfam America. Working in fear: sexual violence against women farmworkers. http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Sexual_violence_against_women_farmworkers_full_doc.pdf This brings up the issues of a rise in farm workers being abused on farms. From 2003 to 2018, workers filed 1,106 sexual harassment complaints with the commission against agricultural-related industries. The allegations range from verbal harassment to rape. Because many farm workers are immigrants and some are illegal, their abusers are able to get away with abuse using the threat of deportation or firing. In 2018, as a 2013 investigation concluded, a federal jury awarded $17.4 million to five migrant women who said they were raped and sexually harassed by three male supervisors at the Florida packing plant where they worked. This win opened the door for many other women to believe they also have a chance to stand up to their abusers in court and win. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace and is the only federal agency that pursues on-the-job sexual violence and harassment cases. While it is the job of the EEOC to enforce civil rights for these farmworkers, a big issue with the process is getting the workers to come forward and for there to be enough evidence of the assault. In July 2018 Bornt & Sons, Inc. and its former farm labor contractor Barraza Farm Service, LLC / Barraza Farm Service, Inc. paid $300,000 and furnished other relief to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Commission. Sexual assault is continually persistent in the world of agriculture. There have been some cases of human slavery and human trafficking among farmworkers.Beardsley, S. Brothers receive 12-year prison terms in Immokalee human slavery case. Naples Daily News. 19 December 2008. http://www.naplesnews.com/news/local-news/immokalee-brothers- get-prison-sentence-aliens-caseGillespie, P. (18 January 2008). \\"Sixth Immokalee slavery case suspect arrested Group accused of keeping beating, stealing from Immokalee laborers\\". Fort Myers News Press. Retrieved 17 May 2013. However, some Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims regarding human trafficking of farmworkers, the subject of widely publicized court cases, were dismissed or rejected by federal courts. Workers rights cards, in English and Spanish, are produced by the US Department of Labor. The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act establishes standards regarding wages, housing, transportation, disclosures and record-keeping. Among other provisions, the act prohibits retaliatory intimidation or discrimination against a migratory or seasonal worker who, with just cause, has filed a complaint or testifies or asserts a right relating to provisions of the Act. In order to operate legally, farm labor contractors must register with the Department of Labor. The H-2A program under US Citizenship and Immigration Services allows US employers or agents meeting various requirements to bring in foreign nationals for temporary or seasonal agricultural work. The petitioner must demonstrate that there are not sufficient qualified, able, willing and available US workers for the jobs. Employment of H-2A workers must not adversely affect wages of US workers doing similar jobs. Despite laws and regulations for protection of farmworkers, concerns persist regarding violations, and regarding the economic status and welfare of many farmworkers.Bon Appetit Management Company Foundation and United Farmworkers. 2011. Inventory of farmworker issues and protections in the United States. =Organizing= Compared to other workers, organization attempts on the behalf of farm-workers face a double challenge. First, labor laws that apply are not always enforced for agricultural workers. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, for example, which protects most workers who organize and form trade unions from employer retaliation (e.g., the firing of workers for trying to join a union) and sets up a framework for unions and employers to negotiate in good faith, does not extend to farm workers Similarly, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which sets minimum wage and overtime pay requirements does not apply to farm labor. In 1966, the minimum wage requirement, but not the overtime pay, was extended to apply to farm workers who worked on farms where there was over approximately 7 full-time employees in a quarter. Some states such as California, have passed laws guaranteeing the right to organize, but these apply only to the particular state in which the law was passed. A second important challenge faced by farm worker organizers is the vulnerability of the workers due to their immigration status. The non-immigrant status of guest workers, as well as the lack of documentation of many other workers, places them in a politically weak position to address worker injustices.Oxfam America. 2004. Like Machines in the Fields: Workers Without Rights in American Agriculture. Research Paper. Despite these challenges, there has been an important history of farm worker organizing in the United-States, and farm labor organizing continues to this day both to ensure the enforcement of existing regulation and to create new regulations. Some of the causes that these organizations fight for include: * Free negotiation * Recognizing workers' rights such as health, wages, and safety * Fair treatment of undocumented workers * Fair wages *Fair trade of product * Alliances with other organizations and student support * Good relationship of farmer with buyer * Protection of children * Safe housing for workers * Bias-free policing * Inclusion in the healthcare system * Unionization, in some cases * Education of the community about immigrant workers, Some of the main organizations associated with the farm workers movement are the United Farm Workers, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, the Agricultural Justice Project and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Many of the issues around which farm workers organize relating to occupational health and safety and labor rights, such as immigration rights and pesticide use on farms, are also socially important issues that affect overall society. The first approach of organization targets regulation changes by pressuring the government through worker solidarity movements. The UFW, for example, often runs campaigns targeting policy by encouraging citizens to communicate with their government representatives on a variety of issues. As a recent example, on the heels of the death of a young farm worker, the UFW has been encouraging supporters to contact California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, to improve the enforcement of existing regulations regarding working in the heat. Despite having the strictest heat laws in the country, heat deaths continue to occur and are largely attributed to a lack of workplace inspectors which results in a low level of compliance. A second strategy involves targeting high-profile businesses that are supplied through contractors and subcontractors hiring farm workers. Recently, the Coalition for Immokalee Workers, for example, has applied pressure to several companies through consumer boycotts, including McDonald's and Taco Bell. The result of these campaigns were that these companies agreed to pay an extra penny per pound to the farmworkers who picked for them, regardless of the fact that they were employed through subcontractors. The Fair World Project, launched by the Organic Consumers Association in 2010, is an organization that promotes fair trade practices as well as the labeling of certified products. It also works to educate consumers and the community about fair trade. = Farmworker Movement in the 21st Century = The Farmworkers Movement has continued into the 21st century, and has included an emphasis on environmental issues. While there is intersection between both the labor rights and environmental justice efforts within the larger farmworker movement, there have been splits and differences between the two areas. Some critics of the environmental groups which work on similar issues to farmworkers organizations have claimed that they focus on \\"natural wildlife\\" rather than on the farmworkers themselves who are exposed the chemicals which are harming the environment.  Labor  United States Senator Kamala Harris speaks about the Fairness for Farm Workers Act in 2018. Organizing efforts within the farmworker community have continued to focus on labor rights and other labor related issues. Organizations such as the United Farm Workers have a history of working to protect the rights of farmworkers; some of the campaigns and causes these organizations work on include heat exposure, wage rights, and overtime inclusion. Farmworker organizations have been able to achieve legislative success in reaching their goals for greater rights for farmworkers. In 2005, following the deaths of four California farm workers due to extreme summer heat, the United Farm Workers was instrumental in getting former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to propose emergency heat stress regulations to prevent possible additional heat-related deaths of outdoor employees and agricultural workers. The proposed regulations required water and shade to be present and available for laborers working outside who felt negatively affected by the heat. Other legislative impacts and victories for farmworkers include the signing of an overtime law by California governor Jerry Brown in 2016 which extended overtime pay to farm workers who worked past 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. The new rules will be phased-in over the course of four years, beginning in 2019. There has long been a precedent for the exclusion of agricultural workers from other labor right provisions, including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which had previously created minimum wage and overtime standards for American workers but had excluded all agricultural workers. In California in 1976, the state Industrial Welfare Commission had extended overtime pay to farmworkers but only after 10 hours on a job in a single day or past 60 hours in a week. = Environmental Justice = Since becoming popular in the 1980s, environmental justice issues have increasingly become important in the farmworker movement. Issues typically include the use of and exposure to pesticides, food sustainability, and climate change.  Pesticides  The use of pesticides for crop protection in the agriculture industry became increasingly widespread in the 20th century, and growers (employers of farmworkers) have heavily relied on their use post-World War Two. Over 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used in the United States each year. Exposure to pesticides has been linked to negative health effects, and many farmworkers, both individuals and groups, have spoken out against their use in recent decades. As growers consistently believed that pesticides were the best method to control pests, many growers' associations worked against regulation on the use of pesticides in the 1970s. Due to the rise of globalization, employers have been pressured to lobby for less regulations against pesticides in recent years to cope with increased competition, while farmworkers have been pressured to stay silent on workplace conditions and to remain unorganized. Several groups of farmworkers and organizations, which represent farmworkers across the United States, have consistently spoken out against the pesticides due to their claims of negative effects on the workers who are exposed to the chemicals. Such groups include Farmworker Justice, El Comité de Apoyo a Los Trabajadores Agrícolas (CATA), and the Farmworker Advocacy Network. While other strictly environmental justice groups have achieved success in reaching their goals by lobbying for regulations and public protests, farmworkers have struggled to advance via similar methods on the issue of workplace pesticide exposure. Groups which focus on pesticides today have opted to use a variety of methods in trying to help those affected by the use of harmful chemicals. Some organizations such as CATA have used pesticide safety training, including tips on clothing to wear. Other groups, such as Farmworker Justice, have called for increased protections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the requirement of reporting pesticide use on a national level, in addition to calling for extensive research on the long-term effects of pesticide use and pesticide exposure on agricultural workers. The federal government has also been involved in regulating the use of and monitoring the effects of pesticides. Since its creation in 1970, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been involved in working to regulate the use of pesticides and any potential harmful effects. The EPA's Agriculture Worker Protection Standard (WPS) attempts to help workers exposed to pesticides and aims to reduce the risk involved with exposure to pesticides. The WPS gives protections to over 2 million agricultural workers and pesticide handlers; its services include preventing workers from being in areas under a restricted- entry interval (REI), with a few exceptions. On 2 November 2015, the EPA revised the WPS in order to enact stronger protections for the same workers and handlers it had covered previously. The majority of the revised protections of the WPS took effect on 2 January 2017, however three requirements will take effect on 2 January 2018; these requirements are aimed at increasing pesticide safety training and revised information posters on pesticide safety, in addition to compelling handlers to suspend applications if any workers are in an \\"application exclusion zone.\\" Recently, The Dow Chemical Company, a U.S.-based multinational chemical company, has been accused of attempting to persuade the Trump administration to ignore the findings of federal scientists that found that the chemicals chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion are harmful to nearly 1,800 \\"critically threatened or endangered species.\\" The chemicals are heavily used and sold by the Dow Company, and the company has hired its own scientists to create a rebuttal to the findings of the governmental studies.  Food justice  There are other specific groups that are influential in their organization attempts. For example, the Food Chain Workers Alliance is a coalition of agricultural production organizations founded in 2009 with the goal of creating a sustainable food system and advocating workers' rights while keeping the cost of food down. Campaigns include Dignity at Darden, Making Change at Walmart, and Campaign for Fair Food. The program also fights for raising the tipped minimum wage, and the Fair Food Agreement with the Coalition of Imomokalee Workers. Another such group is the \\"Agricultural Justice Project\\" (AJP). This project seeks to promote food justice by creating a food label that signifies the certification of fair treatment of the workers who helped produce the food as well as fair contracts and pricing for farmers. The label also certifies sustainable and fair trade of the food at every step of production. Four nonprofit organizations are partners in the AJP: The Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI-USA), The Farmworker Support Committee (CATA), Florida Organic Growers (FOG), and the Northeastern Organic Farming Association (NOFA). Each group has the common goal of improving the quality of life for sustainable farmers.  Impacts of climate change  Heat illness risk among agricultural workers already occur among hotter climates and will increase with climate change. An analysis of heat stroke deaths among agricultural workers in the United States shows that signs of heat strain are often ignored, leading to increased risk of harm. These risks are higher for agricultural workers in the southeast and the southwest United States as these areas have higher average WBGT and are at higher risk for losing safe, workable daylight hours to climate change. A community-based study in Los Angeles County, CA found a significant increase in heat-related ED visits in communities with greater prevalence or residents working in outdoor work including agriculture, after adjusting for age, race, and poverty. Each percentage increase in residents working in agriculture resulted in a 10.9% increase in heat-related ED visits.  Legislation  In 2003, an immigration reform bill titled the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act of 2003 (AgJOBS) was introduced in Congress and received bipartisan support from over 500 labor, business, immigrants rights, and other groups. The bill would allow undocumented farm workers in the US to have the opportunity to legally earn the right to stay in the country permanently by continuing to work in the agriculture industry. In April 2005 AgJobs became the first major bill aimed at immigration reform in 20 years to be supported by a majority of senators, however it was not a supermajority and did not receive enough votes to avoid a filibuster. The bill has not been passed as of April 2017. Groups, such as Farmworker Justice, have continued to support the AgJobs bill, and while it was not a stand-alone bill in the 112th Congress, it was included with Senator Bob Menendez's (NJ) Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2011. Other recent legislation relating to farmworkers was introduced in 2011 by Representative Howard Berman (CA); the bill was titled the Agricultural Labor Market Reform Act, H.R. 3017. This bill aimed to remove incentives for growers (agricultural employers) to hire guest workers instead of US workers. This bill gathered the support of some farmworker organizations, including Farmworker Justice. There have also been legislative attempts at enacting environmental change by farmworker groups. In 2017, a coalition including the United Farm Workers (UFW) has challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's reversal of a previous law to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos; according to studies conducted by the EPA, exposure to chlorpyrfios, even at very low levels, can damage children's brain development and cause other brain-harming effects. The chemical was banned in 2000 for most household settings but is still used on some crops. Many environmental groups have since come out to condemn the choice of the EPA to reject the pesticide ban. The coalition has called for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Scott Pruitt to reinstate the planned ban. In Canada Canada had 297,683 agricultural employees; 112,059 were year-around and 185,624 were seasonal or temporary. Qualifying employers in Canada can hire temporary foreign farmworkers from participating countries for periods of up to 8 months per calendar year for on-farm primary agriculture in specified commodity sectors, if the work involved totals at least 240 hours within a period of 6 weeks or less.Employment and Social Development Canada. Hiring seasonal agricultural workers. http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/foreign_workers/agriculture/seasonal//index.shtml This Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program, established in 1966, brings about 25,000 foreign workers to Canada each year. About 66 percent of those work in Ontario, 13 percent in Québec and 13 percent in British Columbia. Workers in the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program, being citizens of Mexico and various Caribbean countries, tend to be Spanish-speaking. Between 1991 and 1996, in British Columbia, the number of South Asian agricultural workers increased from 3,685 to 5,685, mostly Punjabi-speaking. Analysis published in 2000 indicated that \\"Of the 5,000 workers employed by the over 100 licensed Farm Labour Contractors in British Columbia, two-thirds were recent immigrants who entered Canada less than 3 years ago. Of the 700 harvest workers surveyed, 97 percent were Punjabi speaking.\\" (British Columbia did not participate in the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program until 2004.) Many of the issues noted for farmworkers in the US also apply in Canada. Analysis pertaining to Ontario noted that \\"All workers are eligible (with some variability) for provincial health insurance ... and workers compensation (WSIB), and are covered by provincial health and safety legislation through the Ministry of Labour, and yet [migrant farm workers] are not always able or willing to access these health and compensation services.\\" Every Canadian province and territory has an office that deals with labour and employment laws. A person at the local employment or labour-standards office can talk to farmworkers about fair pay, hours of work, rest periods and working conditions, and provide other services. An employer cannot punish a farmworker for contacting an employment- standards office.  In Cuba Prior to social changes in the 1960s, the all- important Cuban sugar-growing economy had an integrated rural-urban workforce - each season, town-dwellers helped to bring in the harvest. Subsequently mechanisation ensued. In Mexico The Encuesta Nacional de Empleo estimated 2.7 million agricultural workers in Mexico. About a million are migrants. There is much use of seasonal and migrant agricultural labor in northwestern Mexico, because of the considerable fruit and vegetable production occurring in that region. Rough estimates of peak seasonal labor requirements for Sinaloa, Sonora, and Baja California Norte and Sur are 400,000 to 600,000. Several issues, particularly low pay and harsh working conditions, have been identified that pertain to some farmworkers in Mexico. Many of these issues are pursued by farmworker organizations, with resulting labor action, e.g. strikes occurring in 2015. Over the past quarter-century, water quality and pesticide issues affecting farmworkers in Mexico have been identified in peer- reviewed literature. The following examples are of interest, but are not necessarily broadly representative. In the Mezquital Valley of central Mexico, in the early 1990s, about 85,000 acres were irrigated with wastewater. A study of the implications found that important outcomes were diarrheal disease and parasitic infections in farmworkers and their families.Cifuentes, E. et al. 1993. Problemas de salud asociados al riego agricola con agua residual en Mexico. Salud Publica de Mexico [1993, 35(6):614-619] Pesticide issues were investigated in 200 farmworkers in a small area of northwestern Mexico in the 1990s. Of those workers, 59% could read at the third-grade level, few had received information about pesticides; 30% did not wear personal protective gear; and 20% had experienced acute pesticide poisoning at least once during the season investigated.de Jesús Chain-Castro, T. et al. 1998. Pesticide poisoning in Mexican seasonal farm workers. Int. J. Occupational Env. Health 4:202-203 A study was conducted comparing 25 farm workers engaged in pesticide spraying with a control group of 21 workers not exposed to pesticides, from the Nextipac community in Jalisco, Mexico. The exposed group showed acute poisoning in 20 percent of the cases.Payán-Rentería, R. et al. 2012. Effect of chronic pesticide exposure in farm workers of a Mexico community. Arch. Env. Occupational Health 67: 22-30 In the European Union For the 27 member states of the European Union in 2009, 77 percent of the overall average agricultural labor force was family members; however, in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary and Estonia, family members were not predominant in the agricultural labor force. Hired labor accounted for more than half of total (hired plus family) labor in the horticulture sector. In the 27 states, the average wage of farm workers was €6.34. In 2010, there were estimated to be about 25 million agricultural workers, including farm family members, in the EU-27 states; many were part-time workers. The full-time equivalents were estimated to be about 10 million. Careers Many programs exist, such as World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) that facilitate the placement of volunteer farmworkers on specific types of farms. Additionally, farms may offer apprenticeship or internship opportunities where labor is traded for the knowledge and experience gained from a particular type of production.

It was first identified via NASA satellite photograph number C-S11-32W071-03, released in 1976. They subsequently garnered greater attention among South America aficionados through a series of three articles which questioned from afar what \\"The Dots\\" might truly represent (and settled upon a geological explanation being the most plausible) in 1977 - 1979 issues of the \\"South American Explorer\\" journal, written under the name of \\"Ursula Thiermann\\" by Don Montague, president of the South American Explorers Club. The next 20 years were filled with speculation as to the formations' true nature, as they appeared to be symmetrically spaced and uniform in shape, looking like a series of eight or more pyramids, in at least four rows of two. In August 1996 Boston-based explorer Gregory Deyermenjian of The Explorers Club, along with Peruvian partners Paulino Mamani, Dante Núñez del Prado, Fernando Neuenschwander, Ignacio Mamani, and Machiguenga \\"Roberto\\", his wife \\"Grenci\\" and their baby daughter \\"Reina\\", were first to make an on-site exploration. Their survey identified Paratoari as natural sandstone formations, not as symmetrical in placement or as uniform in size as suggested by their image on the satellite photograph, and without any sign of the influence of ancient culture. The formations, which are at the edge of a higher area that breaks down into lower jungle, were argued to be a natural landform, which is known as truncated ridge spurs (as put forth 17 years previously in the last of the three \\"Ursula Thiermann\\" articles). However, according to pictures in these articles, these formations are another natural landform, which geomorphologists refer to as a \\"flatiron\\". Deyermenjian has since, in 1999 and 2006, seen and photographed various very similar sites in the area of the Río Timpía, with intriguingly pyramidal-shaped huge natural formations.

It was built at Four Mile Creek near Alexandria by pioneer shipbuilder James Trahey of Victoria for Gustavus Blin-Wright and Captain Thomas Wright and was put into service in the spring of 1863. Her captain was JW Doane. The Enterprise was the first of twelve sternwheelers that would work on this section of the Fraser from 1863 to 1921. Though she wasn’t large, she was a wonderful example of the early craft of shipbuilding. All of the lumber she was built from was cut by hand and her boiler and engines had been brought to the building site at Four Mile packed by mule via the wagon road from Port Douglas, 300 miles away. The route The Fraser River was not considered navigable by sternwheeler between Yale and Soda Creek due to many hazardous canyons and rapids, so the terminus of river navigation on the upper Fraser River was located at Soda Creek. From there a steamer could travel with no obstructions to Quesnel where a stage road ran to Barkerville. The stages of Barnard's Express would travel on the Cariboo Road up from Yale and connect with the Enterprise at Soda Creek. Passengers and freight would then be transferred onto the sternwheeler and travel upriver 56 miles to Quesnel. Once there they would be transferred to company stages again to Barkerville for the last 54 miles. The Enterprise made this trip three times a week, from May to October, for eight years. In October 1863 she carried two Englishmen, Viscount Milton and Dr. Walter Butler Cheadle who would later write fondly of the experience, \\"Given use of captain’s cabin, cigars and books. Fetched out every few minutes to have a drink with someone... Cocktails every five minutes and champagne lunch afterward.\\". Not all early sternwheeler passengers would be so delighted with the experience. Most would be expected to sleep on the open deck and had to work for, as well as pay for, their passage. Usually this work involved ‘wooding up’: cutting and loading firewood for the boiler which could consume as much as five cords an hour. . The Omineca Gold Rush In 1871 during the Omineca Gold Rush, the Wrights decided to take the Enterprise up to Takla Landing, 230 miles northwest of Quesnel, following a route that even the seasoned Hudson's Bay Company canoe-men regarded as extremely difficult. In June 1871, the Enterprise left Quesnel with a full load of passengers including a reporter from Barkerville’s Cariboo Sentinel. She navigated the Fort George Canyon on July 6, although the help of the passengers was required as they cranked her manual capstan to line through. She arrived in Fort George, then a large First Nations village and a Hudson’s Bay Company Post, and continued onto the Nechako River, up to the Stuart River and through Stuart Lake onto Tachie River to Trembleur Lake to Middle River, finally arriving at Takla Lake on August 12. It would be a journey worthy of its own chapter of sternwheeler history and a fitting swan song for the pioneer steamer because, although it was an amazing accomplishment, it was made too late. Other supply routes had been made to the Omineca diggings, from Hazelton via the Skeena River. On her journey back from Takla, the Enterprise was wrecked and abandoned on Trembleur Lake.

Hamsterz Life is also known as Love ♥ Hamster or Love Love Hamster in Japan. Gameplay Hamsterz Life is from the Petz series from Ubisoft for the handheld systems. Being released after Petz 5, it is part of the second Petz series. Hamsterz Life lets you raise several breeds of hamsters and build fully customizable homes for them to live in. Just as in the other Petz games, players can interact with their hamsters by training, playing with, and feeding them. At the start of the game, players can select their first hamster and name it. The hamster will then appear in a cage and be ready to play. Various actions can be chosen including training, feeding, care and other options. Training consists of teaching the hamster words (which they repeat back in their own hamster speak) by speaking the set phrases into the DS microphone. The hamster can repeat these phrases back, but inaudibly. Players can clean the cage and brush their hamsters. Hamsterz Life also includes many mini-games to play. Players can only have one hamster at home at once, any other hamsters that are owned are left with a girl with hamster ears until you wish to switch. Your hamsters can visit with the hamsters of friends who also own Hamsterz Life. When playing mini-games, if you win you receive prizes such as food or toys. You can also let your hamster out of its cage to play in the surrounding room. There are present boxes in the room, which contain prizes you receive when your hamster finds them. Cages Hamsterz Life contains a variety of different cages used for housing a pet hamster. They include Standard, Steel, Toy Box, Pastel, Plant and Wood. Each cage has its own theme song. Toys can be put into the cage for the hamsters to play with. The roller coaster, the slide and the tube cannot be placed into the Standard and Steel cages, for they are too small to fit large items. The standard cage is the cage you will start out with when you start the game. As you play mini-games, you may win cages. Different Types of Hamsters Different types of hamsters are shown in the game as you choose your pet hamster. There is Djungarian, Golden, Campbell, Cutie, Baby and Panda hamsters. Each will start out as a pup and eventually grow into an adult. You can play mini-games to win toys for your hamsters and teach them how to say basic phrases such as \\"hello\\" and \\"good-bye\\". Each of the types of hamster has its own manner of speaking; Cutie speaks like a yandere, and Baby speaks both Mandarin and a Pidgin English based thereon. Hammy Hammy is a hamster girl seen in the game. She appears as a girl with brown hair and hamster ears. She is also seen wearing an apron with a yellow dress underneath. She explains how to do things throughout the game such as how to play mini-games, taking care of your hamster. She is also there to help pick out a hamster. When switching for a visiting hamster, Hammy takes them and takes care of them until you come back to swap your current hamster for another that you already have.

His last work Harisanhita, an epic poem, was published posthumously in three parts during 1959–1960. Harisanhita, composed in Anuṣṭubh metre, is considered to be 'a sublime piece of poetry'. Umashankar Joshi called his lyrics 'Gujarat's paragon in melody in words'. Among the play that Nanalal has written, the main are Indukumar, Jaya ane Jayant, Shahenshah Akbarshah, Vishvageeta and Jahangir–Noorjahan. In his social plays, he has discussed the problems of marital love and love-marriage. His plays have thin plot and characters, and their stageability is also limites. These plays are written in Dolanshaili, a sort of blank verse based on rhythm, employed by the Nanalal himself. Pankhadio is a collection of his short stories. He wrote two novels entitled Usha and Sarathi (Charioteer). Usha is a story of a poet turned lover. In Sarathi, he discusses contemporary politics and prophesies that India will one day be the charioteer (leader) of the world. He wrote a biography of his father, Dalpatram, in three volumes entitles Kavishwar Dalpatram. The critic Mansukhlal Jhaveri consider it 'remarkable' for the valuable information it provides about the life in Gujarat some time before and during the life time of Dalpatram. Jhaveri also criticised it for its excessive exaggeration in presentation and the total lack of balance in judging the subject. Apana Saksharratno (part I & II) and Gurudakshina are the collection of biographical sketches. He translated several works into Gujarati from Sanskrit including Kālidāsa's Abhijñānaśākuntalam and Meghadūta; Bhagavad Gita, Shikshapatri and 5 Upanishads. Reception The Government of India issued a postage stamp on him in his honour on 16 March 1978.Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi – Postage stamp – 1978 India Post Gujarati critic and historian Mansukhlal Jhaveri notes, in History of Gujarati Literature, that \\"few poets in Gujarat have reached as high a zenith in esteem as Nanalal, who during his own life time was acknowledged as the greatest lyrical poet of Gujarat.

It is part of the Maine Community College System. History Southern Maine Community College (SMCC) opened in Augusta, Maine in 1946 under the name \\"Maine Vocational Technical Institute\\" as a day school to serve World War II veterans who needed training to learn new skills in a post-war economy. Having outgrown its space in Augusta, MVTI and its 156 students moved in the summer of 1952 to the site of the decommissioned Fort Preble in South Portland. It is located across Portland Harbor from the city of Portland, the largest city in Maine, on a site overlooking Casco Bay. During the 1960s, the name was changed to Southern Maine Vocational Technical Institute (SMVTI) and authorization was received to award Associate in Applied Science degrees. Through the years, the institution evolved from a technical institute into an accredited college. The first Associate of Applied Science degree students were enrolled in 1968, and the first A.A.S. degrees were awarded two years later. In the late 1980s, the Maine Legislature changed the name of the state Vocational Technical Institute System to the Maine Technical College System, and SMVTI changed its name to Southern Maine Technical College, with similar name changes at other colleges within the system. The college in 1998 added an Associate in Arts degree in liberal studies to its offerings, a major step in the evolution to a comprehensive community college. The transformation was completed in 2003 when the Maine Legislature passed legislation establishing the Maine Community College System, resulting in SMTC becoming Southern Maine Community College. In 2011, SMCC opened a second campus at Brunswick Landing in the nearby town of Brunswick, Maine, home of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The college now has more than 6,000 students who come from across Maine and New England, from other states outside of New England and from other nations. The college offers more than 40 degree and certificate programs in five different academic divisions: Applied Technology, Arts & Sciences, Health Sciences, Public Safety and Business and Information Technology. =History of Fort Preble= During the Revolutionary War, a temporary fortification known as Fort Hancock was built on a point of land on the eastern shore of South Portland, Maine (then part of Cape Elizabeth). In 1808, under direction of Henry A. S. Dearborn, Fort Hancock was acquired by the federal government and was expanded, partly to enforce a trade embargo that President Thomas Jefferson enacted against Great Britain and France. The newly expanded fort, now called Fort Preble, was named after Commodore Edward Preble. Fort Prevel was established as a Second System Fort in 1808 by Henry A. S. Dearborn to defend Portland Harbor. Modifications to upgrade it to a Third System Fort were started but never reached completion. It received continued use through the U.S. Civil War, the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II. Four Endicott Period batteries were installed after the Spanish–American War. An additional battery was constructed during World War II. On July 31, 1947 it was deactivated and declared surplus in 1950. =Execution at Fort Preble= On July 15, 1863, Billy Laird, a private in the 17th Maine Regiment, was executed by firing squad at Fort Preble after being charged with desertion. Laird was the only Maine soldier in the Civil War to be executed for desertion. Campuses SMCC has two campuses, in South Portland and in Brunswick. It also offers classes at several satellite locations and online. The South Portland Campus is located on an 80-acre site on the South Portland waterfront and is home to more than 50 buildings that house classrooms and college administrators, faculty and staff. The campus also has two residence halls and athletic facilities, as well as a lighthouse, a beach and old bunkers that were once part of Fort Preble. The Midcoast Campus in Brunswick opened in 2011 and is located at Brunswick Landing, the site of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The campus has four primary buildings: the L.L.Bean Learning Commons and Health Science Center, Orion Residence Hall, the Maine Advanced Technology and Engineering Center (MATEC), and the Academic Building. The L.L.Bean Learning Commons opened in 2014 and serves as the hub of the campus with tech-infused learning space, a library, advising offices, quiet study rooms, a café, and modern laboratories and classrooms for Nursing and Health Sciences students. =Online= SMCC also offers online and hybrid (in-class and online) courses and a full online liberal studies degree. =Peter A. McKernan Hospitality Center= The McKernan Center served as officers' quarters from the Revolutionary War through World War II when the site was a military fort. In 1993, the center was renovated into a conference and lodging facility and is now utilized for students who are attending SMCC in the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management programs. The center overlooks the abundant history of Fort Preble and Portland Harbor. =Residence Halls= Most students commute to SMCC, but the college also has three residence halls (two on its South Portland Campus and one on its Midcoast Campus). Spring Point and Surfsite Residence Halls are located on the South Portland Campus and accommodate roughly 450 students a semester. Orion Residence Hall on the Midcoast Campus served as bachelor officers' quarters when the Brunswick Naval Air Station was open. Enrollment After transitioning from a technical college to a community college in 2002, SMCC's enrollment more than doubled in just a few years to more than 6,000 students. SMCC graduates typically directly enter the workforce or continue their education at a baccalaureate college of university. SMCC has agreements that offer seamless transfer options to nearly 70 degree programs at over 20 colleges and universities. =Athletics= Southern Maine Community College has seven sports teams that are members of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) and the Yankee Small College Conference (YSCC), the New England regional league of the USCAA. The college offers men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, baseball, softball and coed golf. The HUB Athletic Center features a gymnasium, locker rooms, a fitness center and a weight room. =Shoreway Arboretum= Shoreway Arboretum The Southern Maine Community College campus also has an established arboretum which was created and is maintained by the college, named the Shoreway Arboretum. The arboretum runs along the shoreline of Willard Beach. The arboretum contains many kinds of native salt-tolerant trees and shrubs, including a good specimen of Swiss Stone Pine (Pinus cembra). =Spring Point Shoreway= The Southern Maine Community College campus is situated within the Spring Point Shoreway. This shoreway comprises and includes Willard Beach, Fort Preble, the Spring Point Ledge Light, and the Old Settler's Cemetery, and runs through the Shoreway Arboretum. The shoreway also includes the building which once housed the Portland Harbor Museum (now merged with the Maine Maritime Museum). =Old Settlers Cemetery= Old Settlers Cemetery Also in the college's grounds is the Old Settlers Cemetery, which is South Portland's oldest landmark. It was established in 1658.Cemeteries in South Portland, Maine - USM.Maine.edu It is also known as the Thrasher Cemetery.

Takami was a Christian pastor assigned to a disaster relief project in Bangladesh after the floods of 1970. Discerning a dearth of capable and committed local leaders, he determined to establish an institute dedicated to providing them training and skills to increase their capacity to serve their people. In 1973, he founded the Asian Rural Institute, or ARI. Early life In his youth, Takami was sent by his parents to a Zen monastery in Kyoto. At the age of eighteen, just months before the end of World War II, he enlisted in the Japanese navy and briefly attended radar school. In 1951, Takami found work as a cook for a Christian missionary where he began to study Christianity. Soon after, he was baptized. A youth organization in the United States then sponsored him to attend Doane College in Nebraska. By 1960, he had earned his bachelor's degree, graduated from Yale Divinity School, and become an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, Japan. Tsurukawa Rural Evangelical Seminary and the Asian Rural Institute Takami taught practical theology and directed the Southeast Asia Christian Rural Leaders' course at the Tsurukawa Rural Evangelical Seminary in Tokyo for ten years, where he eventually designed the institute's curriculum around small-scale organic farming and animal husbandry. Although based in Christianity, ARI is not exclusively a Christian organization and is interfaith in practice. In subsequent years, as the institute's six-hectare campus north of Tokyo grew with new facilities, men and women from virtually every country in Asia, and eventually many in Africa, the Pacific, and the Americas, joined its unique nine-month rural leaders training course. Takami deliberately kept ARI small, accepting only about thirty participants a year. Yet he cast the institute's net so wide that today over 1,200 graduates are spread across the world. Takami resigned as ARI director in 1990. He passed away peacefully at the Maronie Nursing Care Facility at 10:18pm on Thursday, September 6th. He was 91 years old.

The 20th Battalion was formed by remnants of the 21st Battalion garrisoned at Pozo Rubio, Albacete, new volunteers, as well as some soldiers and officers who had recovered from their wounds.

The terms Crown in Right of Jamaica, Her Majesty in Right of Jamaica, or The Queen in Right of Jamaica may also be used to refer to the entire executive of the government of Jamaica. Though the Jamaican Crown has its roots in the British Crown, it has evolved to become a distinctly Jamaican institution, represented by its own unique symbols. The present monarch is Queen Elizabeth II—officially titled Queen of Jamaica—who has reigned since 6 August 1962. She, her consort, and other members of the Royal Family undertake various public and private functions across Jamaica and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any constitutional role, holding ultimate executive authority, though her Royal Prerogative remains bound by laws enacted by her in parliament and by conventions and precedents, leaving the day-to-day exercise of executive power to her Cabinet. While several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Jamaica are carried out by the Queen's representative, the governor-general. While several British kings ruled over Jamaica before independence, none held the specific, separate title \\"King of Jamaica.\\" The Jamaican monarch, besides reigning in Jamaica, separately serves as monarch for each of fifteen other Commonwealth realms. This developed from the former colonial relationship of these countries to Britain, now independent each realm of the Commonwealth is legally distinct. International and domestic aspects Jamaica has the same person as their monarch as other Commonwealth realms. Each country is sovereign and independent of the others,The English Court of Appeal ruled in 1982, while \\"there is only one person who is the Sovereign within the British Commonwealth ... in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada\\". R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association, QB 892 at 928; as referenced in High Court of Australia: Sue v Hill [1999] HCA 30; 23 June 1999; S179/1998 and B49/1998 meaning the Jamaican monarchy has both a separate and a shared character, and the monarchy has also thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called British since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, political, and of convenience. On all matters of the Jamaican state, the monarch is advised solely by Jamaican Ministers of the Crown. and, effective with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962, no British or other realm government can advise the monarch on matters pertinent to Jamaica. Given these arrangements, it is considered impossible for the monarch of Jamaica to receive an ambassador from, or send an ambassador to, any country of which he or she is also monarch; essentially sending an ambassador to him or herself. Instead, the practice of sending High Commissioners developed, wherein an individual is sent to be a representative in one realm of the government in another. =Title and style= The shared and domestic aspects of the Crown are also highlighted in the sovereign's Jamaican title, currently Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Jamaica and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth. The sovereign's role specifically as Queen of Jamaica, as well as her status as monarch of other nations, is communicated by mentioning Jamaica separately from, but along with, the Queen's other lands. Typically, the sovereign is styled Queen of Jamaica, and is addressed as such when in Jamaica or performing duties on behalf of Jamaica abroad. =Finance= The sovereign only draws from Jamaican coffers for support in the performance of her duties when in Jamaica or acting as Queen of Jamaica abroad; Jamaicans do not pay any money to the Queen, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside Jamaica. This applies equally to other members of the royal family. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General in the exercise of the powers of the Crown, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like. =Succession= Charles, Prince of Wales, is the heir apparent to the Jamaican throne. Succession is by absolute primogeniture governed by the provisions of the Act of Settlement, 1701, and the Bill of Rights, 1689. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, nor married to one, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. Though these constitutional laws, as they apply to Jamaica, still lie within the control of the British parliament, via adopting the Statute of Westminster both the United Kingdom and Jamaica agreed not to change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies identically in all the other realms, and which has been likened to a treaty amongst these countries.Justice Rouleau in a 2003 court ruling wrote that \\"Union under the ... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle\\". O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.) Thus, Jamaica's line of succession remains identical to that of the United Kingdom. Upon a demise of the Crown (the death or abdication of a sovereign) it is customary for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly proclaimed by the Governor-General. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign’s heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase \\"The king is dead, long live the king!\\" Following an appropriate period of mourning, the monarch is also crowned in the United Kingdom, though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne. All incumbent viceroys, judges, civil servants, legislators, military officers, etc., are not affected by the death of the monarch. After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so before Jamaica was independent, and, even then, only with the authorization of specials Acts of Parliament in the Dominions. Personification of the state Royal Standard of Jamaica Since the independence of Jamaica, the sovereign's role as monarch of Jamaica has been recognised and promoted as separate to his or her position as monarch of the United Kingdom. From the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II's reign onwards, royal symbols in Jamaica were altered or new ones created to make them distinctly Jamaican, such as the augmentation of the Royal Arms of Jamaica in 1962 and Queen's Royal Standard for Jamaica, created in 1962. Today the sovereign is regarded as the personification, or legal personality, of the Jamaican state. Therefore, the state is referred to as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Jamaica; for example, if a lawsuit is filed against the government, the respondent is formally described as Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Jamaica, or simply Regina. As such, the monarch is the owner of all state lands (called Crown land), buildings and equipment (called Crown held property), state owned companies (called Crown Corporations), and the copyright for all government publications (called Crown copyright), as well as guardianship of foster children (called Crown wards), in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual. Government staff are also employed by the monarch, as are the Governor-General, judges, members of the Jamaica Defence Force, police officers, and parliamentarians, who all technically work for the monarch. Many employees of the Crown were once required by law to recite an oath of allegiance to the monarch before taking their posts, in reciprocation to the sovereign's Coronation Oath, wherein he or she promises \\"to govern the Peoples of ... [Jamaica] ... according to their respective laws and customs\\". Save for that taken by senators,Standing Orders of the Senate of Jamaica 1964 the oaths of allegiance were altered in 2002, removing mention of the monarch. Constitutional role Jamaica's constitution is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Jamaican in origin, which gives Jamaica a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms, wherein the role of the Queen and the Governor-General is both legal and practical. The Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct, meaning all powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch, who is represented by the Governor-Generalappointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister of Jamaica. Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by this vice-regal representative, though she is briefed through regular communications from her Jamaican ministers, and holds audience with them whenever possible. All institutions of government are said to act under the sovereign's authority; the vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the Royal Prerogative. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests. While the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxessuch an action requires the authorization of an Act of Parliament. The government of Jamaica is also thus formally referred to as Her Majesty's Government. Further, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch's representative in Jamaica, requires the consent of a two-thirds majority of each house of parliament. When Jamaica attained fully responsible status within the Commonwealth provision for the new constitution, with effect from 6 August 1962, was made by The Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, under the West Indies Act,1962 and the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962. The Form of Oath of Allegiance set out in the First Schedule of the Order in Council, is a declaration of allegiance to \\"Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors\\".Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962 =Executive (Queen- in-Council)= In Jamaica's constitutional system, one of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint a prime minister, who thereafter heads the Cabinet and advises the monarch and Governor-General on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs; this requirement is, unlike in other Commonwealth realms where it is a matter of convention, constitutionally enshrined in Jamaica. Though the monarch's power is still a part of the executive processthe operation of the Cabinet is technically known as the Queen-in-Council (or Governor-in-Council)the advice tendered is typically binding. Since the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the last monarch to head the British Cabinet, the monarch reigns but does not rule. This means that the monarch's role, and thereby the viceroys' role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain the Queen's peace, and direct the actions of the Jamaica Defence Force, as well as to summon and prorogue parliament, and call elections. However, it is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way, and the royal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen. These include signing the appointment papers of Governors-General, the confirmation of awards of Jamaican honours system, and the approval of any change in her Jamaican title. In accordance with convention, the monarch or Governor- General, to maintain the stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Representatives: usually the leader of the political party with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority government situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor- General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to the Cabinet the other ministers of the Crown, who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Representatives, and through it, to the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and other members of the ministry. Members of various executive agencies, and other officials are appointed by the Crown. The commissioning of privy councillors, senators, the Speaker of the Senate, Supreme Court justices also falls under the Royal Prerogative, though these duties are specifically assigned to the Governor-General by the constitution. Public inquiries are also commissioned by the Crown through a Royal Warrant, and are called Royal Commissions. Foreign affairs The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or Governor-General negotiates and ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements. As with other uses of the Royal Prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required; however, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Jamaica; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Jamaican High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative, and, as such, all Jamaican passports are issued in the monarch's name. =Parliament (Queen-in-Parliament)= The sovereign, along with the Senate and the House of Representatives, is one of the three components of Parliament, called the Queen-in-Parliament. The authority of the Crown therein is embodied in the mace for each house,Jamaica Houses of Parliament: Mace which both bear a crown at their apex. Per the constitution, the monarch does not, however, participate in the legislative process; the viceroy does, though only in the granting of Royal Assent. Further, the constitution outlines that the Governor-General alone is responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving parliament, after which the writs for a general election are usually dropped by the Governor-General at Government House. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which either the monarch or the Governor-General reads the Speech from the Throne. As the monarch and viceroy cannot enter the House of Representatives, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the Commons by the Crown's messenger, the Usher of the Black Rod, after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him, to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the assembly. All laws in Jamaica are enacted only with the viceroy's granting of Royal Assent; usually done by the Governor-General, with the Broad Seal of Jamaica. Thus, all bills begin with the phrase \\"BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Representatives of Jamaica, and by the authority of the same, as follows...\\"The Caribbean Court of Justice: Closing the Circle of Independence, Duke E. Pollard, Ian Randle Publishers, 2004, page 153 =Courts (Queen-on-the-Bench)= The sovereign is deemed the fount of justice, and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects, known in this role as the Queen on the Bench. However, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name by what are termed Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace. Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign \\"can do no wrong\\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a sovereign and under established principles of international law, the Queen of Jamaica is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent. The sovereign, and by extension the governor-general, also exercises the prerogative of mercy, and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial. In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the Coat of arms of Jamaica is always displayed in Jamaican courtrooms. History In 1966 Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by his son, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, toured Jamaica as part of his visit there to open that year's Commonwealth Games. Popularity Prior to the Queen's 2002 visit, the newspaper Jamaica Gleaner said \\"So as Jamaica looks back, let it also look forward. Let this visit not so much renew old ties as cement new ones.\\"\\" A visit for the future\\" , Jamaica Gleaner The BBC reported that \\"despite republican sentiments in the country she was given an enthusiastic welcome.\\"\\"Picture gallery: Queen in Jamaica\\", BBC News, 19 February 2002 A poll taken in 2002 showed that 57% of Jamaicans thought that the Queen's visit to Jamaica as part of Her Golden Jubilee tour was important. Republicanism Individuals in both major political parties in Jamaica have voiced support for making Jamaica a republic. In September 2003, then Prime Minister of Jamaica P. J. Patterson called for Jamaica to abolish the monarchy by 2007.\\"Jamaica eyes republican future\\", BBC News, 22 September 2003 Bruce Golding, while prime minister and leader of the conservative Jamaican Labour Party, also pledged that Jamaica shall \\"take steps to amend the constitution to replace the Queen with a Jamaican President who symbolises the unity of the nation\\". Portia Simpson-Miller (Prime Minister, 2012-16) expressed her intention to make Jamaica a republic to coincide with the country's 50th anniversary of independence in August 2012, but did not follow through with the proposed change which would require the support of two-thirds of both houses in the Parliament of Jamaica to pass; Simpson-Miller's People's National Party had a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives but was one seat short in the Senate and would have needed the support of at least one senator from the Opposition Jamaican Labour Party in order to have the constitutional reform approved. The current leader of the JLP, Andrew Holness, who succeeded Simpson-Miller as prime minister in 2016, has announced that his government will amend the Constitution to make Jamaica a republic. Specifically, the government has pledged to introduce a constitutional amendment to \\"replace Her Majesty The Queen with a non-executive president as head of state\\".Jamaica unveils plan to ditch Queen as head of state, Daily Telegraph, 16 April 2016 During the 2020 Jamaican general election the People's National Party promised to hold a referendum on becoming a republic within 18 months if it won the election.http://jamaica- gleaner.com/article/news/20200808/pnp-vows-hold-referendum-whether-remove- queen-if-elected and polls suggested that 55% of Jamaicans desired the country become a republic.http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/55-of-respondents-say- the-queen-must-go_200465 However, the ruling Jamaican Labour Party, which had in 2016 promised a referendum but not carried one out, was re- elected.http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/commentary/20200908/editorial-pms- governance-agenda-needs-clarity See also * Constitution of Jamaica * Jamaican High Commission in London * List of monarchies * Monarchies in the Americas References Category:Government of Jamaica Category:Commonwealth realms Category:Monarchies of North America Category:Jamaica–United Kingdom relations Category:Jamaica and the Commonwealth of Nations Monarchy of Jamaica ","title":"Monarchy of Jamaica"},{"id":"10722208","title":"North Dakota Secretary of State"},{"id":"10722246","text":"General Palafox, Duke of Saragossa The Palafox Battalion was a volunteer unit of largely Polish and Spanish composition in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. It was named after José de Palafox, a Spanish general who successfully fought French Napoleonic forces during the Peninsular War. The Palafox Battalion was formed on 28 June 1937 as a unit of the 150th International Brigade. It was formed from Poles, and Soviet citizens, with a nucleus of Spanish volunteers from the Pasionaria Battalion. \\"Most of its companies were commanded by Red Army lieutenants\\"Beevor, The Battle for Spain (2006), p 163). On 4 August 1937, two of its companies were sent to reinforce XIII International Brigade, with the remaining companies following in early October. On 12 October 1936, the Palafox Battalion was merged with the Mickiewicz Battalion to form the 4th battalion of XIII International Brigade. It remained with the XIIIth Brigade until the International Brigades were demobilised on 23 September 1938. It was formed on 28 Jun 1937 and, until 12 October 1937 attached to 150th International Brigade. It was then transferred to XIII International Brigade (the 13th Dabrowski Brigade). It has five companies of which No. 2 was a specifically Jewish unit. 1 Coy: 2 Coy: Naftalí Botwin 3 Coy: Adam Mickiewicz 4 Coy: Taras Szewczenko 5 Coy: Ludwik Warynski Adam Mickiewicz Company It was common practice in the International Brigades to build new battalions around existing veteran companies and the Palafox Battalion's third company was used as the nucleus for the Mickiewicz Battalion. Naftali Botwin Company  This company was formed of Jewish volunteers and was a sub-unit of the Palafox Battalion during the Spanish Civil War. It was named after Naftali Botwin, a Polish Jew who was executed in 1925 for killing a police informer. =Background= The idea of a separate Jewish unit was first put forward to Luigi Longo and André Marty in Albacete by \\"Albert Nahumi\\" (Arieh Weits), a French Communist Party leader in October 1936.Zaagsma, p 17 The idea was well received and a call for volunteers went out. However, Nahumi died shortly afterwards and the idea was not progressed. A year later, the idea was resurrected and pressure was put on Longo and Marty by a group of influential Paris communists. On 12 December 1937, the Naftali Botwin Company was established by renaming and reforming No. 2 Company of the Palafox Battalion into an officially Jewish unit.Text of Brigade declaration (at marxism.org) The new company had about 150 members from Poland, France, Belgium, Palestine and Spain. Its flag bore the Dabrowski motto (\\"For your freedom and ours\\") in Yiddish and Polish on one side, and in Spanish on the other. It also had its own anthem, Der March der Botvin-soldaten (\\"March of the Botwin Soldiers\\"). The lyrics were by Olek Nuss, who survived wounds in Spain only to be executed in Nazi-occupied France. It was published in Botwin, the journal of Yiddish-speaking soldiers in Spain, in November 1938. =Political dimension= By the end of 1937, the International Brigades were facing significant difficulties, both in Spain and abroad. Its supply of volunteers was drying up, as a result of high casualties and stories circulated by returning volunteers about harsh discipline and appalling conditions. The blockade on arms and materiel, organised by the Non- Intervention Committee was also having its effect. As Zaagsma writes:Zaagsma, p 19 The International Brigade was one of the Comintern's most powerful propaganda tools ... Given the high proportion of Jews in the various communist parties, a Jewish fighting unit was a powerful propaganda tool.

Life and work In 1965, Stan Bevington, a typesetter, newly transplanted to Toronto from Edmonton, rented an old coach house and installed an antique Challenge Gordon platen press, creating Coach House Press, which introduced Canadians to the early works of writers such as bpNichol, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, George Bowering, Di Brandt, Nicole Brossard, Frank Davey, Daphne Marlatt, Ann-Marie MacDonald, David McFadden and Anne Michaels. Known for its advocacy of the avant-garde and for many author/artist collaborations, Coach House has published more than 500 titles since its inception, and prints more than 200 books a year for other presses, including catalogues for libraries and art galleries. As printing technology changed over time, Bevington invited collaboration with computer programmers. In 1996, Coach House launched a digital distribution online series of ebooks as part of Bevington's current exploration in virtual publishing. In the 1970s, Bevington lectured at York University and Visual Studies Workshop, Rochester, and in the 1980s at the Banff Publishing workshops and Radcliffe at Harvard. He was awarded several Canada Council artists' grants during this time and made the Coach House available as a printmaking studio for a number of Canadian artists. One of his own prints is in the Art Gallery of Ontario's permanent collection. In 1999, Bevington won an Alcuin Society Award for Design for his work on the Toronto in Print catalogue. That same year, Arts Toronto awarded him the William Kilbourn Lifetime Achievement Award, while the Organization of Book Publishers of Ontario gave him the 2005 Janice E. Hanford Small Press Award. In June 2008, Coach House won the Ontario Premier's Award for Excellence in the Arts. In July 2009, Bevington was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada for his outstanding contribution to Canadian culture. In May 2010 Stan was awarded Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa from NSCAD.

Death growls are sometimes criticized for their \\"ugliness\\".Sharpe-Young, Garry. Death Metal, However, the harshness of death growls is in keeping with death metal's abrasive music style and often dark and obscene subject matter. The progressively more forceful enunciation of metal vocals has been noted from heavy metal to thrash metal to death metal. Definition Death metal, in particular, is associated with growled vocals; tends to be lyrically and thematically darker and more morbid than other forms of metal; and features vocals which attempt to evoke chaos, death, and misery by being \\"usually very deep, guttural, and unintelligible.\\"David Konow, Bang Your Head:The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal. Three Rivers Press, 2002, p.228. Natalie Purcell notes, \\"Although the vast majority of death metal bands use very low, beast-like, almost indiscernible growls as vocals, many also have high and screechy or operatic vocals, or simply deep and forcefully-sung vocals.\\"Purcell, Natalie J. Death Metal Music:The Passion and Politics of a Subculture. McFarland, 2003, p. 11. Sociologist Deena Weinstein has noted of death metal: \\"Vocalists in this style have a distinctive sound, growling and snarling rather than singing the words, and making ample use of the voice distortion box.\\"Weinstein, Deena. Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology. MacMillan, 1991, p. 51. Terminology and technique Death growls are also known as death metal vocals, guttural vocals, death grunts, growled vocals, unclean vocals, harsh vocals, and also jocularly as Cookie Monster vocals. In June 2007, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in The Netherlands reported that, because of the increased popularity of growling in the region, several patients who had used improper growling technique were being treated for edema and polyps on the vocal folds.\\"Grunten\\" sloopt de stem (Growling destroys the human voice), Nederlands Dagblad, June 28, 2007 (Dutch) History and variations =Early precedents= Growled vocals may have been a part of Viking music. In the 10th century, Arab-Spanish Sefardi Jewish merchant Abraham ben Jacob visited Denmark and commented on the local music as follows: \\"Never before I have heard uglier songs than those of the Vikings in Slesvig. The growling sound coming from their throats reminds me of dogs howling, only more untamed.\\" In Hildegard of Bingen's 12th-century allegorical morality play Ordo Virtutum, the role of the Devil uniquely does not employ melodic singing, but is performed in a manner which Hildegard specifies as strepitus diaboli and which is often taken to mean a low and growling voice. In 1966, The Who released the song \\"Boris the Spider,\\" which featured death growls sung in basso profondo by bass player John Entwistle. This may be considered one of the first uses of death growl in popular music. The use of growling, \\"monstrous\\" vocals for ominous effect in rock music can be traced at least as far back as \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins in 1956. Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells, Part Two,\\" from 1973, contains a section from 11:55 to 16:30 featuring extensive use of guttural vocals which are very close in style to the modern \\"death growl;\\" however, this effect was created by manipulating tape speed. In 1969 and the early 1970s, the song \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" by King Crimson is notable for its heavily-distorted vocals sung by Greg Lake. The songs \\"Iron Man\\" by Black Sabbath and \\"One of These Days\\" by Pink Floyd both contain brief passages of ominously-growled, low-pitched vocals (in both cases studio-manipulated) against a heavy background of rock riffs. Other examples are Roger Waters' screams in some Pink Floyd songs, such as \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" (1967) and \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\" (1968). Punk rock bands like The Clash, Stiff Little Fingers, and 999 also regularly employed gruff-sounding vocals, although not as pronounced as the death growl common in metal music today. The low, raspy, aggressive pitch of Lemmy Kilmister from Motörhead was not unlike the death growl and may be thought of as a precursor to the current style. Kate Bush employed raspy, guttural vocals on the track \\"Get Out of My House\\" from her 1982 album The Dreaming. =Origins in heavy metal= The advent of the growl as it is used today coincided roughly with the gradual emergence of death metal, and it is thus difficult to pinpoint a specific individual as the inventor of the technique. Different vocalists likely developed the style over time. The band Death (and its precursor Mantas) with its two vocalists—initially Kam Lee and subsequently Chuck Schuldiner—has been cited as among the first bands to utilize growling (although Schuldiner would eventually switch to a more high- pitched screeching). Other early bands to use the technique include Possessed, Necrophagia, Master, Hellhammer, and Massacre also employed a variation of the growl. Other bands utilizing growling include Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse, and Suffocation. =Uses in other subgenres= *Deathcore *Grindcore *Kawaii metal *Metalcore *Screamo *Gothic metal *Doom metal *Symphonic metal See also * Screaming (in music) * Screaming (with other purposes) * Strident vowel * Harsh voice * Creaky voice * Ingressive sound * Pharyngealization * Voiced epiglottal trill References External links * How to Do Harsh Death Metal Vocals, WikiHow Category:Heavy metal performance techniques Category:Singing techniques Category:Death metal ","title":"Death growl"},{"id":"10722306","text":"Lewis Linaker (8 April 1885 - 17 November 1961) was an English first-class cricketer, who played one match for Yorkshire County Cricket Club against Cambridge University in 1909.

Within the context of archival preservation, the custodians of architectural records must consider many aspects of identification and care when managing the artifactual nature of these materials. Storage containers, handling, paper and chemical compositions and interactions, ultraviolet light exposure, humidity, mold, and other agents of potential harm all interact to determine the longevity of these documents. As well, architectural reprographic drawings are often in very large formats, making storage and handling decisions especially complex. History With the rise of the professionalized practice of western architecture in the second half of the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of photography and mass-produced wood-pulp paper—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of diazotype printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural reprography to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect's own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or Computer-Aided Design—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog reprography far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation. Major processes Both the underlying support—paper or plastic—and the image type are used to identify the specific processes used in architectural reprography. Between the late 19th century and the late 20th century, several processes emerged as the preferred methods, used for decades, while other less common processes were employed for shorter periods of time. =Blueprints= First developed in 1725, blueprinting uses a wet process to produce an image of white lines on a cyan or Prussian blue ground. To make a blueprint, a heavy paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is impregnated with potassium ferricyanide and ferric ammonium, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. After sufficient light exposure, the glass and original drawing are removed and the blueprint paper is washed to reveal a negative image. This same process, using an intermediary reprographic drawing, could also be used to produce a positive blueprint—blue lines on a white ground—however, this more expensive and time-intensive method was far less commonly employed. The major disadvantages of the blueprint process, however, included paper distortions caused by the wet process which might render scale drawings less accurately, as well as the inability to make further copies from the blueprints. Nonetheless, for its efficiency and low cost, the blueprint process, further simplified and mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, became the most widely used reprographic process from the mid-19th century through the first half of the 20th century. In archival settings, because the process involves ammonium, the resulting prints should not be stored in contact with other papers that have a buffered reserve, nor should blueprints be de-acidified, as the resulting chemical interactions can cause irreversible image loss. Blueprints are also highly light-sensitive and should not be exposed to ultraviolet light for long periods of time. =Pellet prints= Invented in 1887 by Henry Pellet, the Pellet process uses a wet process to produce an image of cyan or Prussian blue lines on a white ground. Essentially, this process produces a positive image, while a blueprint produces a negative one. To make a Pellet print, a paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is coated with ferric salts suspended in a gelatin emulsion, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. As with the blueprint process, after sufficient light exposure, the original drawing is removed, the paper washed in a ferrocyanide bath, and then rinsed in an acidic bath to reveal a positive image. This process required fewer steps than creating a positive blueprint, and was thus more widely employed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In an archival setting, Pellet prints should be treated and stored under the same conditions as blueprints. =Van Dyke prints= The Van Dyke process, invented by F. R. Van Dyke in 1901, created an intermediary print—a white line on a dark brown ground—that could used in any of several other processes, such as blueprinting, to create a positive print, i.e. a dark line on a light ground. Using a translucent vellum support, the paper was prepared with a coating of silver salts. The vellum was then united with the original drawing, exposed to ultraviolet light, and later washed in a sodium thiosulfate bath. In an archival setting, Van Dyke prints are relatively rare, as they were created for temporary purposes and often discarded after the final positive prints were made. Because of the nitrates used in preparing the paper and the preferred thin paper itself, Van Dyke prints are often extremely brittle and susceptible to damage. Van Dyke prints should be stored separately and, when possible reformatted before the image degrades unacceptably. =Diazotypes= By the middle of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic techniques such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the Diazotype process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with diazonium salts, a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The Diazo positive print was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper. As with other earlier reprographic processes, a translucent original drawing was placed over a sheet of the sensitized paper and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an ammonia gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream- colored background, although line and ground colors can vary. A related process is the sepia Diazo print, which produced either a positive or negative print in dark brown and light tones. The negative versions of these prints were most often produced as intermediaries, like the earlier Van Dyke process, to allow corrections and revisions without disturbing the original drawing. In the negative printing process, additional resins and oils were sometimes added to the paper support to increase translucency. Positive sepia prints, generally made on opaque paper, were typically used as an alternative to positive blueline Diazo prints. Both blueline and sepia prints were often poorly and cheaply processed, resulting in undesirable residual chemical content. Off-gassing of sulfurous compounds, image fading, and yellowing of the paper support are common signs of degradation and are not reversible. Diazo prints are also highly light-sensitive and can fade to illegibility within a short period of exposure to ultraviolet light. In archival practice, Diazo prints are the most common reprographic format encountered in late 20th- century architectural collections. However, their inherent fragility and fugitive images, as compared with blueprints and earlier processes, makes their care problematic. Diazos—particularly sepia prints, which readily transfer color to adjacent papers—should be physically segregated from all other types of media. Exposure to light and pollutants in air should be minimized, and wherever possible, original drawings or reformatted prints should be kept for reference.

Consultation with a professional conservator is recommended, although some minor treatments can be accomplished by general caretakers with training. Rolled and folded reprography, once cleaned, can be flattened through humidification. Cleaning may be done with white vinyl erasers, using great care in areas of friable media, such as graphite and colored pencil. Tears, losses, and other surface damage should be treated by a professional conservator. For particularly fragile or frequently- handled prints, sheets may be encapsulated in polyester or polypropylene film for additional support and protection. This is not recommended, however, for reprographic prints with annotations in friable media. Storage =Rolled storage= The most common form of storage for architectural drawings—both for drawings in active professional use and in archival environments—has traditionally been in rolls. While this allows for efficiency in the use of space and ease of retrieval, potentially damaging situations can arise from a casual approach to roll storage. For reprographic drawings on paper supports, rolling can stress paper fibers and make unrolling for examination more difficult. Small rolls can be easily crushed and ends can be creased and torn without additional protective wrapping and support. =Flat storage= In circumstances where fragile, rigid, or otherwise atypical media makes rolled storage unfeasible, storage in flat boxes or flatfile drawers can be the best choice. Acid-free and lignin-free portfolio boxes, ideally no more than four inches deep, can be cost-effective and allow more flexibility in arrangement on shelving. Flatfile furniture should meet the minimum requirements of archivally-sound construction—powder- or enamel-coated steel units with no rust or sharp edges that could damage materials while stored or moved in and out of the drawers. Drawings should be grouped and identified for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut to fit the full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from diazotypes, and sepia diazo prints should be stored alone to the extent possible. Reformatting For most drawings, especially those that are oversized or significantly damaged, photographic reproduction remains the best method of accurately reproducing the fine details of a drawing. For drawings that are not significantly damaged or that are encapsulated in a polyester film, digital flat-bed scanning or other mechanical methods may be used. Professional resources The Society of American Archivists supports many architectural archivists in their professional responsibilities. In particular, the SAA's Architectural Records Roundtable is a primary forum for discussion of issues of acquisition, identification, description, conservation, and digital preservation of a wide variety of architectural documentation.

Up until 1 July 2008, it was designated as the 341st Space Wing. Established as a World War II Tenth Air Force North American B-25 Mitchell bomb group in India, the unit served as part of Strategic Air Command during the early part of the Cold War as a Boeing B-47 Stratojet wing, before becoming an intercontinental ballistic missile unit in 1962. Today, the 341st is one of three remaining United States Air Force wings that maintain and operate the LGM-30 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. Mission The 341st Missile Wing reports directly to Twentieth Air Force, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming, and is part of Air Force Global Strike Command, headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The mission of the 341st Missile Wing is to defend America with safe, secure, effective nuclear forces and combat-ready airmen. Subordinate units The 341st Missile Wing is made up of a wing staff and five groups – the 341st Operations Group, 341st Maintenance Group, 341st Mission Support Group, 341st Security Forces Group and 341st Medical Group. The base is also host to two tenant units, the 819th RED HORSE Squadron and the 40th Helicopter Squadron (part of the 582d Helicopter Group). *341st Operations Group :: 10th Missile Squadron :: 12th Missile Squadron :: 490th Missile Squadron :: 341st Operations Support Squadron The 564th Missile Squadron served with the wing from 1967–2008. The 341st Security Forces Group is the largest security forces group in the USAF. The units of the 341st Security Forces Group include the 341st Security Forces Squadron, 341st Missile Security Forces Squadron, 741st Missile Security Forces Squadron, 841st Missile Security Forces Squadron, and 341st Security Support Squadron. History =World War II= B-25J Mitchell, 341st #435, 491st Bomb Squadron, 1944 The 341st Missile Wing has its origins in the China-Burma-India Theater of World War II, being activated in India on 15 September 1942. The unit was one of the first bomber units in the CBI; being equipped with B-25 Mitchell medium bombers which were shipped from the United States to Karachi. The aircraft were readied for flight operations by Air Technical Service Command at Karachi Air Depot and dispatched to Chakulia Airfield, now in Bangladesh in December. The group was formed with two bomb squadrons (11th, 22d) which had been attached to the 7th Bombardment Group since May 1942, and two newly activated squadrons (490th and 491st Bombardment Squadrons). The 11th Bombardment Squadron was already in China, having flown combat missions with China Air Task Force since 1 July 1942. Planes and crews of the 22d Bombardment Squadron had been flying recon and tactical missions over north and central Burma, also since July. The group entered combat early in 1943 and operated chiefly against enemy transportation in central Burma until 1944. It bombed bridges, locomotives, railroad yards, and other targets to delay movement of supplies to the Japanese troops fighting in northern Burma. The 341st Bomb Group usually functioned as if it were two groups and for a time as three. Soon after its activation in September 1942, 341st Bomb Group Headquarters and three of its squadrons, the 22d, 490th and 491st, were stationed and operating in India under direction of the Tenth Air Force, while the 11th Squadron was stationed and operating in China under direction of the \\"China Air Task Force\\", which was later reorganized and reinforced to become the Fourteenth Air Force. Fourteen months later the group headquarters along with 22d and the 491st Squadrons joined the 11th Squadron under the command of 69th Composite Wing, Fourteenth Air Force. 341st Group HQ was Kunming and the 22d and 491st were at Yangkai, while the 11th continued to be based at Kweilin, attached to the 68th Composite Wing. However, the 490th \\"Burma Bridge Busters\\" remained in India, under the command of Major-General Howard Davidson's Tenth Air Force. Still later the 11th Squadron and a detachment of the 491st operated for a time under the East China Task Force.Group Records and Squadron History Reports, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL From several airfields in China the group engaged primarily in attacking enemy concentrations and storage areas and in conducting sea sweeps and attacks against inland shipping. They also bombed and strafed such targets as trains, harbors, and railroads in French Indochina and the Canton-Hong Kong area of China. Received a DUC for developing and using a special (glip) bombing technique against enemy bridges in French Indochina. It was inactivated on 2 November 1945, the day after Group and Squadron personnel debarked at Newark, New Jersey. =Bombardment Wing= Reactivated in September 1955 at Abeline Air Force Base (later Dyess Air Force Base), Texas as a Strategic Air Command Boeing B-47E Stratojet unit which were designed to carry nuclear weapons and to penetrate Soviet air defenses with its high operational ceiling and near supersonic speed. The 341st flew the B-47 in training missions and participated in various SAC exercises and deployments with the Stratojet to bases in Morocco and England designed for forward deployments. Also controlled a KC-97 Stratotanker squadron to provide air refueling for B-47 operations. In 1958 after the loss of some aircraft in clandestine Cold War operations; it was believed that Soviet air defenses had caught up to the ability of the B-47 to successfully penetrate Soviet airspace if called to combat duty. The Stratojet began to be phased out of the inventory and the 341st Bomb Wing began sending its aircraft to storage at Davis–Monthan AFB in 1961. The unit was inactivated on 25 June. =Strategic Missile Wing= On 15 July 1961 the 341st was reactivated as the 341st Strategic Missile Wing. A year later, in late July 1962, the first LGM-30A Minuteman I ICBM arrived at Malmstrom and was placed at Alpha-9 launch facility. The 10th Strategic Missile Squadron (SMS) accepted its final missile on 28 February 1963. Two months later, the 12th SMS became 100 percent combat ready. In July, the 490th SMS became fully operational, giving the 341st SMW responsibility for 150 silos. In August 1964, the Air Force announced plans to build an additional 50 silos assigned to the 341st to house LGM-30F Minuteman II missiles. As construction of these new silos proceeded through 1966, the 564th Strategic Missile Squadron stood up on 1 April 1966. Just over a year later America's 1,000th Minuteman missile would be in place and on alert at Malmstrom. This milestone marked the completion of Minuteman deployment by the United States. While new Minuteman IIs deployed with the 564th, upgrading of the Minuteman I models had been ongoing with the wing starting a transition from \\"A\\" to \\"B\\" models in August 1964. By June 1969, all Minuteman Is, both \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" models, were replaced by Minuteman II models. In 1975, the 564th SMS switched from the Minuteman II to the LGM-30G Minuteman III model. In November 1975, the wing began an integrated improvement program that included a command data buffer and an improved launch control system. In 1985, the 341st SMW became the lead unit in the Minuteman Integrated Life Extension program (Rivet Mile). While serving as a deterrent force, the 341st SMW won numerous honors. The unit won its first Blanchard Trophy in SAC's annual Olympic Arena missile competition in 1976 and again captured this most coveted prize in 1986, 1990, and 1991. The unit has won additional accolades over the years. On 28 September 1991, President Bush ordered all Minuteman IIs off alert status. This order affected three-quarters of the 200 ICBMs assigned to the 341st SMW. On 1 September 1991 the 341st SMW was redesignated simply a Missile Wing, part of Strategic Air Command's Twentieth Air Force. As such it apparently became the only formation designated a 'Missile Wing' ever assigned to SAC. The 341st Missile Wing was reassigned from SAC to the Eighth Air Force of Air Combat Command on 31 May 1992. In accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), on 28 September 1991, the 341st Missile Wing began taking its Minuteman IIs off alert and began deactivation of the missiles. 150 Minuteman II missiles were removed from their silos. Fifty of the vacated silos received Minuteman III missiles, joining the 50 Minuteman III missiles already on alert status. This conversion was completed by 1994. In March 1995, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission selected the 321st Strategic Missile Wing at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota for deactivation. The 321st Missile Group transferred control of its Minuteman III silos and alert responsibilities to the 341st Missile Wing on 30 September 1998. As a result of the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review, the 341st Missile Wing deactivated the Minuteman III WS-133B missile system and subsequent inactivation of the 564th Missile Squadron on 19 August 2008 On 1 December 2009 it was reassigned to the new Air Force Global Strike Command where it remains on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year. On 19 April 2016, Col. Ronald G. Allen assumed command of the 341st Missile Wing from Col. Tom Wilcox. Notable incidents In November 2008, the wing failed its nuclear surety inspection, given by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.; The wing again failed the inspection on 9 February 2010. A July 2009 inspection conducted by the Air Force Audit Agency found that 48 percent of the 711 unused nuclear weapons-related materials handled by the wing were incorrectly tracked or recorded. The inspectors primarily faulted the Material Command, not the wing, for most of the discrepancies. In response to the findings, the wing moved all unused nuclear-related items to a secure storage area and performed a follow-up inventory which accounted for 100 percent of the items. The 341st failed inspection again in August 2013. The wing received an \\"unsatisfactory\\" rating due to \\"tactical level errors\\" made during one of the many exercises during its inspection. In 2014 it was revealed that 34 nuclear missile officers of the wing had been implicated of cheating on their monthly missile launch officer tests. After an investigation, the wing's commander, Colonel Robert Stanley voluntarily resigned and retired from the Air Force. The commander and deputy commander of the operations group, and several subordinate commanders were relieved.

It was originally published by Bloomsbury in 2000. Plot The story follows Lily Bloom's encounter with the afterlife after dying from cancer. After being transported to new lodgings near Dalston accompanied by her Aboriginal spirit guide Phar Lap Jones, Rude Boy her dead 9-year-old son and a lithopedion foetus she soon starts to adapt and learn the ways of the dead. Reviews \\"Self is a manic, inventive stylist who can't leave anything out: literary allusions from Goodnight Moon to Finnegans Wake; discussions of Australian sympathetic magic; a sub-theme about Lily's dentures (dentures also made a cameo appearance in \\"The North London Book of the Dead\\"). What with Martin Amis and Zadie Smith, this has certainly been a vintage literary year for teeth, and maybe Self has bitten off more plot than he can chew. Nonetheless, what How the Dead Live lacks in economy of structure it repays in lavishness of feeling and characterisation. Lily is a colossal heroine, a nighttown Molly Bloom who memorably reveals herself through her furious monologue. What begins as a satiric novel of ideas ends as a surprisingly moving elegy\\" \\"Self has always given the impression of a man who intends to elope with his thesaurus at the first available opportunity; on the evidence of How the Dead Live, that opportunity has finally presented itself. We get pointless reiterations (unbeatable gloating, unbelievable schadenfreude); we get the word puling twice in eight pages, which, for a book that invokes Joyce, will not do; and we get wave after wave of viscous imagery (congealed reality . . . blubbery blancmange of an evidence). Throw this book at a wall and it will stick. \\"Self's writing is, in other words, a handy illustration of the close link between cynic and sentimentalist. The person who looks at the world and sees nothing but pustulation is no better or worse—philosophically speaking—than the person who looks at the world and sees nothing but puppy dogs. As guides to the world they are equally reliable, which is to say not reliable at all. Self is writing literature, of course, not philosophy, and anyone using his work as a map deserves our every sympathy.\\" References External links * Official Will Self site * * First Chapter serialized at The Guardian * A review of critical response to the book at The Guardian Category:2000 British novels Category:Novels by Will Self Category:Fiction narrated by a dead person ","title":"How the Dead Live"},{"id":"10722612","text":"Krisnan Nevada Inu (born 17 March 1987) is a professional rugby league footballer who plays as a or er for the Salford Red Devils in the Betfred Super League.

He was later well known as a cricket administrator, serving as secretary of Yorkshire for twenty turbulent years from 1971, until his death at the age of 60 in 1991. Playing career Born in Thirsk, Yorkshire, England, Lister represented the Rest against Southern Public Schools at Lord's in 1948 scoring 75 in eighty minutes. He also appeared for the Yorkshire Second XI (1953-1954), Worcestershire Second XI (1959-1971) and the Free Foresters (1957). He reappeared in a non first-class game for Worcestershire against Jamaica in 1970, captaining the side. Lawrence Rowe scored a hundred in his first innings and fifty in his second, both unbeaten, but the game ended in a draw. In twenty four first-class matches overall, Lister as a right-handed batsman scored 796 runs at 20.41, and took 14 catches. He scored four 50s and came agonisingly close to what would have been a maiden century for Worcestershire against Kent at New Road, Worcester in 1955, the season he played twelve County Championship matches. Opening the batting he had reached 99, but was bowled by Colin Page. He did score 143 for Worcestershire Second XI. His uncle was the Yorkshire bowler George Macaulay. Cricket administration Lister moved into cricket administration early in his career. From 1956, he was assistant secretary of Worcestershire, and, like other prominent amateurs of the period – including the then Worcestershire captain Peter Richardson – combined administration duties with playing. He was a successful captain of Worcestershire's Second XI, leading the team to the Second XI Championship in 1962 and 1963, and being credited with bringing forward some of the young cricketers who helped Worcestershire to the county's first-ever County Championship successes in 1964 and 1965. Lister's years as secretary of Yorkshire were beset by controversy as the county side, accustomed to regular success throughout its history, went through its leanest years, with the captaincy and the committees frequently riven by faction and intrigue. Lister's diplomatic skills meant that the feuding remained in the committee rooms rather than spilling out on to the field of play, and he was also successful in deflecting continued criticism of the pitches and the crowds at Headingley which threatened, at times, its place as a regular Test venue. He died in January 1991 in Granby, Harrogate, Yorkshire.

() is a 1999 Indian psychological suspense thriller film directed by Ram Gopal Varma, written by Anurag Kashyap and starring Urmila Matondkar, Manoj Bajpayee and Sushant Singh. It was shot in 15 days. Plot On a gloomy night, a scared young woman (Urmila Matondkar) talks to her parents on the telephone, enquiring about when they will be back home. As she watches the news of a serial killer at large, the doorbell rings. The man outside identifies himself as Sameer Purnavale (Manoj Bajpai), claiming to be a business partner of the home owner, Mr. Malhotra. The woman is reluctant to open the door, due to the news of a killer on the loose. She says that the house doesn't belong to Mr. Malhotra, but instead to a Mr. Gupta. Believing that there has been a misunderstanding, Sameer persistently rings the doorbell even after the woman tells him that she won't let him in. To scare him away, the woman lies by saying that her husband is sleeping upstairs. Sameer says that he has indeed seen a man in the house, and requests to talk to him. Upon hearing this and a subsequent noise from within the house, the woman becomes scared and runs outside. Sameer then takes the woman back inside, reassuring her that he will protect her. Due to a sudden power cut, the woman goes to the kitchen to look for candles, but instead finds her dead pet cat. Terrified, she runs to the door in a panic, only to find another man who is holding a gun. The man identifies himself as Inspector Qureshi (Sushant Singh) and calls the police station for help. Sameer and the woman are suspicious of Qureshi, and two men then get into a fight. During the struggle the woman gets hold of Qureshi's gun, forcing him to reveal that he is not actually a policeman, but a thief. The woman telephones her mother and asks her to contact the police. Another struggle occurs, and Sameer gravely injures Qureshi, thinking that he is the serial killer. He picks up the telephone to call the police, however he finds that it is not working. Confused, he asks the woman to hide somewhere safe inside the house while he tries to fix the phone. The doorbell rings and Sameer answers. He calls out to the woman, saying that there was a man asking for Mr. Malhotra, but earlier she had insisted that the house belongs to Mr. Gupta. Bewildered, he searches for her in the attic, and stumbles upon a dead body, identifying it as that of Mr. Malhotra. The woman attacks him and they begin to struggle, until Sameer is suddenly stabbed by Qureshi, who believes that he is the killer. Whilst he checks on Sameer's body, the woman begins humming and stabs the thief to death. The woman begins to remove the bodies, clean up the house, rearrange the furniture and proceeds to \\"talk\\" to her mother using the disconnected telephone, revealing her to be the serial killer. The doorbell rings and there is another man at the door, asking for Mr. Malhotra. The woman then turns to the audience and smiles. Cast * Urmila Matondkar as an unnamed female referred to as Ma'am * Manoj Bajpayee as Sameer A. Purnavale * Sushant Singh as Inspector Qureshi/Thief Reception Anupama Chopra in her review for India Today stated, \\"Relentlessly experimental, he moved from the MTV love story Rangeela to the spoof-gone-poof Daud to the gritty underworld saga Satya without a pause. In Kaun, Varma takes a shot at an Ittefaq-style songless suspense thriller and almost pulls it off.\\" Suparn Verma of Rediff said, \\"The film starts with a big scare that leaves you feeling silly and, slowly, as the momentum picks up, it draws you in. You prepare for the worst, and end up jumping at shadows. Though the climax is a little long-drawn and leaves you with some unanswered questions, it delivers the required punch.\\" According to the Hindustan Times, Kaun enjoys a near cult status today. An English version of the film Who's There was released online in 2014. Even after two decades of the release; Kaun is popular among movie fans who follow thriller-horror genre. The main element that makes this movie alive is the screenplay and characters of it, especially the one played by Urmila Matondkar. Trivia *After Satya, director Ram Gopal Varma collaborated with writer Anurag Kashyap again for the screenplay and story of Kaun. *There are many mysterious elements in the film which remain unsolved. For instance, the murderer of the cat is never known in the film which adds to its suspense even more. Additionally, it was never known how the woman was committing so many murders in an unknown house which belongs to some Mr. Malhotra. All of the mysteries raised great suspense to the overall film. *During the original release in theaters and on television, there were titles that get displayed at the end of the film before the credits roll in. The titles throw some light on the woman's mysterious personality. But later, due to the policy changes in the censor board, the titles were removed from both television and home video releases. The film is now available with the edited version without the titles.

Activities and issues Mosaic tree art by Pavee Point at Mountjoy Square, Dublin According to the 2016 Census, there are 30,987 Irish Travellers in Ireland. Pavee Point functions as a national resource for that community, in addition to those that work with Travellers, by implementing a multidimensional strategy of action.Walsh, Jim and Sarah Craig. \\"Illustrative Examples of Local Partnerships\\". Local Partnerships for Social Inclusion?. Dublin, Ireland: Oak Tree Press, 1998. p. 88. Pavee Point holds non-Travellers accountable for the conditions of Travellers because inaction allows the problems to persist, \\"Non-Travellers have a responsibility to address the various processes which serve to exclude Travellers from participating as equals in society.\\"Introduction. Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. Pavee Point works on local, regional, national, and international levels. The service- oriented programs at Pavee Point are designed to remedy specific issues faced by the travelling community. =Education= According to the 2002 Census, 54.8% of Traveller children don't pursue an education beyond primary school, and their literacy levels are well below those of settled children, across the board.Tables. 2002 Census, Ireland To help change this, Pavee Point established The Parents and Traveller Education project in August 2004. The goals of the project are: to get Traveller parents more involved in their children's school by educating them about the system itself; and to work with the schools to make them more accepting of Traveller parents. As of 2005, Pavee Point has produced an educational DVD to help familiarise parents with the school system, facilitated workshops for parents about getting involved in school, and provided one-on-one support and advice.Education. Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. =Health= * Local level: Primary Care for Traveller's Project (PCTP)Local. Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. In 1994, Pavee Point joined with the Eastern Health Board to form a pilot health initiative; the Primary Care for Traveller's Project. Four years later, the project expanded from Finglas to include Blanchardstown in its radius of service. The goals of the project were to raise awareness about the good health for Travellers, to teach Traveller women basic health-related skills, to facilitate dialogue between Travellers and the health service providers, and to call attention to problems in healthcare distribution for Travellers. To make healthcare more amenable to Travellers, Pavee Point created health informational materials with Traveller-friendly imagery and began educating hospitals and universities about the health issues that Travellers are facing. * Regional level: Traveller Health Unit (THU)Regional. Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. For the first time, in 1995 a report found that the health needs of Travellers were not being met. To help bridge the gap between Traveller needs and healthcare provisions, the National Traveller Health Advisory Committee was established. * National Level: National Traveller Health Advisory Committee (NTHAC)National. Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. Pavee Point is a representative for Traveller health interests as a member of NTHAC and made extensive contributions to the formation of the National Traveller Health Strategy. =Mediation= Pavee Point began offering mediation services in 1999 with the hope of mending the relationship between the Traveller and settled communities, and to foster stronger ties within the travelling community as well. Mediation provides a non-violent setting for opposing parties to confront conflict in a civil manner. Participation in mediation is a voluntary act that operates best if there is an understanding of mutual respect. Each party is given the opportunity to clarify his/her problem, identify needs, and explore possible solutions before reaching an agreement. The most common issues among Travellers that may be resolved through mediation are: conflicts over the management of housing sites, unauthorised encampments, and illegal dumping.Diacon, Diane. \\"Promoting understanding\\". Out in the Open: Providing accommodation, promoting understanding and recognizing rights of Gypsies and Travellers. Building and Social Housing Foundation, 2007. p. 29−33. =Community development= In 2005, Pavee Point hosted Traveller Focus Week from 3–10 December 2005. The theme of the week was recognition, because the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority by the Irish government and the rest of the world, is such a critical issue for the community. Events included a photo contest, a concert, a roundtable discussion on equality, and the launch of the parental education DVD, Pavee Parents Primary Concerns, among others. 2,000 participated in the events throughout the week.Community Development Pavee Point Annual Report 2003-05 =Employment= Programs to promote and assist the employment of Travellers, especially in public service, are of critical importance to Pavee Point.Harvey, Brian. Working for Change: A Guide to Influencing Policy in Ireland. Combat Poverty Agency, 2008. The Civil Service Traveller Internship Program was organised by PP in 2005 to introduce Travellers to the public service work experience. The program entails a six- month paid internship with a government department or agency for approximately 20 Travellers. International involvement Pavee Point's decision to advocate for Travellers rights internationally, rather than in Ireland, is a definitive feature of its operations. As phrased in the 2003–05 tri-annual report: \\"Our rationale for this work is that many of the problems that Irish Travellers face, such as racism, exist outside of the country and are unlikely to be resolved at a national level alone.\\"International Work Pavee Point Annual Report 03-05. Working internationally has allowed PP to network with other minority groups, learn new strategies for activism, and to get Traveller rights issues into the current dialogue on international human rights. * In 2003, the Council of Europe invited PP to attend two conferences as an expert on and representative of the Traveller community. At the second seminar on 'Challenges for Cooperation and Integration between Roma and Travellers and local and Regional Authorities', Pavee Point representatives were given the opportunity to speak to an international audience. * In 2004, the European Roma and Traveller ForumEuropean Roma and Travellers Forum. European Roma and Travellers Forum www.ertf.org was formed after 10 years of careful deliberation. PP is a founding member of the forum, and is represented by Martin Collins. Along with two other delegates, Collins will form the official voice for the Irish Traveller ethnic group at a European level. * in 2004, PP submitted a Shadow Report to UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The Irish government had already sent a report of its own that included the fact that it would not acknowledge Travellers as an ethnic minority group.Recognizing Travellers as an Ethnic Group. National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. Pavee Point contested the Irish Government's refusal to recognise Travellers as an ethnic group. In their CERD report, PP described the government's actions as closed-minded and reprehensible- and not without negative ramifications for settled-Traveller relations. In 2005, Pavee Point was represented in CERD's hearing on Ireland.Irish Travellers and Roma: Shadow Report.

It was also the centre of the Koolama Incident, an alleged mutiny resulting from these attacks. General description Koolama was built in 1937, by Harland and Wolff of Glasgow, Scotland for the State Shipping Service, at a cost of £250,000, and was registered at Fremantle. Her official displacement was 4,068 tons (4133 tonnes), she was 348 feet (106 m) long, with a beam of 54 feet, and had diesel engines driving two propellers. Koolama could accommodate about 200 passengers and 90 crew, 500 live cattle and had a freezer hold for cargo such as meat. She was used mostly for passenger and general freight transport on coastal routes in Western Australian (WA) waters. Koolama is sometimes confused with another State Ships vessel of a similar design, Koolinda. Service history The ship's master, Captain Jack Eggleston, his officers, and crew travelled to Glasgow in early 1938 to take delivery of the ship, and after successful sea trials she sailed for Australia on 7 April. The ship entered service on 23 May, sailing north from Fremantle to Darwin, calling at various ports in between. =War service and the \\"Koolama incident\\"= In January 1942, following the outbreak of war with Japan, Koolama carried members of the ill-fated 8th Division and their equipment to Ambon and West Timor, in Netherlands East Indies. On the return voyage she carried Dutch refugees to Darwin. On 10 February, Koolama – still under Captain Eggleston – sailed from Fremantle, bound for Darwin with Australian Army personnel and equipment, as well as some convicts on work release and regular civilian passengers. Although the soldiers on board were armed only with rifles, the ship carried a 50 mm (1.97 in) gun on its rear poop deck, which was intended for use against submarines and could not be aimed above level for anti- aircraft purposes. However, Koolama was carrying Vickers 0.303-inch machine guns mounted on each side of the bridge. At 11.30 am on 20 February 1942, a day after the first Japanese air raids on Darwin, Koolama was off the coast of the Kimberley, when it was attacked by a Japanese Kawanishi H6K flying boat near Cape Londonderry. Three or four bombs landed near the ship but caused no damage. Eggleston reported the attack by radio and continued towards Darwin. At 1.30pm, three Kawanishis – led by Lieutenant Commander Tsunaki Yonehara – attacked the ship again, over a period of 30 minutes. Three bombs hit the ship.Helbig, (2003) One 60 kg (132 lb) bomb, dropped from a height of 800 m (2,625 ft), went through wooden decking, struck a civilian passenger, Raymond Theodore \\"Bluey\\" Plummer, glancing blows to his head, arm and foot, before falling into an engine room and exploding. Plummer was facing down and a tailfin on the bomb struck the back of his head, peeling away the scalp as far as his nose, along with a piece of his skull. Although Plummer's brain was partly exposed, he remained alive, albeit unconscious. The bomb also caused injuries to his arm and foot. Two other passengers were also injured. Koolama was severely damaged. Later that afternoon, with the ship taking water at the stern, and its steering and internal communications out of action, Eggleston decided to beach the ship in Rulhieres Bay (later known as Koolama Bay). He sent an SOS by radio and ordered that the ship be evacuated by lifeboat, but did not officially abandon Koolama. The following day, as the evacuees awaited help in an inhospitable area of mangroves, inhabited by many saltwater crocodiles, Japanese planes attacked again, albeit without effect. Eggleston and his first officer, Ken Reynolds – who was also a qualified ship's master – disagreed regarding the best course of action. The captain wanted to refloat Koolama, using the high tide, and head back to the small port of Wyndham; he believed that the ship could pump out enough water to survive 48 hours at sea, and could be steered with its engines. However, Reynolds believed that Koolama should be abandoned. The crew split into two factions along these lines. Because of this, some people would later accuse Reynolds of mutiny. While they waited for assistance, the crew undertook some repairs to the stern. On 25 February, a lugger crewed by Benedictine priests and Aboriginal people from the nearest settlement, Drysdale River Mission (later known as Kalumburu), almost 100 kilometres (80 mi) away, arrived to take the sick, wounded and women passengers to the mission, a journey of 24 hours. After enduring a week on the shore, most of the passengers and crew members began to walk to Drysdale River, guided by a priest. By 1 March, all possible on-site repairs has been completed and the badly damaged Koolama, with Eggleston, 18 crew members, three civilian passengers and two military personnel, was refloated and set off for Wyndham. The bomb damage, including blown rivets, was worsened by the stress of movement, and as Koolama approached the port on the morning of 2 March, about 24 hours after leaving Rulhieres Bay, its pumps could no longer keep up with the inflow of water. By 7pm, Eggleston and his party had unloaded most of the cargo, including army vehicles and other military equipment. The pumps were run throughout the night and unloading resumed at 6.00 am. However, the pumps were becoming clogged with mud and the ship was still taking water. Just after 7.00 am on 3 March, eight Japanese Zero fighters, led by Toshitada Kawazoi, made a strafing attack on Wyndham. This air raid caused no apparent damage to the Koolama, but Eggleston and his crew remained on shore for the rest of the day, in case follow-up raids occurred. By 4pm, Koolama was down at the stern and listing to starboard. At about 4.45 pm the ship rolled onto its side in the shallow water. It was written off. Aftermath Meanwhile, some of the crew and passengers at Rulhieres Bay were rescued by flying boat, and arrived in Broome on 3 March, just after a devastating air raid on the town. A further 19 men had to wait for the return of the mission lugger. On 5 March, Plummer was flown from Drysdale River to Darwin, for more intensive medical treatment. He underwent more than 40 operations resulting from his injuries, but lived until the early 1980s. One man had died while walking to Drysdale River and he was buried at the mission. He was the only fatality resulting from the attacks on the Koolama. Later in 1942, a Marine Board of Inquiry exonerated all the crew members of any wrongdoing. Both Eggleston and Reynolds had long careers, including positions as Marine Superintendents, with the State Shipping Service. In 1947, an attempt to refloat Koolama was unsuccessful. The hull was raised the following year, albeit only to clear Wyndham harbour. It was towed out to sea and scuttled.  Documentary  * 2003 - Malice or Mutiny: The Koolama Incident (dir.

It is more often regarded as an iconic landmark than as an advertisement. Commercially, it is considered to be the premier billboard in Sydney and is the largest billboard in the Southern Hemisphere. It is commonly, though incorrectly, assumed to be heritage-listed.Search of listings under the NSW Heritage Act, plus other NSW state and local listings, via http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/heritagesearch.aspx, and using \\"Darlinghurst Road\\" as the only search criteria, produces only a local government-listed Woolworths building. The sign The Coca-Cola billboard The Coca-Cola sign is located above the intersection of William Street and Darlinghurst Road and is attached to the Zenith Residences, formerly the Millenium Hotel and Kingsgate Hotel. The sign is often referred to as The Gateway to the Cross, because it is prominently visible from all of William Street, which is the principal road leading to Kings Cross from the Sydney CBD: also, one must pass directly in front of the sign when entering Kings Cross from either William Street or Darlinghurst Road, the two main access roads. The billboard is made up of two parts: on the right, the famous red and white neon sign, and on the left the more modern, flex-faced sign. In total the sign is 41 metres in length and 13 metres in height, with the right sign being slightly larger at 21 metres in length. The red and white neon sign is made up of eighty-eight vertical bars of red tubing. It also has 800 fluorescent lamps that are concealed behind reflectors that allow the billboard to project thirteen different patterns. The left part of the billboard is a flex-face style sign and is internally illuminated by approximately 1,000 fluorescent lamps. On 18 April 2008 Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA, the Australian Coca-Cola licensee) purchased the iconic sign. The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) had leased the sign since it was built in 1976. CCA and TCCC agreed to maintain the then-existing leasing arrangements. History In 2008 activists covered the billboard in protest of Chinese policies towards Tibet. The red and white neon billboard was erected in 1974 in its current location whilst the left side of the billboard was a later addition in 1990. In 2004 the billboard for the first time in thirty years advertised a product other than Coca Cola, when the left side of the board advertised the release of Halo 2. On 31 March 2007 the lights on the billboard were intentionally switched off for the first time, in correlation with the inaugural Earth Hour. On 23 April 2008, four activists unfurled a banner over the billboard in protest of Coke’s sponsorship of the Olympic torch relay at Kings Cross. The banner read: \\"Enjoy Compassion. Always Tibet. CHINA - TALK TO THE DALAI LAMA\\". All four activists were arrested. In 2015, the Coke sign was removed to make way for an upgraded Coke sign. The lettering was auctioned off, raising $100,700 for the Wayside Chapel, but the Hyphen between the words was given away via a Facebook contest, and now resides in Lithgow, NSW, as part of a Christmas Light display. http://www.lithgowlights.com/2016.html The new Coca Cola sign was officially turned on, on 15 September 2016.

It is commonly used by oil companies. The rule simply states that for any work that must be done on a section of piping, which involves breaking containment, there must be at least two barriers separating the fluids from the broken area. The purpose behind specifying two barriers is to ensure redundancy. The risk of a total loss of containment is reduced if there are two independent isolations as it is highly improbable they would both fail at the same time. For example, if a section of pipe from a production line leading from a Christmas tree to the process plant, were to need replacement, this area of the piping would need isolation before the offending section was removed or oil would be able to flow freely out of the piping into the environment, causing environmental damage, a health and safety hazard and waste of a precious resource. Under the two barrier rule, there must be two separate isolations between the oil flowing from the well to this area of the piping. The logical barriers in this case would be the production wing valve and the upper master valve. Uncontrolled release of pressure has been the cause of many accidents in the oilfield and so the two barrier rule is considered very important for increasing safety.

Born in Kensington, London, England, the second son of Sir Cecil Edmund Lister-Kaye, 4th Baronet, Lister-Kaye was educated at Eton College where he played in Fowler's match in 1910. He then went up to Trinity College, Oxford. He was a rather wild left-arm swing bowler who narrowly missed his blue as a freshman in 1912. He played for the Yorkshire Second Eleven in 1913. For York C.C. in 1914, he took 7 for 19 runs against Hull C.C. and also had some successful days for the Yorkshire Gentlemen. Lister-Kaye played for Oxford in his second year, without winning a blue, and his games for Yorkshire came against the West Indies and Leicestershire.

In mathematics, he is noted for discovering and classifying the semiregular polytopes in dimensions four and higher. Biography Thorold Gosset was born in Thames Ditton, the son of John Jackson Gosset, a civil servant and statistical officer for HM Customs,UK Census 1871, RG10-863-89-23 and his wife Eleanor Gosset (formerly Thorold). He was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge as a pensioner on 1 October 1888, graduated BA in 1891, was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in June 1895, and graduated LLM in 1896. In 1900 he married Emily Florence Wood, and they subsequently had two children, named Kathleen and John.UK Census 1911, RG14-181-9123-19 Mathematics According to H. S. M. Coxeter, A brief account of Gosset and his contribution to mathematics is given on page 164. after obtaining his law degree in 1896 and having no clients, Gosset amused himself by attempting to classify the regular polytopes in higher-dimensional (greater than three) Euclidean space. After rediscovering all of them, he attempted to classify the \\"semi-regular polytopes\\", which he defined as polytopes having regular facets and which are vertex-uniform, as well as the analogous honeycombs, which he regarded as degenerate polytopes. In 1897 he submitted his results to James W. Glaisher, then editor of the journal Messenger of Mathematics. Glaisher was favourably impressed and passed the results on to William Burnside and Alfred Whitehead. Burnside, however, stated in a letter to Glaisher in 1899 that \\"the author's method, a sort of geometric intuition\\" did not appeal to him. He admitted that he never found the time to read more than the first half of Gosset's paper. In the end Glaisher published only a brief abstract of Gosset's results. Gosset's results went largely unnoticed for many years. His semiregular polytopes were rediscovered by Elte in 1912 and later by H.S.M. Coxeter who gave both Gosset and Elte due credit. Coxeter introduced the term Gosset polytopes for three semiregular polytopes in 6, 7, and 8 dimensions discovered by Gosset: the 221, 321, and 421 polytopes. The vertices of these polytopes were later seen to arise as the roots of the exceptional Lie algebras E6, E7 and E8. A new and more precise definition of the Gosset Series of polytopes has been given by Conway in 2008 A new account of Gosset Series is given on pages 411-413.

He died in the decisive battle during the revolt, which subsequently failed. Because of his name, his family might have originated from Nagybuda, Kingdom of Hungary (today in Romania). He lived in the neighbouring village of Diós. The peasant uprising Antal Nagy de Buda lived in Diós, Kolozs county. His family got its name from the village of Nagybuda (today part of Chinteni, Romania) in Transylvania. As a soldier, he took part in the Hussite wars in the Czech Republic, where he first became acquainted with Hussitism and a new kind of fighting style. In Transylvania, the peasants were increasingly taxed by the nobility in the 1430s. King Sigismund's spoilage of money (enforces by law the people to change the coins and made new one with less silver proportion) in particular provoked great uproar and hostility. Bishop György Lépes, moreover, excommunicated the serfs from the church if they refused to pay him decima. Due to the brutal oppression of the nobles, lot of serfs became a follower of Jan Hus(Hussites) in Transylvania. The peasants gathered on Bábolna Hill were joined by Antal Nagy, along with many other little nobles who were also not satisfied. Antal Nagy was then elected leader by the insurgents because he had military experience. The Transylvanian peasant war started. After the peasants' envoys were killed by László Csáki's Transylvanian voivode, Antal Nagy gathered the Hungarian and Romanian peasant armies (and some regular nobles). Having experience of the Hussite style of fighting, he arranged the insurgents in a chariot castle, and at Dés he attacked and defeated the knightly army of the nobles who had marched against them. The nobles were forced to negotiate with the insurgents and their leader. The first treaty of Kolozsmonostor was broken by the nobles as soon as another armed force was gathered. At Apáti, however, the peasants prevailed again, and Antal Budai Nagy marched to Kolozsvár However, despite the victory, the second treary of Kolozsmonostor convention was followed by further clashes by the end of the autumn. There were lot of peasant missed from Antal Nagy's army due to losses and departures. Their main strength, against the Transylvanian army marching against Kolozsvár, gathered the peasant army for another attack. They continued to fight resolutely, but in the end the peasant leader fell. The uprising soon failed, but until the recapture of Kolozsvár by nobility's army on January 8, there were still peasant uprising in Northern Transylvania and Tiszántúl.

History  Historically, there is a man who exemplifies the tenfold virtue of the ruler, namely, King Asoka (304-232 BCE), who ruled India for forty-one years. Initially, the King was a great warrior general, winning many battles, and continued to expand the Indian empire during the first eight years of his reign. After one particularly bloody campaign, the King wandered the sight of his army’s victory, and seeing the carnage all around him, famously cried out, “What have I done?” Following this, he embraced Buddhism, establishing a just kingdom along Buddhist lines and was known as 'Dhammasoka' or \\"Asoka, the holder of dhamma\\". He promoted wildlife protection, banning hunting for sport, built universities, hospitals for people and animals, and constructed irrigation systems for trade and agriculture. The King also renounced the use of violence, ceasing all military campaigns against his neighbors, instead sending monks and nuns abroad to spread the Buddhist Teachings on wisdom and kindness. Indeed, a son and daughter of King Asoka’s who were monk and nun took Buddhism to Sri Lanka, where it remains the predominant faith to this day. This is not to say that he promoted Buddhism at the expense of other religions, however, as he also encouraged tolerance and understanding between different creeds and ethnic groups. King Asoka is remembered by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike as an example of a truly compassionate and just ruler, who lived according to the tenfold virtue of the ruler.Forest Wisdom.

The drives are also referred to as Apple 871 drives in service documentation,Apple Computer Inc.: Lisa schematics, 1981 based on their approximate formatted storage capacity in kilobytes, but are most commonly known by their code name, Twiggy, after the famously thin 1960s fashion model. History In 1978, Apple intended to develop its own FileWare drive mechanism for use in the new Apple III and Apple Lisa business computers being developed. They quickly ran into difficulties which precluded them from being incorporated in the Apple III, which continued to use the earlier Shugart design.Apple and the Floppy Drive Finally, FileWare drives were implemented in the Lisa computer, released on January 19, 1983. The original Macintosh computer was originally intended to implement a Shugart drive, then later, a FileWare drive, before eventually shipping with Sony's 3.5\\" 400k diskette drive. Although Apple planned to make FileWare drives available for the Apple II and Apple III, and announced them under the names UniFile and DuoFile (for single and dual drives, respectively), these products were never shipped.Lisa2 Drive FileWare drives are 5¼-inch double-sided, but are not mechanically compatible with industry-standard diskettes. In a single-sided floppy disk drive, the disk head is opposed by a foam pressure pad. In a normal double-sided floppy disk drive, the top and bottom heads are almost directly opposed to each other. Apple was concerned about head wear, and instead designed the FileWare drive such that the top and bottom heads are on opposite sides of the spindle, and each is opposed by a pressure pad. Since there is only one actuator to move the heads, when one head is near the spindle, the other is near the outer rim of the disk.Apple Computer Inc.: Lisa Hardware Reference Manual, 1983 The drive is approximately the same size as a standard full-height 5¼ inch floppy drive, but does not use the standard mounting hole locations. The electrical interface is completely different from that of standard drives, though conceptually similar to that of the Disk II. Diskette The FileWare diskette has the same overall jacket dimensions of a normal 5¼ inch diskette, but because of the head arrangement, the jacket has non-standard cutouts for the heads, with two sets of cutouts on opposite sides of the spindle hole. The write enable sensor is also in a non-standard location, though most FileWare diskettes were produced without a write protect slot. The jacket had a corner cutout that keyed the diskette to prevent insertion in an incorrect orientation, and a rectangular hole that the drive could use to latch the diskette in place, preventing removal until the software allowed it. FileWare drives use 62.5 tracks per inch rather than the standard 48 or 96 TPI, and use high flux density (comparable to the later IBM 1.2MB format introduced with the PC/AT). This requires custom high-density media. The coercivity required is similar to that of the 1.2MB format, so it is possible to modify the jacket of 1.2MB diskettes for use in a FileWare drive. Format The disk format uses group coded recording (GCR) in a manner very similar to that of the Disk II. The drive contains circuitry to allow software control over the motor speed, which is used to maintain near constant flux transition rate on all tracks, so that more data can be stored on the outer tracks. Each physical sector stores 512 data bytes and 20 tag bytes. Each side of the disk had 46 tracks, and the number of sectors per track varies from 15 to 22. This results in 851 sectors per side, or a total capacity of 871,424 bytes. The Lisa Hardware Manual doesn't explicitly state the total number of sectors, but page 173 states that there are 4 tracks of 22 sectors, 7x21, 6x20, 6x19, 6x18, 7x16, and 4x15. The controller uses similar circuitry to the Disk II controller, but runs at twice the clock rate. The controller uses a dedicated MOS 6504 microprocessor; in the Lisa this is on the system I/O card, and for the UniFile/DuoFile products, it is on an interface card that plugs into a peripheral expansion slot. The Lisa 2/10 and Macintosh XL I/O card use the IWM controller chip to replace the TTL chips of the earlier design. Reliability In the field, the FileWare drives prove to be somewhat unreliable. In early 1984, Apple introduced the Lisa 2, which uses a single 3½ inch Sony floppy drive in place of the two FileWare drives of the original Lisa. A free upgrade was offered to Lisa 1 owners.Apple's Twiggy Disks References Category:Apple Inc. hardware Category:Computer-related introductions in 1983 Category:Floppy disk drives ","title":"Apple FileWare"},{"id":"10722911","text":"A microbrand is a small-scale brand recognized only in a certain geographic location, or by consumers in a specific micromarket or niche market.

Legacy Zammit's scientific approach to archaeology further enhanced his international reputation. A permanent display of some of his findings may be viewed at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. The main Assembly Hall of the University of Malta bears Zammit's name. He also appears on a commemorative 1973 Maltese pound coin. Zammit signed most of his works with his initials T. Z.p. 110.

Super Jumbo mortgages are made available to borrowers whose loan requirements exceed the guidelines commonly referred to as Jumbo loan limits, which apply to mortgage loan amounts in excess of the FNMA / FHLMC (\\"Fannie Mae\\" or \\"Freddie Mac\\") conforming loan limits of 417,000. Unlike Jumbo loan limits, the super jumbo mortgage category is not directly defined, controlled, or regulated by any of these aforementioned agencies. Instead, mortgage lenders internally and independently define their own parameters and criteria for what defines a Super Jumbo mortgage. The minimum loan amount for some lenders to classify a loan as Super Jumbo ranges from $500,000 (with the exception of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands where jumbo loan limits on single family residences are $625,000, or 50% higher) to $1,500,000, with maximum super jumbo loan amounts generally running into the $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 range. __TOC__ Risk Super Jumbo Mortgages present an increased risk to the lender in direct correlation with the size of the loan, substantially more than conforming mortgages. The increased risk of Super Jumbo mortgages is firstly due to the lack of \\"agency\\" support for these loans, effectively reducing the available pool of investors and insurers for all jumbo mortgages by an order of magnitude. Mortgages in excess of 1 million dollars have an even smaller secondary market of investors, and super jumbo mortgages in excess of 2 million dollars frequently require extensive \\"sourcing\\" of private investors prior to funding due to minimal institutional investor coverage. The complex nature of funding these loans requires the use of Super Jumbo mortgage specialists, whose compensation requirements are generally too prohibitive for retail banks and mass market lenders to accommodate outside of niche geographic areas, leaving much of the business to private concerns. Private Mortgage Bankers generally focus primarily on doing fewer, but larger deals, and thus have a familiarity with how and where to get these larger loans done. Securitization of Super Jumbo mortgages has not met with the same success as conventional jumbo mortgages, although work in this area is ongoing throughout the financial community. The underlying lack of liquidity for Super Jumbo Mortgage securities is compounded by a reduction in lending capacity for the institutions which must service these larger loans; as they lack a ready market for secondary sale the loans remain \\"on the books\\" of the lender, tying up capital in servicing that would otherwise be invested again. The assets against which super jumbo mortgages are secured are primarily classified as \\"luxury\\" residential real estate, a segment which is highly prone to market volatility in gross dollar terms. Luxury homes also require substantially more time to market in the event of foreclosure. Mitigants In response to the multiple layered risk of writing Super Jumbo mortgages, lenders utilize a few common mitigants in super jumbo mortgage underwriting to reduce their downside exposure. Key Super Jumbo mortgage mitigants include: =LTV= Borrowers can expect significantly lower Loan To Value or \\"LTV\\" limits on Super Jumbo mortgages, particularly above and beyond $1,500,000. Typical Super Jumbo mortgage LTV maximums range from 80% to as low as 50% depending on loan amount and credit scoring. While 100% or \\"No Money Down\\" financing was available up to $2,000,000 until February 2007 from several of the leading Super Jumbo Mortgage Lenders, as of this writing none are currently able to fund LTV ratios higher than 90% for loans in excess of $1,500,000, regardless of credit scoring. =Credit Scoring= credit score requirements for Super Jumbo Mortgages have become increasingly relaxed since 2002, but credit score standards are still somewhat more stringent for Super Jumbo borrowers than they are for their conforming counterparts. The biggest difference for Super Jumbo mortgage borrowers is the lack of subprime Super Jumbo mortgage programs, meaning that for borrowers with credit scores below 620 who are seeking a Super Jumbo mortgage refinance, the only option might be \\"Super Jumbo Hard Money\\" lenders, a category of private lending catering specifically to the needs of high-net-worth individuals with temporarily blemished credit scores, bankruptcy issues, or foreclosure problems. =Loan Purpose Guidelines= Generally Speaking, lenders will allow borrowers to refinance or purchase a home utilizing a Super Jumbo mortgage, but refinance guidelines for these loans generally require lower LTVs than purchase money. Borrowers wishing to \\"Cash Out\\" in a super jumbo mortgage refinance can expect limits not only to LTV but also to gross cash proceeds from the transaction. Cash out refinancing is a very popular use of Super Jumbo mortgages, as it allows individuals to \\"take profits\\" from appreciated real estate with minimal tax consequences. Some lenders do allow for unlimited cash out on Super Jumbo mortgage refinance transactions, but their number is declining in step with the broader mortgage markets. =Interest Rate= While Interest Rates are rarely the focal point of a typical Super Jumbo mortgage borrower's shopping list (most focus on cash flow and tax benefits), lenders routinely charge higher interest rates on super jumbo mortgage products than they would for a borrower with similar qualifying criteria in a conventional jumbo loan, in large part to account for their risk and reduction of liquidity. Below $1,000,000, super jumbo mortgage rates are generally within 50 basis points (half of a percent) of an equivalent jumbo mortgage interest rate, but above $2,000,000 rates can be 1% to 2% higher or more. =Multiple Appraisals & Reviews= Due to the difficulty of setting market values for luxury homes, it is not unusual for super jumbo mortgage lenders to require 2 full appraisals at a minimum for properties valued at $1,500,000 or more. Should the subject property be unique, or comparable sales be difficult to obtain for the purpose of deriving value, additional field review appraisals, desk review appraisals, and broker price opinions may be ordered to substantiate the property's value. This is a significant concern for the lender as the asset in which they are taking a security interest must have a reasonable value to justify their risk and associated premiums. Amortization Types While historically super jumbo mortgages were primarily short term adjustable rate principal & interest mortgages, interest only options and payment cap or negative amortization loans (currently called \\"Option ARM\\" mortgages) were introduced to the category in the early 1980s to counteract typical 12% rates of the time. While 30-year fixed rate mortgages are available in the super jumbo category, they do not represent the majority of super jumbo mortgages. 3/1 ARM, 5/1 ARM, 7/1 ARM and 10/1 ARM Adjustable Rate Mortgages are more popular among super jumbo mortgage applicants than with the general public, but the greatest increase in originations as a category has been so called \\"exotic\\" Super Jumbo Mortgages. Offering interest only and negative amortization features, these loans allow borrowers to choose a lower payment option than a conventional principal & interest mortgage, often 10 to 20% lower in the case of interest only amortization and up to 50% lower or more in the case of deferred interest options. Trends Due to the unconventional requirements of many super jumbo mortgage applicants, the popularity of unconventional mortgage programs amongst the wealthy is understandable. The popularity in particular of cash flow option ARM loans with super jumbo mortgage applicants is due in large part to the difference in perception of negative amortization in the context of their primary residence not being an asset but a liability. When home equity is substantial as required by the more stringent LTV requirements of super jumbo mortgage underwriting, negative amortization allows a borrower to extract more of the cash locked in the home's equity than would otherwise be possible, short of selling the property, due to the ability to defer interest above and beyond the Loan To Value stipulated on the note. In a conventional mortgage with principal and interest or interest only amortization, the borrower would be required to take out a second mortgage or line of credit to accomplish the same goal, but CLTV guidelines from most super jumbo lenders preclude the use of most of these products for this purpose. This is not to say that second mortgages and lines of credit are uncommon in super jumbo lending, in fact quite the opposite is true, but \\"piggyback\\" or \\"80/20\\" transactions which are common in conforming and jumbo loan financing are not as prevalent. Another popular application for the use of negative amortization loans by super jumbo mortgage borrowers is to shift as much of their taxable income to long term capital gains as possible by taking advantage of the lower monthly carrying costs and the ability to make lump sum payments at annual or semi-annual intervals. Super Jumbo Option ARM mortgages are also available in hybrid form, with fixed rate and fixed payment periods of 3, 5, 7 or 10 years, although they are relatively new on the super jumbo mortgage scene and not necessarily available to 8-figure loan amounts ($10 Million and up). Super Jumbo mortgage lending is a niche activity, not engaged in directly by most consumer focused banks. The preponderance of Super Jumbo lending is arranged by mortgage companies who specialize in financing these multimillion-dollar transactions with the help of investment banks and private mortgage capital sources. =Effects of Recent Events= Recent events constraining liquidity, securitization, and demand in the capital markets for structured debt securities have severely impacted the ability of conventional lenders to make loans larger than the Fannie Mae conforming loan limit ($417,000 for a single family residence in most states). This is due primarily to the inability of most mortgage originators to sell or otherwise deliver large loans to investors. Unable to sell, the originating lender must then retain and service the loan utilizing their existing capital. The net effect has been an overall reduction in the Loan To Value permissible in a traditional super jumbo mortgage and an increase in the level of income documentation required for such large mortgages by comparison to the period from 2003 to June 2007, during which time the capital markets were willing and able to purchase these securities. The current constraints are leading mortgagors (homeowners seeking super jumbo mortgages) to make larger cash down payments to make up for the reduction in leverage currently being afforded, and a resurgence in the utilization of mortgages from private banks and other non-traditional and non- MBS lenders. In response to the tighted lender guidelines for loans over $1,000,000, many borrowers are using specialty mortgage brokers to assist with these unique loans.

It was banned in 1960 by President Sukarno for supporting the PRRI rebellion. Background In 1909, a trade organization called the Islamic Trading Association () was established in Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies to protect the interests of batik traders in the face of competition from ethnic Chinese merchants. In 1912, this became the Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union), and was headed by western-educated Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto. Although it began as a non-political organization, it began to speak out against injustice and poverty. By 1918, it had 450,000 members. Communist influence within it grew, but so did that of the reformist Islamic Muhammadiyah organization, which was anti-communist. In 1920, Muhammadiyah merged into Sarkat Islam. In 1923, Tjokroaminoto moved to expel communists from the organization at the SI Congress, and established the Islamic Union Party ( - PSI), which adopted a policy of non-collaboration with the Dutch. In 1929 the party was renamed the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII). The next few years saw splits within the party, worsened by the death of Tjokroaminoto in 1937. In September 1937, Muhammadiyah and the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama established the Supreme Islamic Council of Indonesia (MIAI) an umbrella group for Islamic organizations. Following their 1942 invasion of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese authorities banned the PSII, But allowed the MIAI to continue. However, it became dominated by former PSII members, so it in turn was dissolved in 1943. In November the Japanese established an organization called the Council of Indonesian Muslim Associations (Masyumi) in an attempt to control Islam in Indonesia. It too included Muhammadiyah and the Nahdlatul Ulama. However Muslims resented the attempt to use them as tools of the Japanese, and were especially angered by the obligation to bow towards Tokyo, rather than Mecca. However, the new organization became highly politicized and establish a network across the country. Post-independence period Following the Indonesian Declaration of Independence, on 7 November 1945 a new organization called Masyumi was formed. The founders wanted to take advantage of the organization's fame and structure, but there was considerable discussion as to whether to retain the name, due to its association with the Japanese occupiers. Its membership included key figures from the wartime Masyumi such as Hasyim Asy'ari and Wahid Hasyim, the PSII and non-political Islamic organizations such as the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama and the modernist Muhammadiyah. The main leaders were Mohammad Natsir, Mohammad Roem, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, Jusuf Wibisono and Abu Hanafi. Its chief aims were the achievement of Indonesian independence and the establishment of a state governed on Islamic principles. It was strongly anti-communist. Along with the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and the Socialist Party of Indonesia (PSI), it played a dominant role in Indonesian politics from 1945 to 1949. Two Masjumi members, including Natsir, served in the cabinet appointed in November 1945, while 35 Masyumi members were appointed to the Central Indonesian National Committee, and four to its Working Committee. Masjumi members subsequently served in the first and second Hatta cabinets and in the cabinet of the short- lived United States of Indonesia In April 1947, the PSII left Masyumi following disagreements with the leadership, particularly Natsir. Liberal Democracy era There were two main factions within the party. The first, led by Natsir, attracted support from the younger generation who had participated in the Indonesian national Revolution and from the non-Javanese membership. The second faction, headed by Soekiman Wirjosandjojo was supported by ethnic Javanese members, and had closer links with the Nahdlatul Ulama, the PNI leadership and President Sukarno. The party as a whole had more support from non-urban areas of Indonesia. By 1950, Masyumi was considered the largest political party in Indonesia. On the basis of this, it was awarded 49 seats ,the largest number, in the 232-seat legislature, the People's Representative Council when this was formed following the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia in August. In the same month, Sukarno asked Natsir to form a cabinet. Natsir attempted to negotiate with the second-largest party, the PNI, but was unsuccessful, and in September announced the formation of his cabinet with support from the PSI and other smaller parties. However, this cabinet lasted less than seven months, falling in March 1951 after losing support from the smaller parties and parliament. It was followed by two Masyumi-PNI coalition cabinets, the first from April 1951 to February 1952 with Masyumi figure Soekiman as Prime Minister (but with no representation from the Natsir faction) and the next (April 1952 - June 1953) led by Wilopo from the PNI, with a Masjumi deputy prime minister, Prawoto Mangkusasmito. Shortly after the Wilopo cabinet took office, the Nahdlatul Ulama began the process of withdrawing from Masjumi following protracted disputes, including over the cabinet's refusal to reappoint key NU figure Wahid Hasyim to the post of religious affairs minister. The NU decided at its congress in 1952 to become an independent political party. This split damaged the standing of the Masyumi and its claim to be the sole party for Indonesia's Muslims. President Sukarno at a 1954 Masyumi convention A pamphlet released by Masyumi for the 1955 election Elections had originally scheduled for 1946. Many parties were worried that Masyumi would emerge as an outright winner and tried to delay the vote, but in April 1953, an election law was finally enacted scheduling elections for parliament for September 1955, and for the Constitutional Assembly for December 1955.. Masyumi came second in the legislative election. It won 7,903,886 votes, representing 20.9% of the popular vote, resulting in 57 seats in parliament. Masyumi was popular in modernist Islamic regions such as West Sumatra, Jakarta, and Aceh. 51.3% of Masyumi's vote came from Java, but Masyumi was the dominant party for regions outside Java, and it established itself as the leading party for the one third of people living outside Java. The end of the party In the mid-1950s, the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebellion broke out. In November 1957, senior Masyumi figures Mohammad Natsir, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara and Burhanuddin Harahap, joined the rebels in the Sumatran city of Padang. The Masyumi Party refused to condemn their actions, which damaged the party's image. In 1960, President Sukarno passed a law allowing him to ban parties whose ideologies conflicted with those of the state, or whose members rebelled against the state, and he subsequently used this law to ban Masyumi on 17 August 1960. Following the collapse of the rebellion, Natsir and Sjafruddin, along with other senior Masjumi figures, were jailed in January 1962. Successor organizations Following the banning, Masyumi members and followers established the Crescent Star Family () to campaign for Islamic shariah law and teachings. An attempt was made to reestablish the party following the fall of Sukarno, but this was not permitted. However, the government eventually permitted the establishment of the Muslim party of Indonesia (Parmusi) in 1968, but refused to allow former Masyumi members to lead the party. Meanwhile, in 1967, Mohammad Natsir and a few of his close associates, including Mohammad Roem, established the Indonesian Islamic Propagation Council (DDII), which was based at the former head office of Masyumi. As well as a refuge for former Masyumi supporters, the organization campaigned against \\"Christianization\\" of Indonesia and appealed for support from the lower social classes. After the fall of Suharto in 1998, another attempt was made to revive the Masyumi name, but eventually Masyumi followers and others established the Crescent Star Party, which contested the legislative elections in 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014. Two other parties, known as the Masyumi Party, established by former Masyumi member Mawardi Noor, and the New Masyumi party, contested the 1999 election, but won only 0.22% and 0.14% of the vote respectively, which was enough for the former to be awarded one seat in the legislature. Neither party contested subsequent elections.

In Middle English and early Early Modern English, it was used as a both informal second-person plural and formal honorific, to address a group of equals or superiors or a single superior. While its use is archaic in most of the English-speaking world, it is used in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, Northern England and Cornwall in the United Kingdom, and Ireland to distinguish from the singular \\"you\\".  Confusion with definite article  \\"Ye\\" is also sometimes used to represent an Early Modern English form of the definite article \\"the\\" (pronounced ), such as in \\"Ye Olde Shoppe\\". \\"The\\" was often written \\"EME ye.svg\\" (here the \\"e\\" is written above the other letter to save space but it could also be written on the line). The lower letter is thorn, commonly written þ but which in handwritten scripts could resemble a \\"y\\" as shown. Thus the article The was written Þe and never Ye. The \\"thorn\\" character was supplanted during the later phases of Middle English and the earlier phases of Early Modern English by the modern digraph \\"th\\". Medieval printing presses did not contain the letter thorn so the letter y was substituted owing to its similarity to some medieval scripts, especially later ones. This substituted orthography leads most speakers of Modern English to pronounce definite-article \\"ye\\" as (\\"yee\\"), when the correct pronunciation is (\\"the\\") or . Etymology In Old English, the use of second-person pronouns was governed by a simple rule: addressed one person, addressed two people, and addressed more than two. After the Norman Conquest, which marks the beginning of the French vocabulary influence that characterised the Middle English period, the singular was gradually replaced by the plural as the form of address for a superior and later for an equal. The practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations, respectively, is called the T–V distinction, and in English it is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing kings and other aristocrats in the plural. Eventually, this was generalised, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was believed to be more polite. In French, was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and, to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form was reserved and formal. In Early Modern English, ye functioned as both an informal plural and formal singular second-person nominative pronoun. \\"Ye\\" is still commonly used as an informal plural in Hiberno‐English and Newfoundland English.

The term refers metaphorically to a geological watershed, or drainage divide, which separates adjacent drainage basins. During times of blockage of one of the arteries that supply the watershed area, such as in atherosclerosis, these regions are spared from ischemia by virtue of their dual supply. However, during times of systemic hypoperfusion, such as in disseminated intravascular coagulation or heart failure, these regions are particularly vulnerable to ischemia because they are supplied by the most distal branches of their arteries, and thus the least likely to receive sufficient blood. Watershed areas are found in the brain, where areas are perfused by both the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and in the intestines, where areas are perfused by both the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (i.e., splenic flexure). Additionally, the sigmoid colon and rectum form a watershed zone with blood supply from inferior mesenteric, pudendal and iliac circulations. Hypoperfusion in watershed areas can lead to mural and mucosal infarction in the case of ischemic bowel disease. When watershed stroke occurs in the brain, it produces unique focal neurologic symptoms that aid clinicians in diagnosis and localization. For example, a cerebral watershed area is situated in the dorsal prefrontal cortex; when it is affected on the left side, this can lead to transcortical motor aphasia.

The Sugarlands is a valley in the north-central Great Smoky Mountains, located in the Southeastern United States. Formerly home to a string of small Appalachian communities, the valley is now the location of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park headquarters and the Sugarlands Visitor Center. Lying just south of Gatlinburg, the Sugarlands is one of the park's most popular access points. The Sugarlands area stretches roughly from Grapeyard Ridge and Roaring Fork in the east to the slopes of Sugarland Mountain to the west.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 298–299. Mount Le Conte rises 5,000 feet above the valley to the south and southeast. The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River, its source high in the mountains, slices through the Sugarlands, draining much of the valley. When the first Euro-American settlers arrived in the early 19th century, they named the valley after the many sugar maple trees growing in the area at the time.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5. Syrup was made from the sap in these trees and used as a sweetener in the days before the availability of cane sugar. While these trees were cleared by the early settlers, the sugar maple is still common throughout the park.  Geology  The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River in the Sugarlands. The Sugarlands is underlain by a Precambrian sandstone of the Ocoee Supergroup, known specifically as Roaring Fork sandstone.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 33. This rock, like other formations throughout the Appalachian region, was formed from ancient ocean sediments nearly one billion years ago.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 23–27. Erosional forces throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras — especially during the last Ice Age — have carried rocks of various sizes down from boulder fields high up on the surrounding mountain slopes, leaving the valley coated with a bouldery alluvium.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 37–42. Early farmers, having to move these rocks in order plant crops, stacked them up to make crude stone walls, many of which remain today.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), introduction.  History  In Cherokee lore, the Sugarlands was part of the area known as \\"Walasi'yi\\", or \\"Frog place\\". Walasi'yi included Mount Le Conte and Bull Head, as well as \\"the ridge extending into Sevier County, Tennessee, between the Middle and West forks of Little Pigeon River.\\"James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 545. In the legend \\"Aganunitsi and the Uktena,\\" the Shawano medicine man, Aganunitsi, in exchange for his freedom, seeks out the great serpent, Uktena, in hopes of snatching a magical jewel from its forehead. After searching the surrounding mountains, Aganunitsi found his way to Walasi'yi: > Going still south to Walasi'yi, the Frog place, he found a great frog > squatting in the gap, but when the people who came to see it were frightened > like the others and ran away from the monster he mocked at them for being > afraid of a frog and went on to the next gap.James Mooney, Myths of the > Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, > 1972), 299. = Early pioneers = John Ownby Cabin, built in 1860 The first European settlers arrived in the area around 1800, settling in the vicinity of what would eventually become Gatlinburg. Richard Reagan and William \\"Black Bill\\" Ogle — children of these early settlers — farmed land along Mill Creek (now LeConte Creek) in the eastern half of the Sugarlands.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 299. William Trentham would homestead in the Fighting Creek area, where the Sugarlands Visitor Center now stands. In subsequent decades, three communities developed in the Sugarlands valley-- the Forks-of-the-River and Fighting Creek communities in the vicinity of what is now the Sugarlands Visitor Center, and the Sugarlands community proper, which lay further to the south, between the two \\"Quiet Walkways\\" opposite the Huskey Gap Trail and the Chimney picnic area.Gladys Trentham Russell, Call Me Hillbilly (Alcoa, Tenn.: Russell Publishing Company, 1974), 7. Most of the inhabitants still living in the Sugarlands when the park was formed were descended from these early settlers.Gladys Trentham Russell, Call Me Hillbilly (Alcoa, Tenn.: Russell Publishing Company, 1974), 66. For much of the 19th Century, Sugarlanders lived in log cabins. The typical mountain cabin consisted of one room, 16' × 20', constructed of notched logs and puncheon floors. A chimney — usually made of slate and clay — rose along one wall. A lone window was on the wall opposite the chimney. Around 1900, modern frame houses slowly started replacing the log cabins.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 5–6. A standard farm in the Sugarlands consisted of the cabin or house and a small vegetable garden, all of which was surrounded by a paling fence, and several outbuildings. A smokehouse and woodshed would likely be found near the kitchen, and a springhouse would straddle a nearby spring. Other likely outbuildings included barns, corn cribs (often affixed to the barns), chicken coops, and toolsheds. There were at least five gristmills in the Sugarlands, the largest belonging to Caleb Trentham.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community of Sevier County (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 6. The tubwheel-powered mill of Noah \\"Bud\\" Ogle still stands today at Cherokee Orchard. =The Civil War= Cole Cemetery, with a Union supporter buried near a Confederate soldier Like much of Southern Appalachia, the U.S. Civil War proved devastating for the Sugarlands. The mountain communities of East Tennessee (most of which were pro-Union) were especially vulnerable, as they were easy targets for Confederate raiders from North Carolina.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 136. During the war, Will Thomas — a Confederate colonel and later Cherokee chief — made improvements to the Oconaluftee Turnpike to allow Confederate marauders easier access to Sevier County.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 324. The Sugarlands would have been among the first communities approached along this road heading north from Chimney Tops. Early in the war, Thomas' forces ascended the turnpike and occupied Gatlinburg. Thomas erected a small fort on Burg Hill in hopes of protecting salt peter mines at Alum Cave, along the northern slopes of Mount Le Conte. He was forced to withdraw, however, when a Union relief force threatened to surround the fort.Lucinda Ogle, Jerry Wear (editor), Sugarlands: A Lost Community in Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 57. =The late 19th and early 20th centuries= The Alex Cole Cabin, formerly located in the Sugarlands, now situated along the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail As small farms in the Sugarlands recovered from the Civil War, some began growing enough excess crops to sell or trade. The more prosperous farmers opened small general stores, which were often located in the store owner's house or a room attached to the house. The stores sold flour, meal, meat, soda, salt, coffee, tobacco, snuff, and castor oil. The stores also bought (or traded for) chickens, eggs, honey, ginseng, and furs, which the storeowner would take to Sevierville or Knoxville to trade.Jerry Wear, Sugarlands: A Lost Community in Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 7. Sugarlanders who lived near fords of the Pigeon River had the most lucrative storefronts. Among them were Richard Reason Reagan (1830–1912), who owned a general store near the Sugarland Branch ford, and Alex Cole, who operated a storefront further up the river.Beulah Linn, \\"The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Journal 12, no. 2 (Winter 1996): 3. Around 1900, sawmills began moving into the area to harvest the thick forests of the Smokies. Andrew Huff had erected a sawmill in Gatlinburg, and the Little River Lumber Company began operating in the upper reaches of Little River by 1908. Many Sugarlanders found employment with the latter in Elkmont, which could be reached on foot by crossing Sugarland Mountain via what is now the Huskey Gap Trail.Vic Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 25–26. Bark from trees cut in the Sugarlands was often used for tanning bark. Poverty plagued much of Appalachia in the early 1900s, and the Sugarlands was no exception. Former resident Alie Newman Maples recalled in a poem: > The Sugarlands so clear and clean, > Altho our meals were mighty lean.Alie Newman Maples, \\"Memories of the > Sugarlands,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 3, no. 4 > (September 1977): 3. Tub mill near the Noah Ogle Place In 1912, the Pi Beta Phi women's fraternity established the Pi Beta Phi settlement school in Gatlinburg to combat poverty in the area.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 230. The early Pi Phi teachers' scrapbooks and letters recalled the region's sub-par conditions. One remarked that the Sugarlands was a \\"land of poorer homes\\" than even Gatlinburg, itself selected for the settlement school as the community most in need.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 231. Another recalled a dining experience with a family in the Sugarlands where the food was served on \\"large pail lids\\" while chickens roamed freely through the house. Some of the area children didn't know simple childhood games, and others knew nothing about Christmas.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 236. Regardless, building on the initial successes of the Gatlinburg school, the Pi Phis decided to open a school in the Sugarlands in 1920. The school was located near the old Ransom Sims place, in the vicinity of the Sugarlands Cemetery. While the Sugarlanders were initially suspicious of the Pi Phis' intentions, they eventually welcomed the benefits of the settlement school. Its presence allowed children in Gatlinburg and the Sugarlands to get a basic education, and helped to improve the health and economy of the area.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 236–7. = Moonshining = By 1900, moonshining had become rampant throughout the Smokies.Mary Bell Smith, In the Shadow of the White Rock (Boone, N.C.: Minor's Publishing Company, 1979), 53–54. The dense forest, isolated coves, and ready availability of corn made mountain valleys such as the Sugarlands the perfect places to hide and operate illegal stills. Horace Kephart, a writer who lived on the North Carolina side of the mountains in the early 1900s, described the Sugarlands during this period: > ...a country of ill fame, hidden deep in remote gorges, difficult of access, > tenanted by a sparse population who preferred to be a law unto themselves. > For many a year it had been known on our side as Blockaders' Glory, which is > the same as saying Moonshiners' Paradise, and we all believed it to be fitly > named.Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of > Tennessee Press, 1976), 213. Kephart goes on to give a quasi-factual account of a North Carolina deputy's raid into the Sugarlands to find three fugitives. Kephart describes a cornfield planted on a slope \\"so steep that it must have been dug with mattocks and hoed on hands and knees.\\"Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 216. The residents, while polite, seemed very suspicious of the outsiders, offering no information on the three fugitives and refusing overnight lodging.Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 222–226. The party eventually found a house to take them in for the night, but would return to North Carolina empty-handed.Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 227–228. While moonshining no doubt occurred, Kephart's account is probably exaggerated. Gladys Trentham Russell, who grew up in the Fighting Creek area, estimated that less than 20% of mountain families ever engaged in the practice. Those who consumed moonshine often did so for medicinal purposes. Russell did acknowledge, however, that \\"bootleggers\\" and \\"bad men\\" made the far reaches of the Sugarlands too dangerous for women and children.Gladys Trentham Russell, Call Me Hillbilly (Alcoa, Tenn.: Russell Publishing Company, 1974), 61. = The Coming of the park = Fighting Creek In the 1800s, mountain areas became popular vacation destinations, especially since large urban areas were often wanting for clean air and scenery. Mineral-rich mountain springs were thought to have health-restoring qualities, and the cool air of the higher elevations lured people seeking relief from allergies and hay fever. Colonel W. B. Townsend — the owner of the Little River Lumber Company — began to see the value of creating recreational areas on land that had already been stripped of its wood. In 1909, after the Elkmont area had largely been cleared, the company's train, the Little River Railroad, began offering daily train service from Knoxville to Elkmont in conjunction with Knoxville's Southern Railroad. Tourists also began pouring into Gatlinburg, especially after Andrew Huff opened the Mountain View Hotel in 1916. With the arrival of tourism, Sugarlanders found a wider market for their furs and produce. Sugarlands CCC Camp ruins During this period, many Sugarlanders became legendary as mountain guides. Wiley Oakley (1885–1954), the most famous of these guides, lived on the northern slopes of Mount Le Conte in an area known as the Scratch Britches (now traversed by the Rainbow Falls Trail). Known as the \\"Roamin' Man of the Mountains,\\" Oakley's navigational instincts and extensive knowledge of area plant and animal life and oral traditions would later prove invaluable to park service scientists and anthropologists.Lucinda Oakley Ogle, Jerry Wear (editor), Sugarlands: A Lost community In Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 41–60. When various entities began buying up land for the national park in the 1920s and 1930s, most of the inhabitants of the Sugarlands were displaced. Russell recalls: > Most folks were happy with the prospects of selling their rocky fields and > hillsides for more money than they estimated it to be worth, but some felt > they didn't want to be driven from their old homeplaces at any price.Gladys > Trentham Russell, Call Me Hillbilly (Alcoa, Tenn.: Russell Publishing > Company, 1974), 63. While most Sugarlanders accepted buy-out offers, a few had to be forced out via condemnation suits. Shortly after the formation of the park, the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed a camp along the West Fork which operated from 1933–1942, and would build roads and trails in the area for the park service. The ruins of this camp remain along a bend in the Old Sugarlands Trail.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 302–303. The closing of the CCC camp after World War II was the end of permanent human habitation in the Sugarlands. The forest quickly reclaimed the farmland, and other than a few small mountain cemeteries and the occasional odd clearing or pile of stones, few signs of the former inhabitants remain today.  Present day  A crude property wall in the Sugarlands Gatlinburg entrance to the park The park's two main paved roads — Fighting Creek Gap Road and Newfound Gap Road (US-441) — intersect at the Sugarlands Visitor Center. From this intersection, it is approximately 25 miles to Cades Cove in the Western Smokies, 22 miles to Newfound Gap, and 34 miles to Cherokee, North Carolina. Gatlinburg is just two miles to the north. =Hiking trails= The Old Sugarlands Trail, which is both a hiking and horse trail, connects the Fighting Creek area along Newfound Gap Road with the Cherokee Orchard area. The Bullhead Trail branches off from the Old Sugarlands Trail, crossing the slopes of Bull Head before intersecting the Boulevard Trail atop Mount Le Conte. The Huskey Gap Trail, with its trailhead along Newfound Gap Road a mile past the visitors center, ascends Sugarland Mountain to the Sugarland Mountain Trail. Both the Boulevard Trail and Sugarland Mountain Trail intersect the Appalachian Trail along the crest of the Smokies to the south. Two short trails labelled \\"Quiet Walkways\\" connect Newfound Gap Road with an area of stone ruins along the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. An interpretive loop trail behind the Sugarlands Visitor Center leads past the John Ownby Cabin and the ruins of the Noah McCarter place. Cherokee Orchard Road connects US-441 in Gatlinburg to the Cherokee Orchard and Roaring Fork areas, and passes by the Noah Ogle homestead and the eastern head of the Old Sugarlands Trail. Historical structures The Noah Ogle Place at the northeastern fringe of the valley, the John Ownby Cabin near the Sugarland Visitor Center, and the Alex Cole Cabin now at Roaring Fork are the last remaining extant building from the valley's pre-park communities. Various stone foundations, chimney falls, and crude rock walls remain scattered throughout the valley, giving hints of the layout of the early Appalachian settlements. The farmland, however, has been almost wholly reclaimed by hardwood forest. =John Ownby Cabin= Built in 1860, the John Ownby Cabin is the last surviving structure from the pre-park Forks-of-the-River community. Repaired in 1964, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.Paul Gordon, , 2 August 1973. Retrieved: 2009-09-21. =Noah Ogle Place= The Noah Ogle Place, located along LeConte Creek just south of Gatlinburg, consists of a cabin, barn, and tub mill that were once part of the homestead of Noah \\"Bud\\" Ogle (1863-1913). The cabin is a \\"saddlebag\\" cabin, a design in which two cabins are built around the same chimney, with both cabins consisting of one story and loft. Ogle's barn is the last remaining four-pen barn in the park, consisting of four by pens. Ogle's tub mill, one of the park's two surviving tub mills (the other is at the Alfred Reagan Place at Roaring Fork), consists of a millhouse connected via vertical shaft to a tubwheel turbine. An flume diverts water from LeConte Creek to power the mill.Edward Trout, . May 1977. Retrieved: 27 July 2009. PDF file. =Alex Cole Cabin= The Alex Cole Cabin was originally located on the east bank of the West Fork of Little Pigeon River along the old Indian Gap Road (the \\"Quiet Walkway\\" opposite the Huskey Gap Trailhead along Newfound Gap Road follows this road along the river's west bank),Paul Gordon, , 17 April 1974. Retrieved: 2009-09-21. but was later moved to the Jim Bales Place along the Roaring Motor Nature Trail a few miles to the east.Wear, 82. Like many Sugarlanders, Albert Alexander \\"Alex\\" Cole (1870-1958) and his sons worked for the Little River Lumber Company at Elkmont, making a weekly trek across Sugarland Mountain via what is now the Huskey Gap Trail. During the tourism boom in subsequent decades, Cole was a much sought-after mountain guide due to his knowledge of the Mount Le Conte area. = Rock House = The \\"Rock House,\\" as it is locally known, can be found along a moderately difficult and faint footpath extending roughly a half mile off of the Old Sugarlands Trail. This structure is of unknown origin, although it is likely linked to the CCC camp which was located about a mile away. The Rock House is a stone structure consisting of two rooms and containing artifacts from its time in use. Broken bottles, bed frames, and an old camp stove remain within. The house was not noted in a 1931 USGS topographic map of the area, but does appear in a 1942 USGS topographic map. It has fallen into disrepair and should be explored with caution.

It was developed by the Maxis Business Simulations division of Maxis in 1993. John Hiles, who was the head of the Maxis division, was a lead designer on the project. After the success of SimCity, Maxis received numerous requests from various companies to develop simulations for their industries. After rejecting many requests from other companies, the team eventually agreed to make a prototype of SimRefinery for Chevron: As a commissioned business aid, it was not made available to the public. Until 2020, little information about the game had existed, though Maxis had discussed its creation and some screenshots existed. Most of the assets stayed with Maxis Business Simulations, which Maxis eventually divested in 1996. The division rebranded itself as Thinking Tools Inc. and continued to develop similar corporate simulations, but eventually had to shutter itself, and most of its assets were destroyed. In May 2020, librarian Phil Salvador published a long form investigative article about Maxis Business Simulations and SimRefinery featuring interviews with Hiles and other members of the division. Ars Technica reported on the article, which led to a commentor on the website uncovering a floppy disc that contains an in-development build of the game. The anonymous commenter then uploaded a digital copy to the Internet Archive to work within its DOSBox emulator. This emulated version reveals more details about the \\"gameplay\\" of SimRefinery. The game resembles SimCity with different graphics, disasters, and rules, the former to represent oil tanker ports, petroleum storage and piping systems. The user's role in the simulation was the plant manager of a refinery. One of the things the user learned was about supply and demand and how it affects the financial situation.GVI Security Solutions Inc. (1997). Form 10-K 1996. Retrieved from http://www.secinfo.com/dsVsd.8Ex.htm The game was not defined to be an accurate representation of the chemical processes of a plant, as this would have been considered extremely dangerous. Instead, it was intended to show how disparate systems of a chemical plant may end up interacting at the larger scale, incorporating the financial, production, and logistics related to operating a plant. The game allowed some \\"disasters\\" to be created by creating explosive mixtures of components that set off fires, as well as external events that may disrupt the plant. The game was not considered to be a fully finished product based on the version received by the Internet Archive.

Throughout history, liturgical Latinisation was manifested in various forms. In Early Middle Ages, it occurred during the process of conversion of Gothic Christianity, and also during the process of reincorporation of Celtic Christianity. During the Crusades, it was introduced to Eastern Christians. After the creation of various Eastern Catholic Churches, several forms and degrees of liturgical Latinisation were adopted by some of those Churches, in order to make their liturgical customs resembling more closely the practices of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. This particular process continued up to the 18th and 19th centuries, until it was forbidden by Pope Leo XIII in 1894 with his encyclical Orientalium dignitas. Latinisation is a contentious issue in many churches and has been considered responsible for various schisms.Descy (1993), pp. 58-59, describes one such schism in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, caused by the 1857 adoption of the Gregorian Calendar In recent years the Eastern Catholic churches have been returning to ancient Eastern practices in accord with the Second Vatican Council's decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum. The decree mandated that authentic Eastern Catholic practices were not to be set aside in favour of imported Latin Rite practices. This further encouraged the movement to return to authentic Eastern liturgical practice, theology and spirituality.Parry (1999), p. 292. Implementation has varied amongst the Eastern Catholic Churches, however, with some remaining more Latinised than the others. In a somewhat similar development, practices once associated only with the West, such as polyphonic choirs, icons in the style of the Western Renaissance, as in the Cretan School of painting, or even of the Baroque period,Orthodox Art and Architecture and pews, have been adopted also in certain Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches and are today the object of controversy or have been abandoned.

The film is about a house and the lives of three families who live in it, so in essence, it is three stories linked by the house. The film stars Dilip Kumar, Kishore Kumar, Keshto Mukherjee, Suchitra Sen and Nirupa Roy. The music is by Salil Chowdhury.  Plot  = Episode-1-Marriage = For any young married couple, moving into their new house is a very special feeling. The feeling gets more special if the young couple has eloped and married. Something similar happened with Shakuntala (Suchitra Sen) and her husband. The landlord (David) helps the couple move to the rented house. The young couple move to this house, which, incidentally is the main protagonist of the film. While Shakuntala makes the house into a beautiful home, her husband gets busy with work. She meets the neighboring tea vendor (Mohan Choti) and meets the next door \\"auntie\\", whose favourite pastime is to gossip about developments in others' homes. The couple hears the sound of a violin in the night and ask the tea-stall owner about it in the morning. He says that it is being played by a mad-man, Pagla Babu. Since the couple had eloped, Shakuntala wanted that her parents-in-law accept her as their daughter-in-law. This is what happens, and her in-laws somehow find the young couple and they are more than happy to meet Shakuntala. Finally, Shakuntala and her husband go with them and vacate the house. In between, Shakuntala plants some seeds in the garden. The landlord again puts the TO LET sign on the house. = Episode-2-Birth = The next tenants in the house is a family headed by an old man Nazir Hussain. The other members are his elder widowed daughter-in-law (Nirupa Roy) and younger son Bhanu (Kishore Kumar). The daughter-in-law is pregnant and we are told that her husband had just died. Bhanu is finishing his college and simultaneously looking for a job, whereas his old father is somehow managing the expenses. Although there is sadness in the home, Bhanu, with his wit and humour, maintains a light atmosphere for his sister-in-law. The next door \\"aunty\\" again comes and chats on and on. Bhanu also hears the violin and when asks about it from the tea- vendor is told about Pagla Babu. The problems of the family increase as Bhanu fails to get a job landing the family in dire consequences. He gets frustrated and this leads to a clash with his father. On feeling humiliated, Bhanu finally drinks poison before sleeping. However, the poison is adulterated and Bhanu wakes up when the entire family is mourning. He gets the news that he has finally got a job in some other city. The pregnant lady also delivers a child. The family is happy and they move to another city vacating the house. We see that the seed which Shakuntala sowed has germinated. The landlord again puts the TO LET sign on the house. Note: This part of the movie is adorned with a lovely song by Kishore; \\"Munna Bada Pyaara, Ammi Ka Dulara\\". = Episode-3-Death = The next inhabitants are a barrister and his widowed sister Uma (Usha Kiron). Uma has a small handicapped son (Daisy Irani). The neighbourhood \\"aunty\\" again visits the home. Like the previous tenants, this family also hears the sound of a violin in the night. The child is also attracted by the music and when he finds out about Pagla Babu from the tea- vendor, he insists on meeting him. However, the vendor tells the child that Pagla babu does not meet anyone. However, the child does not listen and insists on meeting the mysterious violinist. Pagla Babu does appear to meet the child. Uma is shocked to realize that Pagla Babu is none other than Raja (Dilip Kumar), her ex-lover. Raja, however, does not make it evident and interacts fondly with the child. In a very short span, an amazing bond is developed between Raja and the child. Initially, Uma is very uncomfortable with this bonding, but slowly she accepts it. We come to know that Raja is suffering from cancer and the dreaded disease is in its advanced stages. Ironically, Raja, who is on the verge of dying, pumps life into the child and fills his dark world with hope. He also tells the child that he will start walking once there is a flower in the garden. On knowing about Raja, Uma's brother is furious. There is a clash between them. Slowly, Raja reaches the final stage and Uma takes care of him. Eventually he dies and the child starts walking. Meanwhile, in the garden, the germinated seed finally blossoms into a flower.

The film deals with antiwar themes and focuses on a garrison of Russian female soldiers in World War II. It was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category. The film is set in Karelia (near Finland) and was filmed near Ruskeala. Plot The film opens in color, with a girl taking off her motorcycle helmet—she is camping with her friends. It then shifts to summer 1942, in the same area, in the midst of World War II some ways behind the Soviet frontlines on the Eastern Front. Having asked for soldiers who don't drink alcohol and fraternize with women, Company Sergeant Major Vaskov is unexpectedly assigned a group of young female anti-aircraft gunners in a railway station far from the front line. Vaskov is not used to commanding women and clashes with them over daily issues. During an air raid, one of the girls, Rita Osyanina, shoots down an enemy aircraft and is decorated for her deeds. Dialogue and flashbacks in color begin to reveal the backstories of the women. It is also shown that Rita regularly sneaks food back to her mother and baby, who are not far from the front. One day, Rita, having secretly carried rations to her family during the night, comes across two German paratroopers her way back to her garrison. Vaskov chooses five volunteers: Rita, Zhenya, Lisa, Galya and Sonia, to embark with him on a mission to eliminate them. They decide to cross the marshland to intercept the Germans but the going is slow and treacherous, causing Galya to lose a boot. When they finally reach the location that Vaskov knows that the German paratroopers will have to pass, they lie in wait—only to find that there are sixteen German paratroopers instead of two. His soldiers come up with the idea to bluff the paratroopers into think that there are a lot of civilians in their path, by cutting down trees and lighting fires, which will cause the Germans to change direction. Though the plan almost fails, Zhenya's last-minute audacity in jumping into the river convinces the paratroopers to take a detour through the forest. Vaskov sends Lisa back to base for reinforcements. The group left in the forest prepare to reroute to avoid direct contact with the German troops. Backs against the wall, they engage in guerrilla warfare with the Germans. Sonia is killed by a knife and Galya is shot and dies immediately from her wounds. Vaskov, to create a diversion, leads the Germans away from the remaining two soldiers, firing at them with his Nagant revolver as they chase him through the forest. Vaskov is shot in the arm but manages to escape from the Germans—realizing that the reinforcements have not come, he hallucinates about Lisa, who tells him that she failed because she went too fast, drowning in the wet marshland. He miraculously comes across Rita and Zhenya but after a tearful reunion realizes that they have disobeyed his orders to retreat. He searches in his bag for a grenade to mount a suicide attack with but finds that the girls have taken the detonator out. Although he threatens to court martial them for continuing to disobey orders, they refuse to leave and instead prepare to ambush the Germans. During a prolonged engagement, Rita is injured by shrapnel from a grenade and tells Zhenya to leave her. Realizing that they are cornered, Zhenya disobeys Vaskov's orders to cover them and instead taunts and lures the Germans away through the forest, as Vaskov did earlier and is killed. Vaskov stays with Rita against her wishes to treat her wounds and promises to take her back to base. She asks him to take care of her son in the neighboring village. After kissing her at her request, he leaves to find a way out, giving her the revolver but soon comes back to find that Rita has shot herself. The desperate Vaskov, armed only with knife, one shot in his revolver and a grenade without a fuze, returns to the cabin where the Germans are resting from their wounds. By stabbing a soldier, shooting another and bluffing with the grenade, he captures a submachine gun and forces the remaining Germans to drop their weapons. Though he mocks them (Five girls... five young girls were here, only five, and you did not pass! You'll croak here, everyone will croak!.. I'll kill each of you with my own hands... with my own hands! And let them judge me...), he eventually takes the three remaining Germans as prisoners back to Soviet lines. The rest of the women of the regiment, who have come to rescue the group, find Vaskov before he passes out from exhaustion. Thirty years after the war ends, Vaskov visits the area of the battle again with an officer, implied to be Rita's son. The girl from the beginning arrives with a bouquet of flowers from her boyfriend, only to see that they are at a memorial for the five female soldiers that died there. She leaves the flowers at the memorial and the three of them pay their respects.

Death and legacy Librescu's memorial stone on the Virginia Tech campus At age 76, Librescu was among the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid mechanics class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held the door of his classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door four times, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows.\\"Israeli lecturer died shielding Virginia Tech students from gunman\\", Haaretz, April 17, 2007.

The rebels launched the coup in response to Diệm's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother Ngô Đình Nhu and his sister- in-law Madame Nhu. They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby regime loyalists who were members of the Ngô family's covert Cần Lao Party were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot. The coup caught the Ngô family completely off-guard, but was also chaotically executed. The plotters neglected to seal the roads leading into the capital Saigon to seal off loyalist reinforcements, and they hesitated after gaining the initiative. After initially being trapped inside the Independence Palace, Diệm stalled the coup by holding negotiations and promising reforms, such as the inclusion of military officers in the administration. In the meantime, opposition politicians joined the fray, trying to exploit Diệm's position. However, the president's real aim was to buy time for loyalist forces to enter the capital and relieve him. The coup failed when the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN entered Saigon and defeated the rebels. More than four hundred people—many of whom were civilian spectators—were killed in the ensuing battle. These included a group of anti-Diệm civilians who charged across the palace walls at Thi's urging and were cut down by loyalist gunfire. Đông and Thi fled to Cambodia, while Diệm berated the United States for a perceived lack of support during the crisis. Afterwards, Diệm ordered a crackdown, imprisoning numerous anti-government critics and former cabinet ministers. Those that assisted Diệm were duly promoted, while those that did not were demoted. A trial for those implicated in the plot was held in 1963. Seven officers and two civilians were sentenced to death in absentia, while 14 officers and 34 civilians were jailed. Diệm's regime also accused the Americans of sending Central Intelligence Agency members to assist the failed plot. When Diệm was assassinated after a 1963 coup, those jailed after the 1960 revolt were released by the new military junta.  Background  The revolt was led by 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông, a northerner, who had fought with the French Union forces against the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. Later trained at Fort Leavenworth in the United States, Đông was regarded by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician and the brightest military prospect of his generation and he served in the Airborne Division. Back in Vietnam, Đông became discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in the internal affairs of the army. Diệm promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years after the coup, Đông asserted that his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the director of training at the Joint General Staff School,Dommen, p. 418. and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy. Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer,Moyar, p. 109. and had been a political activist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority opposition party called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a small presence in the rubber-stamp National Assembly. Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers were members of other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border with the assistance of their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained officers were denied such promotions.Hammer, pp. 131–133. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable. Planning for the coup had gone on for over a year, with Đông recruiting disgruntled officers. This included his commander, Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi. In 1955, Thi had fought for Diệm against the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon. This performance so impressed Diệm—a lifelong bachelor—that he thereafter referred to Thi as \\"my son\\".Halberstam, p. 23. However, the Americans who worked with Thi were less impressed. The CIA described Thi as \\"an opportunist and a man lacking strong convictions\\". An American military advisor described Thi as \\"tough, unscrupulous, and fearless, but dumb\\". There is some dispute as to whether Thi participated in the coup of his free choice. According to some sources, Thi was still an admirer of Diệm and was forced at gunpoint by Đông and his supporters to join the coup at the last minute, having been kept unaware of the plotting. According to this story, Thi's airborne units were initially moved into position for the coup without his knowledge. Many months before the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely regarded as the brains of the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the Viet Cong (VC) near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held. The Americans started to notice and become alarmed at increasing reports of political disillusionment in the military officer corps in August. An intelligence report prepared by the US State Department in late August claimed the \\"worsening of internal security, the promotion of incompetent officers and Diệm's direct interference in army operations ... his political favoritism, inadequate delegation of authority, and the influence of the Can Lao\\".Kahin, p. 123. It also claimed that discontent with Diệm among high-ranking civil servants was at their highest point since the president had established in power, and that the bureaucrats wanted a change of leadership, through a coup if needed. It was said that Nhu and his wife were the most despised among the civil service. The report predicted that if a coup was to occur, the objective would probably be to force Nhu and his wife out of positions of power and allow Diệm to continue to lead the country with reduced power, should he be willing to do so. The intelligence analysis turned out to be correct.Kahin, p. 124. The US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, who had been in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to pressure Diệm into political reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out to a broader cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, cronyism, abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw authoritarianism as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG). Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.Kahin, p. 122. Around this time, Durbrow began to advise Diệm to remove Nhu and his wife from the government, basing his arguments on a need to cultivate broad popular support to make South Vietnam more viable in the long term. His key suggestions included Nhu being sent abroad as an ambassador, removing Nhu's wife and intelligence director Tran Kim Tuyen from public power and sending them overseas, new defense and interior ministers, and \\"altering the nature of the Cần Lao Party\\" to acknowledge its existence and operations in public. These proposals were endorsed by the State Department and delivered to Diem. As Nhu and the Can Lao were a core means of his keeping power, Diệm did not follow Durbrow's advice, and was reported to have become angry when Durbrow suggested that corruption and political favoritism was diminished the government's effectiveness.Miller, p. 212. On September 16, after another fruitless meeting with Diệm, Durbrow reported to Washington: \\"If Diệm's position in [the] country continues to deteriorate ... it may become necessary for [the] US government to begin consideration [of] alternative courses of action and leaders in order [to] achieve our objective.\\" In another State Department Report, it was concluded that a coup would become more likely \\"if Diệm continued to remain uncompromising and if the opposition felt that the United States would not be unsympathetic to a coup or that U.S.–Vietnamese relations would not be seriously damaged.\\" As it turned out those in Vietnam discontented with Diệm reached the same conclusion, that the US would not mind them toppling the president. The coup was organised with the help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They were told that they were heading into the countryside to attack the VC.Moyar, p. 108. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.  Coup  According to Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Vietnam: A History, the coup was ineffectively executed; although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff near Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to follow the textbook tactics of blocking the roads leading into Saigon. While they captured Saigon's principal telephone exchange at the central post office, they, they failed to secure a secondary system that was located in the basement.Miller, p. 203. This meant that phone lines into the palace remained intact, which allowed Diệm to call for aid from loyal units. Most notably, the director of the post office, who remained loyal, was able to call Diem's director of intelligence Tran Kim Tuyen, allowing him to make summon loyalist forces.Miller, p. 204. The paratroopers headed down the main thoroughfare of Saigon towards Independence Palace. At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diệm would comply with their demands. Đông attempted to call on US ambassador Durbrow to put pressure on Diệm. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diệm, maintained his government's position of supporting Diệm, stating \\"We support this government until it fails\\".Karnow, pp. 252–253. Durbrow later recalled receiving a telephone call from an aide to Diệm who insisted that he call Diệm and tell him to surrender or face a howitzer attack on the palace. Durbrow refused and no attack took place. He consequently learned that the aide was forced to make the call.\\"Interview with Eldridge Durbrow, 1979 (Part 1 of 3).\\" 02/01/1979. WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved November 23, 2010. Most of the rebel soldiers had been told that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire at the front of the palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier. The paratroopers' first assault on the palace met with surprising resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the National Police offices, Radio Saigon and the Cộng Hòa barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours would have to come from outside Saigon.Moyar, p. 110. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters. He had been sitting in his jeep behind the frontline when he was hit by stray gunfire. Diệm headed for the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant Nhu, and his wife Madame Nhu. Brigadier General Nguyễn Khánh, at the time the ARVN Chief of Staff, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege, as the Presidential Guard had been under explicit orders to not open the gates. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The plotters had tried to put him under house arrest at the start of the coup, but were unaware that he had moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quang Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.Moyar, pp. 109–110. The pair managed to trick the rebels into allowing a column of tanks drive past, which were later turned against the rebels.Miller, p. 208. At dawn, civilians began massing outside the palace gates, verbally encouraging the rebels and waving banners advocating regime change. Radio Saigon announced that a \\"Revolutionary Council\\" was in charge of South Vietnam's government. Diệm appeared lost, while many Saigon-based ARVN troops rallied to the insurgents. According to Nguyễn Thái Bình, an exiled political rival, \\"Diệm was lost. Any other than he would have capitulated.\\" However, the rebels hesitated as they decided their next move. There was debate on what Diệm's role would be in future. Thi felt that the rebels should take the opportunity of storming the palace and capturing Diệm, or using artillery if necessary.Miller, p. 207. Đông on the other hand, was worried that Diệm could be killed in an attack. Đông felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, the president was South Vietnam's best available leader, believing that enforced reform would yield the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu and his wife out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to kill or deport the couple.Jacobs, p. 117. alt=A middle-aged lady wearing a light-coloured dress and with short hair, fluffy at the front, sits at a dinner table smiling. To the right is a taller, older man in a dark suit, striped tie and light shirt who is turning his head to the left, talking to her. A man in a suit is visible, standing in the background. Thi demanded that Diệm appoint an officer as prime minister and that Diệm remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai to negotiate with the coup leaders.Langguth, pp. 108–109. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated.Moyar, p. 111. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major Nguyen Huy Loi.Dommen, p. 419. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check, but with Hong--who was meant to supposed to be the primary negotiator--dead, Dong was uncertain as to what to demand. At one stage, Dong wanted Diem to remain as a \\"supreme advisory\\" to a transitional regime made up of military officers and civilians. The plotters unilaterally named Brigadier General Lê Văn Kim, the head of the Vietnamese National Military Academy, the nation's premier officer training school in Da Lat, would be their new prime minister. Kim was not a Can Lao member and was later put under house arrest after Diệm regained control. According to Kim's brother-in-law, Major General Trần Văn Đôn, Kim was willing to accept the post but was not going to say anything unless the coup succeeded.Kahin, p. 473. The rebels also suggested that Diệm appoint General Lê Văn Tỵ, the chief of the armed forces, be made defence minister. Diệm asked Ty, who had been put under house arrest by the plotters, if he was willing, but the officer was not. During the afternoon of November 11, the rebels used Ty as an intermediary to pass on their demands to the president. A broadcast was made over Saigon Radio, during which Ty said he had consulted with Diệm and obtained his agreement for the \\"dissolution of the present government\\" and that \\"with agreement of the Revolutionary Council\\" had given the officers the task of constituting \\"a provisional military government\\".Kahin, p. 125. Phan Quang Đán joined the rebellion and acted as the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diệm, Đán had been disqualified from the 1959 legislative election after winning his seat by a ratio of 6:1 despite Diệm having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of the war against the Viet Cong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt. Đán spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it.Moyar, p. 114. In the meantime, Thuy went about organising a coalition of political parties to take over post-Diệm. He had already lined up the VNQDĐ, Đại Việt, and the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious movements, and was seeking more collaborators. Khanh returned to the palace and reported the result of his conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due to the demands of the rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president. During the standoff, Durbrow ambivalently noted \\"We consider it overriding importance to Vietnam and Free World that agreement be reached soonest in order avoid continued division, further bloodshed with resultant fatal weakening Vietnam's ability [to] resist communists.\\"Hammer, p. 131. American representatives privately recommended to both sides to reach a peaceful agreement to share power. alt=Middle-aged black-haired man, stands side-on in a dark suit with a cigarette in right hand and left hand in pocket, looking at the large map of the Asia Pacific region on the wall. In the meantime, the negotiations allowed time for loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, a future president, brought infantry forces from Biên Hòa, a town north of Saigon. The Seventh Division of Colonel Trần Thiện Khiêm brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from Mỹ Tho, a town in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon. Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục. Khanh also convinced Lê Nguyên Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of Tây Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyễn Đình Thuận phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said \\"I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If one side or the other has to make some concessions in order [to] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists.\\" Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime. Diệm advised Khanh to continue to negotiate with the paratroopers and seek a rapprochement. After consenting to formal negotiations, the parties agreed to a ceasefire.Moyar, p. 112. In the meantime, loyalist forces continued to head towards the capital, while the rebels publicly claimed on radio that Diệm had surrendered in an apparent attempt to attract more troops to their cause. Diệm promised to end press censorship, liberalise the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but he agreed to dissolve his cabinet and form a government that would accommodate the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of November 12, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, which the rebels broadcast on Saigon Radio.Jacobs, p. 118. In it he expressed his intention to \\"coordinate with the Revolutionary Council to establish a coalition government\\". As the speech was being aired, two infantry divisions and supporting loyal armour approached the palace grounds. Some of these had broken through the rebel encirclement by falsely claiming to be anti-Diệm reinforcements, before setting up their positions next to the palace. The loyalists opened fire with mortars and machine guns, and both sides exchanged fire for a few hours. During the morning, Durbrow tried to stop the fighting, phoning Diệm to say that if the violence was not stopped, \\"the entire population will rise up against both loyalists and rebels, and the communists will take over the city. If a bloodbath is not avoided, all of Vietnam will go communist in a very short time.\\" Durbrow deplored the attempt to resolve the situation with force. Diệm blamed the rebels for causing the outbreak of fighting and the collapse of the power-sharing deal. Some of the Saigon-based units that had joined the rebellion sensed that Diệm had regained the upper hand and switched sides for the second time in two days. The paratroopers became outnumbered and were forced to retreat to defensive positions around their barracks, which was an ad hoc camp that had been set up in a public park approximately away.Moyar, p. 113. After a brief but violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. This included a large number of civilians, who had been engaging in anti-Diệm protests outside the palace grounds. Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngos by charging the palace, and 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers from the 2nd Armored Battalion as they invaded the grounds. The others dispersed quickly.  Aftermath  Colonel Lansdale (pictured here as a alt=Man with dark hair and moustache in a dress uniform, suit and tie, sitting at a table, with a star indicating his rank, in front of a map on a wall. After the failed coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu and several other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia turned a blind eye to the VC using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another. Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and began rounding up scores of critics, including several former cabinet ministers and some of the Caravelle Group of 18 who had released a petition calling for reform. One of Diệm's first orders after re-establishing command was to order the arrest of Dan, who was imprisoned and tortured.Jacobs, p. 119. For Diệm and his family, the failed coup was a turning point in relations with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously thought the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin \\"We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; we felt we could count on it, just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee.\\" Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were \\"explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels\\".Kahin, p. 474. In the wake of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a perceived lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been \\"100% in support of Diệm\\". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow \\"the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt.\\" In May 1961, Nhu said \\"[t]he least you can say ... is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected\\". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to \\"unify all elements of the country\\", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying \\"You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting\\", accusing them having \\"duped\\" innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnam—an English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponents—to meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of \\"American support of and complicity in the coup\\". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers. The American military establishment strongly backed Diệm. Colonel Edward Lansdale, a CIA agent who helped entrench Diệm in power in 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the Eisenhower administration to recall the ambassador. Lansdale said that \\"It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diệm must feel that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow's remarks over the months helped incite the revolt.\\" Lansdale criticised Durbrow: \\"At the most critical moment of the coup, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diệm to give in to rebel demands to avoid bloodshed.\\" Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the new MAAG commander, agreed with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the \\"courageous action of Diệm coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon\\".Moyar, p. 115. McGarr asserted that \\"Diệm has emerged from this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population.\\" General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said that \\"When you have rebellious forces against you, you have to act forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can't be avoided and that those in power must act decisively.\\" The State Department advised President Eisenhower to send Diệm a congratulatory message, but Durbrow objected, arguing that Diệm would interpret the message as an unqualified endorsement of his rule and prevent him from \\"grasping and heeding lessons of [the] coup\\". Diệm later implicated two Americans, George Carver and Russ Miller for involvement in the plot. Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers. Durbrow had sent them there to keep track of the situation, but Diệm felt that they were there to encourage the uprising; the coup group's desired changes were very similar to those advocated by Durbrow in previous months. It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers. Carver had also spent some of the coup period in a meeting with civilian rebel leaders at Thuy's house, although it is not known if he pro-actively encouraged Diệm opponents.Moyar, p. 438. The Ngô brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported, and soon after, Carver received a death warrant. The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders, who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them. The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit, but told the Ngô family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety, thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment. Years later, Carver said he agreed with the rebels' thinking that Diệm was doing poorly and needed to be replaced, saying he was \\"absolutely convinced\\" that a regime change was needed to \\"achieve American objective in Vietnam\\". In his memoir, Don claimed Miller had cryptically encouraged him to overthrow Diệm a few months before the coup attempt.Moyar, p. 439. The rift between American diplomatic and military representatives in South Vietnam began to grow. In the meantime, Durbrow continued his policy of pressuring Diệm to liberalize his regime. Durbrow saw the coup as a sign that Diệm was unpopular and with the South Vietnamese president making only token changes, the ambassador informed Washington that Diệm might have to be removed. However, in December, the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs J. Graham Parsons told Durbrow to stop, cabling \\"Believe for present Embassy has gone as far as feasible in pushing for liberalization and future exhortation likely to be counterproductive.\\" The tensions between the palace and the US was mirrored in the ARVN. The paratroopers had been regarded as the most loyal of the ARVN's units, so Diệm intensified his policy of promoting officers based on loyalty rather than competence. Khiêm was made a general and appointed Army Chief of Staff.Hammer, p. 133. The Ngô brothers were so paranoid that they felt that Khanh was suspect as he had broken through the rebel lines too easily.Halberstam, p. 180. Khanh's action gained him a reputation of having helped the president, but he was later criticised for having a foot in both camps. Critics claimed that Khanh had been on good terms with the rebels and decided against rebelling when it was clear that Diệm would win.Hammer, p. 132. Khanh was later dispatched to the Central Highlands as the commander of II Corps.Hammer, pp. 127–128. General Dương Văn Minh, who did not come to Diệm's defense during the siege and instead stayed at home, was demoted. During the revolt, the plotters had nominated Minh to become their Defence Minister, but he refused when Diệm contacted him, claiming that he would willingly fight for Diệm on the battlefield, but was neither interested in nor suited for politics. However, Minh did not come to assist Diệm, and the president responded by appointing him to the post of Presidential Military Advisor, where he had no influence or troops to command in case the thought of coup ever crossed his mind.Hammer, p. 126. Minh and Lieutenant General Tran Van Don, the commander of the 1st Division in central Vietnam, but who was in Saigon when the coup attempt occurred, were the subject of a military investigation by the regime, but were cleared of involvement by junior officers appointed by Diem. Don's brother-in-law Kim, was also subjected to formal investigation, and placed under house arrest for a few weeks after the coup attempt. Despite being cleared of any wrongdoing, he was removed from his post as the director of the National Military Academy and transferred to Minh's unit.Miller, p. 210. Lansdale continued to be critical of Durbrow, and wanted to replace him as ambassador.Kahin, p. 126. Two months later, the incoming US President John F. Kennedy started a review of Washington's stance with regards to Saigon.Kahin, p. 129. Lansdale's report predicted South Vietnam's demise, and along with it, the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs, unless a new direction was found. He blamed what he saw as Durbrow's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance, and that the current ambassador could not work effectively anymore because he had \\"sympathized strongly\\" with the coup. Without explicitly suggesting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone \\"with marked leadership talents\\" and the ability to \\"influence Asians through understanding them sympathetically\\". Lansdale called Diệm \\"the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President\\" and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him. Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA, but felt that diplomats were \\"very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11\\". During the meeting at which these matters were discussed, there was strong agreement that Durbrow's position in Saigon had become untenable.Kahin, p. 475. Lansdale's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy's decision to replace Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961. Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him.Moyar, p. 130. Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale, before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.Kahin, p. 130. Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale.Moyar, p. 129.  Trial  The trial of those charged with involvement in the coup occurred more than two years later in mid-1963. Diệm scheduled the hearing in the middle of the Buddhist crisis, a move that was interpreted as an attempt to deter the populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.Hammer, pp. 154–155. Diệm's officials gave the Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere. The official prosecutor claimed to have documents proving that a foreign power was behind the failed coup but said that he could not publicly name the nation in question. It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: George Carver, an employee of the United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a CIA agent, and Howard C. Elting, described as the deputy chief of the American mission in Saigon. One of the prominent civilians summoned to appear before the military tribunal was a well-known novelist who wrote under the pen name of Nhat Linh. He was the VNQDĐ leader Nguyễn Tường Tam, who had been Ho Chi Minh's foreign affairs minister in 1946. Tam had abandoned his post rather than lead the delegation to the Fontainebleau Conference and make concessions to the French Union. In the 30 months since the failed putsch, the police had not taken the conspiracy claims seriously enough to arrest Tam, but when Tam learned of the trial, he committed suicide by ingesting cyanide. He left a death note stating \\"I also will kill myself as a warning to those people who are trampling on all freedom\\", referring to Thích Quảng Đức, the monk who self-immolated in protest against Diệm's persecution of Buddhism. Tam's suicide was greeted with a mixed reception. Although some felt that it upheld the Vietnamese tradition of choosing death over humiliation, some VNQDĐ members considered Tam's actions to be romantic and sentimental. The brief trial opened on July 8, 1963. The seven officers and two civilians who had fled the country after the failed coup were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. Five officers were acquitted, while the remainder were imprisoned for terms ranging from five to ten years. Another VNQDĐ leader Vũ Hồng Khanh was given six years in prison. Former Diệm cabinet minister Phan Khắc Sửu was sentenced to eight years, mainly for being a signatory of the Caravelle Group which called on Diệm to reform. Dan, the spokesman was sentenced to seven years. Fourteen of the civilians were acquitted, including Tam. However, the prisoners' time in prison was brief, as Diệm was deposed and killed in a coup in November 1963.Blair, p. 70. On November 8, political opponents who had been imprisoned on the island of Poulo Condore were released by the military junta. Đán was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large crowd at the town hall.Blair, p. 81. Suu later served as president for a brief period and Dan as a deputy prime minister. Thi, Đông and Lieu returned to South Vietnam and resumed their service in the ARVN.Karnow, pp. 460–464.

Based in Wallisdown, Bournemouth in southern England. In December 2018, Parvalux was acquired by maxon motor AG. History The name ‘Parvalux’ derives from the Latin 'parvulus' and 'lux' and means 'young light', alluding to the hopes that founder Leslie J. Clark had for the Romford-based business where he first began selling motor rewinds in 1947. After relocating to Bournemouth in 1957, the company moved from simply re-winding motors to designing and manufacturing complete gear- motor units for industrial applications. Parvalux prospered for forty years through continued expansion of its product offer to cover a broad range of AC/DC electric motors and gearboxes, enabling the business to sell into a diverse range of markets and applications ― all over the world. In 2003, Steven Clark took over as Chief Executive. In 2008 Parvalux acquired rival firm and DC motor application specialist EMD Drives Systems of Halstead, thereby creating the UK’s largest privately owned manufacturer of sub 1kW electric motors and gearboxes. Until that time EMD had shared a similar history to Parvalux, initially winning recognition in the 1960s as volume AC motor supplier to household names such as Qualcast and Hotpoint, but then moved exclusively into DC products by the 1980s where they would compete directly with Parvalux for some 30 years. EMD was relocated in its entirety to the Bournemouth headquarters during 2009, with key members of the EMD staff relocating to join the newly merged business. The merger allowed Parvalux to offer products in much higher quantities than previously possible and cemented this position with a new 'product development and design' function (PDD). The company has 185 employees in three production sites in Bournemouth, Dorset. Parvalux generates revenues of 23 million British pounds annually, with just over 40% being exported around the world. Applications One notable application of a Parvalux product was documented as under test at the university of California in 1966 for inclusion on the cancelled Voyager program (Mars) mission.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670008707_1967008707.pdf The Brayebrook Observatory in Cambridgeshire uses two Parvalux AC induction gear-motor units to operate dome and shutter functions.http://www.brayebrookobservatory.org/BrayObsWebSite/HOMEPAGE/BRAOBSENG.html#Dome%20&%20Shutter%20Design In 2006 Team Joker used a Parvalux unit as a servo motor on their combat robot 'Joker'.

He qualified with Artmedia to the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League group stage but he did not get a chance. He became a first goalkeeper in the second half of the 2005–06 season when Juraj Čobej had to undergo treatment for a brain tumor. He won the domestic league again in 2007–08. On 2 July 2009, the 22-year-old Kamenár left Artmedia Petržalka to sign a five-year contract for French Nantes. He played 35 matches in his first season and finished 15th with Nantes. In the next season he lost his position in the club and moved on a half-year loan to Sivasspor. There he made only one appearance against Manisaspor.

Retrieved 11 May 2007. and decides to move permanently to Walford from Ibiza where they ran a bar together. Roxy is the younger of the two sisters. She is described as the \\"fire\\", as opposed to Ronnie's \\"ice\\". Simons took a temporary hiatus in 2016, with Roxy off screen from 1 January until 4 May 2016. Following the announcement that Womack would be leaving the series, Simons' departure was also announced. Roxy departed the series in scenes broadcast on 1 January 2017, when she drowned in a swimming pool along with Ronnie. Simons returned in 2019 to record a voiceover as Roxy, which was broadcast on 3 May 2019. During Roxy's time on the show she has been married twice — to Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) — and engaged an additional three times — to Damian (James Hiller), Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) and Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo). Her major storylines have included the paternity of her daughter Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles), becoming Landlady of The Queen Victoria, becoming a millionairess before squandering all the money on frivolous spending, her popular friendship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), a feud with Alfie's ex-wife Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), one-night stands with her sister's two husbands Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Dean's attempted rape of her, and becoming a drugs mule. The character has proved popular with viewers, with Simons winning the \\"Best Newcomer\\" award at the Digital Spy Soap Awards in 2008 for her role in the soap opera. Storylines Roxy arrives in Walford with her sister, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), from Ibiza, and they help run their aunt Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) public house, The Queen Victoria. Roxy's philandering fiancé Damian (James Hillier) follows them to Walford, and Roxy seduces him for money so she and Ronnie can buy the local nightclub. However, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) usurps Roxy, buying the club and going into partnership with Ronnie, whom he also dates. Roxy starts dating Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), but Ronnie tries to break them up when she discovers Sean is a drug dealer. It later emerges Roxy was once addicted to cocaine. After arguing with Ronnie, Roxy gets extremely drunk and has sex with Jack. She later discovers she is pregnant and tells Sean that he is the father, while she and Ronnie plan to return to Ibiza. They leave, but Ronnie soon returns looking for Roxy, revealing that after they argued in Ibiza, she disappeared. It transpires Roxy is staying with their father Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) in Weymouth, to Ronnie's horror. Roxy is adamant she will live with Archie but Sean persuades her to return to Walford, telling her he loves her. They move in together upon their return, and later marry. Roxy goes into premature labour and gives birth to a girl, named Amy (Amelie Conway), after Ronnie's daughter who was adopted as a newborn. Roxy and Sean plan to move to Dagenham, but then Sean discovers Jack is Amy's father on Christmas Day. He pretends to forgive Roxy and asks her to move away with him. He drives Roxy and Amy drive to a frozen lake, revealing he intends to kill them all. Roxy gets Amy to safety, but she and Sean fall through the ice. They both survive, and in the wake of this Sean flees. Roxy then begins dating local GP Al Jenkins (Adam Croasdell), however their relationship ends when someone complains that he is seeing his patient. Archie continually attempts to ruin Roxy's relationship with Ronnie, but it takes Roxy a long time to acknowledge the extent of her father's duplicity and his attempts to destroy Ronnie. Archie is murdered, having made numerous enemies in Walford. Roxy inherits Archie's estate, including £3 million. After Archie's funeral, Roxy meets their younger brother Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) for the first time; they invite him to stay. He gains Roxy's trust, but she is unaware that he and their estranged mother Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) are planning to steal her inheritance. Glenda double-crosses Danny, exposing the con, claiming Danny has been abusing her and that he is not really Archie's son. Roxy tells Danny to leave and asks Glenda to stay. Roxy spends frivolously until she only has £20,000 left and this is stolen by her cousin Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and his partner Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). Glenda, who is having an affair with Phil, discovers the theft; when Phil dumps her, she urges Roxy to steal back her money as revenge, but they are caught. Phil manages to convince Roxy that it is Glenda who stole her money; he plants money in Glenda's wardrobe and Roxy sends her away. Roxy agrees to be a surrogate mother for her gay friend Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and his partner Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) in 2011, but despite their attempt, she does not become pregnant. Roxy is left mortified upon discovering Ronnie's newborn baby, James Branning, died of sudden infant death syndrome and Ronnie swapped her baby with Kat Moon's (Jessie Wallace) newborn, Tommy, who is also the biological son of Roxy's boyfriend Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd). Before Ronnie is tried in court, Michael attempts to frame Ronnie for kidnapping Tommy a second time to ensure she will receive a custodial sentence. Roxy finishes with Michael as a result, but the damage sticks and, to Roxy's horror, Ronnie is given three years imprisonment. When Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) babysits Amy, she almost drowns in the bath when he leaves her alone. She is revived but Jack accuses Roxy of neglect then attempts to gain custody of Amy; he is awarded this temporarily and stops Roxy having any contact with Amy. Roxy hires a solicitor, Jimmie Broome (Samuel James), who suggests she discredit Jack. The animosity has a negative effect on Amy, so Roxy and Jack agree not to argue in front of her. They momentarily soften towards each other, which leads to sex, but after Roxy discovers Jack has forged her signature to get Amy a passport, she believes he is intending to flee the country with her daughter. She threatens to report this, and Jack withdraws his bid for custody; Amy is returned to her mother. Roxy is comforted by her friend and boss, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), after her attempts to seduce Max Branning (Jake Wood) are made public. Realising she has feelings for Alfie, she confesses she loves him. Although Alfie admits to being tempted, he remains faithful to his wife Kat, who is away visiting family. Roxy and Alfie remain friends and colleagues despite Roxy's growing affection for him. After Alfie goes to visit Kat, Roxy becomes concerned for Jean Slater's (Gillian Wright) welfare and asks Alfie to return home. He returns with Kat, who throws Roxy out. Seeing that Alfie is in financial difficulty, Roxy gives him a loan from Amy's Child Trust Fund. Suspicious of Roxy and Alfie's friendship, Kat confronts Roxy and she admits she had a crush on Alfie. Kat sacks her from the pub and she moves back in with Phil. Phil once again takes control of the Queen Vic kicking Kat and Alfie out due to unpaid rent. He then appoints cousin Roxy as manager once again running it alongside Alfie and Kat. Roxy has brief flings with AJ Ahmed (Phaldut Sharma) and Michael, who she moves in with for a short time. When Alfie and Kat split up, Alfie asks Roxy to live with him and they declare their love for each other. Roxy is delighted when Alfie decides to divorce Kat, though it leads to more hostility between Kat and Roxy, which leads to a physical fight. Roxy and Alfie decide to try for a baby and Kat is upset about this. When a builder, Josef (Aleksander Mikic), tries to steal money from the pub's till and later the safe, Kat helps Roxy to stop him and Roxy thanks Kat but then accuses her of trying to win Alfie back. Initially Kat promises Roxy that she will not tell Alfie about the incident, but when Roxy tells Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) that Kat is having a relationship with her estranged husband Michael, Kat tells Roxy that she has to tell Alfie about the attempted robbery. Roxy is later delighted when she discovers that Kat and Alfie's divorce has been finalised, but is upset when Alfie does not tell her about it. Alfie proposes to Roxy and she accepts. Roxy does not tell Alfie that Ronnie is due to be released from prison soon, but when he finds out, he forbids Roxy from meeting her at the prison gates. Instead, Kat meets Ronnie and brings her back to Walford. Ronnie and Roxy spend time together while Alfie is out, but he returns early to find them together, so tells Roxy to choose between him and Ronnie. Roxy chooses Alfie, but is miserable, so starts seeing Ronnie in secret. Michael sees them and tells Alfie, who nearly ends his and Roxy's engagement, but instead, tells Roxy they must leave Walford immediately to sort out their relationship. When they return, Roxy tells Ronnie she can no longer see her, but Alfie sees Roxy crying, so announces their wedding date and invites Ronnie to the wedding. Alfie and Ronnie spend time together, but she is suspicious that he still has feelings for Kat, and warns him not to hurt Roxy. However, after the death of Michael, even Roxy notices how Alfie looks to Kat for comfort. At Roxy's hen party, Ronnie expresses her doubts about the upcoming marriage to Roxy, and the sisters argue. This leads to Roxy declaring that she does not want Ronnie at the wedding. Ronnie attends anyway and the sisters reconcile. Kat walks in during the ceremony, but Alfie continues his wedding vows and they marry. However, Roxy soon realises that Alfie still loves Kat and orders him to go to her as she is leaving for Ibiza. He does so, and Ronnie and Phil worry about Roxy, who gets drunk and humiliates herself. Phil then gets revenge on Alfie on Roxy's behalf by selling The Queen Vic. Roxy has sex with Carl White (Daniel Coonan) and they begin a relationship, much to Phil and Ronnie's annoyance, especially as Roxy is not looking after Amy. Ronnie tries to get Carl to break up with Roxy, and when he refuses, she buys tickets for her and Roxy to return to Ibiza. Carl tries to outmaneuver Ronnie by inviting Roxy on a holiday of his own, but when he fails to turn up Roxy leaves with Ronnie for Ibiza instead. They return to Walford three months later and Ronnie confesses to Roxy that the reason Carl didn't show up to take her away was because Ronnie had murdered in him in self-defence several hours earlier. Despite initially struggling with the confession, Roxy forgives her sister, and together they buy their own house on the square. When Carl's mother, Nora White (Lynn Farleigh), arrives looking for Carl, Roxy wants to help convince her that Carl has moved away from Walford, but Ronnie intervenes and pretends to be her instead. Ronnie pays Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) to date Roxy, but she becomes distrusting of him and tells him to stop. Aleks continues to date her and falls for her, acting as a father-figure to Amy (now Abbie Knowles). Roxy discovers that Ronnie was paying Aleks to date her, but eventually forgives Aleks when he declares his love for her publicly. When Alfie tells her that Aleks is married to Marta Shirovs (Noeleen Comiskey) and has a daughter Ineta Shirovs (Gledisa Osmani), they break up. Aleks convinces her that they have separated. Ronnie warns Roxy about her being a mistress; she orders her to give him an ultimatum. She does, and he arranges a holiday. On her wedding day to Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Ronnie goes into labour. On the way to the hospital, Roxy, Charlie and Ronnie are all involved in a car accident as the vehicle crashes. Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) is killed after being run over by the car and Ronnie is seriously injured and comatised. While Ronnie is in her coma, Roxy and Charlie have sex, later agreeing that it was a mistake. Later, Charlie learns that Roxy has feelings for him. Aleks finds out that Roxy and Charlie had sex, and he and Roxy make plans to leave for Latvia immediately, but they split after Roxy admits to Aleks she does not love him, so Aleks leaves with Marta and Ineta. Charlie admits to Roxy that he thinks he is falling in love with her but says they should stay apart. Roxy confesses to Ronnie about her one-night stand, and their relationship becomes strained. Roxy turns to drink and has sex with Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), later admitting that she likes him. She asks Dean to keep their relationship secret, due to him being hated by the community for raping Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Ronnie discovers their relationship and tries to stop them from seeing each other. However, they carry on seeing each other. Whilst Dean is hiding from Ronnie, he finds the hidden camera Ronnie is using to spy on Roxy and Charlie. When Ronnie threatens him, Dean tells Roxy about this, and, when Roxy confronts Ronnie, they argue, then Roxy moves in with Dean. When Ronnie and Charlie's marriage begins to fall apart after Ronnie has sex with Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), Roxy tries to convince Ronnie to repair the marriage for Matthew's sake. However, when Amy is due to go to France to visit Jack, Charlie asks Roxy if they can join her. After Roxy drops Amy off at the airport the next day, she learns that Charlie wants to take Matthew with them. Although initially hesitant, she says she wants to come with him. However, when she learns that Ronnie has been prescribed anxiety medication, she tells Ronnie the plan and they conspire against Charlie together. Roxy is stunned when Dean, jealous of Charlie, burns her with a hair straightener. Dean becomes insecure that Roxy is spending time working with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), so employs her as manager of his salon. When she says he needs to take himself less seriously, Dean cuts a chunk out of her hair in anger, but immediately apologises and proceeds to give her a proper haircut. As a result of this, Ronnie worries about Dean trying to control Roxy. Roxy and Ronnie have a furious row over Charlie and Dean, which turns violent. Roxy then reports Ronnie's murder of Carl to the police. This results in Roxy fighting with Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) as the Mitchells despair of Roxy not seeing Dean as a rapist. When Jack returns, he finds out from Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) that Dean raped Linda, so he packs Amy's belongings and removes her from Roxy's care, pointing out that Roxy's feisty personality has gone since she started dating Dean. As Roxy ends her engagement to Dean, who has assaulted her again, he attempts to rape her but Shirley interrupts. A tearful Roxy is found by Linda and her mother Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), who support her. Linda encourages her to tell the police, which Roxy does. Shirley then attempts to drown Dean who finally admits he raped Linda before running away from the police. Roxy is examined in the hospital with bruises and scars left by Dean on her body, and gives her statement. Roxy visits Glenda and decides to leave the country, but Glenda enlists Ronnie to try to stop her. They are unsuccessful after Roxy tells Ronnie she has controlled her all her life and she needs to be alone. Roxy leaves Amy with Jack, who also departs Walford shortly after, in January 2016. One month later, Roxy does not return for Dean's court case, where he pleads not guilty and is remanded in custody until a retrial in June, so Ronnie calls her to inform her of this. She returns in May having been assaulted. She is hospitalised but discharges herself. Glenda has also returned, looking for Roxy as she took money from her and Danny before disappearing. Roxy tells Ronnie that she needs money to pay off a debt, so Ronnie gives her money, and Roxy gives some of it to Glenda as long as Glenda never returns to Walford. Roxy leaves, and when she returns, she tells Ronnie her debt is paid and she has money coming in. Jack refuses to let her see Amy. Roxy appears in discomfort and pain, and tells her relative Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) that she has £10,000 worth of cocaine inside her and she thinks something has gone wrong. Jack and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) find out, and when Roxy passes the bags of drugs through her system, she tells Jack and Billy she has flushed them but reveals to Jay that she has kept them, and he offers to help her sell them. However, they both change their minds for the sake of their families, and Roxy puts effort into finding work, and agrees to help Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) on her market stall. Roxy starts a relationship with Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) but Roxy struggles with being intimate because her last relationship was with Dean, and she admits that she is not ready for a relationship. She later learns that Andy is in fact Gareth Jones, Ronnie's dead daughter Danielle Jones' (Lauren Crace) adoptive brother, who has been plotting revenge on Ronnie as he blames her for Danielle's death. Despite Andy telling Roxy that his feelings for her were genuine, she firmly believes that he used her to get to Ronnie and she coldly tells him to leave. Roxy is then left further distraught along with Linda when Dean is later found not guilty, despite Roxy and Dean's mother Shirley giving testimony in court. Roxy struggles to be a good mother to Amy, especially when Ronnie suggests that Roxy take Amy shopping, but not knowing this, Jack books a trip to Paris, which upsets Roxy when she finds out, and when Roxy wants to buy an expensive gift for Amy's birthday, her credit card is declined. Roxy asks Ronnie to lend her the money, so Ronnie asks her to help Amy with her homework but afterwards Roxy says she enjoyed it so much she does not want any money for it. Roxy is then upset to discover that Ronnie and Jack plan to move out of London, taking Amy with them. Roxy is also angry when Jack decides to sell the house Ronnie and Roxy co-own, but he tells her she well get half of the money from the sale. Donna helps Roxy to realise that letting Amy live with Jack and Ronnie will be the best thing for Amy, but then Roxy suspects Jack of having an affair with Billy's partner Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) and tells Ronnie this, but Jack denies it. Roxy also agrees to move away to be near Amy but soon changes her mind. Roxy fears that Amy will not remember her, and she starts drinking heavily but when Phil tells her off and she forgets to collect Amy from school, she realises her problems and asks Donna if she can change. Donna suggests that the best thing she can do for Amy may be to allow Ronnie to adopt her. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees to the adoption. Roxy then starts using drugs again. On Ronnie's hen night, Roxy tells Ronnie that she is not going to the wedding and will be in Tenerife instead. Ronnie insists that Roxy is at the wedding and also asks her to move to Essex with her, Jack and Amy. A few nights later, Roxy embarrasses herself at the market traders' party after taking cocaine. She calls Glenda, who collects her. Roxy returns a day later to pack her things and refuses to go to Ronnie's wedding in fear she will ruin it, saying she is going to move in with Glenda and Danny. However, she changes her mind after Ronnie shows how much Roxy means to her. At the wedding, Roxy agrees to give Ronnie away but is uncertain once more, believing Ronnie needs to tell Jack the truth about Roxy moving away with them before marrying him. Ronnie dismisses this, but runs off in tears when walking down the aisle. Roxy makes Ronnie tell Jack, who understands that Ronnie needs Roxy and agrees to let Roxy come with them. At the wedding party, Roxy and Max dance and flirt, and she afterwards, they go to her room for sex but are interrupted by Ronnie, who asks Roxy to join her while Jack reads the children a bedtime story. Ronnie and Roxy reminisce about their time on the square and talk optimistically about their future whilst getting increasingly drunk. They find the hotel's swimming pool and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is shocked to see her unconscious at the bottom of the pool and attempts to rescue her, but her wedding dress weighs her down and she drowns alongside Roxy. Later, Jack is informed Roxy suffered a heart attack in the pool and he surmises cocaine was to blame. After their funerals, an inquest into the deaths concludes that Roxy drowned following a cardiac arrest when hitting the cold water and both deaths are ruled as misadventure, however, Jack still blames Roxy's drug use for Ronnie's death. In 2019, Roxy's ex- husband Sean returns to Walford and picks Amy from school. He hopes to reunite with Roxy, unaware of her death. Jack takes Sean to Ronnie and Roxy's grave where he reveals this to Sean. Jack blames Roxy's drug use for Ronnie's death which leads to them fighting by their grave. Sean wears his and Roxy's wedding ring and he later speaks to Roxy's gravestone where he tells her that he will join her. Roxy's voice is later heard when Sean replays an old voicemail left by Roxy when they were married. Other appearances Roxy appears in episode 9 of the second series of the Internet spin-off EastEnders: E20, as the landlady of Stevie Dickinson (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes) who lives in the flat above Roxy's salon. Stevie is due to move out but asks Roxy if she can stay. Roxy says no as there have been complaints and she caused a blackout across the entire Square. However, Stevie has made a list of safety violations in the flat and threatens to go to the council, so Roxy agrees to let her stay. Creation =Promotion= Both Mitchell sisters were featured heavily in a BBC marketing campaign. Several promos aired on the BBC network in summer 2007. Using the slogan \\"The square, under new management\\", one promo depicted both sisters as party girls, dancing, serving tequila in The Queen Victoria public house (The Vic), shocking the older residents with their raunchy antics and squirting men with a soda syphon to the tune of \\"The Girls\\" by Calvin Harris. This was later recreated during Ronnie's 2017 wedding to Jack where Roxy and Ronnie danced to The Girls once again spraying guests with soda syphon's, This was also their final episode together as they later died showing that they came in together and left together. Rita Simons portrayed Roxy. Two other trailers featured Ronnie and Roxy (Samantha Womack and Rita Simons) speaking individually. To the instrumental sound of \\"Little Green Bag\\" by George Baker (famously used in the Quentin Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs), each sister discussed their sibling, giving snippets of information on their personality and the dynamics of their relationship. Discussing Ronnie, Roxy said \\"My big sister Ronnie, she'd do anything to stop me getting hurt, including getting hurt herself. Boy she means business. We mean business. We're the Mitchell sisters after all... and you don't wanna find that out the hard way.\\" Discussing Roxy, Ronnie said \\"Roxy will always be my kid sister. Fights, broken hearts, over the years we've had them all. She can be quite a handful, and she's definitely gonna stir things up around here. But remember, wherever Roxy Mitchell is... I'm right behind.\\" The promotion was received favourably by Leigh Holmwood, television journalist for The Guardian newspaper and MediaGuardian.co.uk. He commented, \\"now there's more to the long running BBC1 soap, apparently...Yes, it's the new sexed-up, soft focus, raunchy EastEnders trailer and it's hitting your TV screens now. In a bid to welcome the Mitchell sisters to Albert Square, the beeb have pulled out all the stops and come up with a very slick marketing campaign indeed.\\" Referencing to the soap's reputation for being miserable and depressing, Holmwood said that the upbeat trailers were \\"about as un-EastEnders as you can get...Maybe the arrival of Roxy and Ronnie will herald a new golden age for the soap? Or maybe the BBC marketing department is just very good at putting a trailer together...\\" In addition to the trailers, the BBC also planned a \\"glitzy\\" EastEnders BBC Radio 1 competition to promote the arrival on the Mitchell sisters, called \\"I love R&R;\\" (Ronnie and Roxy). It ran from the end of June 2007, and included online promotion and video via the website iloverandr.com. The prize consisted of VIP tickets to a special party, which was to be attended by EastEnders actors and Radio 1 DJ Dave Pearce. Despite inviting the winners to attend, Radio 1 cancelled the event due to orders from BBC director general Mark Thompson, who called a halt to all BBC radio, TV and online competitions following a review of its programming, which uncovered scores of editorial breaches. Radio 1 reportedly decided to cancel the promotion as a \\"precautionary measure\\", though it is unknown whether the competition breached the BBC ban. Winners were instead told that they would be getting a tour of the EastEnders set, and the website was closed down on 26 July 2007. =Personality= Simons has described Roxy's insecurities, commenting: \\"whatever insecurities she's got, she has a shag\\". and GMTV date = 6 August 2008 Describing how real life crisises clash with work and her social life Development Discussing the storyline which saw Roxy sleep with Ronnie's boyfriend, Jack Branning, Simons has said: \\"This is by far the worst Roxy has ever felt in her entire life. The guilt is absolutely killing her. I really hope the viewers sympathise with her Filming was hard and it got to the stage where she couldn't even look at Sam without crying. What she's done to Ronnie is so out of order, but if she could take it back, she would.\\" Making it clear that what happened between Roxy and Jack was a one-off, she stated: \\"There's no lingering attraction between them [...] He makes Roxy's skin crawl.\\" Simons also considered the outcome were Ronnie to find out about the betrayal, speculating: \\"One thing the Mitchells are good at is sweeping things under the carpet. And these girls have been through so much together. Perhaps in time, Ronnie could find it in her heart to forgive Roxy...\\" She mentioned the character's relationship with friend Christian Clarke, assessing that Roxy would be \\"really lost without him. He's her rock\\". With the introduction of Roxy and Ronnie's mother, Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in 2010, Simons stated that Roxy had Archie's genes while Ronnie had Glenda's. Before Glenda's introduction, Archie is murdered by an unseen person, and Simons stated that she did not think Roxy was the killer, but said that in the last few days of Archie's life, she saw what he was really like, though she believed that Roxy would still forgive Archie regardless. In December 2010, Simons stated she hoped that Roxy would have a new romance, saying \\"She's supposed to be the slapper of the Square—but hardly. Okay, she slept with Jack Branning once, was married to Sean and had a thing with Dr Al for about five minutes. But she hasn't had a bit of stuff for ages, so I think she's due some romance. Not that there's anyone on the Square she fancies. [...] She wants nothing more than a ring on her finger and to settle down, but she's a loose cannon, so I don't think she's going to get that anytime soon.\\" Discussing Roxy's friendship with Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Simons told Soaplife that although Roxy flirts with Alfie, she would not steal him from his wife Kat (Jessie Wallace). Roxy is the only person to ask Alfie how he feels after the death of his son Tommy Moon, which Simons said showed how close Roxy and Alfie have become as friends. The actress commented, \\"She cares about Alfie and can see that a lot of what he's feeling is hidden behind his sparky exterior. She's a bit like that too.\\" In 2011, Roxy agrees to become a surrogate mother for Christian and his boyfriend Syed Masood. Simons explained that although Roxy would do anything for Christian out of love for him, she probably agrees for selfish reasons as well, as she is a single mother and wants what her friends have. She expressed a wish for Roxy to grow up and be less moody. Simons also said she wanted Roxy to be successful in a forthcoming revenge storyline following Roxy's discovery that Phil and Shirley stole her money, telling Soaplife magazine, \\"[The plan is] to steal back the money [Phil] stole from her. Glenda's in on it with Roxy and they plan to rob the club for what's rightfully Roxy's.\\" In April 2011, Roxy discovers that Ronnie swapped her dead baby, James, with Kat Moon's healthy son, Tommy. Speaking to Digital Spy, Simons discussed Roxy and Ronnie's relationship and how Ronnie's crime affects them. She stated that Roxy is loyal to Ronnie, despite Ronnie's mistakes, and would stand by her, but has conflicting feels as she finds it hard to come to terms with what Ronnie did. She called Roxy \\"quite a moral person\\", but her loyalty to her sister would most likely win. She said it is hard on their relationship, comparing it to when Roxy discovered that Ronnie was raped by their father as a child. Roxy tries to help release Ronnie from prison, and Simons said the storyline marks a transition for Roxy as she starts to grow up and stand on her own feet with Ronnie out of her every-day life. =Relationship with Alfie Moon= In March 2012, Roxy realises that she is in love with Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie and Roxy share a strong friendship and Roxy starts to see him as her \\"ideal man\\". After a confrontation with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), Roxy goes to see Alfie and they have a heart-to-heart which leads Alfie to hug Roxy, making her realise that she is in love with him. Richie admitted that he did not want Alfie to cheat on Kat with Roxy. Alfie was tipped to face temptation as the storyline developed. Speaking to an Inside Soap writer, Richie commented \\"As far as Alfie's concerned, he's a happily married man. He can see that Roxy is flirting with him, but he just thinks she's being friendly. They've got a great friendship and enjoy some good banter together, but Alfie banters with half of Albert Square.\\" The following month, it was revealed that Roxy would confess her feelings to Alfie. Simons stated that she did not want Roxy and Alfie to have an affair, saying \\"Roxy knows it can't happen, but she can't help being in love with him. She leaves The Vic and says she just can't work there any longer. She just decides she has to leave because he goes on and on about Kat. It's too much for her.\\" Simons added that she wanted the storyline to be \\"slow-burning\\". Simons later admitted that she does not know whether she will be sharing an on-screen kiss with Richie. Speaking to Press Association, Simons commented \\"It's been lovely to work with Shane, he's a great actor. We haven't had a kissing scene yet, I don't know if we will. He's a very generous actor.\\" Roxy later daces more heartbreak when her friend Christian Clarke (John Partridge) says that Alfie does not love her, leading to Roxy denying this saying that there is definitely something between them. It was revealed that Roxy will confess her feeling for Alfie to his wife Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) when she returns to the square. A source told the Daily Star Sunday \\"Everyone has been eagerly awaiting Kat's return to Albert Square and it doesn't disappoint. Roxy confesses all in a bid to stay on friendly terms with Kat and Alfie. He then decides the best distraction would be to set up a football team.\\" Kat manages to keep her temper following Roxy's revelations but warns her that she is not to do any further shifts in the pub and is to leave immediately, leading to Roxy moving on from Alfie. =Departure and death= On 18 August 2016, it was reported that Roxy would be leaving the series in 2017 along with Ronnie after executive producer Sean O'Connor chose to write them both out. A spokesperson said: \\"We can confirm that Rita Simons will be leaving EastEnders. Having joined the show in 2007, Rita immediately won the hearts of the audience in the role of Roxy Mitchell and between her and Samantha Womack they created one of the most iconic duos EastEnders has ever seen. Alongside Samantha, Rita was recently offered to take part in the same big storyline that will see the Mitchell sisters depart Walford forever, but we will not be releasing any further details at this time. We wish Rita all the best for the future.\\" Following the 1 January 2017 episode in which Ronnie and Roxy drown in a swimming pool, the BBC released a 10-second alternate ending clip on their Snapchat account, in which Ronnie survives, finding Roxy's corpse on a pool table with Jack. It then cuts to a hospital where Ronnie is shown grieving when Roxy dies in hospital from a suspected drug overdose. Reception Rita Simons won the 'Best Newcomer' award at the Digital Spy Soap Awards in 2008 for the part of Roxy and also collected an award at the Dublin awards and the TV Now awards. She also won the National Television Award 2008 for Best Newcomer. Singer Duncan James said that he watches EastEnders to follow Roxy. Speaking to Inside Soap, James said \\"I like to watch the show and see what they're doing with her character. Purely because Rita is one of my best friends.\\" In August 2017, Simons and Womack were longlisted for Best Exit at the Inside Soap Awards, while Roxy and Ronnie's deaths were longlisted for Best Show-Stopper. Both nominations made their shortlists, but Simons did not win any awards.

Today's contemporary theatres produce a variety of plays and musicals that attract very different audiences. In full theatrical productions there are a great number of people working towards many types of shows. A producer acquires financing, hires staff and oversees everything from the beginning to the end of each show. Theatrical staff is separated by department, which varies from theatre to theatre and production to production depending on needs. The production will employ front of house and back of house staff. In addition to performers, stage hands, stage managers, lighting and sound technicians, many theatres will hire ushers, concessions workers, janitorial and security in mounting a theatrical production. Theatrical productions may also involve other types of performance exhibitions, which include improvisational, skit and parody performances which involve varying levels of involvement from off-camera staff or assistants in order to create the production.

On 14 February 1990, an Airbus A320-231 registered as VT- EPN, crashed onto a golf course while attempting to land at Bangalore, killing 92 of 146 people. The Indian investigative team ruled that the probable cause was the pilots selecting the \\"Open descent/flight idle\\" control mode rather than \\"Glideslope capture\\", allowing the aircraft to sink far below the correct flight path. They further failed to advance the throttles or pull up even after the radio altitude call-outs, as the aircraft approached landing. The report stated that the crew of Flight 605 weren’t aware of the situation and the danger they were facing at the time, resulting in delayed reaction during the descent. After the crash, the Indian investigation committee issued 62 recommendations to the Indian DGCA (Director General of Civil Aviation), including a time recording on the ATC tapes and the formation of several investigative committees specializing in several aviation operational issues. Included in the recommendation was the addition of a crash siren in Bangalore, evaluation of the evacuation doors and slides in Airbus airplanes, and a design change on their instrument knob. The report also urged the government to evaluate every airport in India to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The crash drew criticism among the Indian Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) which claimed that the Airbus A320 had severe flaws. They claimed that the aircraft's systems were too confusing and that the crew of Flight 605 was struggling to avert the crash. Another A320 accident less than two years later (which occurred under similar circumstances) led to design improvements to the flight control unit and numerous safety recommendations. Flight =Take-off and approach= Flight 605 took off from Bombay Airport at 11:58 local time after an hour delay. Prior to this, the aircraft was used for two other flights on the day of the accident, operating as Flight 669 and Flight 670, flying from Bombay to Goa and back. The aircraft was an Airbus A320-231 registered in India as VT-EPN, carrying 139 passengers and 7 crew members, including 4 infants. The aircraft's assigned route was on route W17 from Bombay to Belgaum via Karad and W56 from Belgaum to Bangalore. The take- off phase and en route phase proceeded normally. At 12:53 local time, Flight 605's radar plot appeared on Bangalore's radar. Flight 605 was asked by Bangalore Radar to turn right and make a visual approach to Runway 09. The crew disengaged the autopilot and later changed to the Bangalore Tower after being transferred by Bangalore Radar. =Crash= While Flight 605 was attempting to land, the pilots flew far below the glideslope, and the landing gear touched down on the grounds of the Karnataka Golf Club, approximately 2,800 ft from the airport. Most people on the aircraft, including some crew members, thought that the aircraft had touched down on the runway as it was similar to its normal landing. Flight 605 then bounced and shortly later impacted the ground for the second time. The impact caused several people's seat belts to fail, leading people to be thrown from their seats and hit the aircraft's floor. Flight 605 later struck a 12-ft embankment. Both the engines and landing gear detached from the aircraft. The aircraft then flew over a road and crashed into a grassy, rocky area near the airport. =Search and rescue= After the crash, a post-impact fire started and the survivors began to escape from the burning wreckage. Several people managed to get out of the plane from an opening in the aircraft's fuselage. The surviving cabin crew opened the emergency door on the airplane and began to evacuate the survivors. 92 people, consisting of 88 passengers and 4 crew, perished in the crash, while 54 survived, all with injuries. Two people succumbed to their injuries after the accident. According to eyewitnesses, no fire service units reached the crash site as there was no RT communication facility between the tower and firefighting vehicles. A portable radio transmitter was available for communication between the tower and the aerodrome fire station, but was not serviceable on the day of the accident. Passengers and crews Flight 605 carried 139 passengers and 7 crew members, consisting of 2 cockpit crew and 5 cabin crew. There were 4 infants aboard the flight. The pilot who controlled the flight was Indian national Captain Cyril Fernandez at 46 years old. He joined Indian Airlines in 1977 as a pilot and was promoted to the position of co-pilot. Eventually, he became Captain of a Hawker Siddeley HS 748. In 1983, Fernandez obtained a Boeing 737 co-pilot rating, followed by a Captain rating in 1984. Fernandez became the co-pilot of an Airbus A320 in 1989. Fernandez had a total flying experience of 9,307 hours, of which 68 hours were spent on the Airbus A320. According to the report, Captain Fernandez was under supervision as he was undergoing the first of 10 route checks required for qualification to Captain. During the flight, he was seated in the left seat. The pilot who supervised Captain Fernandez was Indian national Captain Satish Gopujkar at 44 years old. He joined Indian Airlines in 1969 and was employed as a co-pilot on a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 from 1971–1981, later flying the plane as a Captain. In 1981, he obtained a Boeing 737 co-pilot rating and later, a pilot in command rating in 1983. In 1989, he was promoted as a co- pilot on an Airbus A320. Captain Gopujkar had a total flying experience of 10,340 hours, of which 255 hours were on the Airbus A320. During the flight, he was carrying out the duties of both the co-pilot and the check pilot. Before Flight 605, Captain Gopujkar was involved in a taxiing incident in Cochin, although he was not blamed for the incident. During Flight 605, he was seated in the right seat. Casualties 92 people were killed in the crash, including Captain Gopujkar and Captain Fernandez. According to official reports: amongst the 54 injured people, at least 20 had suffered head injuries, 32 suffered lower limb injuries, while 7 sustained thoracic injuries. Details in the report revealed that most of the dead suffered major trauma during the crash. At least 81 victims were revealed to have suffered shock and burn injuries. The report then stated that several passengers may have been too injured to move, leaving them physically unable to escape from the burning wreckage. They may have survived the impact, but due to the injuries they suffered during the crash, they couldn't escape. The report stated that most people seated near the emergency exits and slides survived the crash. As most survivors and victims of the crash suffered head and leg injuries, the investigative team stated that those injuries might have occurred to the passengers (and some of the crew) onboard as a result of the inadequate leg room. In addition, during the crash, several seats were thrust forward, causing several passengers' head to slam into the back of the seat in front of them. Investigation The Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered a full-scale investigation into the crash. The Indian AAIB and the Canadian TSB were involved in the investigation. On 19 February, investigators visited the crash site and inspected the wreckage of the aircraft. They noted that the front part of the aircraft was destroyed during its impact with the embankment. A subsequent fire led to the total destruction of the aircraft. =Initial inspection= Investigators then inspected the flight controls of Flight 605, viz. the rudder, the ailerons, the trimmable horizontal stabilizer, the flaps and slats, and several other flight controls. However, they didn't find any abnormalities on these controls. Control failure was ruled out as a possible cause of the crash. According to investigators, they also ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash, as there were no signs of an onboard explosion during the approach and there was no evidence of explosives on board. =FDR and CVR analysis= After the discovery of the FDR and the CVR, investigators decoded and analyzed its contents. Investigators made an analysis based on both flight recorders as follows: Flight 605 was approaching Bangalore Airport in 'open descent' mode. In this mode, the aircraft engines are at the idle throttle. People would notice this since the engines seem to turn silent, and the plane appears to be sinking bit by bit. The crew of Flight 605 disengaged the autopilot when sighting the runway of Bangalore Airport. They later made contact with Bangalore Tower. At 01:40 pm local time, the aircraft display indicated that the plane’s altitude had been just under 5000 feet and its approach path was 600 ft higher than the normal glide path. Captain Fernandez noticed this and requested for a go-around. He would climb to 6000 ft, do another circle and come back better aligned to the normal glide path. The check pilot, Captain Gopujkar then responded to his request: “Do you want a go around? Or do you want vertical speed?” Captain Fernandez chose to proceed with the vertical speed option. If the pilots had proceeded with the go-around, the emergency that was to follow could have been averted. Since the plane was a little higher than the normal glide path, Captain Fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of 1000 ft/min, instead of the normal rate of 700 ft/min. This faster descent increased the aircraft speed to 275 km/hr — higher than the recommended speed of 240 km/hr — but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path. The aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode — the correct mode for landing. Captain Gopujkar then checked the landing checklist. After completing the checklist, he asked the cabin crew to be seated at their stations. Realizing that the aircraft had regained its normal glide path, Captain Gopujkar reported at 01:42 that he had now selected a “700 ft rate of descent”. However, instead of choosing the vertical speed knob, he accidentally chose the altitude knob. So, instead of inputting an order for a 700 ft rate of descent to the Airbus A320, he made an order to put the aircraft on an altitude of 700 ft. The cockpit of an Airbus A320. The ten control knobs are shown. The vertical speed knob and the altitude knob are located next to each other and have a similar design. This might have led to the confusion. Because of Captain Gopujkar's action, the aircraft went back to the 'open descent' mode, causing the throttle to be in the idle position. The absence of engine power on the aircraft led to a decrease of the aircraft's speed, and the plane began descending more quickly. Despite the impending disaster, the crew of Flight 605 seemed to not be aware of it. The plane's radio altimeter then sounded: \\"400 ft\\". This probably alerted Captain Gopujkar in some way because he suddenly observed: “You are descending on idle open descend eh, all this time!”. And as the altimeter called out “300 ft”, Captain Gopujkar asked: “You want flight directors off now?”. Captain Fernandez confirmed that his flight director had been put off, Captain Gopujkar's however, hadn't. If both the flight directors had been put off at that point, the plane would have gone to the speed mode, sensing that speed was dropping, and enough engine power could have been generated for a possible recovery even at that late stage. The plane continued to hurtle downwards. When the plane was only 135 ft from the ground, Captain Fernandez suddenly realized the gravity of the situation and exclaimed: “Hey, we’re going down!”. Captain Gopujkar, himself stunned now, could only respond with “Oh, shit!” Those were his last recorded words. Captain Fernandez then ordered an immediate TOGA (Take-off Go-around). However, this action was too late. The aircraft did lift from the ground, however, it failed to clear a 12-ft embankment and crashed. Investigators stated that if this action had been taken 2 seconds earlier, the disaster could have been averted. =Court's findings= The High Court of Karnataka reported that the accident was caused by the pilots failing to realize the gravity of the situation and failing to respond by immediately advancing the throttles, even after the radio altitude callouts of “Four Hundred,” “Three Hundred” and “Two Hundred” feet, despite knowing that the plane was in idle/open descent mode. Controversy India's investigative team concluded that pilot error was the cause of the accident, which was supported by Airbus Industrie. However, the India Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) disputed the report, claiming that a design flaw on the Airbus A320 was the cause of the crash. The ICPA stated that the senior Captain of the flight, Captain Gopujkar, wouldn't have made the series of mistakes and stated that there was no proof that he made the faulty setting since the flight data recorder didn't record such mistakes. The association also believes that the engines went into idle power because of a major system defect. Even when Gopujkar tried to shut his director off, it didn't respond. They also claimed that the time lag of 0.5 seconds for the auto-thrust controls to act proved to be disastrous. At the time, the Airbus A320 was relatively new, having just been launched in 1988. Its main difference from other aircraft was that it used fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. In a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator; so if the pilot opened the throttle more, the actuator immediately gave the pilot more power. In the A320 however, the pilot’s command is first directed to an onboard computer — and the actuator responds only when the computer determines that it is okay to do so. Before the crash of Flight 605, an Airbus A320 had been involved in another crash, Air France Flight 296. Official investigations determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error. However, the pilot blamed the plane's fly-by-wire system for the crash. This claim caused a major controversy about the Airbus A320.  Aftermath  Less than two years after the crash of Flight 605, the A320 suffered another fatal accident when Air Inter Flight 148 crashed in France killing 87 people. The cause was also a CFIT like 605. The investigation of Flight 148 harshly criticized the Airbus A320's cockpit design. In response, changes were made to the Flight Control Unit panel display; the French aviation safety authority issued 34 recommendations.

In fact, the more faces a Waterman polyhedron has, the more it resembles its circumscribed sphere in volume and total area. With each point of 3D space we can associate a family of Waterman polyhedra with different values of radii of the circumscribed spheres. Therefore, from a mathematical point of view we can consider Waterman polyhedra as 4D spaces W(x, y, z, r), where x, y, z are coordinates of a point in 3D, and r is a positive number greater than 1.Visualizing Waterman Polyhedra with MuPAD by M. Majewski Seven origins of cubic close(st) packing (CCP) There can be seven origins defined in CCP,7 Origins of CCP Waterman polyhedra by Mark Newbold where n = {1, 2, 3, …}: * Origin 1: offset 0,0,0, radius sqrt(2n) * Origin 2: offset 1/2,1/2,0, radius sqrt(2+4n)/2 * Origin 3: offset 1/3,1/3,2/3, radius sqrt(6(n+1))/3 * Origin 3*: offset 1/3,1/3,1/3, radius sqrt(3+6n)/3 * Origin 4: offset 1/2,1/2,1/2, radius sqrt(3+8(n-1))/2 * Origin 5: offset 0,0,1/2, radius sqrt(1+4n)/2 * Origin 6: offset 1,0,0, radius sqrt(1+2(n-1)) Depending on the origin of the sweeping, a different shape and resulting polyhedron are obtained. Image:Waterman Overview.png Relation to Platonic and Archimedean solids Some Waterman polyhedra create Platonic solids and Archimedean solids. For this comparison of Waterman polyhedra they are normalized, e.g. has a different size or volume than but has the same form as an octahedron. =Platonic solids= *Tetrahedron: W1 O3*, W2 O3*, W1 O3, W1 O4 *Octahedron: W2 O1, W1 O6 *Cube: W2 O6 *Icosahedron and dodecahedron have no representation as Waterman polyhedra. =Archimedean solids= *Cuboctahedron: W1 O1, W4 O1 *Truncated octahedron: W10 O1 *Truncated tetrahedron: W4 O3, W2 O4 *The other Archimedean solids have no representation as Waterman polyhedra. The W7 O1 might be mistaken for a truncated cuboctahedron, as well W3 O1 = W12 O1 mistaken for a rhombicuboctahedron, but those Waterman polyhedra have two edge lengths and therefore do not qualify as Archimedean solids. Generalized Waterman polyhedra Generalized Waterman polyhedra are defined as the convex hull derived from the point set of any spherical extraction from a regular lattice. Included is a detailed analysis of the following 10 lattices – bcc, cuboctahedron, diamond, fcc, hcp, truncated octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, simple cubic, truncated tet tet, truncated tet truncated octahedron cuboctahedron. Each of the 10 lattices were examined to isolate those particular origin points that manifested a unique polyhedron, as well as possessing some minimal symmetry requirement. From a viable origin point, within a lattice, there exists an unlimited series of polyhedra. Given its proper sweep interval, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between each integer value and a generalized Waterman polyhedron.

Boazum, 1774.] from 1774 was long said to have motivated Eise Eisinga to build his famous planetarium. According to the canonicised view, Alta stated that the upcoming conjunction of the planets with the sun would herald the apocalypse, and through his planetarium, Eisinga was able to prove that in fact, the conjunction would not take place. Modern research has however come to the more prosaic conclusion that Eisinga was mainly motivated by practical motives - most of all not having to calculate the orbits and respective positions of the planets and the sun on paper, but instead using his planetarium as a reference.Huib J.

It takes place at the beginning of August at Pendley Manor, a hotel in Tring, Hertfordshire. History The first official festival took place in 1949 with a production of King Henry VIII, although there had been less formal presentations in the two preceding years. In 1954, the festival took its current format, when a second production was added. The credit for the festival's initiation must go to Dorian Williams. Williams was a popular sports commentator for the BBC, especially expert in Show-Jumping. Pendley Manor was his family home (it only became a hotel in later years) and he helped oversee the development of part of the house into an adult education centre. The drama group that met in the centre performed the first, non-official festival in 1947 and Williams himself often acted and directed in the early festivals. =Past productions= Dorian Williams as Bolingbroke in Richard II.

These include: * Lynda Bellingham * Stephen Campbell Moore * Silas Carson * Raza Jaffrey * Caroline Quentin * Hermione Norris * Luke Newberry Stages =The Glade Stage= The majority of Productions prior to 2001 were given on what became known as The Glade Stage, a natural raised stage in the grounds of the Manor, west-facing, flanked by two magnificent 100 ft high Canadian Firs. Dramatic entrances made on horse back down the glade were common. =The Formal Stage= A second natural raised stage, facing south was used in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1968, 1970, 1980 and 1981. This stage had a backdrop of Yew hedges, characters would make their entrances and exits through gaps between the hedges. =Rose Garden= In 1989 during the conversion of the Manor House into a Hotel, a production of The Merchant of Venice was presented raised above the Rose Garden, on the south side of the Manor, with the Manor itself as a backdrop. The Garden Stage and seating stand, 2006 =The Williams Stage= In 2001, a swimming pool and leisure centre were added to the Hotel. The electricity that this facility drew from the substation, compromised the power available for the Festival. This compromise, alongside increased demand for the Hotel's wedding facilities located within earshot of the Glade Stage, meant the Festival had to be both downsized in terms of its power requirements, and also relocated away from the wedding facilities. The Garden Stage sits in front of a leafy bank, alongside the Rose Garden, and the seating stand is placed on the tennis courts. Although this smaller, more intimate stage, may lack some of the grandeur of the larger stages, many believe it doesn't lack any of the magic. Current status The festival has continued to grow in popularity, maintaining its reputation as one of the most significant amateur Shakespeare festivals in England. The festival saw record attendances in 2004 when it staged A Midsummer Night's Dream and Twelfth Night, two of the most popular plays in the Shakespeare canon. This year's productions (August 2015) - The 66th Festival - will be Twelfth Night and Henry V. The current Artistic Director of the Festival is Sarah Branston. Director of Drama at Reigate Grammar School, she is also an excellent director of Shakespeare; visionary and dramatic. Her productions (Twelfth Night - 1998, Romeo and Juliet - 1999, and since becoming Artistic Director - Henry V - 2001, The Winter's Tale - 2003, A Midsummer Night's Dream - 2004, King Lear - 2006, The Merchant of Venice - 2008, Richard III - 2010, Much Ado About Nothing - 2012 and Hamlet - 2014) are considered by regular festival-goers to be amongst the finest in the history of the event. Her parents, John and Jennie Branston, actually met at a festival over thirty years ago and have been attending ever since. John has directed several productions and both John and Jennie frequently play small, character roles.

He then served Frederick III, Duke of Lorraine. He was preparing to go on crusade when his father died. In 1284 Joan I of Navarre, Countess of Champagne married the future Philip IV of France.

The congregation was organized in 1849, and its first building was dedicated on November 3, 1850. The parish patron is Saint Francis de Sales. The cornerstone was laid June 30, 1878, by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell, in the presence of nearly 10,000 persons. The edifice was dedicated December 20, 1879. The interior contains one of the finest altars in the United States, costing $20,000. The parent parishes were St. Mary's Church in Over-the-Rhine and St. Paul Church in Pendleton. The original congregation was mostly German. The main altar at St. Francis de Sales was consecrated by Archbishop W.H. Elder on April 27, 1887. It was a gift of Joseph Kleine and his wife Agnes Kleine, and was sculpted by Fred and Henry Schroeder of Cincinnati from designs by A. Kloster of New York. The altar of pure white Rutland marble and the white marble floor cost $20,000. The altar's onyx pillars and delicate Gothic spires are flanked by statues of SS.

The species is endemic to Australia. Stimson's pythons are sold and kept as pets in some Australian states. Taxonomy Lawrence Alec Smith described the species in 1985. Both the specific name, stimsoni, and the common name, Stimson's python, are in honour of herpetologist Andrew Francis Stimson of the Natural History Museum, London.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Antaresia stimsoni, p. 254). Antaresia stimsoni is commonly and incorrectly referred to as Stimpson's python (Antaresia stimpsoni). The species is also called the large-blotched python, for the patterns of its markings, or an inland children's python, in reference to its genus. Four species are currently recognized in the genus Antaresia, which is contained by the family Pythonidae; infraspecific ranks have also been described. All Children's pythons were previously place in the genus Liasis, but this was revised by authors in the 1980s. The new genus Antaresia was proposed by Wells and Wellington, but their name for this species, Antaresia saxacola, was withheld from acceptance due to a petition before the ICZN. When this dispute was resolved in 1991, and the genus name already in use, L. A. Smith's epithet stimsoni had appeared in several publications. While the nomenclatural validity of Antaresia stimsoni is questionable, this is the current and accepted name. A new subspecies, A. s. orientalis was also described by Smith (1985), but not recognized as valid by Barker and Barker (1994). However, the list of taxa maintained by the Western Australian Museum names two subspecies. The Western Australian subspecies, A. stimsoni stimsoni, occurs in coastal regions and the interior of the state.Antaresia stimsoni stimsoni ISIS abstract Large-blotched python, Range: Western Australia Description A species of the family Pythonidae, non- venomous snakes that trap and asphyxiate prey. It is contained by a group without well developed heat-sensing pits, these are only found at the lips. Small and terrestrial, adults grow up to about in length. They have 35-49 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 240-305 ventral scales and 30-45 subcaudal scales. The subcaudals are mostly or entirely divided, while the anal scale is single. Distribution and habitat This species is found in Australia from the coast of Western Australia through central regions of all states (except Victoria) as far as the Great Dividing Range, but is not found in the far north, extreme south, or east. The type locality given is \\"15 km SE of Nullagine, Western Australia, in 21°58'S, 120°12'E\\" [Australia]. It also is found on Dirk Hartog Island. It occurs throughout many dry, inland areas, mainly in rocky areas, but also in Eucalyptus woodlands, arid shrublands, and deserts. Occurrence in open or flat areas is unusual. Behavior Generally nocturnal, the species occupies crevices, hollows, and holes made by other creatures in termite mounds, the latter offering a controlled climate. A. stimsoni is an ambush predator, spending much of its time waiting for prey, trapping and killing by constriction. It is often recorded at rocky hills or other habitat providing good cover. Feeding The diet consists of small lizards, frogs, and mammals. Like other snakes, they can go without food for several months. Reproduction Oviparous, with females laying clutches of 7-10 eggs. Females incubate their eggs in typical python fashion by wrapping their bodies around the clutch, leaving only to warm in the sun or when the eggs have hatched. In captivity The species is kept as a pet and successfully bred in captivity. It is easily handled and rarely bites, and is listed as an easily maintained, not rare or endangered, and commercially available pet herpetofauna (formerly category 3 Now category B as of 2018) in the Western Australian Government's Gazette (2013).Wildlife Conservation (Reptiles and Amphibians) (Pet Herpetofauna) Notice 2003 made per Wildlife Conservation (Reptiles and Amphibians) Regulations 2002 Western Australia Biodiversity Conservation Regulations (2018) In 2009, four baby Stimson's pythons escaped on board a Qantas airplane, resulting in it being fumigated. Stimson's pythons should have a warm and slightly damp terrarium which may include lightly spraying the terrarium once per fortnight. Aspen and wood shavings would make an ideal substrate for this particular snake.

Since its inception as a combat tracker team in 1986, the unit gradually expanded into a brigade consisting of several regiments. It is one of the top- secret units in the Sri Lanka Army. History The Sri Lanka Army Special Forces Regiment evolved from an organisation initially known as the \\"Combat Tracker Team\\". At its inception in 1985, this force had two officers and 38 men and was tasked with carrying out small group operations deep inside LTTE territory. This Combat Tracker Team was led by Major (later Major General) G. Hettiarachchi from the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps (SLAC) and Lieutenant (later Colonel) A. F. Lafir. After the formation of the Special Service Group (SSG), the Combat Tracker Team became the SSG's reconnaissance element. The SSG was ultimately disbanded, and after this, the Combat Tracker Team changed its name to the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) (Special Force) and operated independently. Following several successful operations, the RDF was gradually expanded to four squadrons. In December 1988, the RDF (SF) was officially designated as the 1st Regiment Special Forces. At present the Special Forces consists of a Regimental Centre, SF Brigade, Training School, four battalions, and the Regimental Headquarter Battalion – Special Forces.

Selection Passing selection training to join the Sri Lankan Army Special Forces is extremely tough,[citation needed] but the regiment does not aim to break the men or shatter their morale, what it wants recruits who can think ahead with initiative and a strong drive of determination to accomplish mission objectives.[citation needed] To this end the regiment has devised a very thorough shifting process, one that ensures that only the right men and highest quality applicants are selected.[citation needed] Training is punishing to ensure that the Sri Lankan Army Special Forces Regiment remains a high quality revolutionary outfit in the country. The Selection test consists of several stages such as Weapons handling, underwater training, Close-Combat training, Live Ammunition training, Jungle warfare, survival, Reconnaissance, Sniper training etc. After undergoing basic military training, recruits are deployed into several treacherous terrains such as jungles without any equipment or weapons and are ordered to survive for a period as specified by the relevant instructors (usually 45–60 days). The recruits who succeed this initial selection test are given several more selection tests based on physical fitness such as Sprinting 50 miles (80 Kilometers) within 12 hours without equipment, sprinting 5 miles (8 kilometers) within 40 minutes with equipment, mountain climbing, underwater diving etc. The recruits who pass these physical fitness selection tests are selected for special warfare training.The Recruits who qualify the special warfare training are given furthermore specialized training according to the special operative type they prefer. However, when selecting operatives for the LRRP (Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols) only the current(Active) servicemen of the Sri Lanka Army are admitted for selection with a service record and a medical report suiting the specifications of that of the LRRP selection course.[1][2] Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol The Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) is designated as covert operations unit of the Sri Lanka Army. This unit is operated under the Directorate of Military Intelligence of the Army and for this LRRP, it is believed to be composed of personnel from the Commando Regiment and Special Forces Regiment.

Insignia The insignia depicts an Eagle and has been regarded as a symbol of courage and warlike qualities, a sine qua non for any member of the Special Forces. The superior imposition of the eagle indicates the ability of the unit of scooping towards its prey. It is well equipped for its task with its hooked beak. Wonderful keen eyes help to locate the target, powerful wings help to rush to the target, curved talons help to grab the target and the hooked beak helps to destroy the target. All these features have been adapted to meet its requirements. Brig. G. Hettiarachchi was a Major when he raised the Special Forces Regiment Four sharp arrows are placed on the background of the insignia, pointing to either side. These depict the regiments basic concept of a 4-man team and its capability of deep penetration (LRRP) into enemy territory and operating in small groups whose skills and have been sharpened as an arrow's head. Placing them crossing each other is intended to give the idea of combined strength and mutual support within as well as with other forces in all types of operation.

Plot NATO Officer Andrea Rossi-Colombotti (Marcello Mastroianni) is a ladies' man with an unusual libido: he can only seduce women in situations where his life is in danger. The film begins with him breaking into a Corsican girlfriends house; the girl, armed and voluptuous, believes Andrea a criminal and nearly shoots him before being seduced, but she later ends their relationship in the light of such an incident. Later, while spending an afternoon with an Asian air stewardess, he tries to achieve arousal by making up a situation about a dying relative, but the stewardess learns the sham and the liaison ends disastrously. Having had enough of his condition and the continuing problems it brings him, Andrea goes to a psychiatrist and pours out everything. He developed his problem in adulthood, but all his life he has flirted with woman and suffered from the consequences. The psychiatrist, while slightly unhinged due to long association with the deranged, sensibly recommends that Andrea try to seek out spiritual qualities in women rather than their physical attributes, and to attempt to connect with them emotionally. Andrea heads off to Switzerland, where he meets an Alpine girl. Following the doctors advice, he doesn't seduce her but charms her and takes her out on romantic dates. Things go well between them and Andrea, attracted by the girl's sweetness, proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the night before their wedding, the couple visit a circus, where a beautiful lion tamer challenges anyone to kiss her in the middle of a group of lions. Andrea can't refuse such an offer, and gives the lion tamer the kiss of her life, bringing an effective close to his Swiss romance. Andrea next entangles with an American woman, the wife of a major who happens to be his superior. This potentially dangerous and passionate affair is blown quickly, and Andrea gets posted to Sicily, where he encounters a Sicilian girl from a fierce-tempered honorable family. The girls family accuses her of not being pure, and Andrea poses as a doctor in order to check on her, but in fact takes advantage of the dangerous opportunity to seduce her. The family catches him in the act and chase after him, and with much difficulty he escapes. Andrea now takes the only alternative he knows: he returns to his Italian hometown and to Gigliola, his first ever sweetheart, who still resides there. He had left Gigliola when he joined the army, and as a result she was heartbroken and lovelorn; however, she still loves him, and he hopes that her love will aid him in overcoming his problem. When she hears about Andrea's condition and his attempts to cure it, she pledges to give herself to him if it will make him stop with other women. Andrea, however, cannot bear to seduce a woman he truly loves and instead spends the night with a pedicure who is reputed to bring ill fortune to her men. Andrea's next woman is a countess, whose husband is much older than she is and moreover suffers from deafness. She lures him into a plot to murder her husband: they will seat him under a heavy and delicately balanced stone ball atop a wall. At the slightest shock, the ball will fall on top of him. Aroused by such a dangerous venture, he consents (not planning to carry out the actual murder). The count's deafness, however, is a sham, and having heard the plan, he tries to turn it upon Andrea: he adjusts the ball to become even more unsteady, and convinces Andrea to take his seat. But the seat itself breaks under Andrea's weight and while the count sets up a new one, Andrea accidentally slams a door and causes the ball to fall on the count. Andrea is put on trial for his supposed crime, which attracts wide publicity and interest. Practically every woman he has encountered in the course of the film turns up at the court to speak about Andrea; however, Gigliola is the only woman who believes in his innocence and attempts to defend him. The psychiatrist Andrea consulted is called upon, but while giving testimony he completely loses his mind. All Andrea himself can offer the court is an apology from the heart for his condition and the trouble its caused for all concerned. But at the eleventh hour, an autopsy reveals that the count had sound hearing, and since the count, if he could hear, should have taken better care, the crime is considered an accident and Andrea is acquitted. The film ends with Andrea and Gigliola happily married and settled down in a high-rise apartment in Milan. However, Andrea is still living with his condition, and to Gigliola's shock he attempts to break into their eighth-floor bedroom... Cast *Marcello Mastroianni ...

Since 1976, a new era of Chernavsky's creativity had begun when he entered mainstream in music. He worked as a musical director with Soviet vocal-instrumental ensembles Fantasy and Krasnye Maki (Red Poppies) and, later on, with rock and pop groups Carnival, Dinamik, and Vesyolye Rebyata (Jolly Fellows).

The bout was Tyson's first defense of the WBA title that he had won from Bruce Seldon on September 7 of that year. The referee officiating the fight was Mitch Halpern. The fight was promoted by Don King Productions and carried on pay-per-view by Showtime. The bout was the first fight pitting the two boxers against each other and it would be followed up with a controversial rematch. Background =Early years= Tyson and Holyfield got acquainted while preparing for the 1984 Summer Olympics, being both on the \\"losing squad,\\" second-ranked substitutes for their much higher regarded No. 1 teammates. However, Holyfield managed to beat Ricky Womack twice and qualify into the Olympic team, while Tyson did not make it, losing on points to Henry Tillman.Evander Holyfield tells SLTV how he feels about Mike Tyson today Afterward, Tyson took steps to become a power in the heavyweight division while Holyfield went on to win the bronze medal in Los Angeles. In 1986, Tyson became the youngest fighter ever to win a world heavyweight championship when he knocked Trevor Berbick out in the second round to win the World Boxing Council title as part of an ongoing series of fights designed to unify the belts of the WBC, WBA, and the International Boxing Federation and create an undisputed world champion. The next year, Tyson won the other two championships to become the first fighter since Leon Spinks to be an undisputed world heavyweight champion. Holyfield came up through the ranks of the light heavyweight division before making his name as a cruiserweight. In what was still a relatively young division -- having only been sanctioned as a title-holding weight class since 1979 -- Holyfield quickly became its first undisputed champion when he won all three major sanctioning bodies' titles. He moved up to heavyweight in 1988 and continued to work his way up the rankings. By 1990, he was looking to challenge Tyson and after some hard negotiating the two fighters would agree to a fight later that year. Tyson's loss to Buster Douglas, which he had intended as a tune-up fight for the Holyfield match, derailed those plans. Holyfield was given the first shot at the new champion and won in a third-round knockout. Tyson, meanwhile, entered into a fight with Canadian heavyweight contender Donovan Ruddock with the winner to face Holyfield. However, a controversial ending to the fight, which Tyson won by technical knockout, led to an immediate rematch and further delayed the showdown between Tyson and Holyfield. After Tyson won decisively, a fight was signed for November 18, 1991. An injury and Tyson's subsequent conviction for rape in 1992 indefinitely shelved the fight, as Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison. =Present day= Holyfield, meanwhile, went on to reign as undisputed champion until losing to Riddick Bowe in November 1992. He would regain the WBA and IBF titles from Bowe in a rematch the following year, then lost them to Michael Moorer in 1994. Holyfield was then forced to retire due to a misdiagnosed heart condition, only to come back a year later. He fought Bowe one more time in the fall, getting knocked out for the first time in his career, and then fought an overmatched former cruiserweight world champion Bobby Czyz and knocked him out. Tyson was released from prison in 1995 and resumed his career with great fanfare. He fought journeyman Peter McNeeley in his first fight and then, before a national television audience, knocked out fringe contender Buster Mathis, Jr.. The WBC installed him as its number one contender and ordered the winner of a fight between Oliver McCall, their champion who knocked out Lennox Lewis in 1994, and Frank Bruno, a veteran British contender who had fought and lost to Tyson during his first run as champion, to fight him in their next bout. Bruno defeated McCall by decision, but then was soundly beaten by Tyson within three rounds. Tyson would be stripped of the title for agreeing to fight WBA champion Bruce Seldon in his next fight instead of Lewis, the top contender. He knocked Seldon out in the first round and a fight was set up with Holyfield, who despite his former championship pedigree was regarded as past his prime. Preparing to fight Tyson, Holyfield employed Mike Weaver, the WBA ex-champion, as a personal assistant. He also employed David Tua, the WBC champion, whose style and anthropometrics were close to Tyson's, as a sparring partner. Undercard Showtime promoted the event as a heavyweight title tripleheader, as two other champions were defending their titles that night as well. In all, five (including Tyson's ) were contested for that night. Another promoted fight featured star women's boxer Christy Martin, who had gained some notoriety and was becoming a star; she defeated her opponent by knockout in one round. Undefeated WBC world minimumweight champion Ricardo Lopez knocked out contender Morgan Ndumo in the sixth round to retain his title. WBA super bantamweight champion Antonio Cermeno defeated challenger Eddy Saenz after his opponent decided not to continue following the fifth round. The first of the three heavyweight title fights followed. The IBF title match was contested with Michael Moorer taking on Francois Botha. Moorer had defeated Axel Schulz earlier in 1996 for the title that had been stripped from lineal champion George Foreman; Botha had defeated Schulz in an earlier fight for the vacant title but the result was vacated following a doping violation. Moorer knocked the previously undefeated Botha out in the final round to retain the title. The last fight before the main event was contested for the World Boxing Organization championship. Henry Akinwande, a British fighter who defeated Jeremy Williams for the title Riddick Bowe vacated to set up the third and last fight with Holyfield, took on former North American Boxing Federation champion Alexander Zolkin. Akinwande emerged victorious with a tenth round knockout in the first defense of his belt. The fight Tyson came out fast and sent Holyfield reeling with his first solid punch. Holyfield, who had studied Tyson's style intensively, later explained that Tyson dipped to his left, from which position he usually loaded up a left hook, but on this occasion surprised Holyfield by firing a right cross. Holyfield tied Tyson up and revealed the first surprise of the fight, his superior strength, as he pushed Tyson backwards. Tyson would never seriously hurt Holyfield for the remainder of the fight. Holyfield defended effectively for the rest of round one and hammered Tyson with several counterpunches. After the end of the round, Tyson threw a punch after the bell; an unintimidated Holyfield retaliated. In the second, Holyfield drove Tyson into the ropes and stung him with a hard combination, and his strategy for the match became clear. As Tyson mainly threw one punch at a time, Holyfield blocked the first attack, then used his strength to clinch, and shove Tyson backwards. Keeping Tyson on the back foot minimized his power and affected his balance, and gave Holyfield the opportunity to come forward and score with combinations to the head. As the rounds passed, Tyson was unable to adjust, and found himself being thoroughly outboxed. In the fifth round, Tyson landed a fierce combination, his best of the match, and Holyfield did not stagger. In the sixth, a headbutt from Holyfield (judged accidental by Halpern) opened a cut over Tyson's left eye, and Tyson also suffered a knockdown, as Holyfield caught him with a left hook to the chest as Tyson rushed in. Holyfield continued parrying Tyson's charges and catching him with punches to the head. With 15 seconds left in the seventh round, Tyson lunged at Holyfield as Holyfield came forward, resulting in a hard clash of heads. Tyson cried out in pain and his knees buckled, but again the referee judged the headbutt to be unintentional. Tyson was examined by the ring doctor, and tied Holyfield up for the rest of the round. During the next two rounds, Tyson continued missing wild punches and absorbing counterpunches from Holyfield. At the end of the tenth round, a punch from Holyfield sent Tyson staggering across the ring. Holyfield chased him into the ropes and landed a series of devastating blows. By the sound of the bell, Tyson was out on his feet and defenseless, but his corner allowed him out for the eleventh. Holyfield quickly landed another brutal extended combination, sending Tyson back into the ropes. Halpern had seen enough, and he stopped the fight, giving Holyfield one of the most famous upset victories in the history of boxing.Shetty, Sanjeev., Holyfield makes history, BBC Sports, 2001-12-26, Retrieved on 2007-04-17.

History From their introduction the 901 Class 2-4-0s put in excellent service on the Newcastle-Edinburgh and Newcastle-York runs hauling 160-170 ton loads. During 1884 engines based at Gateshead depot averaged 4,400 miles per month. Apart from minor instances of updating only two of the class underwent extensive rebuilding. More substantial modifications were made to the last of the Neilson-built engines. No. 933 which in 1907 was not only reboilered but converted into a 4-4-0 but was scrapped in 1914. It became one of 29 of the class withdrawn between 1913 and 1914 and, but for the onset of the first World War, the rest would have follow suit. Instead the curtailing of new construction led to a shortage of motive power and new work was found for the 901 Class. Some were drafted on to the coastal line between Scarborough and Bridlington but the majority were stationed at Darlington. From here they worked passenger services over the Stainmore route to Kirkby Stephen, Penrith and Tebay. Darlington also kept them on as pilots. By 1923 only ten of the class remained and the now preserved No.910 was amongst the final five to be withdrawn from service. 910 was displayed by the NER when new at the 50th anniversary of Steam on the Stockton and Darlington railway in 1875, by the LNER at the 100th anniversary in 1925, and again by British Railways at the 150th anniversary in 1975.

Village name  Over the years it has been known by many names: *Culinge - 11th century. *Culinges - 1195. *Cooling - David Elisha Davy in the early 19th century. The name probably means the home or settlement of Culs or Cula's people.  The village  Cowlinge village encompasses a large area of countryside and the local parish stretches some three miles (5 km) from its northern border with Lidgate to its southern border near HMP Highpoint, formerly Stradishall airfield. Its north-west border is the county boundary between Suffolk and the parish of Kirtling in Cambridgeshire. At this end of the parish is the estate of Branches Park, which was laid out by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown. The great mansion, which was the home of the Dickins, Usborne and other families has unfortunately been demolished but has been replaced by three large residences. The Three Tuns Inn, Cowlinge. The oldest building in the village is the mediaeval Church of St. Margaret of Antioch. This lovely building was built approximately 650 years ago and is still in regular use for Christian worship. The building has evolved over the years and is the product of a great deal of love and care which people of many periods and traditions have lavished upon it. The 19th century former village school is now a private residence. At the centre of the village is the Freehouse - Public House The Three Ways currently owned and run by Sue and Chris Smith. Another prominent feature in the village is the WWI Memorial situated at Tillbrooks Hill and bordering Queen Street.

The maximum age documented for a typical striped grass mouse in captivity is 4.8 years. Distribution This species is native to Central and Western Africa. It is widespread in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Angola, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DRCongo, Tanzania, Zambia and Malawi. Habitat This species lives in deforested areas, grasslands, secondary forest and savanna up to 1,700 meters above sea level.

As of 2019, he had published seven books; his work published in 2006 was noted as among the best of the year by several major publications. He published a book of essays in 2006 on Native American fiction that stirred controversy by criticizing major writers of the tradition and concluding, \\"Native American fiction does not exist.\\" Interested in language preservation, Treuer and his brother Anton are working on an Ojibwe language grammar. Early life and education David Treuer was born in Washington, D.C. His mother, Margaret Seelye, was an Ojibwe who first worked as a nurse. His parents met when his father, Robert Treuer, an Austrian Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, was teaching high school on her reservation. When they were in Washington, his father worked for the federal government and his mother attended law school. They returned to the Leech Lake Reservation, Minnesota, where the young Treuer and his two brothers were raised. Their mother became an Ojibwe tribal court judge.DINITIA SMITH, \\"American Indian Writing, Seen Through a New Lens\\" (Profile of David Treuer), New York Times, 19 August 2006, accessed 21 July 2012 Treuer attended Princeton University; he graduated in 1992 after writing two senior theses, one in the anthropology department and one in the Princeton Program in Creative Writing. He studied writing at Princeton with the authors Joanna Scott and Paul Muldoon; his thesis advisor in that program was the Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison. He received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1999. Academic career He has taught English at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. He also taught Creative Writing for a semester at Scripps College in Claremont, California, as the Mary Routt Chair of Writing. In 2010 Treuer moved to the University of Southern California where he is a Professor of Literature and teaches in the Creative Writing & Literature PhD program. Literary career Treuer has published stories and essays in Esquire, TriQuarterly, The Washington Post, the LA Times, \\"The New York Times,\\" \\"Lucky Peach,\\" and Slate.com. He published his first novel, Little, in 1995, which features multiple narrators and points of view. His second, The Hiawatha, followed in 1999. It was named for a fleet of trains operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (and by allusion the epic poem The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.) The novel features a Native American family who migrate to Minneapolis in the mid-twentieth century under the federally sponsored urban relocation program. One of two brothers works on the railroad. In the fall of 2006, Treuer published his third novel, The Translation of Dr Apelles. The Native American professor is presented as a translator who lives alone and works with an unnamed language. He confounds many expectations of Native American characters. Dnitia Smith said that Appelles is \\"untranslated, a man who cannot make sense of his own history, his personal narrative, perhaps because it falls between two cultures, two languages.\\" Brian Hall wrote, \\"The hidden theme of his novel is that fiction is all about games, lies and feints, about the heightened pleasure we can derive from a narrative when we recognize that it is artful.\\" Treuer uses a double narrative with allusions to several classical and other Western works to pull the novel (and Native American literature) into the mainstream.Brian Hall, \\"Love in a Dead Language\\" (Review of David Treuer, The Translation of Dr. Apelles), Washington Post, 14 September 2006, accessed 21 July 2012 That year Treuer published a book of essays, entitled Native American Fiction: A User's Manual (2006). It was controversial because he challenged the work of major writers and urged readers to see the genre of \\"Native American Fiction\\" as closely linked to many other literatures in English, and not as a \\"cultural artifact\\" of historic Indian culture. He argues against Native American writing being read as ethnography rather than literature. He criticized \\"the precious way that Indians are portrayed in even the most well-meaning books and movies.\\" This analysis included the works of such notable authors as Sherman Alexie, Louise Erdrich, Leslie Marmon Silko or James Welch which he thought sometimes the work perpetuated stereotypes and misrepresenting historic cultures.Ron Charles, \\"David Treuer: Burning Wooden Indians\\", Washington Post, 14 September 2006, accessed 21 July 2012 In sum, he said that \\"Native American literature hasn't progressed as quickly as it should have beyond cultural stereotypes.\\"Kerri Miller, \\"Translating David Treuer\\", Talking Volumes Interview, Minnesota Public Radio, 29 September 2006, accessed 21 July 2012 In 2012, Treuer published his fourth work, Rez Life: An Indian's Journey Through Reservation Life, which combines memoir with journalism about reservations. He conveys material of his own experience, as well as examining issues on other reservations, including federal policies and Indian sovereignty, and cronyism in tribal governments.\\"Review: David Treuer, Rez Life\\", Kirkus Reviews, accessed 21 July 2012 Revival of Ojibwe Treuer has a deep interest in the Ojibwe language and culture.

His brother has been studying it since high school.David Treuer, Excerpt online: Rez Life: An Indian's Journey through Reservation Life, Indian Country Today, 13 April 2012, accessed 21 July 2012 Treuer has written that \\"it's not clear why so many Indian critics and novelists suggest that stories, even great ones, in English by writers whose only language is English are somehow 'Indian stories' that store the kernels of culture.\\" He likens that to believing that long abandoned seeds found in caves can sprout and bear produce.David Treuer, Essay: \\"If They're Lost, Who are We?\\", Washington Post, 4 April 2008 He believes that Native American cultures are threatened if their writers have only English to use as a language; he contends that the tribes need their own languages to perpetuate their cultures.

Kikuchi dropped out of the Graduate School of Sciences, Tokyo University, 1973. In the same year, he took an assistant professorship at Yokohama City University. In 1976, he earned his doctorate in science. He was promoted to associate professor in 1983 and to professor in 1988. Kikuchi returned to Tokyo University in 1996 and became the Director of the seismic prognosis information center at the Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo. Scientific contributions (1) Computer simulation for dynamic rupture propagation. The specific fracture energy associated with large earthquakes was estimated to be much larger, by 5-6 of the order of magnitude, than that of the ordinary solid material in laboratory. (2) Source rupture processes. Waveform inversion technique was developed in an attempt to extract the information of detailed source rupture processes. Heterogeneous fault slip distributions were determined for many large earthquakes. These are now being compiled into a fault asperity map in the world. (3) Effect of multiple scatterings on the attenuation and dispersion of wave propagation. The numerical method to estimate the impulse response was developed and applied to laboratory data. Kikuchi simulated the seismic rupture process using computers in the 1970s and 1980s. He invented the method for slip distribution on the fault plane by teleseismic waveform with Hiroo Kanamori. In addition, he analysed significant earthquakes just after occurrence and distributed the results of analysis on the internet. These results were called Kikuchi Solutions.

There were three branches in the chain of shops, the first of these was in the North Laine area of Brighton on Kensigton Gardens, further branches opened in The Guildbourne Centre in Worthing, and The Enterprise Centre in Eastbourne. The Hive no longer exists after the business was declared bankrupt in 2001 after six years trading.  Biography  His first published work was a Judge Hershey story published in the Judge Dredd Megazine. A number of other Judge Hershey stories and one Judge Dredd story were published in the same title in the following months. His first work for 2000AD came later and was published in Prog 1000. It was called Outlaw and detailed the story of the lead character trying to rescue his daughter from an evil arms manufacturer. He was known as \\"The Deadliest Man Alive\\". Outlaw ran for thirteen instalments with five different artist on art duties. The final instalment suggested a second series of Outlaw was forthcoming, as yet there is no mention in the pages of 2000 AD that a sequel is planned.

Early life  Born in South London, her father, James Brand Silver, was a violinist and oboist, and had been a boy chorister at St. George's Chapel, Windsor where his singing attracted the attention of Queen Victoria. Her mother Amelia Argyle Silver was a piano teacher. Millicent was the second of four children. Her musical talent was discovered at the age of three, when she imitated her elder brother's practising. She won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music where she studied piano and violin equally. She was awarded the Chappell Silver Medal for piano playing and, in 1928, the college's Tagore Gold Medal for the best student of her year. As a violinist she was guided by W. H. \\"Billy\\" Reed, leader of the London Symphony Orchestra and friend of Edward Elgar. She earned her first professional fees playing as a violinist in the Hallé Orchestra. As a pianist she played concertos by Liszt, Brahms's D minor concerto and notably, Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\" concerto, which she performed in the first half of a concert conducted by Adrian Boult, and for the second half led the orchestra from the principal violin desk. After graduating, she studied with Tobias Matthay. She married flautist John Francis in 1932. She taught piano in a girls' school, while her husband got orchestral work in London, and began an early collaboration with Benjamin Britten. His interest in chamber music led him into an exploration of baroque music; he and Millicent became regular broadcasters on BBC radio, together and in larger ensembles. World War II disrupted her career; she returned to teaching and toured widely, playing for the troops.  Career as a harpsichordist  An important point in Millicent Silver's career came at the end of the war, when at Dartington Hall she was persuaded by the conductor Hans Oppenheim to play the continuo in a performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas on a harpsichord. Soon after this her future as a harpsichordist was determined, and the London Harpsichord Ensemble, which she formed with her husband and others, gave its first performance in 1945 at one of Dame Myra Hess's lunch-hour concerts at the National Gallery. She acquired a Kirckman harpsichord, which had been rebuilt by the instrument maker Henry Tull, and, with the group, toured widely and became a prolific broadcaster for the BBC. They gave a programme of ten concerts given at the 1950 Edinburgh Festival to mark the bicentenary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach. With the ensemble, she played a regular series concerts at the Royal Festival Hall, during which she always performed a substantial solo item. There had been a few harpsichord players in Britain before the war, such as Violet Gordon-Woodhouse and members of the Dolmetsch family, but the instrument was established in Britain in the two decades following 1945 by three main players: George Malcolm, Thurston Dart and Millicent herself. She had a 35-year career on the harpsichord during which she played a very wide solo repertory, though never abandoning the revival- type instruments with pedals, 16' stops and piano-type construction popular in the 50s and 60s, though later supplanted by the authentic performance movement. She played most of the keyboard works of Bach, including his concertos, Partitas and English Suites; the Goldberg Variations featured repeatedly in her recital programmes. She also played the works of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Johann Christian Bach, many of Domenico Scarlatti's and Antonio Soler's sonatas, many of the works of François Couperin and Jean- Philippe Rameau, the music of the English virginalists (William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, John Bull and others), and much 20th century harpsichord music by composers such as Manuel de Falla, Hans Werner Henze and György Ligeti. She gave the first broadcast of Benjamin Britten's Holiday Diary, and Paul Hindemith's Flute Sonata, with John Francis. Walter Leigh, Gordon Jacob and Herbert Howells wrote pieces for her. Henze said that she played the harpsichord part in his Apollo et Hyazinthus better than anyone else. Her recordings include Scarlatti sonatas; some Baroque chamber music with the London Harpsichord Ensemble; oboe sonatas with her daughter Sarah Francis and the cellist Bernard Richards; and her own arrangement for seven instruments of Bach's The Musical Offering, which was used by the Argentine novelist Julio Cortázar as the framework for his short story Clon. She recorded the Goldberg Variations in the 1950s.Samples of her playing the Goldberg Variations That she made few recordings reflects the era in which she lived as well as her dislike of the process itself. She and John Francis made their last appearance together in Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.5 in January 1981. She played in public for the last time in 1982, when she accompanied her daughter, soprano Hannah Francis, on the piano in a recital of Russian songs.

The club is governed by the Rugby Football Union and the 1st XV currently competes in the fourth tier of the English rugby union system, National League 2 North. The 2nd XV and 3rd XV play in the North West Intermediate Rugby Union leagues. History Research shows that there was a rugby club in Chester in the 1880s and apparently there was a game between Chester and New Brighton in 1879–80, but the club later disbanded, The 'new' Chester RUFC was formed in 1925 at the Chester YMCA. In 1932 the club moved to rented facilities at Boughton Hall as tenants of the cricket club where they stayed for almost thirty years until the ground at Hare Lane, Vicars Cross was purchased with the club moving there in 1961. Rugby blossomed in the sixties and seventies with a fixture list including some of the then top clubs in the North and many players awarded county honours. The eighties was a quiet period, with playing strength less than before and the fixture list suffering as a result. The introduction of league rugby revitalized the club and started a new era. In 1994 a new clubhouse was built and since the turn of the century Chester have reached the Cheshire Cup final three more times, winning in 2004. The 2007–08 season was arguably the most successful in the club's history. Not only were Chester promoted as champions from North 2 West (having been relegated from North 1 the previous season) but they also won the EDF Intermediate Cup, at Twickenham, with a 21–18 win over local rivals Birkenhead Park after an interception allowed winger Simon Love to run in from 80 metres late in the game to secure the win after Centre Liam Lawton had run in a try in the first half. Since then Chester have performed well at Level 5, finishing runner-up in National League 3 Midlands in 2008–09 but losing heavily in the ensuing North/Midlands promotion play-off game against Hull. The following season they returned to the familiar surroundings of National 3 North (formerly North 1) after a level transfer. In the 2009–10 season Chester finished in the top half of the table after an inconsistent season. However the 2010–11 season, under the leadership of new club captain Andrew Moore, saw Chester reach the North/Midlands play- off game for the second time in three years, once again losing, this time narrowly at Sheffield Tigers 16–14. During the last five or so years Chester have specialised in playing fast attractive rugby which has no doubt helped the attendances which have been impressive in recent years. The comprehensive 34–6 EDF Intermediate Cup semi-final victory against Newport Salop in 2007–08 saw one of the biggest crowds seen at Hare Lane in recent years. Recent seasons have seen Chester players return to the Cheshire set up when props James Whitlock-Wainwright and Mike Davies along full back Sean Green were selected to play for Cheshire in the 2009–10 County Championship. Half backs Thomas Chappell and Bryn Snellgrove also appeared in a Cheshire shirt the following year. Chester holds the Chester Vets tournament each May where teams of over-35's compete in shortened 15-a-side games. This tournament once regularly attracted large numbers of sides but in recent years the turnout in terms of teams has begun to decline but the enthusiasm of the players playing has remained.

The structure, part of the fort built by the British in 1879, was likely positioned to help soldiers get a good shot at lurking enemies Fort Tanjong Katong, which stood from 1879 to 1901, was one of the oldest military forts built by the former British colonial government of Singapore. The fort gave its name to today's Fort Road, and it used to stand on the grounds of the present Katong Park. Fort Tanjong Katong, the only one of its kind on the eastern side of the island, was part of a series of defensive batteries and fortifications along the southern coast of Singapore, that defended the eastern approaches to the Singapore Harbour and Singapore Town against seaborne attacks. Due to its poor structural design and remoteness, the fort was subsequently abandoned and buried until its rediscovery in 2001. Found with traces of a moat and near intact perimeter wall, the fort was considered by local archaeological experts as one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds of a \\"true 19-century fort\\" to date. As a result, an archaeology group has been lobbying for the site to be gazetted as a National Monument. As of May 2010, the National Heritage Board has stated that it has no plans to gazette the fort for the time being. History An 1880 photograph of Fort Tanjong Katong The SVA Gunners conducting a firing practice next to Fort Tanjong Katong around 1905 Fort Tanjong Katong was designed and built in 1879 by Henry Edward McCallum, who was the Colonial Engineer and Architect of the Singapore History Museum on Stamford Road. The fort reflected the British concerns that other European powers such as the Netherlands and Russia, might attack the strategically located colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. On the island of Sentosa, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Fort Serapong were built around the same time as Fort Tanjong Katong, to guard the western and eastern entrances to the New Harbour (now Keppel Harbour). The fort was sitting atop a wet, low-lying coconut plantation and occupied an area of approximately two hectares, and had a small elevated battery of three rifled muzzle-loading guns facing the sea, along with bombproof shelters. The battery was surrounded by a ditch measuring 100 feet wide on the flanks. A local team of contractors constructed the fort in less than 12 months. The fort's garrison included members of the Singapore Volunteer Artillery (SVA) that held regular gun drills and their annual training camps at the fort. In 1885, works began on upgrading the existing gun batteries in Singapore, and the three-gun battery at Tanjong Katong was replaced with a pair of more powerful and longer range Mark VII breech-loading guns. =\\"Wash-out Fort\\"= Beset by problems from the start, the Fort Tanjong Katong was nicknamed the \\"Wash-out Fort\\".\\"Fort Tanjong Katong (1879—1901)\\"—Information obtained from on-site information board erected by National Parks Board. Due to the soft ground, each time the guns were fired, the range finding equipment would shake, and would need to be recalibrated. To make matters worse, it was difficult to find the ammunition for the new guns as it was not common in Singapore. The remoteness of the site, which hindered supply and reinforcement, reduced the effectiveness of Fort Tanjong Katong as a defensive position. Barely five years after upgrades were completed in 1888, it was suggested the fort be demolished. Debates over the fort lingered on between the Colonial Defence Committee in London, and the Local Defence Committee in Singapore for nearly a decade. The fort was finally rendered obsolete and abandoned in 1901 when the guns were removed. Instead of destroying the fort, the British thought it simpler to bury it, which was done sometime after World War I. A portion of a bastion was still visible above ground well into the 1960s, when a public park was built atop the fort for the fast-growing Katong suburbs. In the late 1960s, the bastion was finally buried when land reclamation in the East Coast took place, and its memory was soon forgotten in the ensuing decades. =Rediscovery= In 2001, the outline of the top of the bastion wall became visible during a dry spell; this prompted a Katong resident, Jack Sim, to seek out the relevant authorities to investigate its origins. Despite much public discussion and interest generated by the discovery, it was not until in 2004 that the Singapore government finally approached a team of archaeologists to excavate the forgotten fort. The excavation was made possible by a community-based project named \\"Raising History, Planting Roots\\", that was initiated by the Mountbatten Citizens' Consultative Committee with local residents and schools as a community involvement program to encourage ownership of local heritage. In just four weeks, an amount of S$200,000 (US$120,000) was raised from corporate sponsors and a fund-raising dinner, held at Suntec City Mall on 27 September 2004. Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency, was the guest of honour at the event. The long- awaited excavation began on 29 September 2004, led by a handful of archaeologists and dedicated archaeology volunteers called Southeast Asian Archaeology. Nearly 2 metres down, the volunteers uncovered significant remains of the fort still in situ—a pair of infantry bastions that did not appear in the original plans, the perimeter of the moat's inner escarpment and what appears to be the drawbridge superstructure. Experts call it Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds. The archaeological dig at the former Fort Tanjong Katong site, provided a unique opportunity for many like- minded Singaporeans to participate actively in uncovering the remains of the old fort. For nearly 10 months, more than 1,000 volunteers ranging from school students to housewives, retirees, working professionals on their off-days assisted the archaeologists on site and discovering first hand on the 125-year-old military fort. The Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, a natural history research unit of the National University of Singapore, assisted with the analysis of marine artefacts and corals that were uncovered at the site, and some 36 bags of samples have been deposited with the museum for further analysis. A Preliminary Site Report (dated 7 May 2006) was later compiled and submitted to the relevant authorities which outlined the research process, preliminary findings, variety of volunteers, and a list of the archaeology research team involved. =Reburied again= To date, the excavation project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended and only the south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might fall into one of the 2 m-deep holes. The remaining funds, about S$150,000, were ploughed back into bursaries and scholarships for the constituency's students. The archaeology group is lobbying for the site to be gazetted as a National Monument, and to incorporate the fort remains to be featured as part of the park in future. To date, its status is still pending while waiting for the final decision by the Preservation of Monuments Board and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

He was born on 18 November 1915 in Marvin, South Dakota, the son of Ernest Ray and Mae E. (née Wheeler) Doren. Doren was prepared for Holy Orders at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary and was ordained a priest in November 1944 by Bishop Roberts of the Protestant Episcopal Church. On 16 June 1946 he married Bonney Dixon Ward in Beadle, South Dakota. Doren served as a series of parishes in the USA, including a period as a Canon of St Mark's Cathedral, Minneapolis. He was later a missionary in Korea holding the office of Archdeacon for some years before returning to the United States and settling in Paoli, Pennsylvania. Following the St Louis Congress of Concerned Churchmen in September 1977, Archdeacon Doren was elected as first bishop of the Diocese of the Midwest in what is now the Anglican Catholic Church. In Denver, Colorado on 28 January 1978 Doren was consecrated by a retired bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Right Reverend Albert Arthur Chambers, who temporarily held jurisdiction over the original Anglican Church of North America http://www.anglicancatholic.org - Chambers Succession along with Bishop Francisco Pagtakhan of the Philippine Independent Church as co-consecrator. The Right Reverend Mark Pae of the Anglican Church of Korea sent a letter of consent. Bishop Doren, Bishop Chambers and Bishop Pagtakhan then consecrated James Mote, Robert Morse and Francis Watterson. Bishop Doren is regarded as, in effect, the \\"Primus\\" of the four bishops consecrated for the Continuing Anglican movement. It is these consecrations which began what would become the multi-jurisdictional Continuing Anglican movement.http://www.anglicancatholic.org - Chambers Succession Bishop Doren was later translated to the smaller Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic States due to a temporary breakdown in his health Douglas Bess - 'Divided We Stand (Tractarian Press 1994) where he served until late 1980. Following a series of disagreements with Bishop Mote, and the leadership of the Anglican Catholic Church, three parishes that had formerly been under Doren's jurisdiction left the ACC and founded the United Episcopal Church of North America in 1981. The new church was intended to be a home for Anglicans of the Low to Central Church ceremonial tradition, and to continue the doctrine, discipline and worship of the old Protestant Episcopal Church with as little alteration as possible.Bess, Douglas - Op. Cit. At its organizing Convention in 1982, the UECNA adopted the 1958 Constitution and Canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church as its own with minimal alteration. However, to distinguish the new jurisdiction from its parent, the title 'Presiding Bishop' was altered to 'Archbishop' and Bishop Doren was duly elected to fill that office. However, unlike a traditional Archbishop, he did not exercise authority as primate, but this remained vested in the House of Bishops as a whole. As required by the Canons, he retired as Archbishop of the UECNA in April 1989, this being the General Convention following his 72nd birthday. Bishop Albion Williamson Knight, Jr. (1924 to 2012) being elected to succeed him. Archbishop Doren initially lived in retirement in Pennsylvania, but later moved to Florida.

History The National Press Club was founded in 1963 as the National Press Luncheon Club by a few journalists with the backing of the Canberra Press Gallery. The founding president was Tony Eggleton. It was renamed the National Press Club in 1968, and established official premises in 1976. Since its inception, the club's reputation has steadily grown, attracting parliamentarians, scientists, diplomats, sporting personalities and other prominent figures to address its weekly luncheons. Guests have included heads of government and ministers of Australia and other countries, including Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi.An archival list of speakers is available on the Club's official website Activities and format , the National Press Club address is a weekly formal speech of approximately one hour, which includes time for questions from members of the press. The president introduces the speaker and moderates the questions. The addresses are broadcast on the ABC Network at 12:30 pm.  2007 federal election leaders' debate controversy  On 21 October 2007 a debate between Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd was hosted by the National Press Club from the Great Hall of Parliament in Canberra. The debate was televised live by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Channel Nine and Sky News. A controversial decision was taken during the debate to interrupt the provision of the live transmission signal to the Channel Nine network because of the inclusion by Channel Nine within its broadcast picture of a real-time line chart of the aggregate studio audience reaction to the debate. This type of chart is referred to as the 'Worm', after the form in which it is rendered and an approximately 'worm-like' movement of the display within the area of the screen in which it appears. The decision by the National Press Club to interrupt the provision of the live transmission signal to the Channel Nine network has been heavily criticised as contrary to the principles of free speech that are a part of the journalistic tradition. On 22 October 2007, Greens Senator Bob Brown called for a Senate inquiry into the circumstances in which the transmission signal had been cut.

It was established as an offshoot of the Gaumont Film Company of France. Film production Title screen for There Goes the Bride (1932) Gaumont-British was founded in 1898 as the British subsidiary of the French Gaumont Film Company. It became independent of its French parent in 1922 when Isidore Ostrer acquired control of Gaumont-British. In 1927 a leading silent film maker, the Ideal Film Company, merged with Gaumont. The company's Lime Grove Studios was used for film productions including Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of The 39 Steps (1935), while its Islington Studios made Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938). In the 1930s, the company employed 16,000 people. In the United States, Gaumont-British had its own distribution operation for its films until December 1938, when it outsourced distribution to 20th Century Fox. In 1941 the Rank Organisation bought Gaumont-British and its sister company Gainsborough Pictures.  Cinemas  The former Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, opened in 1937 Gaumont-British developed or acquired large \\"super-cinemas\\" such as the New Victoria (later Gaumont and finally Odeon) in Bradford opened in 1930, the Gaumont in Manchester opened in 1935, and the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, opened in 1937. They also took over many smaller cinemas across the country, eventually owning 343 properties. One such property was the Holderness Hall in Hull, built by the pioneering William Morton in 1912 and managed by him until 1930 when he could no longer compete. Many of the Gaumont cinemas had a theatre organ for entertainment before the show, in the intervals, or after the show. The name \\"Gaumont\\" was adopted to describe the style of the flat-top organ console case (originally for the Pavilion Theatre, Shepherd's Bush), for some Compton organs built from October 1931 to 1934. The Odeon, Westover Road, Bournemouth was a Gaumont until 1986 Cinema exhibition in the UK was characterised by alignments between exhibitors and distributors. After the Odeon and Gaumont takeovers, Rank had access to the product of 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Walt Disney, Columbia, Universal, United Artists and its own film productions. Rivals ABC had only Warner Brothers, MGM and the productions of its parent company Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC). Both cinema circuits also took films from smaller distributors. With ample supply of product, Rank maintained the separate Odeon and Gaumont release pattern for many years. Some Odeon cinemas were renamed Gaumont when transferred to Gaumont release. As attendances declined during the 1950s many cinemas on all circuits were closed and eventually, the booking power of the Gaumont circuit declined. In January 1959, Rank restructured its exhibition operation and combined the best Gaumonts and the best Odeons in a new Rank release, while the rest were given a new \\"National\\" release. In 1961, Paramount objected to Rank consigning its Dean Martin comedy All in a Night's Work to the national circuit and henceforth switched its allegiance to the ABC circuit. With the continuing decline in attendances and cinema numbers, the National release died on its feet and henceforth there were two release patterns, Rank and ABC. There was no reason to perpetuate the Gaumont name and in towns that lost their Odeon, the Gaumont was usually renamed Odeon within a couple of years of the latter's closure. Even so, the Gaumont name continued to linger until, in January 1987, the last Gaumont, in Doncaster, was renamed Odeon.  G.B. Equipments Ltd and G.B.-Bell and Howell  G.B-Bell & Howell Autoset Turret 8mm film camera G.B. Equipments Ltd, a subsidiary of Gaumont- British, made a number of 16 mm film sound projectors in Britain before and during the Second World War, including models such as the G.B.-Scope A and B, Grosvenor and G.B. K and L series. After the war, G.B. Equipments Ltd decided not to manufacture models of their own. Instead they began to manufacture, under licence, models of American design by Bell & Howell. These models, branded as either G.B.-Bell & Howell or Bell & Howell-Gaumont in Great Britain, were identical to the American models except in model number. During the 1950s G.B.-Bell & Howell either manufactured, or distributed, a number of 8 mm and 16 mm cine-cameras and projectors.  G.B.-Kershaw and G.B.-Kalee  Gaumont-Kalee GK21 35mm cine film projector, National Media Museum, Bradford In 1888 Abram Kershaw established a business in Leeds making photographic items, including lanterns and projection equipment. Kershaw produced cinema projectors under the Kalee trade name (from the initials of Kershaw, A, Leeds) from the 1910s. Later, the company became part of Amalgamated Photographic Manufacturers, forming the Kershaw-Soho Ltd group. The brand Kalee continued to be used until the Kershaw group was acquired by Gaumont British to become G.B.-Kalee Ltd. Both GB-Kershaw and GB-Kalee were used as brand names for a range of 8 mm and 16 mm cine-cameras, movie projectors, slide projectors and still cameras.

Pisco was the President of the General Assembly of Estoril-Praia from 1987 to 1988, later a member of the Board of Directors, and became Chairman in 1990. During his time as Chairman the club was promoted for two consecutive years, reaching the Portuguese First Division in 1991. In 1992, when the club was 5th place in the Portuguese First Division, he stepped down and was replaced as Chairman by Filipe Soares Franco, who later became the President of Sporting Clube de Portugal. When Pisco left Estoril-Praia, the team included footballers such as Portuguese internationals Hélder Cristóvão and Paulinho, Bulgarian international Stoycho Mladenov, Moroccan international Aziz Bouderbala and Bolivian international Erwin Sanchez. The club was relegated in 2004, but when it returned to the Portuguese First Division Pisco returned as elected Chairman with 79% of votes. He is now the President of the Fausto Figueiredo Foundation for the promotion of sport, an organization closely associated with Estoril-Praia.

There is one existing commuter rail service in the state, the Northstar Line, and one existing long-distance intercity rail service, the Empire Builder. Future projects include a mixture of short-distance commuter rail and medium-distance regional rail lines which would run from the Twin Cities outward to neighboring states and perhaps Canada. This article is focused on heavy-rail projects and does not discuss potential light rail lines in the core Twin Cities area. Existing service =Northstar= The Northstar Line is a state and federally funded commuter rail line that serves a region from Minneapolis northwest toward the central Minnesota city of St. Cloud. The line began service on November 16, 2009, and runs about half the distance to St. Cloud, terminating in Big Lake, with bus service covering the remaining distance. The train operates at up to . MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier One Passenger Rail line. Proposed metropolitan services These corridors are generally less than 50 miles (80 km) in length, but could be expanded beyond that distance. Many have either a parallel BRT route or have not been seriously considered for passenger rail traffic. =Red Rock= The Red Rock Corridor is a 30-mile corridor running from Hastings through downtown St. Paul in the counties of Dakota, Washington, and Ramsey. Communities along the corridor include Hastings, Denmark Township, Cottage Grove, St. Paul Park, Newport, and St. Paul. Additional stops in downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota, Snelling Avenue, Rice Street, Lower Afton Road, Newport were proposed, as was a deferred extension to Red Wing. The Minneapolis end of the route was initially designated to be at Target Field station, but revised to terminate at Saint Paul Union Depot. An alternative analyses study determined Bus rapid transit to be the preferred alternative for at least part of this segment. MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier One Passenger Rail line. = Gateway Corridor = The Gateway Corridor parallels Interstate 94 (I-94) between downtown St. Paul and the Eastern Suburbs. Studies, led by the Gateway Corridor Commission, determined BRT to be the preferred alternative for the corridor, and rail is no longer being considered. =Rush Line= The Rush Line is a proposed mass transit link from downtown Saint Paul to Hinckley via White Bear Lake, Forest Lake and Pine City. Commuter rail, bus rapid transit, light rail transit and express bus options were considered for parts of the 80-mile corridor. Studies concluded in 2017, and BRT was selected as the locally preferred alternative. MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier Two Passenger Rail line. =Bethel= The Bethel Corridor is a proposed commuter rail line along BNSF tracks between Bethel, Minnesota and downtown Minneapolis. This would follow part of the route of the proposed Northern Lights Express to Duluth, but would stop at more stations. The project is no longer updated and assumed to be abandoned. MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier Two Passenger Rail line. =Norwood/Young America= The Norwood Corridor is a proposed rail line between Minnetonka and downtown Minneapolis, using existing Twin Cities & Western trackage. It is unknown if the line will go beyond the study process, although MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier Two Passenger Rail line. This route slightly overlaps the Metro Green Line (Minnesota) Extension. =Dan Patch Line= The Dan Patch Corridor is a proposed commuter rail line which runs from Minneapolis to Northfield, Minnesota. The plan was under consideration until 2002, when a bill passed that banned further study on the route. MnDOT previously identified this line as a Tier One Passenger Rail line. Proposed regional services These services will run distances of more than and would have the potential to run at speeds higher than the common limit of 79 mph. They will likely have fewer stops than the routes outlined above. Several routes were outlined in the 2009 Minnesota Comprehensive Statewide Freight and Passenger Rail Plan. The plan had two phases defined: Phase I for projects intended for completion before 2030, and Phase II for projects beyond that date. =Northern Lights Express= The Northern Lights Express is a proposed line to Superior, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota. About halfway along the line is Hinckley, Minnesota which is expected to be a big draw from both ends of the line due to the presence of a major casino. This could be considered inter-city rail due to a limited number of stops. It is planned to run at up to . =Fargo/Moorhead-Twin Cities= Expanded service to the Fargo–Moorhead area on the North Dakota–Minnesota border is also planned for Phase I. The Amtrak Empire Builder serves this route, but it is inconveniently timed for passengers in Fargo since the trains in both directions are scheduled for station stops between 2 and 4 AM. They use BNSF Railway's busy northern transcontinental line, which is expected to need significant upgrades in order to handle increasing freight traffic. =Twin Cities-Milwaukee-Chicago Second Train= A proposed Second Train, also known as TCMC, would be an expansion of current Empire Builder service. MnDOT published a feasibility report in 2015 that proposed trains depart Chicago at 10:25am and arrive in St. Paul at 6:15pm. The proposal also recommends interlining the TCMC train with one of Amtrak's Hiawatha Service trips and expanding the service to Minneapolis Target Field Station or St. Could. Service is expected to start 2022, pending funding availability. =Rochester= Part of MnDot's state rail plan is a proposed line connecting the southeastern city of Rochester with St. Paul and Minneapolis. This route would require building a new line. There is no direct freight rail connection between Rochester and the Twin Cities. Plans for the line are vague. =Southern Minnesota= From Minneapolis or St. Paul to Northfield, Faribault, Owatonna and Albert Lea, with eventual plans to go south to Des Moines and Kansas City. =Eau Claire= Along with the Northern Lights Express and the Rochester link, a line eastward to Eau Claire, Wisconsin was identified in 2009 as a Phase I corridor for implementation before 2030. It would use \\"enhanced conventional\\" service of and would likely make use of existing rails owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (ex-Omaha Road/Chicago and North Western). This could become Eau Claire's first train service since the Twin Cities 400 ended service in 1963. In August 2010, it was designated as the \\"Gateway Corridor\\" and an alternatives analysis study was begun. =Mankato= The Minnesota Valley Line running southwest to Mankato, Minnesota was also identified as a Phase I corridor with \\"enhanced conventional\\" 79 to 90 mph speeds in 2009. =Phase II corridors= Conventional-speed trains running up to 79 mph are also planned beyond 2030 for *The Little Crow Line from the Twin Cities to westward to Willmar, Minnesota and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. *Expanding from the Minnesota Valley Line in Mankato through Worthington, Minnesota and beyond toward Sioux City, Iowa *And an extension northward from Fargo/Moorhead to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Their patronymic surname derives from Irish Ó Donnabháin, meaning the grandsons or descendants of Donnubán, referring to the 10th century ruler of the Uí Fidgenti, Donnubán mac Cathail. During the 12th and 13th century, O'Donovan relations relocated from the Bruree/Croom area south to the Kingdom of Desmond and to Carbery, where they were a ruling family for centuries and played a role in the establishment of a feudal society under the MacCarthys. Other septs retreated into the southeast corner of the Ui Fidgheinte territory, reaching from Broadford/Feenagh to the Doneraile area, where their territory was identified in the 16th century as Synnagh-Donovan.See History of Cork, page 51Downham The northern septs of the O'Donovans did not use a White Rod as the family's position in their original territory was vastly eroded, while several septs of O'Donovans in the southwest territories were semi-autonomous flatha under the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty in Carbery, with the most notable being local petty kings.Dillon, Myles, \\"The consecration of Irish kings\\", in Celtica 10 (1973): 1–8. Dillon refers to O'Donovan as a petty king under MacCarthy. See also Elizabeth FitzPatrick, Royal Inauguration in Gaelic Ireland, passim. The family were counted among the leading Gaelic nobility of Ireland. Foundation The O'Donovans trace their ancestry from Donnubán mac Cathail, Lord of Uí Fidgenti, a tenth-century ruler of the Irish regional kingdom of Uí Fidgenti, who had married the daughter of his norse ally, Ivar of Limerick of the Uí Ímair. The O'Donovans carried Danish names for the next three centuries. Donndubhán was a major figure and opponent of Mathgamain mac Cennétig and his brother Brian Bóruma in the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib. He was in part responsible for the death of Mathgamain, and killed Donnubán and his brother- in-law Aralt mac Ímair, newly elected King of the Foreigners of Munster, around the year 978 in the Battle of Cathair Cuan. However, Donnubán's son Cathal mac Donnubáin would later be one of the Munster kings supporting Brian in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. Norse settlements in Ireland By 1300, most of the O'Donovans had vacated the geographical territory held for the previous thousand years. Most of the Ui Chairpre who moved to the Carbery area merged with Donovans of the Corca Laidghe. Of the family remaining in County Limerick after the 13th century few records are preserved. Clearly, however, there were O'Donovans in the Limerick and Tipperary areas during the period 1400-1575, and the senior descendant of the last chief of the Ui Donabhains of Fidgheinte sat in the 1689 Parliament along with an O'Donovan from both Clan Cathail and Clan Lochlan.  Arms and mottos  Arms have been granted or registered by at least ten separate O'Donovan individuals, in addition to the arms claimed by various septs of the O'Donovans. The armorial bearings, although distinct from each other, share a number of similar elements. The mottos associated with the various arms include: :'Adjuvante Deo in hostes' (Latin) – 'With the assistance of God against our enemies'.) :'Vir Super Hostem' (Latin – 'A man above his enemies') :'Giolla ar a-namhuid a-bu' (Gaelic – 'A man over his enemies forever') :'In Deo faciemus Virtutem (Latin – 'With God I shall be valiant and virtuous') :'Croom a boo' (also, 'Croom abu') (Old Irish – 'Croom to victory') :'Imagines majorum as virtutem accendunt' (Latin – the images of our ancestor's lives inspire us to ever increasing valiancey and virtue'). Two Carberys: Ui Chairpre near Limerick, and Carbery in Cork An ancient race in Munster, a portion of the O'Donovans became Cairbre Eva (or Uí Chairpre, see map) within the ancient regional kingdom of the Uí Fidgenti, once approximately co-extensive with the modern County Limerick,Begley and were for many centuries allies of the Eóganachta, to whom they were related by common descent from Ailill Flann Bec (or Ailill Aulom). Although allowed to be princely in multiple ancient sources,See Charles-Edwards. in the Irish class structure the Uí Fidgenti were only middle tier among the ruling septs of the land, as they never contested for the kingship of the greater provincial kingdom of Munster, in which they were located. However, the Uí Fidgenti did not pay tribute to the Eóganachta kings of Cashel.See Byrne. The Book of Rights,O’Huidhrin, Topeg. Poems, page 119 transcribed as a medieval topographical poem set forth the rights of the O'Donovans: pp. 118–9 Ireland about the year 1100 Their extensive territory followed Limerick's River Maigue, before the Dál gCais and O'Brien dynasty, and later the FitzGerald dynasty, forced them out of their territory between the late 12th and mid-13th century. O'Donovans were noted as taking refuge in 1169 in County Kerry, but were also noted as being in their historical territory near Bruree and Croom in the mid-1200s. The relocation of some O'Donovans to Carbery in the later County Cork, appears to have occurred during the mid to late 13th century, primarily through their association with the MacCarthy Reagh sept. The majority of O'Donovans were associated with the MacCarthy Reagh sept, although considerable documentation exists that some O'Donovans maintained relations with groups hostile to the MacCarthy Reaghs, including other MacCarthy septs (MacCarthy Mor and MacCarthy of Muscry) and Anglo-Irish rulers (Earls of Desmond and Kildare). Only the O'Donovan chiefs of territories south of Kilmallock were inaugurated by the MacCaarthy Reagh; the O'Donovan chiefs of Bruree and territories north of Kilmallock were inaugurated by their Fidgheinte kinsmen.Irish Family History by Richard Cronnelly,p 253 The O'Donovans in Carbery may have been joined by a junior sept of their Ó Coileáin kinsmen from Uí Chonaill Gabra. A large number of O'Donovans of Carbery and Cork may also descend from the Dunavans of the Corca Laidghe, which was a completely different, and perceived as inferior (less royal) race than the descendants of Eoghan Mor. Later, the title Prince of Carbery (Cairbre) would be adopted by the MacCarthy Reaghs, although there is significant doubt as to whether this is actually derived from the former tribal name of the O'Donovans (Ui Chairpre of the Ui Fidgente), and if so, then what circumstances led to it being extended well beyond the territories belonging to the O'Donovans. In any case, the Carberry septs of the Donovans were junior to the MacCarthy Reaghs, from whom they received the White Wand. The leading family of the Carbery O'Donovans, Clann Cathail, paid to their overlords a surprisingly small, economically insignificant rent, but the precise reason for this is lost to history.Butler, \\"The Barony of Carbery\\" Possibly earlier times were recalled, or it may be due to the special relationship they developed with Fíngin Reanna Róin Mac Carthaig (see below). Reverend John Begley (see references), of St. Munchin's, gives an account of the Christianization of the Norse of Limerick by the O'Donovans, and their long intermarriage. Mainchín of Limerick is the patron saint of the Diocese of Limerick and Bruree, and he may have been adopted by the Norse of Limerick city from the family. Begley argues that he was, but the O'Briens also claimed him indirectly at some point and obviously have their own supporters. The longphorts were the Viking ship fortresses and later settlements, although the term soon enough came to mean simply encampment. However, the original meaning remained in usage and in the 10th century there were at least two Norse longphuirt, extensions of Limerick, which were deep in Uí Chairpre controlled territory.Valante, Mary A., The Vikings in Ireland: Settlement, Trade and Urbanization. Four Courts Press. 2008. Many Irish families intermarried with the Scandinavians, but it was a question of degree. In their case the O'Donovans simply took a particularly large dose. Nearly all of the long history of the Danes in Munster has been lost, although those living in Uí Chairpre are not known to have left, being last noted in Donnubán's company in 978.Annals of the Four Masters and Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib The later advent of the Norman invasion of Ireland ruined them as a political class. For the fate of the Limerick Norse see History of Limerick. Only the Cotter family of East Cork continue to prosper today in Ireland,Ó Murchadha, p. 261 but they are not of Limerick provenance. From the later 16th century Scandinavian names have been very little used by the O'Donovan family, when once they were as popular as the Gaelic. But see the important Ímar Ua Donnubáin. =Final ancient deeds= The O'Donovans are first found associated with the MacCarthys only four years after the death of Amlaíb. The Annals of Inisfallen report that in 1205Annals of Inisfallen The political influence of the O'Donovans with the Ui Chairbre decreased as the Mac Carthy influence increased, and then splintered. By 1232, certain septs of the MacCarthys ruled from where they had relocated to the south of the historical territory of the Ui Fidghente, and controlled the Ui Chairbre. In 1260 the O'Donovans are found raiding Norman lands alongside none other than Fíngin Reanna Róin Mac Carthaig, according to Norman documents. This was one year before his famous victory at the Battle of Callann, where the O'Donovans of Ui Chairbre are also believed to have been at his side.Ó Murchadha, p. 125 In 1259 he aided them in a fight against the O'Mahonys, who appear to have been blamed for the slaying of Crom Ua Donnubáin.Mac Carthaigh's Book and Annals of Inisfallen Up until this period the O'Donovans and O'Mahonys are generally regarded to have been allies, their ancestors Máel Muad mac Brain and Donnubán having joined forces against the Dál gCais in the 10th century. In 1283, following an attempted coup within the MacCarthy, a number of MacCarthys and some O'Donovans migrated into new territory adjacent to the O'Sullivans, which commenced a long and tumultuous relationship between O'Donovans and both major septs of the O'Sullivans, and which has included both minor warfare as well as intermarriage over the next four centuries. Later history Carbery in Tudor times Following an active 13th century, and after their move south the O'Donovans of Ui Chairbre fall into relative obscurity for approximately two centuries, primarily because the records for Munster during this period are few. Fragmenting into several smaller-sized lordships, they became subordinate to their overlord, MacCarthy Reagh, who was at odds with the MacCarthy Mor, who was at odds with the MacCarthys of Muscrery, who were at odds with both the Norman settlers (Barrys) and the old Irish (O'Callahan, O'Keefe), and with Gaelicized English (Fitzgeralds- Earls of Desmonds, FitzGibbons – Earls of Kildare and the White Knight), all of whom were or were not, depending on changing politics, at odds with the English monarchs. O'Donovans of Ui Chairpre reappeared in various annals and records about 1500. Domhnall Ó Donnabháin was Bishop of Ross in the mid-late 15th century, while Donal mac Melaghlin O'Donovan, was killed for piracy, along with his O'Driscoll accomplices, by the lords of the O'Driscolls in 1551.Ó Murchadha, p. 126 However, despite similar obscurity for an extended period, an O'Donovan sept (the remnants of the Ui Donabhain of the Ui Fidghente, holding territory in Synnagh-Donovan near Doneraile, were still counted among the 64 leading Gaelic families in all of Ireland in the mid-16th century Book of Howth list, with their Chief noted as being the Chief Irish of his countrie (i.e. region).Book of Howth, p. 255 =Clancahill= Following the migration of some of the O'Donovans of the Ui Chairpre into Cork and the death of Ancrom O'Donovan in 1254, few Munster records survived which provides information on the history of the Ui Chairpre O'Donovans for the next three centuries. But when they reappear in the mid-16th century they are found in a similar state as other septs in Ireland at that time: rival branches assassinating each other and each supported by more distantly related septs. It appears that by a fortuitous marriage to an O'Leary of Carrignacurra and the ardent support of Clan Aneslis that the branch of the celebrated Donal of the Hides were able to set aside their rivals, in the person of Diarmaid an Bhairc (\\"Dermot of the Bark\\", meaning born at sea), who were supported by Ire (Ivor) O'Donovan [Ó Donnabháin Íomhair] of the Sliocht Íomhair (\\"Seed of Ivor\\"), descendants of the legendary Ímar Ua Donnubáin, younger son of Cathal, and also by the Sliocht Tioboit (\\"Seed of Toby\\"), another distinguished sept of Clancahill. In a terrible local conflict occurring in Rosscarbery in 1560, where Diarmaid was being inaugurated with the White Wand by the MacCarthy Reagh, Donal, with Clan Aneslis and a contingent of O'Learys, stormed the town, slaying Diarmaid and a great number of the Sliocht Íomhair at the start, and others of his followers were soon found and slaughtered in the streets of the town. The MacCarthy Reagh, who would have been Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh, 10th Prince of Carbery, then inaugurated Donal na g crocieann with the White Rod, declaring him \\"O'Donovan\\", after he had just run his kinsman Diarmaid through. The story has significant doubt as to its veracity, though John O'Donovan considered it \\"probably true\\". Ellen O'Leary and Donal na g crocieann (of the Hides) were married at Dromale, and their issue was, among other sons, Donal II O'Donovan, who may or may not have been a bastard born before their marriage was solemnised. In any case he succeeded to the chiefship in 1584 upon the death of Donal of the Hides, and received the White Rod from his father-in-law, Owen MacCarthy Reagh, 12th Prince of Carbery, to whose daughter the Lady Joane he was now married. Previously he was married to Helena de Barry, daughter of William Barry of Barryroe, son of James de Barry, 4th Viscount Buttevant, and she was mother to his son and heir Donal III O'Donovan, but it is not known in what year she may have died or was possibly divorced. Donal III joined the so-called Irish Rebellion of 1641 under Donough MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry, with the result that his lands were later wasted and two of his castles blown up by the Cromwellians. Later in the Irish Confederate Wars he would assist his near neighbour, James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven in the taking of a number of fortifications in County Cork. For all this he was eventually stripped of his estates by Oliver Cromwell in 1652. Donal married Gylles O'Shaughnessy, daughter of Sir Roger Gilla Dubh Ó Seachnasaigh, and his heir by her was Donal IV O'Donovan. In 1660 Daniel IV was eventually restored to a small portion of his father's estates by Charles II of England, who gave the rest away to Cromwell's soldiers. In 1689 he sat as a member of the House of Commons of the Patriot Parliament of James II, and in the next year, under Governor Sir Edward Scott, was the Deputy Governor of Charles Fort, Kinsale, when besieged by John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (then 1st Earl). After holding out for ten days, they received guarantees before surrendering, O'Donovan delivered the keys to Marlborough, and they and the 1200 strong garrison were allowed to march out to Limerick. See Siege of Cork. Daniel IV's last descendant in the male line was General Richard II O'Donovan, who was the first person in two hundred years to declare himself \\"the O'Donovan\\", based on his lineage and social stature. Following his death in 1829, the title 'the O'Donovan' was assumed by Protestant clergyman Morgan O'Donovan but his claim was not accepted by the clan.Graves Collection; holograph letters from Timothy O'Donovan, Donovan's Cove to John O’Donovan General O'Donovan willed the last of the ancient Clancahill estates, Bawnlahan, to the family of his wife, by whom he had no issue. General O'Donovan's self-proclaimed chiefship was passed by his agreement to a cadet line in the person of the Reverend Morgan O'Donovan of Montpelier, who was a descendant of Teige O'Donovan, of Mauleycorane, son of Donal II by the Lady Joanna née MacCarthy Reagh. The title of O'Donovan of Clan Cahill has been passed to subsequent generations from Rev. O'Donovan. The grandson of the Reverend Morgan was Morgan William II O'Donovan, who fought in the Second Boer War 1900–1902, and was mentioned in despatches. He was later Colonel of the 4th Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers 1903–1914. His mother was Amelia, daughter of Gerald de Courcy O'Grady, The O'Grady. Morgan William's son was Morgan John Winthrop O'Donovan, who fought in World War I and was decorated with the Military Cross. He later commanded the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers during World War II. O'Donovan of Clan Cahill Morgan Gerald Daniel O'DonovanthePeerage.comThe O'Donovan, Independent.ie, Sunday 14 January 2007, accessed Wednesday 3 March 2010 (Murchadh Gearóid Dónal Ó Donnabháin) was born in Pau, France, in 1931, died 25 January 2016, was the son of Morgan John Winthrop O'Donovan by his wife Cornelia Bagnell (died 1974). Educated at Stowe and Trinity College, Cambridge, O'Donovan resided near Skibbereen, in West Cork. O'Donovan was a member of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland, and served as Chairman of the Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains. He was married to Frances Jane, daughter of the late Sir Gerald Templer, with whom his father served in the Royal Irish Fusiliers. They have issue: a son, Morgan Teige Gerald (born 1961), educated at Harrow and Girton College, Cambridge and two daughters, Katharine Jane (born 1962) and Cecilia Mary Cornelia (born 1966) [married N.G.F. Chamberlain, 1996 and has issue]. O'Donovan served on the Council with O'Donoghue of the Glens, McGillycuddy of the Reeks, O'Callaghan (Tortosa), Baron Inchiquin and O'Grady, the last his distant cousin. O'Callaghan and O'Donoghue are much more distant cousins through the MacCarthys. O'Donovan was profiled and interviewed by Ellis, Curley, and Chambers, for which see the list of references below. =Gaelic rank and titles= From the 10th to the beginning of the 13th century the O'Donovans were titled rí or rig and belonged to the middle grade of Irish kings, either as kings of Uí Fidgenti, a once relatively large regional kingdom, or as kings of Uí Chairpre, itself a smaller but expanding regional kingdom containing at least two local petty kingdoms and a number of other tuatha, as well as additional occupied and conquered territories, stretching into County Tipperary and apparently including the majority of the lands surrounding Norse Limerick, according to the author of the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib.Todd, p. 87 According to the historian William F. T. Butler, Uí Chairpre alone contained six to as many as ten tuatha and Uí Chonaill sixteen more.William F. T. Butler, Gleanings from Irish History. Longmans, Green & Co. 1925. p. 299. As kings of the middle or regional grade, members were known as Ruiris or \\"over-kings\\". =Clanloughlin and Ballymore= These O'Donovans are notable for many accomplishments. An important junior sept, the Donovans of Ballymore, established themselves in County Wexford. Many have distinguished themselves in political office and the military. * Jeremiah O'Donovan (MP Baltimore) * Juliana Donovan, Countess of Anglesey – scandalised widow of Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey * Edward Westby Donovan – fought in the Crimean War, later Commander of British Troops in Hong Kong. Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur. The current representative of Clan Loughlin and the Ballymore sept is the scholar Brian Donovan of Trinity College, Dublin, a descendant of Donal Oge na Cartan O'Donovan, Lord of Clan Loughlin (died 1629). He is the CEO and co-founder of the historical research company Eneclann, based at Trinity.Eneclann =Sliocht Aineislis= =Sliocht Íomhair= Territory in Carbery Between them, Clancahill and Clan Loughlin controlled the entire harbour of Glandore, the former on the west side and the latter on the east, although before the 1560s the Clancahill portion appears to have been controlled by the Sliocht Íomhair. Clan Loughlin were seated at Cloghatradbally, now called Glandore Castle, a 13th-century Norman castle built by the Barretts, from whom they took it. This is the sacred harbour of Clíodhna. Clancahill came to control half of Castlehaven harbour as well, the ancient O'Driscolls of Corcu Loígde in control of the other. From the ocean the territory of the O'Donovans then stretched north and northwest into the area of Drimoleague, with the well known Castle Donovan found in a valley not far from that village. This, up in the mountains, in a remote area, was the principal seat of the Clancahill main line until the early 17th century. At what was probably their height in Carbery, between the late 16th century and their partial dispossession following the so-called Irish rebellion of 1641 and the Irish Confederate Wars in the mid 17th, the O'Donovans were in control of approximately 100,000 acres right in the center of the principality, with territories both in West and East Carbery. Of this, however, only around 15,000 acres were usable as farmland. In the remaining they were still owed rents and had the rights to hold court(s), fairs, and so on. From the several harbours and bays they controlled actually came their chief income, which was the case for lords all along the South Munster coast. Following the Cromwellian confiscations, the infamously ungrateful Charles II of England, after first giving his deceitful word he would restore them entirely, granted the vast majority to soldiers of Cromwell's army in lieu of pay. The O'Donovans would regain possession of less than one twentieth their former territories, a few thousand acres... although this was better than many Gaelic families did. The great MacCarthys Reagh lost virtually everything, receiving not enough back to even live on respectably, a few hundred acres out of the approaching they once controlled at their height (this included the O'Donovan territories, which were at one time probably much less than 100,000 acres), so they eventually left. Clanlouglin lost their estates twice, first the majority of the fairly immense Manor of Glandore in the 1650s to Cromwell and his soldiers, and then the Manor of the Leap, a descendant of the remains of the former, in 1737, when one of their dynasts, Jeremiah II O'Donovan, sold it. In 1878 various branches of the O'Donovan family were reported successful (landed) and in possession of 17,213 acres of estates in several counties in southern Ireland,The Landowners of Ireland, pp. 348, 133 not counting estates and homesteads of less than 500 acres. By this time Donovans were well established in England, Australia, Canada, Argentina and the United States.

He has written works that include seven symphonies, eleven string quartets, eight cantatas, two one-act operas, three piano sonatas, two cello and piano sonatas, four violin and piano sonatas, six piano trios, four violin concertos and numerous other concertante works.  Career  Nicolas Bacri was born in Paris, France. His musical studies began with piano lessons at the age of seven. He continued to study harmony, counterpoint, analysis and composition as a teenager with Françoise Levechin-Gangloff and Christian Manen. After 1979, he continued his studies with Louis Saguer. In 1979, Bacri entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he studied with Claude Ballif, Marius Constant, Serge Nigg, and Michel Philippot. After graduating in 1983 with the premier prix in composition, he attended the French Academy in Rome.Pernon, Gérard (ed.), \\"Bacri, Nicolas\\", Dictionnaire de la musique 5th edition, Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, 2007, p.16. Back in Paris, he worked for four years (1987–91) as the Director of Chamber Music for Radio France.France Musique, Nicolas Bacri, Compositeur français Bacri organized the very first performance of the complete 15 string quartets cycle by Shostakovich (1989–90 season with the Manhattan String Quartet as a symbol of the end of cold war) in France and featured for the first time in France the major composers of Terezin: Pavel Haas, Gideon Klein, Hans Krasa and Viktor Ullmann. Since then, he has concentrated on free-lance composing, receiving commissions from major institutions and festivals around the world. Bacri taught orchestration at the Geneva Conservatory (HEM/HES) from 2005 to 2011. He regularly gives masterclasses in composition in France and abroad (in USA: Rochester Eastman School of music... Russia: Ekaterinburg Ural Academy and China: Beijing Conservatory). Bacri received important commissions in all major musical fields: opera, symphony, concertante, vocal, choral and chamber music. In February 2020 Riccardo Muti conducted his Ophelia's Tears, Concertante Elegy for Bass-clarinet and orchestra op. 150, with soloist J. Lawrie Bloom, commission from Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Made possible through the generous support of Helen Zell)\\"The openly emotional writing for the Bass-clarinet (...) surely defied musical fashions of our noisy age.\\" Howard Reich, Chicago Tribune. Held by Jonh Bortslap in his book \\"The Classical revolution\\" (Thoughts on new music in the 21st Century\\", Scarecrow Press, inc. 2012) as \\"the most important french composer since Messiaen and Dutilleux...\\", Bacri has been Professor of Composition at the Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional (CRR) de Paris since October 2017 and at the Schola Cantorum (Paris) since October 2018. In his book Notes étrangères, published in 2004 by Seguier (coll. Carré musique) N. Bacri expresses his ideas as: “My music is not Neoclassical, it is Classical, for it retains the timeless aspect of Classicism: the rigor of expression. My music is not Neo- romantic, it is Romantic, for it retains the timeless aspect of Romanticism: the density of expression. My music is Modern, for it retains the timeless aspect of Modernism: the broadening of the field of expression. My music is Postmodern, for it retains the timeless aspect of Postmodernism: the mixture of techniques of expression.” Bacri's Symphony No. 6, Op. 60, was a finalist in the 2003 Masterprize international composing competition. Bacri made his debut as conductor with the London Symphony Orchestra conducting the world premiere of his opus 130 titled A Day (Four Images for Orchestra) at L'Opéra of the Palace of Versailles in Paris on 8 September 2013. The 29 minutes long symphonic piece was written on commission for South Korean businessman Yoo Byung-eun. It has been recorded at the Abbey Road Studios for a planned future release.

Upon completing his school education he was articled to Alfred Adams, a Douglas advocate. He was admitted to the Manx Bar in 1877 at the age of 24 and commenced practice in Ramsey He soon obtained a reputation as a sound lawyer. In 1880, upon the appointment of Alfred Adams as Clerk of the Rolls, Dickinson invited him to become his partner in one of the largest legal practices in the Isle of Man. His rival at the Bar was the Attorney General. Kneen also took a considerable interest in politics. In this respect he first came to prominence by persuading the rural electors of the insufficient representation of the town of Douglas in the House of Keys. In 1892 he was returned unopposed to the House of Keys to fill the vacancy in the constituency of Glenfaba. His time in the House was short as his legal duties took up his time and he resigned in 1895. In 1895 he was appointed Captain of the Parish of Onchan, an office he held until his death.

A higher education provider is a body that is established or recognised by or under the law of the Australian Government, a state, or the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. There are 42 universities in Australia: 37 public universities, three private universities, and two international private universities. The flagship Australian universities are Go8 universities. Australian universities are modelled on the British system, so learning is comparatively challenging, but there are other intermediate options that may be taken as preparatory steps and very research-oriented starts early from the similar American freshman year (there is no liberal arts requirement in the first year, so many of them only have three years to graduate), and generally sets international research-ready standards throughout the entire learning experience to evaluate students' academic performances. Australia ranked 4th (with Germany) by OECD in international PhD students destination after US, UK and France. Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019. Allocation of responsibilities Decision-making, regulation and governance for higher education are shared among the Australian Government, the state and territory governments and the institutions themselves. Some aspects of higher education are the responsibility of states and territories. In particular, most universities are established or recognised under state and territory legislation. States and territories are also responsible for accrediting non- self-accrediting higher education providers. =Funding= The Australian Government has the primary responsibility for public funding of higher education. The Higher Education Support Act 2003 sets out the details of Australian Government funding and its associated legislative requirements. Australian Government funding support for higher education is provided largely through: * the Commonwealth Grant Scheme which provides for a specified number of Commonwealth supported places each year * the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) arrangements providing financial assistance to students * the Commonwealth Scholarships and * a range of grants for specific purposes including quality, learning and teaching, research and research training programmes The Department of Education has responsibility for administering this funding, and for developing and administering higher education policy and programs. = Quality and Standards = The federal government also plays a role in the quality and standards of higher education via the statutory agency Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency TEQSA. The regulatory agency provides quality assurance and standards are met using various pieces of legislation for example Higher Education Standards Framework to ensure compliance. It registers higher education providers and collects information to assess and evaluate performance. Universities In Australia, universities are self-accrediting institutions and each university has its own establishment legislation (generally state and territory legislation) and receive the vast majority of their public funding from the Australian Government, through the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The Australian National University, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the Australian Maritime College are established under Commonwealth legislation. The Australian Catholic University is established under corporations law. It has establishment Acts in New South Wales and Victoria. Many private providers are also established under corporations law. As self-accrediting institutions, Australia's universities have a reasonably high level of autonomy to operate within the legislative requirements associated with their Australian Government funding. Australian universities are represented through the national universities' lobbying body Universities Australia (previously called Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee). Eight universities in the list have formed a group in recognition of their recognised status and history, known as the 'Group of Eight' or 'Go8'. Other university networks have been formed among those of less prominence (e.g., the Australian Technology Network and the Innovative Research Universities). Academic standing and achievements vary across these groups and student entry standards also vary with the Go8 universities having the highest standing in both categories. Technical and further education and registered training organisation The various state- administered institutes of technical and further education (TAFE) across the country are the major providers of vocational education and training (VET) in Australia. TAFE institutions generally offer short courses, Certificates I, II, III, and IV, diplomas, and advanced diplomas in a wide range of vocational topics. They also sometimes offer higher education courses, especially in Victoria. The Grattan Institute has found that, for low-ATAR male students, TAFE training often results in a more stable and lucrative career than a university degree. Low-ATAR female students, however, are usually better off acquiring a degree in a profession such as teaching or nursing. In addition to TAFE institutes there are many registered training organisations (RTOs) which are privately operated. In Victoria alone there are approximately 1100. They include: * commercial training providers * the training department of manufacturing or service enterprises * the training function of employer or employee organisations in a particular industry * Group training companies * community learning centres and neighbourhood houses * secondary colleges providing VET programs In size these RTOs vary from single-person operations delivering training and assessment in a narrow specialisation, to large organisations offering a wide range of programs. Many of them receive government funding to deliver programs to apprentices or trainees, to disadvantaged groups, or in fields which governments see as priority areas. VET programs delivered by TAFE institutes and private RTOs are based on nationally registered qualifications, derived from either endorsed sets of competency standards known as training packages, or from courses accredited by state/territory government authorities. These qualifications are regularly reviewed and updated. In specialised areas where no publicly owned qualifications exist, an RTO may develop its own course and have it accredited as a privately owned program, subject to the same rules as those that are publicly owned. All trainers and assessors delivering VET programs are required to hold a qualification known as the Certificate IV in Training and Assessment (TAA40104) or the more current TAE40110,http://training.gov.au/Training/Details/TAE40110 or demonstrate equivalent competency. They are also required to have relevant vocational competencies, at least to the level being delivered or assessed. All TAFE institutes and private RTOs are required to maintain compliance with a set of national standards called the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF), and this compliance is monitored by regular internal and external audits. Classification of tertiary qualifications In Australia, the classification of tertiary qualifications is governed in part by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), which attempts to integrate into a single classification all levels of tertiary education (both vocational and higher education), from trade certificates to higher doctorates. However, as Australian universities largely regulate their own courses, the primary usage of AQF is for vocational education. In recent years there have been some informal moves towards standardisation between higher education institutions. History =To World War II= The first university established in Australia was the University of Sydney in 1850, followed in 1853 by the University of Melbourne. Prior to federation in 1901 two more universities were established: the University of Adelaide (1874) and the University of Tasmania (1890). At the time of federation, Australia's population was 3,788,100 and there were fewer than 2,652 university students. Two other universities were established soon after federation: the University of Queensland (1909) and the University of Western Australia (1911). All of these universities were controlled by State governments and were largely modelled on the traditional British university system and adopted both architectural and educational features in line with the (then) strongly influential 'mother' country. In his paper Higher Education in Australia: Structure, Policy and Debate Jim Breen observed that in 1914 only 3,300 students (or 0.1% of the Australian population) were enrolled in universities. In 1920 the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) was formed to represent the interests of these six universities. The 'non-university' institutions originally issued only trade/technical certificates, diplomas and professional bachelor's degrees. Although universities were differentiated from technical colleges and institutes of technology through their participation in research, Australian universities were initially not established with research as a significant component of their overall activities. For this reason, the Australian Government established the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 1926 as a backbone for Australian scientific research. The CSIRO still exists today as a legacy, despite the fact that it essentially duplicates the role now undertaken by Australian universities. Two university colleges and no new universities were established before World War II. On the eve of the war, Australia's population reached seven million. The university participation level was relatively low. Australia had six universities and two university colleges with combined student numbers of 14,236. 10,354 were degree students (including only 81 higher degree students) and almost 4,000 sub-degree or non-award students. =World War II to 1972= In 1942, the Universities Commission was created to regulate university enrolments and the implementation of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme (CRTS). After the war, in recognition of the increased demand for teachers for the \\"baby boom\\" generation and the importance of higher education in national economic growth, the Commonwealth Government took an increased role in the financing of higher education from the States. In 1946 the Australian National University was created by an Act of Federal Parliament as a national research only institution (research and postgraduate research training for national purposes). By 1948 there were 32,000 students enrolled, under the impetus of CRTS. In 1949 the University of New South Wales was established. During the 1950s enrolments increased by 30,000 and participation rates doubled. In 1950 the Mills Committee Inquiry into university finances, focusing on short-term rather than long-term issues, resulted in the State Grants (Universities) Act 1951 being enacted (retrospective to 1 July 1950). It was a short-term scheme under which the Commonwealth contributed one quarter of the recurrent costs of \\"State\\" universities. In 1954 the University of New England was established. In that year, Robert Menzies established the Committee on Australian Universities. The Murray Committee Inquiry of 1957 found that financial stringency was the root cause of the shortcomings across universities: short staffing, poor infrastructure, high failure rates, weak honours and postgraduate schools. It also accepted the financial recommendations in full, which led to increased funds to the sector and establishment of Australian Universities Commission (AUC) and the conclusion that the Commonwealth Government should accept greater responsibility for the States' universities. In 1958 Monash University was established. States Grants (Universities) Act 1958 allocated funding to States for capital and recurrent expenditure in universities for the triennial 1958 to 1960. In 1959 the Australian Universities Commission Act 1959 established the AUC as a statutory body to advise the Commonwealth Government on university matters. Between 1958 and 1960 there was more than a 13% annual increase in university enrolments. By 1960 there were 53,000 students in ten universities. There was a spate of universities established in the 1960s and 70s: Macquarie University (1964), La Trobe University (1964), the University of Newcastle (1965), Flinders University (1966), James Cook University (1970), Griffith University (1971), Deakin University (1974), Murdoch University (1975), and the University of Wollongong (1975). By 1960, the number of students enrolled in Australian Universities had reached 53,000. By 1975 there were 148,000 students in 19 universities. =After 1972= Until 1973, university tuition was funded either through Commonwealth scholarships, which were based on merit, or through fees. Tertiary education in Australia was structured into three sectors: * Universities * Institutes of technology (a hybrid between a university and a technical college) * Technical colleges During the early 1970s, there was a significant push to make tertiary education in Australia more accessible to working and middle-class people. In 1973, the Whitlam Labor Government abolished university fees. This increased the university participation rate. In 1974, the Commonwealth assumed full responsibility for funding higher education (i.e., universities and Colleges of Advanced Education (CAEs)) and established the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC), which had an advisory role and responsibility for allocating government funding among universities. However, in 1975, in the context of federal political crisis and economic recession, triennial funding of universities was suspended. Demand remained with growth directed to CAEs and State-controlled TAFE colleges. =1980s= By the mid-1980s, it became the consensus of both major parties that the concept of 'free' tertiary education in Australia was untenable due to the increasing participation rate. Ironically, a subsequent Labor Government (the Bob Hawke/Paul Keating Government) was responsible for gradually re-introducing fees for university study. In a relatively innovative move, the method by which fees were re- introduced proved to be a system accepted by both Federal political parties and consequently is still in place today. The system is known as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and enables students to defer payment of fees until after they commence professional employment, and after their income exceeds a threshold level – at that point, the fees are automatically deducted through income tax. By the late 1980s, the Australian tertiary education system was still a three-tier system, composed of: * All tertiary institutions established as universities by acts of parliament (e.g. Sydney, Monash, La Trobe, Griffith) * A collection of institutes of technology (such as the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)) * A collection of colleges of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) However, by this point, the roles of the universities, institutes of technology and the CSIRO had also become blurred. Institutes of technology had moved from their traditional role of undergraduate teaching and industry-consulting towards conducting pure and applied research. They also had the ability to award degrees through to Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) level. For a number of reasons, including clarifying the role of institutes of technology, the Federal Minister for Education of the time (John Dawkins) created the unified national system, which compressed the former three-tier tertiary education system into a two-tier system. This required a number of amalgamations and mergers between smaller tertiary institutions, and the option for institutes of technology to become universities. As a result of these reforms, institutes of technology disappeared and were replaced by a collection of new universities. By the early 1990s, the two-tier tertiary education was in place in Australia – university education and Technical and Further Education (TAFE). By the early years of the new millennium, even TAFE colleges were permitted to offer degrees up to bachelor's level. The 1980s also saw the establishment of Australia's first private university, Bond University. Founded by businessman Alan Bond, this Gold Coast institution was granted its university status by the Queensland government in 1987. Bond University now awards diplomas, certificates, bachelor's degrees, masters and doctorates across most disciplines. =1990s= For the most part, up until the 1990s, the traditional Australian universities had focused upon pure, fundamental, and basic research rather than industry or applied research – a proportion of which had been well supported by the CSIRO which had been set up for this function. Australians had performed well internationally in pure research, having scored almost a dozen Nobel Prizes as a result of their participation in pure research. In the 1990s, the Hawke/Keating Federal Government sought to redress the shortcoming in applied research by creating a cultural shift in the national research profile. This was achieved by introducing university scholarships and research grants for postgraduate research in collaboration with industry, and by introducing a national system of Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs). These new centres were focused on a narrow band of research themes (e.g., photonics, cast metals, etc.) and were intended to foster cooperation between universities and industry. A typical CRC would be composed of a number of industry partners, university partners and CSIRO. Each CRC would be funded by the Federal Government for an initial period of several years. The total budget of a CRC, composed of the Federal Government monies combined with industry and university funds, was used to fund industry-driven projects with a high potential for commercialisation. It was perceived that this would lead to CRCs becoming self-sustaining (self-funding) entities in the long-term, although this has not eventuated. Most Australian universities have some involvement as partners in CRCs, and CSIRO is also significantly represented across the spectrum of these centres. This has led to a further blurring of the role of CSIRO and how it fits in with research in Australian universities. People attending a tertiary institution as a percentage of the local population at the 2011 census, geographically subdivided by statistical local area Total employment in tertiary education (thousands of people) since 1984 =2000s= The transition from a three-tier tertiary education system to a two-tier system was not altogether successful. By 2006, it became apparent that the long term problem for the unified national system was that newer universities could not build up critical mass in their nominated research areas – at the same time, their increase in research level deprived traditional universities of high calibre research-oriented academics. These issues were highlighted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in 2006. The available money was spread across all universities, and even the traditional universities had a diminished capacity to maintain critical mass. The Melbourne Institute figures, based upon Government (DEST) data, revealed that many of the newer universities were scoring \\"zeros\\" (on a scale of 0 – 100) in their chosen research fields (i.e., were unable to achieve the threshold level of activity required). In 2006 Campion College was opened in Sydney as Australia's first liberal arts tertiary college. In 2008, Canberra lifted restrictions on university enrolments, in order to make tertiary education more accessible to students from socioeconomic groups which had previously had relatively low levels of education. However, since federal funding to each university is largely determined by student numbers, this created an incentive for universities to increase their enrolments by accepting students with weak academic skills. In response to falling graduation rates and academic standards, along with rising grants to the tertiary sector, Canberra will freeze grants at 2017 levels for two years, followed by increases according to population growth and university performance. Graduates in high-paying jobs will have to put a certain percentage of their income toward repaying their student debts. = 2020s = The Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has impacted the Australian tertiary education sector by reducing revenue by A$3 - 4.6 billion. Australian universities depend on overseas students for their revenue. Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan announced a $18 billion package to support the sector by allowing universities to offer short courses of 6 months duration with at least 50 per cent reduction in fees. Tehan announced that 20,000 places short- term courses in nursing, teaching, health, IT and science. International students Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/booming-student- market-a-valuable-property/news- story/6bb3823260aa3443f0c26909406d089bhttps://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/11/australian- universities-double-down-on-international-students/. Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/temporary-graduate- visa-485-boom/10035390 Australia's universities are increasingly dependent on revenues from international students. Therefore, they are willing to accept such students with weak academic and English-language skills.. This is despite circumstances in which, after graduation, many struggle to find jobs in their field, being either underemployed in low-skilled jobs or unemployed. Criticism Problems with the new mass marketing of academic degrees include declining academic standards, increased teaching by sessional lecturers, large class sizes, 20% of graduates working part-time, 26% of graduates working full-time but considering themselves to be underemployed, 26% of students not graduating at all, and 17% of employers losing confidence in the quality of instruction at a university. Students' rate of return on their large investment in time and money depends to a great extent on their study area. A longitudinal study by the Department of Education and Training found that median full-time salaries for undergraduates four years into their careers ranged from $55,000 in the creative arts to $120,000 in dentistry. For those with a master's degree or higher, the figures range from $68,800 in communication studies to $122,100 in medicine. Rates of graduate unemployment and underemployment also vary widely between study areas. For comparison, the average taxable income for the top ten trades range from $68,000 for landscapers to $109,000 for boilermakers. A 2018 study from the Grattan Institute found that the gender gap in career earnings has continued to shrink, and that the proportion of foreign students is growing rapidly. Although the graduate labour market has partly recovered from the Great Recession, only the education, nursing and medical sectors have seen significant earnings growth. There is a concern that Australian Universities have \\"lacked the incentives, encouragement and resources\\" to \\"bring about the transformation in which high-growth, technology-based businesses become a driving force behind Australia's economy\\" and demonstrated there is no Australian universities placed in the Reuters top 100 ranking for lack of innovation and competitiveness.http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/2015/10/new- report-boosting-high-impact-entrepreneurship-in-australia/ Only 10.4% of Australian higher education students study ICT and Engineering/Technologies related courses.https://docs.education.gov.au/node/43231 =Governance= With a larger proportion of university turnover derived from non-Government funds,Marginson, S. National system reform in global context: The case of Australia . Reforms and consequences in higher education system: An international symposium, National Centre of Sciences, Hitotubashi Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 2009. the role of university vice chancellors has moved from one of academic administration to strategic management. Accompanying this shift has been a massive rise in the remuneration of these officials to as much as $1.5 million per year. However, university governance structures remained largely unchanged from their 19th-century origins. All Australian universities have a governance system composed of a vice-chancellor (chief executive officer); chancellor (non-executive head) and university council (governing body). However, unlike a corporate entity board, the university council members have neither financial nor vested specific interests in the performance of the organisation (although the state government is represented in each university council, representing the state government legislative role in the system). =Melbourne University Private venture= The late 1990s and early years of the new millennium therefore witnessed a collection of financial, managerial and academic failures across the university system – the most notable of these being the Melbourne University Private venture, which saw hundreds of millions of dollars invested in non-productive assets, in search of a 'Harvard style' private university that never delivered on planned outcomes. This was detailed in a book (Off Course) written by former Victorian State Premier John Cain (junior) and co-author John Hewitt who explored problems with governance at the University of Melbourne, arguably one of the nation's most prestigious universities. =Federal Government quality measures= The Australian Federal Government has established two quality systems for assessing university performance. These are the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) and Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA). The TEQSA reviews of universities essentially look at processes, procedures and their documentation. The TEQSA exercise, largely bureaucratic rather than strategic, is currently moving towards its second round of assessments, with all Australian universities having seemingly received mixed (but generally positive) results in the first round. TEQSA's shortcoming is that it does not specifically address issues of governance or strategic planning in anything other than a bureaucratic sense. In the April 2007 edition of Campus Review,Campus Review the Vice Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Fred Hilmer, criticised both AUQA (the agency before it became TEQSA) and the Research Quality Framework (a precursor to the ERA that was discarded before rollout): \\"... singling out AUQA, Hilmer notes that while complex quality processes are in place, not one institution has lost its accreditation – 'there's never been a consequence – so it's just red tape...'\\" \\"...The RQF is not a good thing – it's an expensive way to measure something that could be measured relatively simply. If we wanted to add impacts as one of the factors, then let's add impact. That can be achieved simply without having to go through what looks like a $90 million dollar exercise with huge implementation issues.\\" The RQF (scrapped with the change in government in 2007) was modelled on the British Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) system, and was intended to assess the quality and impact of research undertaken at universities through panel-based evaluation of individual research groups within university disciplines. Its objective was to provide government, industry, business and the wider community with an assurance that research quality within Australian universities had been rigorously assessed against international standards. Assessment was expected to allow research groups to be benchmarked against national and international standards across discipline areas. If successfully implemented, this would have been a departure from the Australian Government's traditional approach to measuring research performance exclusively through bibliometrics. The RQF was fraught with controversy, particularly because the cost of such an undertaking (using international panels) and the difficulty in having agreed definitions of research quality and impact. The Labor government which scrapped the RQF has yet to outline any system which will replace it, stating however that it will enter into discussions with higher education providers, to gain consensus on a streamlined, metrics-driven approach. =International reputations= Australian universities consistently feature well in the top 150 international universities as ranked by the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University Rankings, and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. From 2012 through 2016, eight Australian universities have featured in the top 150 universities of these three lists. The eight universities which are regularly ranked highly are Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, the University of Adelaide, Monash University, the University of Western Australia, the University of New South Wales, and the University of Sydney. These universities comprise Australia's Group of Eight, a coalition of research-intensive Australian universities.

It allows the user to interpret seismic data, perform well correlation, build reservoir models, visualize reservoir simulation results, calculate volumes, produce maps and design development strategies to maximize reservoir exploitation. Risk and uncertainty can be assessed throughout the life of the reservoir. Petrel is developed and built by Schlumberger. Background Petrel software was developed in Norway by a company called Technoguide. Technoguide was formed in 1996 by former employees of Geomatic, some of whom were key programmers involved in the early development of RMS. Petrel was developed specifically for PCs and the Windows OS, it was commercially available in 1998. Petrel was developed to have a familiar Microsoft like interface, with a pre-arranged workflow that enabled less experienced user to follow, Technoguide made 3D geologic modeling more accessible to all subsurface technical staff, even those without specialist training. In 2002, Schlumberger acquired Technoguide and the Petrel software tools and they currently support and market Petrel. Newer versions of Petrel include additional functionality such as geological modeling, seismic interpretation, uncertainty analysis, well planning, and links to reservoir simulators.  Version History  * Petrel Version 2007.1 The Petrel 2007.1 release expands the application's seismic-to-simulation scope with greater capabilities for exploration workflows. Petrel software now handles large- scale seismic surveys and regional scale 2D lines. Fracture modeling and dual porosity capabilities support carbonates and unconventional gas workflows. Real-time updates are available through WITSML, the industry standard data delivery mechanism. Petrel 2007.1 software was built on the Ocean framework which allows 3rd parties, universities, oil companies and other parts of Schlumberger to code directly into Petrel. * Petrel Version 2008.1 Released in March 2008. Major enhancements include support for hydraulic fractures, sector modeling, multi-threading of several modeling processes, and improvements to the 3D seismic autotracking workflows. A major re-working of the volume rendering and extraction module now allows users to interactively blend multiple seismic volumes, isolate out areas of interest and then instantly extract what is seen into a 3D object called a geobody. In essence this is “what you see is what you pick”. Extracted 'geobodys' can be sampled directly into the geological model. * Petrel Version 2009.1 Released in February 2009 this is the first version of Petrel to be fully 64bit and to run on Microsoft's Windows Vista 64 bit OS. This brings large performance benefits to users especially those working in exploration or with large seismic volumes and geological models. Other enhancements include a new type of Seismic Inversion called Genetic Inversion based on a non-linear multi-trace approach. Multipoint geostatistics, completions modeling, automated fault polygon generation and a new synthetic seismogram package called Seismic-Well-Tie * Petrel Version 2010.1 Released in May 2010. Major enhancements include a new structural modeling workflow enabling the user to build water tight structural models while interpreting. Other enhancements include improvements to the fracture modeling, multipoint geostatistics, and the volume interpretation workflows. This version also integrates Petromod for petroleum systems modeling and RDR's advanced structural and fault analysis module enabling an integrated approach to exploration to analysis Trap, Seal, Reservoir, & Charge in the same place. Building on the Ocean framework this release coincided with the release of the Ocean Store and online store where users can download plugins for Petrel.

Viking Press) Fame is the Spur is a novel by Howard Spring published in 1940. It covers the rise of the socialist labour movement in Britain from the mid 19th century to the 1930s. The title comes from John Milton's poem Lycidas: \\"Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise / (That last infirmity of noble mind) / To scorn delights, and live laborious days\\".\\"How Fame is the Spur got its name\\", The Telegraph, 24 August 2008. Accessed 6 Nov 2014  Plot summary  The central character, Hamer Shawcross, starts as a studious boy in an aspirational working-class family in Ancoats, Manchester; he becomes a socialist activist and soon a career politician, who eventually is absorbed by the upper classes he had begun by combating. In fact the story is rather subtler than this summary sounds, despite the fact that the author's sympathies obviously lie with Shawcross's friends and associates who remain faithful to the cause; however, many of the middle class and aristocratic characters are portrayed fairly sympathetically, and one character whose career parallels that of Shawcross in his rise from poverty to eminence is a market-boy who becomes a major capitalist. The book also gives a fair impression of the growth particularly of the Labour Party in Britain; historical characters, such as Keir Hardie, occasionally appear, and part of the book is taken up with the hardships of life for coal mining communities in South Wales at the turn of the 20th century. The treatment of the militant women's suffrage movement is especially detailed—there are graphic descriptions of imprisonment and forcible feeding of hunger strikers. Hamer Shawcross is often taken to be based on Ramsay MacDonald;Britmovie.co.uk Accessed 6 Nov 2014 though there are similarities in their careers, there are as many differences in their personalities.

He was subsequently cleared of criminal charges in February 2010.Omagh bomb accused Colm Murphy cleared by retrial Background Born in Belleeks, County Armagh, Murphy was an active Irish republican paramilitary from his late teens. In March 1972 he was arrested in Dundalk regarding an assault, and was sentenced to two years in prison after the Garda Síochána found a loaded revolver in his car. Murphy was imprisoned in the Curragh military jail but escaped in October 1972, and was not recaptured until May 1973. In June 1976 he was imprisoned again, receiving a three-year sentence for firearms offences and a one-year sentence for Provisional Irish Republican Army membership, both sentences to run concurrently. In July 1983 Murphy was arrested in the US, after attempting to buy a consignment of M60 machine guns to be shipped to Ireland for use by the Irish National Liberation Army. He received a five-year prison sentence, but returned to Ireland in December 1985 after being released early. In the late 1980s Murphy began investing in property, and formed a company named Emerald Enterprises in 1990. He bought the Emerald Bar public house in Dundalk for IR£100,000, and it later became a meeting place for dissident republicans. Other investments included of land in Drogheda bought for IR£52,000 in 1995, and his company won contracts for an IR£11m development at Dublin City University and the multi-million pound International Financial Services Centre in Dublin's docklands. Dissident republican activity Murphy was arrested by the Gardaí on 21 February 1999 for questioning under anti-terrorist legislation. On 24 February Murphy became the first person charged in connection with the Omagh bombing, when he appeared before Dublin's Special Criminal Court and was charged with conspiring to cause an explosion under the terms of Ireland's Offences Against the State Act, between 13 and 16 August 1998. Murphy was also charged with membership of an illegal organisation, the Real Irish Republican Army. On 10 October 2000 the BBC television show Panorama named Murphy as one four people connected with the Omagh bombing, along with Seamus Daly and Liam Campbell. In 2001 Murphy undertook legal action against the BBC and Daily Mail publishers Associated Newspapers for contempt of court. The action against Associated Newspapers was settled on 31 July 2001, and the newspaper released a statement saying Murphy was entitled to be presumed innocent of the charges against him until proven guilty. Murphy's trial began at Special Criminal Court in Dublin on 12 October 2001. The court heard that Murphy had supplied two mobile phones which were used during the bombing. One witness, Murphy's second cousin, retracted his evidence and the judge called the conduct of two detectives outrageous, saying they had persistently lied under cross-examination. Despite this, on 22 January 2002 Murphy was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, and on 25 January was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with the judge describing him as a long-time republican extremist. On 21 January 2005 Murphy's conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered, due to the invasion of Murphy's presumption of innocence, and alteration of Gardaí interview notes and evidence presented by two officers. A week later Murphy's legal case against the BBC was resolved, with the BBC issuing a statement that Murphy \\"was fully entitled to maintain his innocence of the charges against him and to test the evidence against him at his trial\\". On 23 October 2006 two Gardaí officers were found not guilty of perjuring themselves during Murphy's trial. On 23 May 2007 it was announced that Murphy is suffering from short- term memory loss resulting from a car accident in 1988. His lawyers attempted to prevent a retrial taking place, on the grounds that his condition interfered with his right to a fair hearing. The Court of Criminal Appeal was scheduled to hear his case again in October 2008. Following a retrial held in January 2010, Murphy was acquitted on 24 February 2010. In 2009 Murphy was one of four men found by a civil court to be liable for the Omagh bombing in a case taken by relatives of the victims. On 7 July 2011 in Belfast High Court, Lord Justice Malachy Higgins directed a retrial of the civil claims against Murphy. He questioned evidence surrounding emails from US undercover agent David Rupert while overturning the judgment on Murphy. The paucity of the email evidence, the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity, the possibility of initials referring to someone other than Murphy and the fact that they refer on occasions to double hearsay considerably weakened the emails as evidence, he said. Following a civil retrial, on 20 March 2013 Murphy and Seamus Daly were found liable for involvement in the bombing.

It is similar in form to his collection of connected memoir stories, The Periodic Table. First published as La Chiave a Stella by Einaudi in 1978, the book was written after Levi had retired from SIVA. It takes the form of an interview by a chemist of a rigger. They are both working in a remote work camp where there is little to do in the evenings except tell stories. The scene is loosely based upon Togliattigrad, the Fiat camp set up in Russia to build a car factory. The rigger is Libertino Faussone and the chemist is clearly autobiographical. Stories The job of a rigger is to set up cranes and scaffolding and to manage major mechanical projects. One of Faussone's jobs is to sort out a problem with an acetic acid separation column which goes through a cycle of making loud noises and shaking, before settling down again. It turns out the ceramic contents of the column have disintegrated and have formed a sludge at the bottom. This is precisely what happened at SIVA to a column that Levi designed. The story, one of many in the book, is about troubleshooting, and the forensic investigation skills needed to solve industrial problems. The skills include being able to assess the facts of a failure, analyse them in the light of the product design, and once the root cause has been identified, act to correct the mistake or mistakes so as to prevent further events of the same kind. Levi always felt that satisfying work was essential for a happy life, and the honest hands-on work of someone who also used his intellect was the highest form of work. Faussone was his ideal.

It was located at the end of Calshot Spit in Southampton Water, Hampshire, England, at . It was the main seaplane/flying boat development and training unit in the UK, with the landing area sheltered by the mainland, to the west, north and east, and the Isle of Wight, a few miles away to the south on the other side of the Solent, where seaplanes and flying boats were mass-produced by Saunders-Roe. It closed in 1961. Much of the former base has been preserved, with most of the site now being occupied by the RNLI. Origins The station was originally established on 29 March 1913 by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), as the Calshot Naval Air Station, for the purpose of testing seaplanes for the RFC Naval wing. The station was taken over by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) during the First World WarNaval Aviation History & FAA Origins - Fleet Air Arm Archive. and finally became a Royal Air Force station on the merger of the RNAS and the RFC on 1 April 1918. 1918 to 1939 RAF personnel on the beach at Calshot, 1936. Houston House, formerly the officer's mess at RAF Calshot. Plaque commemorating Lady Houston's funding for the 1931 RAF Schneider Trophy team. On 8 August 1918 'A' & 'B' Boat Seaplane Training Flights was formed here within 210 Training Depot Station before being disbanded during 1919. On the formation of the RAF, Calshot retained the two RNAS flights of Felixstowe flying boats and the flight of seaplanes, and for a short while the station became the headquarters of No. 10 Group RAF. After the war, Calshot continued its crew training and aircraft development role, and became home to the RAF School of Naval Co- operation and Aerial Navigation. The station was officially renamed as RAF Calshot on 5 February 1922. During this time, Calshot also housed a reconnaissance flight (with Felixstowe flying boats), and a large part of the unit was designated for the training of motorboat crews and other marine craft; the boats mainly used for towing disabled aircraft, collecting bombs from practice runs, and for towing gunnery target boats. On 24 March 1924, three serving members of the RAF took off from Calshot in a Vickers Vulture amphibious biplane on a planned round-the-world flight. The flight was beset by bad weather and several mishaps, including a crash in Akyab Harbour, Burma (requiring a replacement aircraft); and eventually a forced sea landing near Bering Island ended the attempt. Calshot also became home for the High Speed Flight as it prepared for the Schneider Trophy competitions in 1927, 1929 and finally 1931. The 1927 competition was held in Venice and won for Britain by the Calshot team in a Supermarine S.5, giving Britain the right to host the race in 1929. Calshot was chosen as the venue and an updated S.5 aircraft covered the seven laps at an average speed of 328.63 mph to take the prize. Two years later, again at Calshot, a Supermarine S.6B won the race for Britain for the third time in a row to retain the Trophy outright. \\"Aircraftsman Shaw\\", also known as T. E. Lawrence, or Lawrence of Arabia, was detached to Calshot to help with the 1929 Schneider races. While there he was seconded to the nearby British Power Boat Company factory, where he worked with Hubert Scott-Paine in the development of the 200 Class Seaplane Tender, at the time claimed to be the fastest craft of their size in the world. Through the 1930s, Calshot continued its development and training role, and included: * Navigation School (until 6 January 1936), * 201 Sqn - re-formed on 1 January 1929 with Supermarine Southampton flying boats, and later with Saro Londons, * Seaplane Training Sqn (STC) - re-formed on 1 October 1931, * 240 Sqn - re- formed on 30 March 1937 from C Flight of the STC, initially equipped with Supermarine Scapas, then Short Singapores, and (by July 1939) with Saro Londons, * Flying Boat Training Sqn - re-formed on 2 January 1939. Second World War velodrome. Just before the outbreak of World War II, the two operational squadrons left Calshot: 201 Sqn to Pembroke Dock and 240 Sqn to Invergordon. Later, in June 1940, the Flying Boat Training Squadron moved away to Stranraer and Calshot became primarily responsible for the repair, maintenance and modification of RAF flying boats, concentrating on the maintenance of Short Sunderlands. The station also continued to provide marine craft maintenance, and to train boat crews. Calshot sent five seaplane tenders to help in the evacuation at Dunkirk on 31 May 1940 and three of these tenders carried 500 men to safety, with one of them making a successful second voyage. Also in 1940, a small number of ex Norwegian Heinkel He 115 flying boats arrived - later to be used for covert operations, landing and collecting agents from occupied Europe. The station housed several air-sea rescue (ASR) units from 1942 onwards. These were used in the D-Day landings, providing quick support for downed aircraft. 1946 to 1961 Operational squadrons returned to Calshot in March 1946, when No 201 Squadron arrived, to be followed a month later by No 230 Squadron, both equipped with Sunderlands. During the Berlin crisis of 1948, all the Sunderland aircraft from Calshot were called into action and flew over 1,000 sorties to the Berlin lakes from Hamburg carrying food into the city and evacuating sick children. On their return from Berlin, both squadrons were transferred to Pembroke. After this, although some flying continued, the station was primarily a marine craft station, providing Air Sea Rescue, target-towing and range safety launches, and also included No 238 Maintenance Unit, responsible for the servicing of all RAF marine craft. A notable event at RAF Calshot was the award of a George Medal to Corporal Peter (Andy) Anderson 3059642. In February 1950, whilst ferrying crew to their Sunderland flying boat as Duty Coxswain, an aircraft he had earlier supplied with technicians, burst into flames. This was due to float flares coming into contact with water, as the plane had partially sunk during a storm. Cpl Anderson transferred his remaining aircraft crews and, on passing a fireboat, ordered the burning plane to be sprayed with foam whilst he rescued the two fitters, who were in the burning water holding onto a propeller blade. With his own seaplane tender now on fire, he dropped them off at the jetty to be treated for their injuries. Cpl Anderson was awarded his George Medal at Buckingham Palace on 14 November 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester, King George VI being ill at the time. Two unfinished Saunders-Roe Princess flying boats, designed to carry 100 passengers and with a range of 5000 miles, were cocooned at RAF Calshot, near the island hangar during the 1950s and 1960s, before being scrapped. The third one was cocooned at Cowes. On 1 April 1961, the RAF base finally closed, the marine craft work being transferred to RAF Mount Batten in Plymouth Sound. Post-RAF RNLI Tyne class lifeboat at Calshot Spit mooring In 1964, Hampshire County Council negotiated a lease with the Crown Estates to use the site as an Activities Centre. The first course - a sailing one for Hampshire children - commenced on 18 May 1964. On 25 July 1970 the RNLI sent the Keith Nelson type lifeboat to Calshot for evaluation, and in 1971 a permanent station was established. As of 2010, an RNLI lifeboat, , was stationed afloat at moorings. In 2012, RNLB Alexander Coutanche was withdrawn from the station and it became an inshore lifeboat station. Short Sandringham Southern Cross at Calshot In 1981, a Short Sandringham flying boat, called the Southern Cross, landed at Calshot after an epic journey across the Atlantic Ocean. This plane is now housed at the Solent Sky aviation museum in Southampton. The last flying Sunderland, Excalibur, came ashore at Calshot in 1984. After an extensive refit, it was flown to Florida in 1994 to join the extensive collection of Kermit Weeks at Fantasy of Flight. View of buildings from RAF Calshot on Calshot Spit, Hampshire The site is now used as a base for the RNLI and for HM Coastguard, as well as for the Calshot Activities Centre, which runs courses in a number of water and land- based activities, and uses the original hangars to house indoor climbing walls, artificial ski slopes and a cycle track.

He died on March 10, 2005. The cause of death was not released but he had battled mental illness, alcoholism, and physical problems for many years. He was 57 years old. Stubborn Child As a child, his alcoholic father frequently beat the Boston native. At seven years of age, Mark was deemed a \\"stubborn child,\\" and locked up. Under state law, a stubborn child was one who \\"stubbornly refused to submit to the lawful and reasonable commands of a parent or guardian.\\" Devlin spent most of his childhood in state institutions. He later told the press that growing up in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts juvenile justice system turned him into a criminal. Devlin testified to a state legislative committee about conditions in the reform school system as part of the process by which the schools were closed and the juvenile justice system reformed in Massachusetts. Detained juvenile Mark was a graduate of the Lyman School for Boys, the Roslindale juvenile detention center, and the Bridgewater, Massachusetts reformatory known as the Institute for Juvenile Guidance. According to his book, when Mark was seven years of age his mother brought him before an old man who wore black robes. Mark’s mother talked to the old man and then somebody brought him to a large building in Roslindale, Massachusetts, where somebody shoved him into a darkened room and locked the door. Mark started to cry for his mother. That was the start of Mark’s encounter with the Massachusetts juvenile corrections system. Once while an inmate of the Bridgewater reformatory Mark was able to look across a prison yard and see his father in the adult section. That was likely as close as they were until after the publication of his book, when he attempted to reconcile with members of his family. Criminal As a young adult, Mark fell in love with a former girlfriend of one of the few friends he met at the Bridgewater reformatory. They decided to move to a different state and start a new life together, but en route, Devlin was arrested for driving a stolen automobile across state lines. He spent a total of six years in a federal reformatory and then married his girlfriend while on parole. Their first child, a son, was placed up for adoption. Their second child, a daughter, was raised in several foster homes before being adopted by Mark's sister. The couple later divorced. Mark had a third child, a son, in a short relationship in later life. In a turbulent life, he accumulated a variety of legal charges, some likely valid, but was not a professional criminal; rather he lived precariously and most often as a saloon anecdotalist and singer. Road scholar Long before the movie, and as a play on the words \\"Rhodes Scholar,\\" this self-described \\"Road Scholar\\" decided to become a writer. While living on the streets, Mark's worldly possessions consisted of a bag filled with clothes, a dictionary, a thesaurus, pencils and a pad of paper. His first publishing success was a letter to the editor of The Real Paper. Mark Zanger, a columnist at the now- defunct, Cambridge, Massachusetts alternative weekly, turned the letter into an article. It was about staying at Boston's Charles Street Jail after it was condemned. Author and celebrity When Stubborn Child was published in 1985, it received national attention. Profiles appeared in the Boston Globe Magazine and in People. Mark kept in touch with his publisher using public telephones and gave interviews from park benches. The movie rights were sold to director William Friedkin for $10,000, but the film was never produced. Devlin was the first author to publish a book about the Lyman School for Boys from the perspective of an inmate. Later life For most of the next 30 years, Devlin was homeless, although he had periods of stability. In the 1990s, after a suicide attempt, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and responded well to medication and a sober lifestyle for parts of several years. He wrote an unpublished account of his breakdown, and made several starts on a work of fiction about his father's life and their relationship. He maintained longstanding friendships despite his lifestyle and increasing physical and legal problems.

She was the subject of several paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, who was a family friend, Joshua Reynolds and Richard Samuel. An adept poet and writer, she became involved with the Blue Stockings Society and participated in Whig politics. The second of twelve children, and the first daughter of the composer Thomas Linley and his wife Mary Johnson, Elizabeth was herself the wife of the leading playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She was one of the most noted soprano singers of her day, though her husband discouraged her from performing in public after their marriage. Her early life was spent in Bath, the town of her birth, and she probably first appeared on stage beside her brother, Thomas, in 1767 although she started singing in concerts when she was nine years old. The Maid of Bath, a comedy that dramatised and ridiculed her life story, played for 24 nights at the Haymarket Theatre in 1771. An engagement to a wealthy elderly suitor at the end of 1770 was called off just prior to the anticipated wedding; Elizabeth later eloped to France with Sheridan and a marriage ceremony may have taken place in March 1772 although no records of the matrimony exist. The couple returned to Britain in late April and a formal marriage took place in 1773. Sheridan defended Elizabeth's honour twice during 1772 in duels with a married man, \\"Captain\\" Thomas Mathews, who had amorously pursued her. The Sheridans' relationship was stormy, and both parties had affairs; Elizabeth also had several miscarriages and a stillborn baby before producing a son, Thomas, born in November 1775. One of Elizabeth's lovers was Lord Edward FitzGerald who was the father of her daughter born on 30 March 1792. Elizabeth had suffered ill-health for some time, which the traumatic labour exacerbated. She died of tuberculosis on 28 June 1792. Early life \\"The Linley Sisters\\", by Thomas Gainsborough (Dulwich Picture Gallery) – Elizabeth (left, standing, aged 17) with her sister Mary Elizabeth Ann Sheridan (née Linley) was born towards the end of 1754, but the exact date varies with sources giving 4, 5 or 7 September, at either Abbey Green or 5 Pierrepont Street, Bath. Her father was Thomas Linley, an English musician and composer, and her mother was Mary Johnson (1729–1820), who was also a talented musician. Elizabeth was the couple's eldest daughter (there was an older brother but he died in early childhood), and like several of her siblings she inherited her parents' musical abilities. Her general schooling was provided by her mother although one, possibly two, years were spent at a school in Bristol where she was taught the rudiments of French conversation, dancing, drawing, painting and deportment. It is likely that she began singing at concerts when she was only nine years old, and she made her formal stage début alongside her brother, also named Thomas, in 1767 at Covent Garden, London. The concert, or masque, featured music by Bach and was called The Fairy Favour. Elizabeth sang and her brother played the part of Puck. Their father was rigid in his enforcement of the children's schedules, making them perform weekly in concerts at Bath and at venues in Oxford and London. Mary Dewes, a concert attendee, expressed the view that he overworked them and required Elizabeth to perform songs which were too difficult for her age. Elizabeth was under indenture to her father as a music apprentice, which ensured that her performances increased his earnings. To manage her image, her father carefully selected the venues where she could perform, to ensure that she sang at only high-society festivals and avoided the pitfalls of performing on the London stage. Among the venues he selected as her manager were his concerts in Bath and the Three Choirs Festival, which included tours at Gloucester Cathedral, Hereford Cathedral, and Worcester Cathedral, as well as performances in Cambridge, Chester, London, Oxford, and Salisbury. The tours were lavish events accompanied by social gatherings held apart from the concert appearance, wherein Elizabeth and the other performers were expected to entertain for several hours prior to each performance. In selecting a repertoire to enhance Elizabeth's fame, her father eliminated popular songs, instead choosing regional ballads with \\"impeccable national pedigree\\" and classics, centred on Handel. Among her noted performances include the May 1768 performance as Galatea in Acis and Galatea, which then became a staple in her repertoire. Contemporary critics, such as Fanny Burney, Daniel Lyons and Gaspare Pacchierotti, noted that her voice with its clear, unaffected, sweet expression was particularly compatible with Handel's oratorial style. These same traits used to describe her voice were also attributed to her behaviour by the composer William Jackson, Charles Burney and others, adding to the public's admiration of Elizabeth, propelling her to be for a time the most celebrated singer in England, as well as the object of cult-like devotion by her admirers. Jackson, a composer from Exeter, Linley family friend, and author of Observations on the Present State of Music in London (1791) wrote music specifically for Elizabeth to perform. Although Handel's works formed the core of Elizabeth's repertoire, William Jackson and both her brother and father composed music particularly for her. Though much of her father's work from his Bath period has not survived, Jackson's Twelve Songs (1765–1770) and Twelve Canzonets (circa 1770) were crafted to suit Elizabeth's young voice. Elizabeth was advertised in local newspapers as the soloist of the concert featuring Joseph Wharton's Ode to Fancy and Jackson's Lycidas which was performed on 26 November 1767. The cantata In yonder grove for Elizabeth's March 1773 final public performance was written by her brother Thomas, for which she penned the lyric. The aria was written to feature her vocal flexibility and specifically amplify the dramatic flair of her range. Many songs which were included in her performances invoked songbirds, such as Handel's aria \\"Sweet Bird\\" in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, lark references of Semele, and her own verse in In yonder grove which speaks of the nightingale's song. Repeated linking of Elizabeth's voice and birds, was a device used to call attention to the specific qualities of her voice and raise the public appreciation of her natural abilities. George III saw her performing at Drury Lane; he was impressed and invited the family to entertain the Queen at Buckingham Palace in April 1773. The audience comprised the King, Queen and their family plus one female guest; the private concert lasted for five hours, for which the King paid Linley £100 (). Thomas Gainsborough's 1768 painting of Elizabeth with her brother Thomas; the original title prior to 1817 was A Beggar Boy and Girl. Elizabeth became properly acquainted with Richard Brinsley Sheridan in October 1770, not long after the Sheridan family arrived in Bath. The Sheridans were invited to the Linley home as Elizabeth's father was seeking to impress Thomas Sheridan with the grandeur of his house while Sheridan wished to elicit help gaining new students. A close friendship soon developed between the teenage members of the families. At the end of the year, she was betrothed to an elderly but wealthy suitor, Walter Long, but the engagement was broken off shortly before the date set for the wedding. Reports vary as to why the engagement was broken; Elizabeth's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Sheridan wrote that Linley had advised Long she would never be happy in their marriage, prompting him to withdraw his suit. Other reports indicate that the characterization of Long in the play The Maid of Bath written by Samuel Foote was the cause of the break. The play, which opened on 26 June 1771 was a new comedy, which premiered at the Haymarket Theatre, dramatising Linley's story. It played for 24 nights in London and was very popular but made Elizabeth a figure of ridicule. Yet other reports indicate that Long was put off by the attention of so many other men. Whatever the reason, the engagement was severed; Long paid her compensation of £3,000 in 1771 (), and she also received £1,000 worth of clothing and jewellery. The unwanted attention from men continued, and Elizabeth became fearful of the lewd intentions of those who tried to court her. Among the men who were infatuated with her was Charles Sheridan, Richard's older brother, and Nathaniel Brassey Halhed. She was particularly worried about the advances made by 'Captain' Thomas Mathews, a married man. The Linley family had made his acquaintance when he moved to Bath in 1770; a descendant of Thomas Mathews, he had resigned his military career when he married. He amorously pursued Elizabeth despite his marital status, sexually harassing her and threatening to rape her. Still feeling mocked by the Maid of Bath comedy, Elizabeth endured further ridicule when her father and William Herschel had a strong public disagreement over whether she would sing at a benefit organised by Herschel. The acerbic exchanges between the two men were in the form of newspaper articles published in January 1772; life for Elizabeth was becoming unbearable and she wanted to escape. Contemplating suicide, and unable to discuss her concerns with her parents, Elizabeth turned to her friend Alicia Sheridan for help. The pair came up with a plan but although Alicia thought the idea to flee to a convent in France was romantic, she expressed reservations and wanted to discuss it with Richard, unaware of his own deepening affection towards Elizabeth. In early March 1772 Elizabeth's agitation increased; she was short of breath, suffered headaches and continually argued with her father, refusing to willingly take part in performances. Sheridan went to visit her on a Sunday morning while the other Linleys were out and found her unconscious from drugs she had taken. Shortly after Elizabeth recovered from the overdose, the trio of friends conspired to put their plans into action; Elizabeth was to feign illness on the morning of 18 March so she would be left alone in the house as a concert was scheduled for that day. Flight to France Jerry Barrett's 1860 portrayal of Sheridan helping Elizabeth escape from her father's house. As arranged, Elizabeth refused to get out of bed on 18 March claiming she had a headache and was too ill to perform. Later, once all the members of the family had left the house, Alicia arrived and helped her gather her belongings, staying with her until Sheridan came to collect Elizabeth. Accompanied by a female servant acting as chaperone, the young couple left for France and a marriage ceremony may have taken place there that month, although no record of it exists. The exact details of the couple's route and events surrounding their escape vary, having been embellished and differing versions given. They first travelled to London, at which point they parted from the chaperone, arriving during the late afternoon the next day, where they approached some of Sheridan's friends for money to supplement the small amount they had in their possession; Alicia had given them a modest sum and Elizabeth had around £40 of savings. The couple were unsuccessful in acquiring extra funds, but an oil merchant, who was an acquaintance of Sheridan, helped them to get passage on a small ship destined for Dunkirk. After a rough crossing they boarded a coach to Calais where they stayed in an inn for at least one night using two rooms before taking another coach to Lille. The intention was to continue on to a convent in St Quentin but Elizabeth had been ill since the sea crossing and her condition deteriorated while they were in Lille. Treated by a local English doctor and nursed by his wife in their home, Elizabeth began to recover but he recognised the early symptoms of tuberculosis. Sheridan remained with her, writing letters to friends in England, while they had lengthy discussions about their childhoods, politics and ambitions. Elizabeth realised her feelings for him had deepened and, despite his lack of money and social connections, she wanted to devote her life to helping and supporting him. Meanwhile, back in Bath, Thomas Linley had been devastated when he discovered his daughter was missing, sending search parties out to look for her; he soon learned she had absconded with Sheridan. Despite his attempts to save her reputation by quelling the information, it quickly became the topic of gossip and rumour throughout Bath. Linley received a letter from Sheridan detailing Mathews' behaviour towards Elizabeth and her father may have delayed seeking her return until after Mathews had left Bath. As the circumstances of Mathews' part in the events became widely known, he lost any support he had; he placed an advertisement in the Bath Chronicle, published on 9 April 1772, decrying Sheridan, then left the town a few days later. Margaret Dicksee, Sheridan at the Linleys, 1899. The young couple stayed in France for around a month, returning on or around 29 April 1772, after her father had learned where they were and visited them. Keen to get Elizabeth back home because he had her scheduled to undertake several concert engagements and, finally aware of the harassment she had endured from Mathews, Linley conceded to a number of her demands. She insisted her workload be reduced, that she be given the option to only perform when she chose to and that she had the freedom to go back to France once she fulfilled the work he had already contracted for her. To break the journey back to Bath, the trio stayed overnight in London; Sheridan surreptitiously left to find and confront Mathews who he discovered was in London. When he found him in his lodgings, Mathews lied to Sheridan about the contents of the advertisement he had placed in the Bath Chronicle, convincing him it had not been defamatory. As soon as the Linleys and Sheridan arrived back in Bath, Sheridan went to the newspaper office to check exactly what had been contained in the advertisement; after learning the true content, arrangements were made with his brother to return to London and again challenge Mathews. A brief duel to defend Elizabeth's honour took place on the evening of 4 May 1772 between Sheridan and Mathews in London where they agreed to fight in Hyde Park, but finding it too crowded they went first to the Hercules Pillars tavern and then on to the Castle Tavern in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Mathews lost his sword and begged for his life before signing a formal retraction of the advertisement he had placed. The apology was made public and Mathews, infuriated by the publicity the duel had received, and goaded into action by his friend William Barnett, refused to accept his defeat as final and challenged Sheridan to another duel. Sheridan was not obliged to accept this challenge, but would have become a social pariah if he had not. The second duel, fought in July 1772 at Kingsdown near Bath, was a much more ferocious affair. This time both men broke their swords but carried on fighting in a \\"desperate struggle for life and honour\\". Both were wounded, Sheridan dangerously. Elizabeth was performing in Oxford and Cambridge so was unaware of the events until later. Although Sheridan's injuries were severe, eight days after the duel the Bath Chronicle was able to announce that he was out of danger. The duels were the impetus for Thomas Linley and Thomas Sheridan deciding that the young couple must be kept apart; Elizabeth was kept in Bath, overworked but otherwise confined to the house, and on 28 August Richard was sent to Waltham Abbey in Essex with the intention he would go on to study law at Middle Temple. Once separated and forbidden by their fathers from contacting each other, their ardour began to wane. Linley encouraged other wealthy suitors to court Elizabeth; Sir Thomas Clarges proposed to her but she refused him around early December 1772. Thomas Norris also asked her to marry him but she rejected him. Sheridan did not remain chaste and had affairs but when he discovered Elizabeth was due to perform at Drury Lane, just a few miles from where he was, in February 1773, the romance was revived. Details of the exact events and circumstances that transpired at the beginning of April 1773 are sketchy but Sheridan, who had turned twenty-one on 30 October 1772 so legally no longer a minor, convinced Elizabeth's father to allow them to wed. Sheridan's father was in Ireland and was not informed or invited. Marriage Elizabeth and Sheridan with their son, Tom, painted by Benjamin West 1776 although Kalinsky considers it would be around 1778 as Tom seems to be approximately three-years-old; she also feels it is a poor depiction of Elizabeth but qualifies this by stating West typically was not successful at reproducing women's portraits. Sheridan and Elizabeth were officially married at St Marylebone Parish Church on 13 April 1773, the period when Elizabeth was described by Frances Burney as \\"infinitely superior to all other English singers.\\" According to later newspaper reports their courtship was \\"one of the classic romances of the west country\\" and she was \\"the most beautiful singer in England\\". Sheridan came from a family that was almost destitute; like his father, Thomas, he was poverty-stricken yet after they were officially married Sheridan would not allow her to appear on stage in a professional capacity as he felt it reflected badly on his status as a gentleman. Elizabeth was concerned about their precarious financial status as their income was negligible, imploring her husband to allow her to continue singing as it was their only means of securing funds. Part of Elizabeth's £1,000 dowry, which her father had taken out of the compensation received from Long, was used to purchase a house in London; a further £1,050 of the Long money was held in trust providing Elizabeth with just £31 and ten shillings a year in interest during her lifetime. Eventually Sheridan reluctantly permitted Elizabeth to perform at the Three Choirs Festival held in Worcester during September 1773. The contract to perform, negotiated by Elizabeth's father, was lucrative but Sheridan insisted that she donate the one hundred guinea fee to charity, a gesture in accordance with his yearning to be considered a member of the gentility. Throughout their marriage, Sheridan borrowed heavily to sustain their extravagant lifestyle. Summer months were spent as invited guests in the stately homes of people such Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire and her husband, William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House or at the Putney home of the merchant banker Stratford Canning; time was also spent at Croome, the home of Lord Coventry. In return for transport, accommodation, food and wine, Elizabeth would sing each evening for the small select group of other dinner guests, relieving the couple of living expenses for a part of the year. During the months that they were at home, Elizabeth's husband organised private twice-weekly soirées there for aristocrats to hear her sing, sometimes accompanied by her sister, Mary; although he had declared she would never perform again in public, he charged attendees. The invitations to enjoy the hospitality at the homes of the nobility were extended to Elizabeth as they were keen to hear her sing but they considered her husband a nonentity. Elizabeth derived great pleasure from the visits, soon striking close lasting friendships with several of the hostesses; she was especially pleased that Sheridan, despite his reputation, began to be accepted and his wit drew admiring comments at the dinner table. Historian Joseph Roach describes them as the \\"pre-eminent glamour couple of the 1770s and 1780s\\". Elizabeth and the Duchess of Devonshire became good friends despite the differences in their social status. Devonshire House, Georgiana's London home, was the hub for social entertaining and Whig party politics, providing the Sheridans with an introduction to Charles James Fox and other influential politicians like Edmund Burke. By early 1780 Sheridan's career aspirations turned towards politics and Elizabeth gave him her full support. When Fox was fighting to win his Westminster seat in 1784 Elizabeth was very active with Georgiana and her sister campaigning in the streets for him. The event was surrounded by scandal: Thomas Rowlandson produced a caricature of Georgiana kissing meat sellers to secure their votes; gossip and negative publicity was rife yet Elizabeth's reputation was not tarnished. She was not included in the pamphlets and the opposition supporters who quipped so cruelly about aristocratic ladies only alluded to Elizabeth's sweetness being irresistible. As her husband's political career became more successful, Elizabeth's involvement with the Whigs deepened; Sheridan was a favourite of the Prince of Wales, who frequently dined with them. The preparation and editing of Sheridan's speeches was carried out by Elizabeth and during the period of the regency crisis in 1788, it was Elizabeth who undertook much of the work in drafting and revising the reply presented to William Pitt by the Prince. The Sheridans had a tempestuous marriage as they were an ill-matched couple; Sheridan preferred city life in contrast to Elizabeth's love of the countryside. After several miscarriages and a stillborn baby on 6 May 1777, the couple had a son, Thomas (Tom), who was born in mid-November 1775. Sheridan had several affairs, as did Elizabeth, and they spent a great deal of time apart. By the time she was 36, in 1790, Elizabeth was showing signs of ill-health but had to maintain the appearance of an involvement with London society. While visiting Devonshire House Elizabeth met Lord Edward FitzGerald and they became lovers. She conceived a child by him, a baby girl who was born on 30 March 1792. The trauma of childbirth exacerbated Elizabeth's illness and she died of tuberculosis on 28 June 1792. Elizabeth was buried at Wells Cathedral on 7 July 1792. Poetry and writing Apart from her singing skills, Elizabeth possessed several other artistic talents including sketching, mimicry and the ability to play musical instruments. She was also an adept writer and poet, particularly using verse as an aid and means of communication in times of mourning. When her younger brother Tom died after falling from a boat into a lake at Grimsthorpe on 5 August 1778 Elizabeth penned a widely circulated verse to his lyre that received a published response from a local poet. Her elegy, entitled On her Brother's Violin, was later reproduced in the 1785 edition of The Annual Register. She also wrote an ode concerning the death from tuberculosis of her sister Mary on 27 July 1787. Letters between Elizabeth and Sheridan took the form of verse both before and during their marriage. David Garrick also corresponded with her, affectionately referring to her as The Saint; historian Giles Waterfield quotes Garrick as asking: \\"What is my thought like? Why is Mrs Sheridan like a cat?\\" Shortly after their marriage, Sheridan abandoned his anticipated career in law, attempting instead to gain income from freelance journalism. Already aware of Elizabeth's literary prowess, he cajoled her into helping write press items, claiming her writing skills were superior to her singing. Her abilities were also called upon after Sheridan bought shares in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; she undertook the administration, book-keeping and secretarial work associated with the running of a theatre. She advised her husband which singers should be used at music events then, when he was unable to cope with the volume of manuscripts received, Elizabeth took on the role of reading all the submitted scripts before making her recommendations of the actions Sheridan should make. Elizabeth chose the music to be played at the King's Theatre after her husband became involved in that enterprise. Letters written by Sheridan indicate Elizabeth participated in the development of the music for The Duenna and his biographers credit her with being involved in the writing of several of his plays. In his 1825 book, Memoirs, Thomas Moore – Waterfield describes this biography as \\"some of his most vital pages refer to Mrs Sheridan\\" – adds that according to Elizabeth's sister the epilogue to The Rivals was possibly penned by her. He also included that \\"an entertainment called the Haunted Village\\" was written by Elizabeth. Michael Kelly claimed in his book Reminiscences that the adaptation of Richard Coeur de Lion was her work. In a letter to her sister-in-law, Alicia, dated 9 December 1782, Elizabeth revealed that she had started work on a book that was progressing well although no further records or detail of it exist. Three decades after her death The Gentleman's Magazine published a letter in 1825 (volume 95) that it claimed was written by Elizabeth addressed to a close friend called \\"Miss Saunders\\". Released just after the publication of Thomas Moore's biography Memoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, it bore a resemblance to the tale of Clarissa written by Samuel Richardson and lengthily described incidents that supposedly took place in Elizabeth's life concerning Long, Mathews and Sheridan more than fifty years previously. According to the magazine, it had received the letter \\"By the kindness of a valued literary friend\\". Waterfield explains that despite lacking any of the character, flair and style shown in Elizabeth's authentic letters, several later commentators accepted it as genuine; he describes it as \\"pure invention, containing a number of striking errors of fact.\\" Caroline Norton, Elizabeth's granddaughter, discredited it in 1861 and Moore conceded it was not legitimate in the fifth edition of the Memoirs published in 1827. A series of fabricated correspondence appeared in the Bath Chronicle during 1773 purportedly between a \\"Lord Grosvenor\\" and Elizabeth; other newspapers also carried similar fake letters around that time. Portraiture Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia, Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1775, Waddesdon Manor By the time Elizabeth was a teenager, she had developed a reputation not only for her singing ability, but for her beauty. Thomas Gainsborough had been a friend of the family since 1759 and he painted several portraits of the Linley family. His artwork The Linley Sisters was painted and shows Elizabeth and her sister Mary Linley shortly before the elopement. The only known portrait of the two sisters together, in 1772 it was exhibited at the Royal Academy as A Portrait of Two Ladies. Gainsborough developed an affinity with Elizabeth, intuitively sensing her subconscious thoughts. His later portrait of her, entitled Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, was undertaken after her marriage and has the 31-year-old Elizabeth posed on a rock set on a hillside reflecting the rural lifestyle she begged her husband to let her lead. Masque of Beauty, a 1972 National Portrait Gallery exhibition, included Gainsborough's 1772 portrait and paintings of Elizabeth were also exhibited as part of the gallery's 2008 exhibition entitled Brilliant women: 18th century bluestockings; William Etty's 1846 painting of her granddaughter Caroline Norton also featured in the two exhibitions, the only two women to be included in both. Elizabeth was also the model for the Joshua Reynolds painting St Cecilia, which was successfully exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1775 (now Waddesdon Manor), and described by Reynolds as \\"the best picture I ever painted.\\" Reynolds had also become a friend of the Sheridans despite earlier friction after he invited the couple to a large dinner party he was hosting. He anticipated Elizabeth would sing for his guests and purchased a new piano to be used; he was appalled when they refused on the basis she would never \\"sing again in public company.\\" She was the sitter for the Virgin Mary in his painting of the nativity scene that was burnt in the fire at Belvoir Castle in 1816. Richard Samuel included a portrait of Elizabeth in his group painting Portraits in the Characters of the Muses in the Temple of Apollo (1778), which depicted the founders and some participants in the Blue Stockings Society. First exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1789, it is now in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Linley (right, with lyre), in the company of other \\"Bluestockings\\" (1778, detail) The popular title of the piece, The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain, referenced the artists and literary figures depicted: the poet Anna Laetitia Barbauld; scholar Elizabeth Carter; playwright Elizabeth Griffith; historian Catharine Macaulay; the three writers Elizabeth Montagu – who was known as the \\"Queen of the blue stockings\\" and played a significant role in the society – Hannah More and Charlotte Lennox; and Elizabeth, posing as classical muses. He styled Elizabeth in the role of Terpsichore or Erato; she is placed in a solitary but focal point towards the centre of the painting and, according to Roach, the composition is indicative of her \\"special place in the company of the bluestocking circle\\", although the other women declared themselves as bluestockings, Elizabeth was not identified as a member. In 1860 Jerry Barrett exhibited a pair of paintings at the Royal Academy that portrayed Elizabeth and Sheridan in two moments of their romance. One of the paintings, entitled The Elopement, captures the night of their abscondment; the scene is set at the Linley house with Elizabeth being helped from her chair by Sheridan. The other is named Sheridan, disguised as a hackney coach driver, sees Miss Linley home from Covent Garden Theatre; it was used as an illustration in The Sphere on 20 November 1940 alongside an article with the title \\"The Romance of Sheridan and Miss Linley\\". The two artworks are held at Brighton Museum & Art Gallery, but there may have been more in the series. Legacy After her death, Sheridan fulfilled his promise to look after Elizabeth and FitzGerald's baby daughter, Mary. A nurse was employed to care for the child at his Wanstead home. The baby had a series of fits on an evening in October 1793 when she was 18 months old, dying before a doctor could attend. She was interred beside her mother at Wells Cathedral. Elizabeth's son, Thomas, had unsuccessfully tried for a political career and briefly served in the army before running off to marry Caroline Henrietta Callander of Craigforth (1779–1851), a daughter of Sir James Campbell. His father gave him a 25 per cent share of the Drury Lane Theatre in 1806, and he went on to become manager there, a role he also undertook at the Lyceum Theatre, London. Like so many of his relatives, Tom was also afflicted with tuberculosis and he moved abroad to ease the symptoms; he was appointed as the Colonial Governor's treasurer at the Cape of Good Hope in 1813. He appears to have died on 12 September 1817. In an article on Mrs Sheridan included in Rees's Cyclopædia, the music historian Charles Burney noted that: \\"There was a brilliancy, a spirit, and a mellifluous sweetness in the tone of her voice, which instantly penetrated the hearts of her hearers, as much as her angelic looks delighted their eyes. Her shake was perfect, her intonation truth itself, and the agility of her throat equal to any difficulty and rapidity that was pleasing.\\" According to musicologist and music critic Stanley Sadie, Elizabeth had \\"one of the sweetest and most expressive soprano voices of her time.\\" On 4 February 1956 a plaque fixed to the outside of the former home of the Linley family at 11 Royal Crescent, Bath, was unveiled. The bronze panel was commissioned by the town Corporation with the ceremony conducted by Lady Jebb. It commemorates the elopement of Elizabeth and Sheridan; the inscription reads: \\"Thomas Linley lived here and from this house his daughter Elizabeth eloped with Richard Brinsley Sheridan on the evening of 18th March, 1772.\\" References = Notes = =Citations= =Bibliography=         Category:1754 births Category:1792 deaths Elizabeth Category:English sopranos Category:18th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:18th-century English singers Category:Tuberculosis deaths in England ","title":"Elizabeth Ann Linley"},{"id":"10725954","text":"Still Pending were an American punk children band, formed in Portland, Oregon, United States, in 2005.

Damage may include bleeding, broken bones, organ damage, infection of the wound, or loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. Long-term complications can include lead poisoning and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Factors that determine rates of firearm violence vary by country. These factors may include the illegal drug trade, access to firearms, substance misuse including alcohol, mental health problems, firearm laws, and social and economic differences. Where guns are more common, altercations more often end in death. Before management begins it should be verified the area is safe. This is followed by stopping major bleeding, then assessing and supporting the airway, breathing, and circulation. Firearm laws, particularly background checks and permit to purchase, decrease the risk of death from firearms, Safer firearm storage may decrease the risk of firearm-related deaths in children. In 2015 about a million gunshot wounds occurred from interpersonal violence. In 2016, firearms resulted in 251,000 deaths globally, up from 209,000 in 1990. Of these deaths 161,000 (64%) were the result of assault, 67,500 (27%) were the result of suicide, and 23,000 (9%) were accidents. In the United States, guns resulted in about 40,000 deaths in 2017. Firearm-related deaths are most common in males between the ages of 20 to 24 years. Economic costs due to gunshot wounds have been estimated at US $140 billion a year in the United States. Signs and symptoms Trauma from a gunshot wound varies widely based on the bullet, velocity, mass, entry point, trajectory, and affected anatomy. Gunshot wounds can be particularly devastating compared to other penetrating injuries because the trajectory and fragmentation of bullets can be unpredictable after entry. Moreover, gunshot wounds typically involve a large degree of nearby tissue disruption and destruction caused by the physical effects of the projectile correlated with the bullet velocity classification. The immediate damaging effect of a gunshot wound is typically severe bleeding with the potential for hypovolemic shock, a condition characterized by inadequate delivery of oxygen to vital organs. In the case of traumatic hypovolemic shock, this failure of adequate oxygen delivery is due to blood loss, as blood is the means of delivering oxygen to the body's constituent parts. Devastating effects can result when a bullet strikes a vital organ such as the heart, lungs or liver, or damages a component of the central nervous system such as the spinal cord or brain. Common causes of death following gunshot injury include bleeding, low oxygen caused by pneumothorax, catastrophic injury to the heart and major blood vessels, and damage to the brain or central nervous system. Non-fatal gunshot wounds frequently have mild to severe long-lasting effects, typically some form of major disfigurement such as amputation because of a severe bone fracture and may cause permanent disability. A sudden blood gush may take effect immediately from a gunshot wound if a bullet directly damages larger blood vessels, especially arteries. Pathophysiology The degree of tissue disruption caused by a projectile is related to the cavitation the projectile creates as it passes through tissue. A bullet with sufficient energy will have a cavitation effect in addition to the penetrating track injury. As the bullet passes through the tissue, initially crushing then lacerating, the space left forms a cavity; this is called the permanent cavity. Higher-velocity bullets create a pressure wave that forces the tissues away, creating not only a permanent cavity the size of the caliber of the bullet but a temporary cavity or secondary cavity, which is often many times larger than the bullet itself. The temporary cavity is the radial stretching of tissue around the bullet's wound track, which momentarily leaves an empty space caused by high pressures surrounding the projectile that accelerate material away from its path. The extent of cavitation, in turn, is related to the following characteristics of the projectile: *Kinetic energy: KE = 1/2mv2 (where m is mass and v is velocity). This helps to explain why wounds produced by projectiles of higher mass and/or higher velocity produce greater tissue disruption than projectiles of lower mass and velocity. The velocity of the bullet is a more important determinant of tissue injury. Although both mass and velocity contribute to the overall energy of the projectile, the energy is proportional to the mass while proportional to the square of its velocity. As a result, for constant velocity, if the mass is doubled, the energy is doubled; however, if the velocity of the bullet is doubled, the energy increases four times. The initial velocity of a bullet is largely dependent on the firearm. The US military commonly uses 5.56-mm bullets, which have a relatively low mass as compared with other bullets; however, the speed of these bullets is relatively fast. As a result, they produce a larger amount of kinetic energy, which is transmitted to the tissues of the target. The size of the temporary cavity is approximately proportional to the kinetic energy of the bullet and depends on the resistance of the tissue to stress. Muzzle energy, which is based on muzzle velocity, is often used for ease of comparison. *Yaw Handgun bullets will generally travel in a relatively straight line or make one turn if a bone is hit. Upon travel through deeper tissue, high-energy rounds may become unstable as they decelerate, and may tumble (pitch and yaw) as the energy of the projectile is absorbed, causing stretching and tearing of the surrounding tissue. *Fragmentation Most commonly, bullets do not fragment, and secondary damage from fragments of shattered bone is a more common complication than bullet fragments. Diagnosis =Classification= Gunshot wounds are classified according to the speed of the projectile using the Gustilo open fracture classification: *Low-velocity: Less than 1,100 ft/s (340 meters/second (m/s)) Low velocity wounds are typical of small caliber handguns and display wound patterns like Gustilo Anderson Type 1 or 2 wounds *These are more typical of shotgun blasts or higher caliber handguns like magnums. The risk of infection from these types of wounds can vary depending on the type and pattern of bullets fired as well as the distance from the firearm. *High- velocity: Between 2,000 ft/s (610 m/s) and 3,500 ft/s (1,100 m/s) Usually caused by powerful assault or hunting rifles and usually display wound pattern similar to Gustilo Anderson Type 3 wounds. The risk of infection is especially high due to the large area of injury and destroyed tissue. Bullets from handguns are sometimes less than but with modern pistol loads, they usually are slightly above , while bullets from most modern rifles exceed . One recently developed class of firearm projectiles is the hyper-velocity bullet, such cartridges are usually either wildcats made for achieving such high speed or purpose built factory ammunition with the same goal in mind. Examples of hyper velocity cartridges include the .220 Swift, .17 Remington and .17 Mach IV cartridges. The US military commonly uses 5.56mm bullets, which have a relatively low mass as compared with other bullets (40-62 grains); however, the speed of these bullets is relatively fast (Approximately , placing them in the high velocity category). As a result, they produce a larger amount of kinetic energy, which is transmitted to the tissues of the target. However, one must remember that high kinetic energy does not necessarily equate to high stopping power, as incapacitation usually results from remote wounding effects such as bleeding, rather than raw energy transfer. High energy does indeed result in more tissue disruption, which plays a role in incapacitation, but other factors such as wound size and shot placement play as big of, if not a bigger role in stopping power and thus, effectiveness. Muzzle velocity does not consider the effect of aerodynamic drag on the flight of the bullet for the sake of ease of comparison. Prevention Medical organizations in the United States recommend a criminal background check being held before a person buys a gun and that a person who has conviction/s for crimes of violence should not be permitted to buy a gun. Safe storage of firearms is recommended, as well as better mental health care and removal of guns from those at risk of suicide. In an effort to prevent mass shootings greater regulations on guns that can rapidly fire many bullets is recommended.  Management  Initial assessment for a gunshot wound is approached in the same way as other acute trauma using the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. These include: * A) Airway - Assess and protect airway and potentially the cervical spine * B) Breathing - Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation * C) Circulation - Assess for and control bleeding to maintain organ perfusion including focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) * D) Disability - Perform basic neurological exam including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) * E) Exposure - Expose entire body and search for any missed injuries, entry points, and exit points while maintaining body temperature Depending on the extent of injury, management can range from urgent surgical intervention to observation. As such, any history from the scene such as gun type, shots fired, shot direction and distance, blood loss on scene, and pre-hospital vitals signs can be very helpful in directing management. Unstable people with signs of bleeding that cannot be controlled during the initial evaluation require immediate surgical exploration in the operating room. Otherwise, management protocols are generally dictated by anatomic entry point and anticipated trajectory. = Neck = Penetrating neck injury protocol. A gunshot wound to the neck can be particularly dangerous because of the high number of vital anatomical structures contained within a small space. The neck contains the larynx, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, vasculature (carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries; jugular, brachiocephalic, and vertebral veins; thyroid vessels), and nervous system anatomy (spinal cord, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, sympathetic chain, brachial plexus). Gunshots to the neck can thus cause severe bleeding, airway compromise, and nervous system injury. Initial assessment of a gunshot wound to the neck involves non-probing inspection of whether the injury is a penetrating neck injury (PNI), classified by violation of the platysma muscle. If the platysma is intact, the wound is considered superficial and only requires local wound care. If the injury is a PNI, surgery should be consulted immediately while the case is being managed. Of note, wounds should not be explored on the field or in the emergency department given the risk of exacerbating the wound. Due to the advances in diagnostic imaging, management of PNI has been shifting from a \\"zone-based\\" approach, which uses anatomical site of injury to guide decisions, to a \\"no- zone\\" approach which uses a symptom-based algorithm. The no-zone approach uses a hard signs and imaging system to guide next steps. Hard signs include airway compromise, unresponsive shock, diminished pulses, uncontrolled bleeding, expanding hematoma, bruits/thrill, air bubbling from wound or extensive subcutaneous air, stridor/hoarseness, neurological deficits. If any hard signs are present, immediate surgical exploration and repair is pursued alongside airway and bleeding control. If there are no hard signs, the person receives a multi-detector CT angiography for better diagnosis. A directed angiography or endoscopy may be warranted in a high-risk trajectory for the gunshot. A positive finding on CT leads to operative exploration. If negative, the person may be observed with local wound care. = Chest = Important anatomy in the chest includes the chest wall, ribs, spine, spinal cord, intercostal neurovascular bundles, lungs, bronchi, heart, aorta, major vessels, esophagus, thoracic duct, and diaphragm. Gunshots to the chest can thus cause severe bleeding (hemothorax), respiratory compromise (pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, tracheobronchial injury), cardiac injury (pericardial tamponade), esophageal injury, and nervous system injury. Initial workup as outlined in the Workup section is particularly important with gunshot wounds to the chest because of the high risk for direct injury to the lungs, heart, and major vessels. Important notes for the initial workup specific for chest injuries are as follows. In people with pericardial tamponade or tension pneumothorax, the chest should be evacuated or decompressed if possible prior to attempting tracheal intubation because the positive pressure ventilation can cause hypotention or cardiovascular collapse. Those with signs of a tension pneumothorax (asymmetric breathing, unstable blood flow, respiratory distress) should immediately receive a chest tube (> French 36) or needle decompression if chest tube placement is delayed. FAST exam should include extended views into the chest to evaluate for hemopericardium, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and peritoneal fluid. Those with cardiac tamponade, uncontrolled bleeding, or a persistent air leak from a chest tube all require surgery. Cardiac tamponade can be identified on FAST exam. Blood loss warranting surgery is 1–1.5 L of immediate chest tube drainage or ongoing bleeding of 200-300 mL/hr. Persistent air leak is suggestive of tracheobronchial injury which will not heal without surgical intervention. Depending on the severity of the person's condition and if cardiac arrest is recent or imminent, the person may require surgical intervention in the emergency department, otherwise known as an emergency department thoracotomy (EDT). However, not all gunshot to the chest require surgery. Asymptomatic people with a normal chest X-ray can be observed with a repeat exam and imaging after 6 hours to ensure no delayed development of pneumothorax or hemothorax. If a person only has a pneumothorax or hemothorax, a chest tube is usually sufficient for management unless there is large volume bleeding or persistent air leak as noted above. Additional imaging after initial chest X-ray and ultrasound can be useful in guiding next steps for stable people. Common imaging modalities include chest CT, formal echocardiography, angiography, esophagoscopy, esophagography, and bronchoscopy depending on the signs and symptoms. = Abdomen = Abdominal gunshot wound Important anatomy in the abdomen includes the stomach, small bowel, colon, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, spine, diaphragm, descending aorta, and other abdominal vessels and nerves. Gunshots to the abdomen can thus cause severe bleeding, release of bowel contents, peritonitis, organ rupture, respiratory compromise, and neurological deficits. The most important initial evaluation of a gunshot wound to the abdomen is whether there is uncontrolled bleeding, inflammation of the peritoneum, or spillage of bowel contents. If any of these are present, the person should be transferred immediately to the operating room for laparotomy. If it is difficult to evaluate for those indications because the person is unresponsive or incomprehensible, it is up to the surgeon's discretion whether to pursue laparotomy, exploratory laparoscopy, or alternative investigative tools. Although all people with abdominal gunshot wounds were taken to the operating room in the past, practice has shifted in recent years with the advances in imaging to non-operative approaches in more stable people. If the person's vital signs are stable without indication for immediate surgery, imaging is done to determine the extent of injury. Ultrasound (FAST) and help identify intra-abdominal bleeding and X-rays can help determine bullet trajectory and fragmentation. However, the best and preferred mode of imaging is high- resolution multi-detector CT (MDCT) with IV, oral, and sometimes rectal contrast. Severity of injury found on imaging will determine whether the surgeon takes an operative or close observational approach. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) has become largely obsolete with the advances in MDCT, with use limited to centers without access to CT to guide requirement for urgent transfer for operation. = Extremities = Acute penetrating trauma from a close-range shotgun blast injury to knee. Birdshot pellets are visible in the wound, within the shattered patella. The powder wad from the shotgun shell has been extracted from the wound, and is visible at the upper right of the image. The four main components of extremities are bones, vessels, nerves, and soft tissues. Gunshot wounds can thus cause severe bleeding, fractures, nerve deficits, and soft tissue damage. The Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) is used to classify the severity of injury and evaluates for severity of skeletal and/or soft tissue injury, limb ischemia, shock, and age. Depending on the extent of injury, management can range from superficial wound care to limb amputation. Vital sign stability and vascular assessment are the most important determinants of management in extremity injuries. As with other traumatic cases, those with uncontrolled bleeding require immediate surgical intervention. If surgical intervention is not readily available and direct pressure is insufficient to control bleeding, tourniquets or direct clamping of visible vessels may be used temporarily to slow active bleeding. People with hard signs of vascular injury also require immediate surgical intervention. Hard signs include active bleeding, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, bruit/thrill, absent distal pulses and signs of extremity ischemia. For stable people without hard signs of vascular injury, an injured extremity index (IEI) should be calculated by comparing the blood pressure in the injured limb compared to an uninjured limb in order to further evaluate for potential vascular injury. If the IEI or clinical signs are suggestive of vascular injury, the person may undergo surgery or receive further imaging including CT angiography or conventional arteriography. In addition to vascular management, people must be evaluated for bone, soft tissue, and nerve injury. Plain films can be used for fractures alongside CTs for soft tissue assessment. Fractures must be debrided and stabilized, nerves repaired when possible, and soft tissue debrided and covered. This process can often require multiple procedures over time depending on the severity of injury. Epidemiology In 2015 about a million gunshot wounds occurred from interpersonal violence. Firearms, globally in 2016, resulted in 251,000 deaths up from 209,000 in 1990. Of these deaths 161,000 (64%) were the result of assault, 67,500 (27%) were the result of suicide, and 23,000 were accidents. Firearm related deaths are most common in males between the ages of 20 to 24 years. The countries with the greatest number of deaths from firearms are Brazil, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala which make up just over half the total. In the United States in 2015 about half of the 44,000 people who died by suicide did so with a gun. As of 2016, the countries with the highest rates of gun violence per capita were El Salvador, Venezuela, and Guatemala with 40.3, 34.8, and 26.8 violent gun deaths per 100,000 people respectively. The countries with the lowest rates of were Singapore, Japan, and South Korea with 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 violent gun deaths per 100,000 people respectively. =Canada= In 2016 about 893 people died due to gunshot wounds in Canada (2.1 per 100,000). About 80% were suicides, 12% were assaults, and 4% percent were an accident. =United States= In 2017 there were 39,773 deaths in the United States as a result gunshot wounds. Of these 60% were suicides, 37% were homicides, 1.4% were by law enforcement, 1.2% were accidents, and 0.9% were from an unknown cause. This is up from 37,200 deaths in 2016 due to a gunshot wound (10.6 per 100,000). With respect to those that pertain to interpersonal violence, it had the 31st highest rate in the world with 3.85 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016. The majority of all homicides and suicides are firearm-related, and the majority of firearm- related deaths are the result of murder and suicide. When sorted by GDP, however, the United States has a much higher violent gun death rate compared to other developed countries, with over 10 times the number of firearms assault deaths than the next four highest GDP countries combined. Gunshot violence is the third most costly cause of injury and the fourth most expensive form of hospitalization in the United States. History Until the 1880s, the standard practice for treating a gunshot wound called for physicians to insert their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe and locate the path of the bullet. Standard surgical theory such as opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds, germ theory, and Joseph Lister's technique for antiseptic surgery using diluted carbolic acid, had not yet been accepted as standard practice. For example, sixteen doctors attended to President James A. Garfield after he was shot in 1881, and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in Garfield's death. At almost the same time, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, on 13 July 1881, George E. Goodfellow performed the first laparotomy to treat an abdominal gunshot wound. Goodfellow pioneered the use of sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds, washing the person's wound and his hands with lye soap or whisky. He became America's leading authority on gunshot wounds and is credited as the United States' first civilian trauma surgeon. Mid-nineteenth-century handguns such as the Colt revolvers used during the American Civil War had muzzle velocities of just 230–260 m/s and their powder and ball predecessors had velocities of 167 m/s or less. Unlike today's high-velocity bullets, nineteenth-century balls produced almost little or no cavitation and, being slower moving, they were liable to lodge in unusual locations at odds with their trajectory. Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895 led to the use of radiographs to locate bullets in wounded soldiers. Survival rates for gunshot wounds improved among US military personnel during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, due in part to helicopter evacuation, along with improvements in resuscitation and battlefield medicine. Similar improvements were seen in US trauma practices during the Iraq War. Some military trauma care practices are disseminated by citizen soldiers who return to civilian practice. One such practice is to transfer major trauma cases to an operating theater as soon as possible, to stop internal bleeding. Within the United States, the survival rate for gunshot wounds has increased, leading to apparent declines in the gun death rate in states that have stable rates of gunshot hospitalizations. Research Research into gunshot wounds is hampered by lack of funding. Federal-funded research into firearm injury, epidemiology, violence, and prevention is minimal. Pressure from the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby, and some gun owners, expressing concerns regarding increased government controls on guns, is highly effective in preventing related research.

Dhaula Kuan () is a major intersection of roads in Delhi, India. The name also now refers to the neighbourhood surrounding the intersection. Intersection Dhaula Kuan fly-overs Five major thoroughfares in Delhi meet at Dhaula Kuan. Passing Through the intersection are the Ring Road and National Highway 8, which feed traffic around Delhi and from Central Delhi to Gurgaon, and points south and southwest, respectively. National Highway 8 is also the primary route of traffic from Delhi to Delhi Airport. A major infrastructure project during the 1990s and early 2000s led to the construction of a figure-eight interchange that eliminated stop lights and improved traffic flow. In addition to being a major road hub, Dhaula Kuan is also a primary stop on the Delhi Ring Railway and is the location of a Delhi Metro stop on the Connaught Place - Airport line. Currently, Dhaula Kuan serves as a primary exchange point for multimodal travellers, and its importance is expected to grow as the Delhi Metro and Terminal 3 at Delhi Airport is constructed. History The name Dhaula Kuan, means white well when translated to English from Hindi, (just as Dhaulagiri means white mountain), and refers to an ancient water well in the area that has white- colored sand. It has been speculated that the well was constructed by Shah Alam II, the nominal Mughal emperor of India in the 1761-1806 CE period, whose actual area of control spanned a small territory in the environs of Delhi. Shah Alam II is said to have been fond of excursions across his limited domain, from the Red Fort to the Palam area, leading to the sarcastic verse, Sultanat-e-Shah-e-Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam (The dominion of Emperor Shah Alam, begins from Delhi and ends at Palam). Dhaula Kuan (the well) is located along this route in the Jheel Park complex (near Metro Station), and its masonry has been dated to the Shah Alam period. Neighbourhood 'Dhaula Kuan' has now also come to refer to the neighbourhood that surrounds and serves the interchange. The latter includes both small scale industry and restaurants. Dhaula Kuan sits between Chanakyapuri and the Delhi Cantonment; the former is an affluent neighbourhood that is home to a number of embassies and the latter houses a number of military personnel and their families. Major institutions and points of interest in the neighbourhood include: *The South Campus of the University of Delhi, including the Sri Venkateswara College and the Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College. *The Air Force School. *The Army Public School. *The Air Force Auditorium. *The Army Golf Course. *Springdales School Delhi Metro Dhaula Kuan Metro Station is located on the Delhi Airport Express Line (Orange Line) of the Delhi Metro.

It is the largest hospital in the region with 672 beds catering to a population of about 550,000. It was formed when the Woden Valley Hospital and the Royal Canberra Hospital were amalgamated in 1991, and was renamed Canberra Hospital in 1996. It is the main teaching hospital for the Australian National University Medical School. It is also a teaching hospital for the University of Canberra's School of Nursing. Furthermore, the hospital has strong links with the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The hospital is also a major regional centre for Clinical Pastoral Education, offering courses through the Canberra and Region Centre for Spiritual Care and Clinical Pastoral Education in association with the Sydney College of Divinity and New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education. History In May 1914 the Canberra Community Hospital, the first hospital for Canberra, was opened in Balmain Crescent, Acton with eight beds. Tents were used to supplement the isolation ward. There were no obstetric facilities and obstetrics patients had to travel to the Queanbeyan hospital. In 1943 a new hospital was opened on the Acton Peninsula. Construction of the building was commenced in 1940. In 1942, the United States Army Medical Corps took over construction and commissioned it as an American military hospital. It was a military hospital for only five months. In February 1943, the hospital buildings were handed over to the Canberra Hospital Board for the development of what in time became the Royal Canberra Hospital on Acton Peninsula. Woden Valley Hospital buildings were constructed between 1969 and 1973. In 1973 the Woden Valley Hospital opened and the first patients were admitted. In 1979 the Canberra Community Hospital was renamed the Royal Canberra Hospital. Services were transferred to the Woden Valley Hospital when the Royal Canberra Hospital closed on 27 November 1991. In 1996 Woden Valley Hospital was renamed Canberra Hospital and its first IVF baby was born on 26 December 1996. On 13 July 1997 the superseded buildings on the Acton peninsula were demolished by implosion, killing a 12-year-old girl named Katie Bender who was hit by flying debris. In 2010, the second operating theatre in Australia capable of performing intraoperative MRI scanning during surgery was completed.

Located on Victoria Road in the Montpelier area, to the east of Montpelier Road, it is one of the largest churches in the city of Brighton and Hove. The church is a Grade I listed building. Origins and the local area The church serves the loosely defined Montpelier and Clifton Hill areas of Brighton, which lie west of the major Dyke Road and cover the steep slopes between the Seven Dials district and the seafront. St Stephen's Church had served parts of the district since 1851, when it had been moved to Montpelier Place from its previous location in Castle Square, close to the Royal Pavilion. However, it was not convenient for the area as a whole, with most of its parishioners being drawn instead from the streets to the south of the church. Development of the Montpelier and Clifton Hill areas started in the 1820s, and by the 1840s they had essentially taken the form they remain in today, with a range of high-quality houses, many in the form of Regency terraces and crescents such as Clifton Terrace. However, one area of open land remained: at the time (the 1850s) it was known as Temple Fields, and consisted of a field, a pond and a partly built house. This was chosen as the site for a new church to serve the area. On present-day maps, Temple Fields is the area bounded by Denmark Terrace, Clifton Hill, Powis Road and Victoria Road. The church faces three streets: St. Michael's Place, Powis Road and Victoria Road (on which the main entrance is located). History and construction =Original church= Windows in the west face of the original church (now the south aisle) The eastern and northern parts of the church, built in 1893 Plans for the church were drawn up in 1858, and construction took place between 1860 and 1861 to a design by George Frederick Bodley (whose father had been a doctor in Brighton and a resident of the Furze Hill area of Hove, close to the Montpelier and Clifton Hill districts). Bodley was also working on St Paul's Church in West Street, Brighton at the time, on an interior alterations project. The design of the exterior was reminiscent of the Italianate style, in red brick with horizontal bands of white stone and a steeply pitched slate roof. This featured a modest flèche spire containing a bell recovered from Sevastopol during the Crimean War (1854–1856). The church took two years to build at a cost of £6,728, and was consecrated by the Bishop of Chichester on 29 September 1862. There was room for a congregation of 700; pew rent was charged on 300 of these seats at first. Rev. Charles Beanlands, who had been a curate at St Paul's Church since his ordination in 1849, was given the perpetual curacy of St Michael's Church, and he remained in this position until his death in 1898. =Extension= The building quickly became too small and, in 1865, William Burges designed a new church which would incorporate Bodley's building as its two south aisles. The rebuilding was not carried out until 1893, under the direction of Burges's pupil, J.S.Chapple, and took two years. Burges was a contemporary of Bodley; both men were born in 1827. It is not known why a different architect was chosen for the redesign, and the changes reportedly caused Bodley some upset. Burges did not live to see his designs realised: he died in 1881. The exterior decoration of the new building broadly matched that of the original church, consisting of bands of white stone contrasting with dark red brick, but there is a considerable difference in height. The original building's north aisle was demolished, and its remaining structure became the south aisle of the new church. In terms of the church's present arrangement, therefore, the main body and the adjacent north aisle date from 1893, while the south aisle is original. The designs, as originally submitted, showed that a cloister and a campanile were planned to be built as well. Inside, additional decoration was to have been made in the chancel, and various additions were proposed for the sanctuary area. A predella (altar platform) behind the altar, a set of sedilia within the sanctuary area and a baldacchino above the altar were all shown in the plans. However, none of these proposals were implemented, and no changes took place in this area until around 1900, when architect and interior designer W. H. Romaine-Walker (1854–1940) provided a marble wall with Cosmatesque-style decoration between the chancel and the nave, a screen for the chancel itself, a new marble altar (in his wife's memory) and extra marble ornamentation for the sanctuary. A rood screen and new reredos were also installed at this time. A parish hall was built in 1970 on the site, to the north of the church, where the cloister was originally proposed. Architecture and fixtures The west windows Burges's enlargement substantially altered the character of the building, abandoning Bodley's polychrome brickwork interior for proper stone dressings, but he retained the polychrome style for the somewhat brutal exterior. The interior featured a series of clerestory windows facing south, a stone arch in the chancel and a row of stone columns with foliated decoration (carved with leaf ornamentations). The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of people active in various areas of the arts who were influenced by the Quattrocento period of Italian art, were closely involved with the decoration of the interior. Bodley was informally associated with this recently formed group, in particular with Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, a long-term friend of his. William Morris himself, along with Philip Webb and Charles Faulkner, was responsible for the painting of the chancel roof. The large windows on the western face of the church were made and installed by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., the predecessor of Morris's firm Morris & Co. There are also many stained glass windows by Morris in the old building and Burne-Jones in the new. The east end of Burges' building features a large trio of stepped lancets with basic two- light tracery. As a whole, the architectural writers Nicholas Antram and Richard Morrice consider that; \\"no church in Sussex has better Victorian glass.\\" Internal fixtures include a grey marble font and a green serpentine and calcite (verde antique) pulpit, both designed and made by Bodley. The noted stained glass designer Charles Eamer Kempe was responsible for the restoration and installation of a 15th-century reredos of Flemish origin. This depicts three scenes from Christ's life in the form of a triptych. The church today The nave and sanctuary The area covered by St Michael's—a portion of the western end of St Nicholas' parish—was made a parish in its own right in the early 20th century. St Michael's had previously been a mere chapel of ease. Following the closure and deconsecration of St Stephens Church in Montpelier Place and another local church, All Saints Church in Compton Avenue, Seven Dials, their parishes were absorbed into that of St Michael's; it now covers an area bounded (approximately) by Brighton railway station, Montefiore Road, Upper North Street and the streets between the church and Dyke Road. Services have always been in the ritualist tradition, reflecting Anglo-Catholic and \\"High Church\\" views and doctrine. This caused some controversy in the church's early years, although to a lesser extent than was experienced at St. Bartholomew's and St. Paul's Churches. Services consist of a daily Mass at various times, and a Sunday morning Sung Mass at 10.30am. A priest is available for Confession after Saturday Masses. In the parish hall, there are Saturday breakfast meetings, a parent and toddler group, dance groups, choir practices and various other activities.

Sawyer first published in 1999. The novel is set in 2009. At CERN, the Large Hadron Collider accelerator is performing a run to search for the Higgs boson. The experiment has a unique side effect; the entire human race loses their consciousness for about two minutes. During that time, nearly everyone sees themselves roughly twenty-one years and six months in the future. Each individual experiences the future through the senses of his or her future self. This \\"flashforward\\" results in countless deaths and accidents involving vehicles, aircraft, and any other device needing human control at the time of the experiment. The novel inspired the 2009 television series FlashForward.  Plot summary  Lloyd Simcoe, a 45-year-old Canadian particle physicist, oversees a run of the Large Hadron Collider. He works with his fiancée Michiko Kamura, who has a daughter, Tamiko. The experiment unexpectedly brings about a vision of a plausible future in which the characters are twenty years older. The consequences include the death of Tamiko as an out-of-control vehicle plows into her school. No recording devices in the world function in the present during the event. Citing the absence of any human awareness during that time, this is interpreted as evidence of the observer effect in quantum theory. The deaths of several characters (the ones who see nothing) are forecast by the flashforward. This includes Lloyd's friend and fellow researcher Theo Procopides, who learns of a prediction that he will be killed. The story begins to take on the features of a murder mystery, as Theo attempts to prevent his own murder. As time goes by it becomes clear that the events of the future are not predestined. Some people, including Theo's brother Dimitrios, commit suicide after becoming depressed by visions of their own dismal futures. Other characters rush to make these futures a reality. Jake Horowitz from CERN sees himself participating in his first sexual relationship. At CERN, less than two months after the original flashforward, the scientists plan a repeat of the run, but this time warning the world of the exact time, so that preparations can be made. However, no flashforward occurs, and the LHC instead finds the Higgs boson - the intended result of the first experiment. Soon after, the flashforward is found to be the result of neutrino pulses coincident with events at the collider. With the quark star remnant of supernova 1987A randomly emitting neutrinos when it experiences a starquake, an early warning system is setup on a satellite to ascertain the time of the next possible flashforward. Unbeknownst to him, Lloyd is put on a list by a billionaire interested in immortality. The next flashforward is engineered for the same date experienced in the characters' visions. By this time, Theo has evaded his murderer, Lloyd has broken up with Michiko and Jake is happily married to a woman named Carly Tompkins as predicted by the flashforward. All the people in the world sit / lie down but most of them do not see anything. Lloyd becomes one of the few people to experience another flashforward and sees himself travelling through the galaxy billions of years in the future, using an artificial body supplied by immortality researchers. The philanthropist approaches Lloyd and offers to prolong his life but Lloyd does not wish to accept this without his current wife Doreen. When he changes the future by refusing, it is implied that the treatment will be offered to Theo. Meanwhile, Theo contacts Michiko, acting on romantic feelings he has had for twenty years. Philosophical and scientific issues discussed The novel discusses free will and determinacy, the Copenhagen interpretation, transactional interpretation and the Omega Point. The last is put in a Christian context, through the character of Cheung, the rich Christian capitalist who finances the immortality project. In a \\"NewsFlash\\" in the novel, Pope Benedict XVI – a reference which proved prescient since Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, six years after the novel was written, and was the serving pope in 2009 – reserves judgement on whether the Flashforward was a miracle or not.  TV adaptation  The FlashForward television series based loosely on the novel aired on ABC between September 24, 2009 and May 27, 2010. It differs from the novel by following non- scientists, including lead characters FBI Special Agent Mark Benford (Joseph Fiennes), Special Agent Demetri Noh (John Cho), and an FBI team investigating the Flashforward. The adaptation also changes the blackout time from under two minutes to two minutes and seventeen seconds, as well as the flashforward moving consciousness six months forward, not twenty-one years; time progresses normally during the event, and security cameras capture footage of people blacked out for the full-time period. A character named Lloyd Simcoe does appear. However, he only partly resembles the character in the novel. The story was also changed from taking place primarily in Geneva, Switzerland, (at and around the CERN facility), to the United States, primarily Los Angeles, California. Also, the flashforward event was portrayed as a terrorist attack, as opposed to the result of unforeseen circumstances.

It reflects the phenomenon that a covariate is not necessarily constant through the whole study.

The area of residency could then be introduced in the statistical model as a time-varying covariate. In survival analysis, this would be done by splitting each study subject into several observations, one for each area of residence. For example, if a person is born at time 0 in area A, moves to area B at time 5, and is diagnosed with cancer at time 8, two observations would be made.

He is played by actor Ron Rifkin. Character history =Background= Saul is Nora Walker's older brother, and works at Ojai Foods, the Walker family business. He has never been married. He was born on August 11, 1938. Personal life Saul once dated Holly Harper (portrayed by Patricia Wettig) until he identified himself as homosexual. Saul had a relationship in Season 5 with a man named Jonathan (portrayed by Richard Chamberlain), who Saul said he loved despite the fact he might have been the one who infected him with HIV. Saul and Jonathan began to date in Season 5. =Season 1= Saul and Nora are very close. He helped her when her husband died, and defended her from their mother's criticism at her birthday party. Saul had a brief relationship with Holly Harper, William Walker's former mistress, following William's death. Although this briefly caused friction between Saul and Nora, Saul's feelings toward Holly were in fact ambiguous; it was never fully clear whether his intentions were romantic, platonic or business-related. In the season finale, it was revealed that Saul once spent a romantic weekend in Key West with another man, an old friend named Milo who reappears at Kitty and Robert's engagement party after an absence of 20 years. He tells Saul that he has finally come out as gay. The exact nature of Saul's sexuality remained ambiguous, though the storyline was developed further in season two. =Season 2= Early in the season, Saul acknowledged to his sister Nora that many years ago he was in love with a man. Saul has often expressed regret for not starting a family of his own and that he is now too old to do so. Another important clue concerning Saul's sexual orientation turned up in the episode with Kitty and Robert's wedding. At the wedding reception, Holly and Saul have a conversation at the bar about their past intimate relationship. Holly remarks about how Saul keeps lamenting that he always wanted a family of his own, and how she wishes it had happened for him. Saul suggests that maybe their past relationship could have developed further, but Holly says that she could tell that Saul just wasn't that into her, and that while he may have gone through the motions, he obviously was never \\"feeling it\\". Holly proceeds to tell him, \\"I know men,\\" and that she knew he was not interested in her. She tells him that everyone should be able to be with who they love, carefully avoiding the use of either masculine or feminine pronouns. Saul finally comes out to his openly gay nephew, Kevin Walker, after getting arrested for drunk driving. He tells Kevin that he has missed his entire life and he wants to be happy as a gay man, like Kevin. =Season 4= Despite previously having been linked romantically with a man named Henry, Saul identifies as single through the season. During the season finale, Saul becomes irate at the fact Kevin and Scotty take HIV testing so lightly, and his annoyance is concern to the young couple. Having never been tested and nervous after discovering a former lover is positive, Saul secretly goes to a local hospital alone to learn that people can live with HIV/AIDS asyptomatically. He is tested and, after Nora pushes him the next morning, calls for his results. He assures her \\"I'm fine.\\" During the final scene, the Walkers are involved in an enormous car accident in which almost every member of the family is injured. When Kevin, bleeding from an open wound on his hand, runs to Saul, bleeding from an open wound on his head and covered with blood, Saul exclaims, \\"Don't touch me! You can't,\\" indicating that Saul, most likely, is HIV-positive. =Season 5= In season 5, Saul falls in love, but the man runs away when he learns that Saul is HIV positive. Saul then finds his previous lover, Jonathan, and confronts him about giving him HIV. He eventually forgives him and they start a relationship. Jonathan asks Saul to marry him in the series finale, and he accepts.

The film is based on Ruskin Bond's fictional novella, A Flight of Pigeons, set around the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The film's soundtrack was composed by Vanraj Bhatia, and cinematography by Govind Nihalani. Its cast included Shashi Kapoor, his wife Jennifer Kendal, Nafisa Ali, Tom Alter, Shabana Azmi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Naseeruddin Shah, Deepti Naval, Pearl Padamsee and Sushma Seth. The film also featured Shashi and Jennifer's children Karan Kapoor, Kunal Kapoor, and Sanjana Kapoor. Plot The story is set around the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Javed Khan (Shashi Kapoor) is a reckless feudal chieftain with a Muslim Pathan heritage, whose world revolves around breeding carrier pigeons. His younger brother-in-law, Sarfaraz Khan (Naseeruddin Shah) is politically awakened and actively plots the fight against the British. Freedom fighters attack the local British administrators while they are in Sunday Worship at Church, massacring them all. Miriam Labadoor (Jennifer Kendal) manages to escape with her daughter, Ruth (Nafisa Ali) and mother (Ismat Chugtai), who is a Muslim lady from the royal Nawab family of Rampur and was married to an Englishman. The three women seek refuge with the wealthy Hindu family of Lala Ramjimal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Lala is torn between his loyalty for India and his privileged position under the British, and also his silent love towards Miriam, who seems to also reciprocate it silently. However, matters are taken out of his hand by Javed Khan who barges into Lala's house and forcibly takes Ruth and her family to his own house. This leads to jealousy on part of his wife, Firdaus (Shabana Azmi) and anger on part of his brother, who ultimately gives in to the Pathan tradition of offering hospitality and sanctuary (Nanawatai) even to uninvited guests. Various situations ensue due to cultural misunderstandings in the domestic routine of the Muslim household with its new English guests. Javed falls in love with Ruth, and wants to marry her but is opposed bitterly by her mother. Noticing intense feelings of Javed for her daughter Ruth, Miriam Labadoor (mother) cleverly makes an agreement with Javed that she would only give her daughter's hand to Javed if British were defeated. At first instance, Javed is hesitant but accepts the offer when again Miriam asks him if he has misgivings in his war against the British. There are simmerings of a love affair under the watchful suspicious eyes of Firdaus. Meanwhile, the Rebellion runs into problems and the British are defeating the poorly organized Indian forces. In a stormy scene, Sarfaraz destroys Javed's pigeon coops and sets his pets free after he finds out that Indian forces have lost the Battle for Delhi. There is a delayed recognition by Javed of his subjugated identity, colonised by the British. Sarfaraz dies in a battle against the British. The Labadoors return to the protection of the re-deployed British contingent, smuggled by Firdaus, who only wants to save her marriage. Javed finds out that the Labadoors have sought sanctuary in the church and rushes there to meet Ruth one last time. Surprisingly, Ruth comes out and expresses her feelings for Javed against her mother's will.

Biography =Career= Known by his middle name, J. Paul Reddam was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and graduated from the University of Windsor with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He then obtained a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Toronto. In 1979, he moved to California to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Southern California and made his home in the state.College professor turned loan agent hits it big as owner of Kentucky Derby winner Reddam wrote his Ph.D. dissertation, entitled \\"Pragmatics and the Language of Belief,\\" in 1982, focusing on \\"pragmatic theories of belief ascription.\\" In 1995, he established a mortgage lending company, Ditech, and sold the business to General Motors in 1999. The New York Times reported that Governor of California Jerry Brown characterized Reddam's company's debt collection methods as loan sharking. He now owns CashCall, Inc., another firm specializing in small loans at very high interest rates. As of 2020, he is running a successor to Cash Call named Owning.com that specializes in high balance, low LTV loans in California. =Horse racing= As a young man, Reddam became interested in the harness races held at Windsor Raceway that eventually led to his involvement as an owner while working as a university professor in Los Angeles. He used to have Standardbred horses competing at Windsor Raceway (has since closed down) and at Cal Expo in Sacramento, California. In 1988 he acquired his first Thoroughbred and has expanded his involvement to a current forty-horse racing stable plus twenty broodmares for his own breeding operations through arrangements with breeding farms in California and Kentucky. Widely respected in the industry for his strong support of Thoroughbred racing, Reddam's first major success came in 2004 with a win by 75%-owned Wilko in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Wilko's race record at the NTRA and his next in 2006 with Red Rocks in the Breeders' Cup Turf.Red Rock's race record at the NTRA His Thoroughbred racing stable is led by head trainer Doug O'Neill, with several horses being conditioned by Craig Dollase. His greatest achievement came when his colt I'll Have Another, from 19th position, won the 2012 Kentucky Derby and the 2012 Preakness Stakes. The New York Times reported that the trainer used by Reddam was suspended for drug violation. His horse Nyquist won the Kentucky Derby in 2016. Nyquist and I'll Have Another were both trained by Doug O'Neill and won the 2012 and 2016 Kentucky Derby races with jockey Mario Gutierrez. =Controversies= Reddam resigned from Ditech in May 2000 after three of his top managers were indicted for extortion. Gregory Kenneth DeLong, Vincent Pozzuoli and Jay David Marx were arrested for allegedly soliciting kickbacks from a Pittsburgh company that provided services for Ditech. Reddam sued GMAC Mortgage Corp in 2000, alleging that the company failed to pay $200 million that it owed after acquiring Ditech. In 2013, Reddam was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for violating consumer protection laws in a case related to Cashcall and other companies he was involved in.

It is about 42 kilometers away from Manila. Having earned the title as the \\"Cradle of Democracy in the East, the most important religious building in the Philippines\\", and the site of the First Philippine Republic, the church is proverbial for its historical importance among Filipinos.  Etymology  The term \\"Barasoain\\" was derived from Barásoain in Navarre, Spain to which the missionaries found the place in Malolos in striking similarity. When the Filipino revolution broke out, the Spanish authorities coined the term \\"baras ng suwail,\\" which means \\"dungeon of the defiant\\" because the church was a meeting place for anti-Spanish and anti-colonial illustrados.  History  Malolos Congress in 1898 Barasoain was known before as \\"Bangkal\\" a part of Encomienda of Malolos integrated by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi with the town of Calumpit on April 5, 1572. When the Augustinian friars founded the Town of Malolos in 1580 as an independent town, Bangkal became one of the villages of Malolos under the jurisdiction of the town church. A hermitage made of nipa and bamboo was constructed near the river between Maluslos (Malolos poblacion) and Barasoain for the people of Bangkal. In that same year, Malolos Friar Curate and Vicario Foraneo Fray Agustin Carreno, OSA established the first chapel at the old Ermita of the old Cemetery of Malolos. Abandoned in 1680, it served as the temporary visita of Barasoain, located in front of the Casa Tribunal (Presidencia), which is now commonly called \\"Casa Real de Malolos.\\" A big fire in the 17th century destroyed the new church. Another church building was commissioned and constructed on a new site, its present location—corner of Paseo del Congreso and Antonio Bautista streets. Under the supervision of Rev. Fr. Francisco Royo, O.S.A., the new church was built, made of light materials. In 1884, during the celebration of the Flores de Mayo (Nuestra Señora del Carmen), Patroness of the Parish, the temporary church was burned. From 1630 to 1859, priests serving in Barasoain were from the nearby church, the mother church of the town which is Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepcion de Malolos. Since the formal establishment of Barasoain as an independent parish to Malolos Church in 1859, several priests were assigned by the Augustinian Order, and later by the Archdiocese of Manila and Diocese of Malolos. = The separation of Barasoain and the construction of the church = In 1859, Barasoain was separated from Malolos. As a new town and parish, the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel was deemed to be its patroness. Fr. Francisco Arriola, was appointed first parish priest on June 1, 1859, built the convent. A small ermita, constructed by Fr. Melchor Fernandez in 1816 while he was parish priest of Malolos (1816–1840), served as temporary parish church. One of the existing bells bears the year 1870. It was installed by Fr. Emterio Ruperez, and it was donated by the “principalia (sic) of Malolos.” The bell was also dedicated to the Our Lady of Mt. Carmel of Barasoain. Fr. Francisco Royo replaced the temporary chapel with a hewn stone church built between 1871 and 1878. This was soon destroyed by fire. The only remnant of this church is one of its bells, installed by Fr. Royo on February 30, 1873 and dedicated to St. Francis Xavier. Fr. Juan Giron who succeeded him, used the chapel of the cemetery until this one, too, was destroyed by the earthquakes of 1880. Fr. Giron then built temporary chapel of nipa and bamboo which was burned down in 1884, during the solemn celebrations of the feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. In 1885, Fr. Giron hired the services of contractor by the name of Miguel Magpayo and started the construction of a massive church made of masonry and bricks. The church was completed under Fr. Giron’s supervision. Jorde does not specify the year of its completion; he says only that, “at the time it was completed the pockets of Fr. Giron were drained.” In 1889, Fr. Martin Arconada started the construction of the tower and the restoration of the convent. Three bells were installed in 1897. One of them is dedicated to St. Martin, Bishop, and was donated by Fr. Martin Arconada. In 1894, Fr. Miguel de Vera undertook another restoration of the convent.Bell Tower of Barasoain Church Inside the church = Philippine Revolution and the Malolos Congress = As tensions were brewing between the Filipino revolutionaries and the Americans who have arrived in the country in the wake of the Spanish–American War, the Philippine Revolutionary Government under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo decided to move the capital north from Cavite to Malolos in Bulacan. Plans were made to write a new constitution for the soon to be proclaimed Philippine Republic; Barasoain Church was chosen to be the site of the First Philippine Congress, otherwise known as the Malolos Congress, which convened on September 15, 1898 to draft what would become the Malolos Constitution. On January 21, 1899, the Malolos Constitution was ratified. This paved way for the formal inauguration of the First Philippine Republic on January 23, 1899) with Emilio Aguinaldo taking oath as president. But the outbreak of the Philippine- American War on February 4 brought the republic into a crisis. The Malolos Congress held its last session on the last week of February as the Aguinaldo government left Malolos and transferred the capital to Nueva Ecija. On March 31, 1899, the American forces captured Malolos and Barasoain as they were placed under American control. = Reunited with Malolos and subsequent events = In 1903, the town of Barasoain was abolished as the former town was decreed to be reunited with Malolos. By Presidential Decree No. 260, Barasoain Church was proclaimed as a National Shrine by President Ferdinand Marcos on August 1, 1973. A museum was opened at the old convent of the church which is being managed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. In the wake of the 1998 Philippine Centennial celebrations, the church became the venue for the inauguration of Joseph Estrada on June 30, 1998. = Philippine Bill Issue= Before 2002, the image of the church has been depicted in certain monetary bills, namely the English series one peso bill and the Pilipino, Ang Bagong Lipunan, and both the 1985 and 1997 New Design series ten peso bill together with an image of Apolinario Mabini (Andres Bonifacio on the 1997 version) on the other side. However, it was replaced by a ten-peso coin without the representation of the church. In 2009, local priests and Laban ng Bulacan movement officials, led by their chairman John Paul Albert Limpo, initiated a signature campaign to appeal to the Philippine Bangko Sentral restoring at least the image of the church in any present Philippine bill. After three years of petition, in December 2010, upon the issuance of the \\"New Generation Currency\\" series for Philippine banknotes, the Barasoain Church was featured again, this time in the 200-peso denomination until 2017 when it was replaced with the scene of the opening of the Malolos Congress.

It is intended to control the family-wise error rate and offers a simple test uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni correction. It is named after Sture Holm, who codified the method, and Carlo Emilio Bonferroni. Motivation When considering several hypotheses, the problem of multiplicity arises: the more hypotheses are checked, the higher the probability of obtaining Type I errors (false positives). The Holm–Bonferroni method is one of many approaches for controlling the family-wise error rate (probability that one or more Type I errors will occur) by adjusting the rejection criteria for each of the individual hypotheses. Formulation The method is as follows: * Suppose you have m p-values, sorted into order lowest- to-highest P_1,\\\\ldots,P_m, and their corresponding hypotheses H_1,\\\\ldots,H_m. You want the familywise error rate to be no higher than a certain prespecified significance level \\\\alpha . * Is P_1 < \\\\alpha / m? If so, reject H_1 and continue to the next step, otherwise EXIT. * Is P_2 < \\\\alpha / (m-1)? If so, reject H_2 also, and continue to the next step, otherwise EXIT. * And so on: for each P value, test whether P_k < \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m+1-k}. If so, reject H_k and continue to examine the larger P values, otherwise EXIT. This method ensures that the family-wise error rate\\\\leq\\\\alpha. =Rationale= The simple Bonferroni correction rejects only null hypotheses with p-value less than \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m}, in order to ensure that the risk of rejecting one or more true null hypotheses (i.e., of committing one or more type I errors) is at most \\\\alpha. The cost of this protection against type I errors is an increased risk of failing to reject one or more false null hypotheses (i.e., of committing one or more type II errors). The Holm–Bonferroni method also controls the maximum family-wise error rate at \\\\alpha, but with a lower increase of type II error risk than the classical Bonferroni method. The Holm–Bonferroni method sorts the p-values from lowest to highest and compares them to nominal alpha levels of \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m} to \\\\alpha (respectively), namely the values \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m}, \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m-1}, \\\\ldots , \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}, \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1}. * The index k identifies the first p-value that is _not_ low enough to validate rejection. Therefore, the null hypotheses H_{(1)}, \\\\ldots , H_{(k-1)} are rejected, while the null hypotheses H_{(k)}, ... , H_{(m)} are accepted (not rejected). * If k = 1 then no p-values were low enough for rejection, therefore no null hypotheses are rejected (i.e., all null hypotheses are accepted). * If no such index k could be found then all p-values were low enough for rejection, therefore all null hypotheses are rejected (none are accepted). =Proof= Holm–Bonferroni controls the FWER as follows. Let H_{(1)}\\\\ldots H_{(m)} be a family of hypotheses, and P_{(1)}\\\\leq P_{(2)}\\\\leq\\\\cdots\\\\leq P_{(m)} be the sorted p-values. Let I_0 be the set of indices corresponding to the (unknown) true null hypotheses, having m_0 members. Let us assume that we wrongly reject a true hypothesis. We have to prove that the probability of this event is at most \\\\alpha. Let h be the first rejected true hypothesis (first in the ordering given by the Bonferroni–Holm test). Then H_{(1)}, \\\\ldots, H_{(h-1)}are all rejected false hypotheses and h-1 \\\\leq m -m_0. From there, we get \\\\frac{1}{m-h+1}\\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{m_0} (1). Since h is rejected we have P_{(h)} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m-h+1} by definition of the test. Using (1), the right hand side is at most \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m_0}. Thus, if we wrongly reject a true hypothesis, there has to be a true hypothesis with P-value at most \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m_0}. So let us define the random variable A=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ P_i \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m_0} \\\\text{ for } i\\\\in I_0\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Whatever the (unknown) set of true hypotheses I_0 is, we have \\\\Pr(A)\\\\leq \\\\alpha (by the Bonferroni inequalities). Therefore, the probability to reject a true hypothesis is at most \\\\alpha. =Alternative proof= The Holm–Bonferroni method can be viewed as closed testing procedure, with Bonferroni method applied locally on each of the intersections of null hypotheses. As such, it controls the family-wise error rate for all the k hypotheses at level α in the strong sense. Each intersection is tested using the simple Bonferroni test. It is a shortcut procedure since practically the number of comparisons to be made equal to m or less, while the number of all intersections of null hypotheses to be tested is of order 2^m. The closure principle states that a hypothesis H_i in a family of hypotheses H_1,\\\\ldots,H_m is rejected – while controlling the family-wise error rate of \\\\alpha – if and only if all the sub-families of the intersections with H_i are controlled at level of family-wise error rate of \\\\alpha. In Holm–Bonferroni procedure, we first test H_{(1)}. If it is not rejected then the intersection of all null hypotheses \\\\bigcap olimits_{i = 1}^m H_i is not rejected too, such that there exist at least one intersection hypothesis for each of elementary hypotheses H_1,\\\\ldots,H_m that is not rejected, thus we reject none of the elementary hypotheses. If H_{(1)} is rejected at level \\\\alpha/m then all the intersection sub-families that contain it are rejected too, thus H_{(1)} is rejected. This is because P_{(1)} is the smallest in each one of the intersection sub-families and the size of the sub-families is the most m, such that the Bonferroni threshold larger than \\\\alpha/m. The same rationale applies for H_{(2)}. However, since H_{(1)} already rejected, it sufficient to reject all the intersection sub-families of H_{(2)} without H_{(1)}. Once P_{(2)}\\\\leq\\\\alpha/(m-1) holds all the intersections that contains H_{(2)} are rejected. The same applies for each 1\\\\leq i \\\\leq m.  Example  Consider four null hypotheses H_1,\\\\ldots,H_4 with unadjusted p-values p_1=0.01, p_2=0.04, p_3=0.03 and p_4=0.005, to be tested at significance level \\\\alpha=0.05. Since the procedure is step-down, we first test H_4=H_{(1)}, which has the smallest p-value p_4=p_{(1)}=0.005. The p-value is compared to \\\\alpha/4=0.0125, the null hypothesis is rejected and we continue to the next one. Since p_1=p_{(2)}=0.01<0.0167=\\\\alpha/3 we reject H_1=H_{(2)} as well and continue. The next hypothesis H_3 is not rejected since p_3=p_{(3)}=0.03 > 0.025=\\\\alpha/2. We stop testing and conclude that H_1 and H_4 are rejected and H_2 and H_3 are not rejected while controlling the family-wise error rate at level \\\\alpha=0.05. Note that even though p_2=p_{(4)}=0.04 < 0.05=\\\\alpha applies, H_2 is not rejected. This is because the testing procedure stops once a failure to reject occurs. Extensions =Holm–Šidák method= When the hypothesis tests are not negatively dependent, it is possible to replace \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m},\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m-1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1} with: : 1-(1-\\\\alpha)^{1/m},1-(1-\\\\alpha)^{1/(m-1)},\\\\ldots,1-(1-\\\\alpha)^{1} resulting in a slightly more powerful test. =Weighted version= Let P_{(1)},\\\\ldots,P_{(m)} be the ordered unadjusted p-values. Let H_{(i)}, 0\\\\leq w_{(i)} correspond to P_{(i)}. Reject H_{(i)} as long as : P_{(j)}\\\\leq \\\\frac{w_{(j)}}{\\\\sum^m_{k=j} w_{(k)}} \\\\alpha,\\\\quad j=1,\\\\ldots,i =Adjusted p-values= The adjusted p-values for Holm–Bonferroni method are: : \\\\widetilde{p}_{(i)}=\\\\max_{j\\\\leq i}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (m-j+1)p_{(j)}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}_1, \\\\text{ where } \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}_1 \\\\equiv \\\\min(x,1). In the earlier example, the adjusted p-values are \\\\widetilde{p}_1 = 0.03, \\\\widetilde{p}_2 = 0.06, \\\\widetilde{p}_3 = 0.06 and \\\\widetilde{p}_4 = 0.02. Only hypotheses H_1 and H_4 are rejected at level \\\\alpha=0.05. The weighted adjusted p-values are: :\\\\widetilde{p}_{(i)}=\\\\max_{j\\\\leq i} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\sum^m_{k=j}{w_{(k)}}}{w_{(j)}} p_{(j)}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}_1, \\\\text{ where } \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}_1 \\\\equiv \\\\min(x,1). A hypothesis is rejected at level α if and only if its adjusted p-value is less than α. In the earlier example using equal weights, the adjusted p-values are 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.02. This is another way to see that using α = 0.05, only hypotheses one and four are rejected by this procedure. Alternatives and usage The Holm–Bonferroni method is \\"uniformly\\" more powerful than the classic Bonferroni correction, meaning that it is always at least as powerful. There are other methods for controlling the family-wise error rate that are more powerful than Holm–Bonferroni. For instance, in the Hochberg procedure, rejection of H_{(1)} \\\\ldots H_{(k)} is made after finding the maximal index k such that P_{(k)} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{m+1-k}. Thus, The Hochberg procedure is uniformly more powerful than the Holm procedure. However, the Hochberg procedure requires the hypotheses to be independent or under certain forms of positive dependence, whereas Holm–Bonferroni can be applied without such assumptions. A similar step-up procedure is the Hommel procedure, which is uniformly more powerful than the Hochberg procedure. Naming Carlo Emilio Bonferroni did not take part in inventing the method described here. Holm originally called the method the \\"sequentially rejective Bonferroni test\\", and it became known as Holm–Bonferroni only after some time. Holm's motives for naming his method after Bonferroni are explained in the original paper: \\"The use of the Boole inequality within multiple inference theory is usually called the Bonferroni technique, and for this reason we will call our test the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test.\\" References Category:Statistical hypothesis testing Category:Statistical tests Category:Multiple comparisons ","title":"Holm–Bonferroni method"},{"id":"10726552","text":"The 6th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment () is an airborne unit of the French Army.

He was one of the most precocious composers and performers that have been known in England, and became known as the \\"English Mozart\\". Grove Music Online Early life Linley's abilities were apparent from a young age. He played a concerto at a concert in Bristol on 29 July 1763, at the age of 7, and from 1763 to 1768 was apprenticed to Dr. William Boyce, the Master of the King's Musick. In 1767 he appeared with his sister Elizabeth Ann Linley in a London production of The Fairy Favour at Covent Garden Opera House, singing, dancing a hornpipe and playing the violin. Between 1768 and 1771, he journeyed to Italy to study violin and composition with Nardini in Florence. There he met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in April 1770, and Charles Burney in September of the same year. In reference to Linley, Burney later wrote, \\"The 'Tommasino', as he is called, and the little Mozart, are talked of all over Italy, as the most promising geniuses of this age.\\"Burney: An Eighteenth-century Musical Tour in France and Italy, p.184; ed. by P.A. Scholes; Oxford University Press, 1959 Thomas and Mozart - both aged 14 in 1770 - had met and become warm friends in Florence earlier in 1770. Work On his return to England he performed in the concerts directed by his father in Bath and at various oratorios at the Drury Lane, of which he was leader between 1773 and 1778. A significant number of Linley's compositions have been lost, including many in the Drury Lane Fire of 1809. Surviving works attest to his congenial mastery of melody, gift for counterpoint, and musical imagination. Linley composed violin sonatas and concertos as well as choral works, and provided most of the music for his brother-in-law Richard Brinsley Sheridan's opera The Duenna (1775). Among his surviving works are \\"Let God Arise\\" a large-scale cantata-anthem for the Three Choirs Festival (1773) an \\"Ode on the Spirits of Shakespeare\\", the Lyric Ode (1776), set to a text by his fellow-Bathonian French Laurence, an oratorio entitled The Song of Moses, an afterpiece comic opera (The Cady of Bagdad) and substantial incidental music for Sheridan's 1777 production of \\"The Tempest\\". Linley also assisted his father, and their works (cantatas, madrigals, glees, elegies and songs) were published together in two volumes. Death Linley was drowned in a boating accident at the age of 22, while staying at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire with his sister Mary. He is buried at Edenham Parish Church. Linley's early death was immediately recognised as a tragedy for English music. Mozart later commented on Linley in a conversation that was recorded by the musician Michael Kelly: \\"[Mozart] said that Linley was a true genius; and he felt that, had he lived, he would have been one of the greatest ornaments of the musical world\\".

Throughout her childhood, she was reared to be an artist. Her parents were progressive, and they pushed each of their children equally to achieve their potential. In her formative years of art education, her artistic inclinations drew her into the fashionable Arts and Crafts Movement. Maltwood matriculated at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London (1896–97). Here, she studied sculpture. She was fascinated by Buddhism, theosophy, Masonic rituals, Goddess Spirituality, and Egyptian culture. These topics of study were widely popular amongst the middle- and upper-class society in England during her lifetime. In addition, her extensive travel ventures made the objects of her spiritual curiosity accessible for her to learn and grasp auxiliary meanings, all of which inspired her sculpture. Her work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics. In 1925, Maltwood was commissioned to draw a map outlining the adventures of the Knights of King Arthur and the Holy Grail, a subject made popular in the Victorian era by the Pre-Raphaelites and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. While researching, she claimed that the effigies of the zodiac were designed in a circle on the fields of Somerset—the very fields that the tales of King Arthur had transpired upon (Maltwood; 1944, p. 3). She devoted the rest of her life to researching, writing, and publicizing what she termed “Temple of the Stars.” Her theory regarding the zodiac was a combination of Sumerian, theosophy, Masonry, Egyptosophy, Early Christianity, and Rosicrucianism. She moved to Victoria, Canada, in 1938 with her husband because of her disillusionment with the state of Europe. She was encouraged to join the local art community by her friend Ina Uhthoff, an established figure as an artist, an art teacher, and an administrator. Maltwood contributed two pieces to the 1941 annual exhibition of the Island Arts and Crafts Society. She entered two sculptures in the exhibition: The Fire God of Mount Rainier, an Indian profile; and Aspiration, a bronze figure. She encouraged her cousin Elizabeth Duer to exhibit. Maltwood also enjoyed sketching. Her depictions of nature were influenced by Emily Carr, from whom she purchased paintings. Maltwood continued to sketch and sculpt until she died in 1961. Thanks to Katharine and her husband John Maltwood’s generous bequest of their estate to the University of Victoria, the Maltwood Gallery and Special Collections own a large assortment of valuable objects and information about their lives. The Maltwood Gallery and Special Collections serve different functions: the gallery conserves the art objects the Maltwoods acquired while travelling the globe, furnishing their home, pursuing their interests, and supporting fellow artists and the artistic endeavours of Mrs. Maltwood herself. Special Collections preserve the Maltwoods’ personal letters, journals, and books, including Mrs. Maltwood’s own writing. Major works Maltwood’s first publicly recognized work was Magna Mater in 1911. It was designed as a triptych. The central individual is crouched with his arms bound together. His position resonates with despair and struggle. The man’s strong legs and arms connote that he is a labourer. On either side of the labourer, mounds of people are bound together along a rope. The quote is taken from Sirach 40 or the Ecclesiasticus, which states, “Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.” Primeval Canada Awakening to Her Destiny was originally shown by the Arts and Crafts Society in the Grosvenor Gallery in 1912 and again at the London Salon in 1913. According to the Lady’s Pictorial of July 11, 1914, the monument was intended for erection in Canada, although we have no other source to prove this statement. The title of the work confirms that Maltwood had connections within Canada early on in her career. The Maltwoods had many friends who had moved from England to Canada, and they chose to visit Victoria in particular on several occasions. In fact, they even asked Samuel McLure to design a home for them on one visit. The dynamic head is the only remaining portion of this sculpture. A photo is the only proof we have that this sculpture was once attached to a body. The grand woman in this photo has her head upturned to the sky, possibly delivering a message to God. She is clothed in forest leaves, and at her sides are figures of moose and buffalo. Between the feet of the woman stands a bearded figure, a pioneer with an axe. His arms are outstretched as if in worship of Canada rising before and above him. Maltwood saw Canada as unspoiled and bountiful, in contrast to the materially driven and spiritually decayed Britain. Maltwood felt a deep connection to the nature of British Columbia; it evoked truth, power, and mysterious strength, all of which were virtues that she aspired to represent in her art. Font for the New Church of the Good Sheperd was made in Tadsworth, Surrey, in 1923. Circling the bowl is an inscription from Keble’s Lyra Innocentium. The three reliefs at the top surrounding the basin are the “open hand,” the “Agnus Dei,” and the holy dove descending; they symbolize the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost (Brown, p. 23). Mills of God (1919) is a sculpture of a giant wheel with multiple bodies helping one another to reach the peak of the wheel. The sculpture concerns the subject of reincarnation: each time an individual reincarnates, they are closer to reaching enlightenment. The wheel is a known symbol of reincarnation. In Buddhism, it is believed that when a person reaches the state of Buddha, they no longer reincarnate unless they desire to. The Priest of Buddha (1920) is a bust of Buddha with his hands in prayer position. The Buddha’s appearance is influenced by Art Deco, and he wears a headdress with a rather Masonic symbol on the front. Although Maltwood was not a mason at this point in her life, there is clear Masonic reference in the design. Aspiration (1924) is a sculpture of a man reaching outward to receive enlightenment. The style of the work is art nouveau. Mirage (1927) is of a man sitting on a camel, his image duplicated on the sand. Cardonald in the novel House of Fulfillment explains that it “reminds and reveals all the experiences of illusion,” referring to the Buddhist concept of the illusion of self, separateness, and the earthly idea of time as opposed to a true awareness of harmonious unity ” (Brown, p. 36). Buddha's Path of Enlightenment (1929) is of a Buddha atop a high mountain. It is about the struggles of attaining enlightenment and about the ultimate bliss that comes with having achieved this state. Trees Over Water, c. 1939 by Katharine Maltwood, Maltwood Art Museum and Gallery, Victoria BC.The sculpture The Holy Grail (1922) was given two names by Maltwood: The Holy Grail, which it is most commonly known as, and Samadhi. The former title refers to her interest in Arthurian legends and foreshadows her discovery of the Glastonbury Zodiac. The latter title, Samadhi, is a Sanskrit word that can be defined as a state of consciousness induced by complete meditation. The idol holds a cup in his hands. The hand posture is inspired by tai chi. Tai chi movements are meant to build and release energy flow in the body and mind. The cup rests in a spiritually sensitive space, which signifies the importance of the cup. Maltwood believed that the cup “embodied the lost knowledge that man must rediscover to achieve spiritual salvation” (Brown, p. 34). The sketch Trees over Water was created in 1939, a year after Maltwood arrived in Victoria. The branches twist and curl in the wind, reminiscent of Art Nouveau designs. Colour is used sparingly in order to highlight the rich greens of the foliage in the foreground and the sun shining on the tips of the jagged rocks, all with the intent of heightening the drama of the scene. Her views on nature were inspired by her interest in theosophy, much like members of the Group of Seven, and Eastern religions such as Buddhism. Maltwood was influenced in her work by the modern art movement termed symbolism but never ventured into abstraction. Authored Maltwood, K. E.

He was also the Chairman of the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD), and a Minister of State for six years. Early life and education Ashraf was born to a Pashtun family. He completed his medical education from the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar University, in 1972. He is also a fellow of the American College of Physicians.  Career  Ashraf comes from a cricketing family. His maternal grandfather, Karim Baksh, played First- Class cricket in India and was one of the first elected members of the Pakistan Cricket Board in 1949. Ashraf had a very brief first-class cricket career, spanning just 3 matches for the Peshawar Cricket Association in the 1969–70 Quaid-e-Azam Cricket Trophy where as a middle-order batsman. He scored 50 runs, with a best of 21 and a duck on debut. He also played for Pakistan Under 19 team which played against the English team in the year of 1969. He was appointed as the chairman PCB due to his vast management expertise. He was responsible for bringing about the Constitution of the Pakistan Cricket Board albeit after some serious delays. The task was first entrusted to Shahryar Khan, who resigned and Nasim Ashraf finally succeeded in getting the Constitution restored after having it vetted to make it more corporate in nature. The new Constitution mandates a 14-member governing board with four representatives of the regional associations, one representative of the cricket playing organisations, two representatives of the players, and seven technocrats specialising in finance, law, media, and management. This new Constitution has significantly diluted the powers of the chairman. He was elected to the Chairmanship of the Asian Cricket Council in June 2008. = Submission and rejection of resignation = In March 2007, having been in the position for five months after he took over from Shaharyar Khan who stood down in October, Ashraf tendered his own resignation, accepting responsibility for the Pakistan team's first round exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies at the hands of young Irish Cricket Team. But his resignation was subsequently rejected by President Pervez Musharraf who asked him to \\"continue his duty to rebuild the Pakistan cricket team on modern and professional lines\\".

Louvre, MR825. The Kanephoros (, , pl. Kanephoroi (Greek: ); latinate plural form Canephorae; lit. \\"Basket Bearers\\") was an honorific office given to unmarried young women in ancient Greece, which involved the privilege of leading the procession to sacrifice at festivals; the highest honour was to lead the () at the Panathenaic Festival. The role was given to a virgin selected from amongst the aristocratic or Eupatrid families of Athens whose purity and youth was thought essential to ensure a successful sacrifice. Her task was to carry a basket or kanoun (), which contained the offering of barley or first fruits, the sacrificial knife and fillets to decorate the bull,L. Deubner, Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics II, 1909, pp. 433-35. in procession through the city up to the altar on the acropolis. From Aristophanes’s Lysistrata we have evidence that the office of kanephoros was the last in a sequence of religious duties that an unmarried Athenian girl might undertake; first as an arrhephoros, later an aletris, then as an arktos ().Aristophanes, Lys. 641-47. The passage continues, “[f]inally, when I had grown to be a beautiful girl, I was a kanephoros and wore a necklace of dried figs.Translation by C. Levine in N. Loraux, The Children of Athena, 1993, p. 167, spoken by the chorus of women to Stratyllis.” Though the precise age of the kanephoros is not known this suggests the girl was probably between 11 and 15. In such a conspicuous and ritually important office the chosen girl was expected to have a blameless reputation: in 514 BCE the unnamed sister of Harmodios was rebuffed as kanephoros in the Greater Panathenaia; this insult is cited as the cause of her brother’s later assassination of the tyrant Hipparchos which hastened the fall from power of the Peisistratid family.Thucydides 656.Aristotle Ath. Pol. 18.BM Lavelle The Nature of Hipparchos' Insult to Harmondios, AJP107, 1986, pp. 318-31. The cult practice of bearing the basket in a sacrificial procession may date back to the Minoan period; however, the Athenian usage seems to belong to the beginnings of the Panathenaia. The role is also referred to in myth with the abduction of Oreithyia by Boreas. A girl who acted as kanephoros would have advertised the central place of her family in Athenian society, and her own availability for a dynastic marriage. The depiction of the kanephoros in art presents an interesting problem. Unlike the ephebos there are few representations of such girls, possibly because of the restriction on mentioning the name of honourable women in ancient Greek society.M. Golden Names and Naming at Athens:Three Studies, CV 30, 1986, pp. 245-69. Excluding the Parthenon there are only some 44 images of girls and karoun in the period 550 to 330 BCE. Otherwise she must be identified by her dress since while serving her office the kanephoros wore a distinctive full-length mantle, for example in the kylix by Makron, Toledo, Ohio 1972.55. On the Parthenon Frieze none of the maidens (who may be identified by their long hair) are depicted carrying the kanoun and all of them wear the festival mantle, however Linda Jones Roccos suggests that the maidens wearing both peplos and mantle implies they are kanephoroi, which would be consistent with the evidence of contemporary vase painting and wedding iconography.L. J. Roccos, The Kanephoros and her Festival Mantle in Greek Art 1995, pp. 654-59. This would solve the problem of the curious absence of the basket bearers from the processional frieze. The kanephoros was not exclusive to the Panathenaia or to Athens, she may be found at a number of festival across the Greek world, including: the Country Dionysia of Attica; Mother of the Gods in Athens, and Apollo Pythais, Artemis Brauronia, Asklepios; Demeter and Isis at Eleusis; Zeus Disoterien in Piraeus; Zeus Basileus in Lebadeia; Argive Hera; Xphrodite; Hermes at Salamis; Hekate on Delos; Sarapis and Isis; Herakles; Heros Iatros; Neoptolemos. The ruler cult of the Ptolemaic kingdom included a kanephoros of the deified queen Arsinoe II. See also *Canephoria *Ergastinai References Sources *Brulé, Pierre (translated by Antonia Nevill).

He represented the Kangaroos in twelve Tests during 1963 and 1964 and on the off-season Kangaroo Tour. Sporting family Ken and his two brothers were all exemplary sportsmen. John Thornett was a Wallabies captain who played 37 rugby union Tests for Australia over a distinguished 13-year career from 1955. Dick Thornett represented Australia at water polo, rugby league and rugby union. Much of Dick and Ken’s club football career was played together at Parramatta and they had the rare distinction of playing three international rugby league Tests together on the 1963-64 Kangaroo Tour. Water Polo career As his summer sport, Ken was initially devoted to water polo along with his two brothers John and Dick. Under the tutorship of ex-Hungarian international Bert Vadas, he became an excellent goalkeeper with lightning quick reflexes, and was a member of Bronte’s inaugural 1st Grade water polo winning team of the NSWAWPA Premiership in season 1958/59, which feat the club repeated with Ken as goalkeeper in 1959/60. Unfortunately he lost contact with water polo after departing for England to play rugby league professionally in mid 1960. Rugby union and UK rugby league Thornett began his career playing first grade rugby union with Randwick DRUFC (in Coogee, New South Wales), and was the youngest player ever to be selected to play in a first grade union side. Switching to rugby league, Thornett played with Leeds for several seasons. Ken Thornett played in Leeds' 25-10 victory over Warrington in the Championship Final during the 1960–61 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 20 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 52,177. He played in Leeds’ 9–19 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1961 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1961–62 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 11 November 1961. Australian rugby league career Ken Thornett was initially expected to sign with South Sydney upon a proposed return to Australia for the 1962 season, however negotiations with the Rabbitohs fell through and he signed with Parramatta.‘Leeds’ Full-Back “Verbal Contract”: Thornett Accepts Offer by P’Matta’; Sydney Morning Herald, 17 April 1962, p. 29 Thornett played only seven games in that first season, but the resultant six wins and a draw from those games lifted Parramatta to their first-ever finals position, following eight “wooden spoons” and a paltry 20 percent win record in all matches of the previous ten seasons 1952 to 1961. Thornett played regularly with Parramatta from 1963, and totalled 136 games for the club. Thornett was the prominent Australian rugby league fullback in the early 1960s after Keith Barnes, and before Les Johns and Graeme Langlands. Ken played in all six Tests of the 1963 Kangaroo tour and in 10 minor tour games. He made a further six Test appearances and by the end of his representative career in 1964 had played three Tests each against Great Britain and New Zealand, five against France and one against South Africa. Ken Thornett captain-coached Parramatta in 1965 and 1966, but a dispute with the club saw him seek a transfer to Eastern Suburbs,Clarkson, Alan; ‘Thornett to Seek Transfer’; Sydney Morning Herald, 15 December 1966, p. but the blue and golds would not release him from the two years remaining on his contract‘Thornett to See Solicitor’; Sydney Morning Herald, 20 December 1966, p. 23 without a large transfer fee.Goodman, Tom; ‘Thornett Made player-coach Offer by Wagga’; Sydney Morning Herald, 16 December 1966, p. 18 Ken Thornett retired at the end of 1968, but returned for one season under Ian Walsh in 1971 and helped Parramatta rise from last to fourth. Thornett died in Sydney on 16 August 2016.  Accolades In 1965 he was named NSW Player of the Year. The western grandstand of Parramatta Stadium was named the Ken Thornett Stand in his honour. In February 2008, Thornett was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908-2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

The town no longer exists, but it was thought to have been situated near the mouth of the Canche River in what is today the French commune of Étaples. Archaeological discoveries led by David Hill in the 1980s found that the actual location of Quentovic was east of Étaples, in what is now the commune of La Calotterie.David Hill et al., \\"Quentovic defined,\\" Antiquity, 64, no. 242 (1990): 51-58. It was an important trading place for the Franks and its port linked the continent to England, specifically to the southeastern county of Kent. From what we know today, Quentovic was founded by a Neustrian king in the early 6th century.Richard Hodges, The Anglo-Saxon Achievements, (London: Gerald Duckworth & Co. Ltd., 1989), 84-86. It was one of the two most prominent Frankish ports in the north (the other being Dorestad) until it was abandoned, probably in the 11th century.Renée Doeheard, The Early Middle Ages in the West: Economy and Society, (New York: North- Holland Publishing Company, 1978), 176-181. Merchants were drawn to this place because the number of trading posts at the time was limited. Quentovic was also the place where Anglo-Saxon monks would cross the English Channel on their pilgrimage to Rome.Georges Duby, The Early Growth of the European Economy, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1974), 100-103. A lack of physical evidence, and the sudden disappearance of this emporium, make the town difficult to interpret. Some of the most important historical evidence on Quentovic comes from documents of taxation and especially through the town's minting of coinage.Simon Coupland, \\"Trading Places: Quentovic and Dorestad reassessed,\\" Early Medieval Europe, 11, no. 3 (2002): 209-232. Coins minted during both the Merovingian and the Carolingian dynasties have been found. Merovingian Period The Merovingian dynasty is considered to have begun in the year 481 and lasted until they were succeeded by the Carolingians in the 750s. Quentovic may have been established in the final decade of the 5th century, although it is more likely that it came into existence in the early 6th century.Daniel G. Russo, Town Origins and Development n Early England, C.400-950 A.D., (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998), 171-172. The earliest minted coins from Quentovic date from the 6th century.Richard Hodges, Dark Age Economics: The origins of towns and trade A.D. 600-1000, (London: Gerald Duckworth & Co. Ltd., 1982), 90-98. The reason for the town's creation likely had to do with a need by the Franks to increase their long-distance trade. The location of the port of Quentovic was also ideal for controlling the frontiers of the recently solidified empire. This location would help to prevent luxury goods from being monopolized by certain aristocrats. In its early years, Quentovic was probably just a simple fairground where trading occurred, as well as a place where merchants went to and from Kent in Anglo-Saxon England.Richard Hodges, op. cit. 85. Merchants located in Quentovic would have been primarily Frankish, Saxon, or Frisian. In a trading centre like this, they would have set up permanent shelters and also would have built warehouses to store their goods during the winter months.Renée Doeheard, op. cit. 200-202. Trade with the Anglo-Saxons, mainly in Kent (and possibly in Hampshire), was vital for the community. Exports to England would have been primarily textiles although they would have also included wine and quern- stones.Richard Hodges, op. cit. 72. In Kent, pottery bottles, glasses, textiles, and gold coins from the early 8th have been discovered, all produced by the Franks. Slaves and other goods would have also been exchanged in Quentovic.Adriaan Verhulst, The Carolingian Economy, (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 106-112. The earliest mention of Quentovic in literary text was originally believed to have been written in a charter by Dagobert I. It concerned merchants who were travelling to the fair of St-Denis to trade. This charter is now recognized to be a forgery and was most likely written by someone in the late 9th century.Ian Wood, The Merovingian Kingdoms 450-751, (New York: Longman Group UK Limited, 1994), 293-296. Although Quentovic was mainly an economic centre, because of its location it was also a place where people would pass through in their travels. During the Merovingian period (and the Carolingian), Quentovic was the primary landing spot for Anglo-Saxon monks on pilgrimages to Rome. English missionaries also set out from Quentovic in the late seventh and early eighth century to journey east of the Rhine River. The English historian Bede said that they did this because they assumed that they were ethnically related to the pagans of that region.Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, ed., C. Plummer, Venerabilis Baedae Opera Historica (Oxford: 1896). Prior to Frankish records, the Anglo-Saxon Bede is one of the first to mention Quentovic in text, in his Ecclesiastical History. Bede states that Egbert, king of Kent, sent Raedfrid to travel with Archbishop Theodore to Francia in 668. Near the beginning of their journey, Theodore fell ill and was in need of rest. Raedfrid was forced to acquire permission from Ebroin, the mayor of the palace of Neustria, to go to Quentovic.Bede, op. cit. Ebroin is also mentioned by Stephanus, in the only other literary text of this time period which mentions Quentovic. In the Life of Wilfrid by the Anglo-Saxon priest Stephanus, bishop Wilfrid attempts to appeal to Rome against the division of his diocese in 678. Wilfrid's opponents send gifts to Ebroin and Theuderic III, the king of Neustria, to persuade them to capture Wilfrid. They decide to intercept him at Quentovic, but mistakenly seize the bishop Winfrid of Lichfield instead.Stephanus, Vita Wilfridi, ed., B. Colgrave, The Life of Bishop Wilfrid by Eddius Stephanus (Cambridge: 1927) It is interesting that the two earliest records of the Frankish emporium come from Anglo-Saxon records. Quentovic was clearly a main point of entry into the Frankish kingdoms from England. In 716, Ceolfrith the abbot of Monkwearmouth/Jarrow, had to possess letters of introduction in Quentovic, for his excursion through Francia.Ian Wood, op. cit. 293-296. Documentation must have been a requirement to enter the continent from England. This also demonstrates that Quentovic was closely supervised by the authorities, and this supervision would only increase when the Carolingians took control of Francia in 751.Ian Wood, op. cit. 293-296. Carolingian Period In the Carolingian period, Quentovic was still one of the principal Frankish trading posts for English trade. There is significant evidence that, during this time, the authority over the port was tightened. Merchants were forced to pay indirect taxes on most goods, in contrast to the fact that in most other places of the empire, merchants were exempt from paying taxes. The only places that the Frankish kings forced them to pay was in the alpine passes and the two ports of Dorestad and Quentovic.Renée Doeheard, op. cit. 200-202. This royal toll, at its height, amounted to ten percent in the town of Quentovic. The tax was clearly one of the most important incomes of the time for the Franks. Without the taxes at the ports, Charlemagne would have had a difficult time funding his enormous army.Adriaan Verhulst, op. cit. 130-134. Quentovic was also the port from where Frankish ambassadors left to conduct diplomacy with King Offa of Mercia. During Charlemagne's reign, a number of monasteries wanted to own warehouses in or around Quentovic. These recorded monasteries include: St-Vaast, St- Riquier, St-Bertin, St-Germain-des-Prés, St-Wandrille, and Ferrières. When Frankish monasteries wanted goods that could not be found in the surrounding area, they would seek the supplies through trade. One example of this is a record of a Frankish church needing to buy lead for its roof.Alessandro Barbero, Charlemagne Father of a Continent, (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2004), 286-292. In 779, Charlemagne granted the abbey of St- Germain-des-Prés an exemption from the royal tolls that were in effect in Quentovic. (The abbey was also exempt in Rouen, Amiens, Dorestad, and Maastricht.) Charlemagne wanted to have better control of this taxation process so he appointed abbots to fill this role. Gervold of St-Wandrille was given this position of procurator in the late 8th century.Renée Doeheard, op. cit. 200. He would have been in charge of controlling foreign trade and monitoring customs across a large area that included Quentovic. Though some historians argue Quentovic was in decline under Charlemagne, he still implemented some careful regulations there. Quentovic Coinage Denier of Pippin III, minted at Quentovic between c. 754-768. The coinage of Quentovic is the most extensive evidence that survives today. The earliest known coins minted in Quentovic are from the 560s.Richard Hodges, op. cit. 90-98. These coins have some form of the towns name minted on them. The mint of Quentovic produced gold trientes in the first half of the 7th century. These trientes had an image of the royal bust and the moneyer's name printed on them. In approximately 670, Merovingian gold coinage was no longer produced. In its place, silver was used for coins which the Franks called sceattas. They were minted in Quentovic in the late 7th and early 8th century.Ian Wood, op. cit. 297-302. This vast amount of coinage indicates that Quentovic was flourishing during this time period. The coinage would have been used mainly for mercantile purposes, and so trade must have been strong at the time. When the Carolingian dynasty took over in 751, coins continued to be minted in Quentovic under Pippin III. After Pippin's reign, the situation suddenly changed. Coins minted in Quentovic under Charlemagne and Louis the Pious are very rare.Simon Coupland, op. cit. 213-218. This signifies that Quentovic had less economic significance under Charlemagne, than in the century prior. Instead Melle, Chartres, Paris, Orléans, and Rheims were all far more prominent mints.Simon Coupland, op. cit. 213-215. Many historians have argued that by the second half of the 9th century Quentovic was in decline. The Edict of Pistres in 864 is the last written reference to Quentovic. It also seems to have been beneficial for the town's economy. There has been significantly more coinage found in the reign of Charles the Bald after the edict than in the decades before. After the edict's reforms, the amount of silver in these coins also increased by a significant amount.Georges Duby, op. cit. 102-103. These coins supply evidence for the argument that Quentovic had an economic resurgence in the 860s and the 870s. In the 10th century, coinage from this mint again became scarce. This, and the fact that no written text from this time mentions Quentovic, lead historians to support that the port town was in decline again. The last known coin to be produced in Quentovic is dated in the year 980.Adriaan Verhulst, op. cit. 92-94. Disappearance It is difficult to determine when Quentovic was completely abandoned. The town was raided by the Vikings in 842, and only remained Frankish because of the tribute paid by Charles the Bald.Renée Doeheard, op. cit. 200-202. Subsequent raids would follow, but still the emporium seems to have recovered later in the century despite a possible decline in Carolingian authority during this time. The continued raiding must have hurt Quentovic's economy, and slowly merchants left to seek places with better protection. In the 10th century, Quentovic seems to have been replaced by ports that were accessible to England and better fortified. Places that possibly took on this role include Montreuil- sur-Mer and Saint-Omer.Adriaan Verhulst, op. cit. 131-133. A lack of evidence remains on the actual demise of Quentovic. Archaeological digs have found pottery dated as late as the 10th century. There has also been fragments of potash glass, which is usually dated near the end of the first millennium AD.David Hill, op. cit. 55-57. Another possible contributor to its decline could be flooding or a rise in sea level. It also may have been difficult for the increasing size of ships to dock at its port.Richard Hodges, op. cit. 92-95. Quentovic's fall remains a mystery, although it is widely believed that it was a gradual abandonment, which finally concluded in the early 11th century.

It is situated in Ruma municipality, Srem District, Vojvodina province. The village has a Serb ethnic majority and a population of 991 people (2002 census). There is a significant ancient Roman archaeological site near the village - the remains of large city Bassianae, which in the 3rd century had the highest status of colonia. Name In Serbian the village is known as Donji Petrovci (Доњи Петровци) or sometimes simply Petrovci (Петровци); in Croatian as Donji Petrovci; and in Hungarian as Petrovcze. The name of the town in Serbian is in the plural, and therefore it is grammatically correct to refer to it as \\"Donji Petrovci are\\" instead of \\"Donji Petrovci is\\". A hypothetical singular version of the name would be Donji Petrovac. History Map of Pannonia Secunda province with major towns, including Bassianae In ancient times, an important Roman town known as Bassianae existed at this location. Today only small amount of this ancient settlement have been preserved. Bassianae was founded as an autonomous civitas in the 1st century and existed until the 6th century. It obtained the municipium status in 124 AD, while in 214 AD it was recorded as a colony. Initially, the town was part of Pannonia province, but due to the subsequent divisions of this province, Bassianae was included into Pannonia Inferior (2nd century) and later into Pannonia Secunda (3rd century). Bassianae was devastated during Barbarian invasions in the 5th-6th century. Modern village of Donji Petrovci was mentioned first under this name in 1520, during administration of medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Since 1526, the village is part of the Ottoman Empire and from 1527 to 1530 it belonged to vassal Serb duchy in Syrmia, ruled by Radoslav Čelnik. Later, the village was included into Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia, which was part of the Budin Eyalet. Following the Treaty of Passarowitz from 1718, the village was transferred from Ottoman Empire to Habsburg Monarchy. Until 1745, the village was under military administration, and since 1745, it was part of the Syrmia County of the Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia (this kingdom was administratively part of both, the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary). In 1828, village was mainly populated by Orthodox Christians. In 1848-1849, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and from 1849 to 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, which was a separate Habsburg crownland. After abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the village was again included into Syrmia County of the Kingdom of Slavonia (in this time, Kingdom of Slavonia was completely separate Habsburg crownland). Following the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement from 1868, the Kingdom of Slavonia and the Kingdom of Croatia were joined into newly formed Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia, which administratively was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. In 1910, the village had Serb ethnic majority and Hungarian minority. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the village firstly became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, then part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and finally part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, the village was occupied by Axis troops and was attached to the Pavelić's Independent State of Croatia. In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis troops from the region and village was included into Autonomous Province of Vojvodina within new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1945, Vojvodina is part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia.

A first baseman who, early in his career, also frequently played corner outfielder, he appeared in 667 games in Major League Baseball from 1958 through 1963 for four National League clubs, most notably the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also spent two years (1965 and 1966) in Nippon Professional Baseball. Larker was listed as tall and , and batted and threw left-handed. Early baseball career Larker was born in Beaver Meadows, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Hazleton High School. He began his pro career with the local Hazleton Mountaineers of the Class D North Atlantic League in 1949, and batted .299. When the Brooklyn Dodgers signed a working agreement with the Mountaineers for 1950, Larker joined the Dodger organization and promptly rose through their farm system, reaching the Triple-A level in 1954. He batted over .300 for three consecutive years (1955–1957) in the American Association but was unable to crack the Brooklyn lineup, which featured eight- time All-Star first baseman Gil Hodges. Larker was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 1956 Rule 5 Draft, but failed to make the 1957 ChiSox roster and was offered back to the Dodger organization. Six years in major leagues Placed on the 28-man, early-season squad of the first-ever edition of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a 27-year-old rookie, Larker proceeded to win a permanent roster spot. He started five games in left field during April 1958, but struggled offensively and was relegated to pinch hitting duty. He was still hitting only .214 on June 30 when his slumbering bat awakened. Starting 23 games at first base and left field in July 1958, Larker raised his batting average to .338 by August 1 on the strength of nine multi-hit games.Retrosheet: 1958 LA N Regular Season Batting Log He finished with 70 hits and a .779 OPS. Then, in his sophomore season, he was a key contributor to the Dodgers' 1959 National League and World Series championship team. Larker started 85 of Los Angeles' 156 regular season games (55 at first base and 30 in the outfield), raised his batting average to .289, and hit eight home runs. The Dodgers rose from seventh place in 1958 to a flat-footed tie with the defending NL champion Milwaukee Braves, forcing a best-of-three playoff. In the 1959 National League tie-breaker series, Larker was the Dodgers' starting right fielder in Game 1 and starting left fielder in Game 2. He collected five hits in eight at bats, with three runs batted in, as the Dodgers swept the Braves to win the pennant. He then started all six games of the 1959 World Series in the outfield against the White Sox and notched three hits and two bases on balls. He batted only .188, but the Dodgers took the series to win the second world championship in their history, and their first in Los Angeles. Larker's most productive MLB season came in . With the 36-year-old Hodges hobbled by injury and limited to only 41 games started in the field, Larker took over as Los Angeles' regular first baseman. Starting 112 games and appearing in 133 contests overall, Larker reached career bests in hits (142), doubles (26), runs batted in (78), batting average (.323) and OPS (.798). He battled for the National League batting title into the season's final days with NL Most Valuable Player Dick Groat of the Pittsburgh Pirates before finishing second by two one-thousandths of a point. Still, his .323 mark allowed him to finish ahead of Willie Mays (.319), Roberto Clemente (.314) and Ken Boyer (.304). He finished 15th in NL MVP voting for 1960, but was selected to the Senior Circuit's All-Star team.1960 National League Standard Batting In the two All-Star games played that season, Larker appeared in each game as a pinch hitter, hitting into a force play in the first contest, and drawing a base on balls in the latter. The season was Larker's fourth and last in a Dodger uniform. He started 79 games at first base, but his production declined: his average fell to .270 and his OPS to .712. With Larker approaching his 31st birthday and the Dodgers anxious to integrate rising young stars Frank Howard and Ron Fairly into their lineup, Larker was left unprotected in the NL expansion draft. Selected by the brand-new Houston Colt .45s with the 23rd overall pick, Larker became the expansion team's starting first baseman in . He batted cleanup in Houston's first-ever major league game on April 10, 1962, going one-for-four with an RBI in an 11–2 Colt .45 win. In 1962, Larker got into 147 games played and hit nine home runs, with 58 runs scored, all career bests. He led the Colt .45s in doubles (19) and on-base percentage (.358) and tied for the team lead in bases on balls (70). But at season's end, he was traded to the Milwaukee Braves in a four- player deal that sent starting pitcher Don Nottebart to Houston. The Braves' regular first-base job was wide open with the trading away of veteran Joe Adcock, but Larker could not claim it. After two months of action and 25 games started, he was hitting only .220, and his production worsened as his playing time became even more limited. He was hitting an anaemic .177 with one home run when the Braves sold his contract to the San Francisco Giants on August 8, 1963. His slump continuing, Larker collected only one hit as a Giant in very limited service over the last two months of the season, his last in the majors. In his six-season career, Larker was a .275 hitter (538-for-1,953) with 32 home runs and 271 RBI in 667 games, including 227 runs, 97 doubles, 15 triples, and three stolen bases. He also collected a .347 OBP and a solid 1.28 walk-to-strikeout ratio (211-to-165). Defensively, Larker compiled a career .991 fielding percentage at first base (in 483 games) and in the outfield (82 games). Career in Japan and winter leagues After spending 1964 with the Giants' Triple-A Tacoma farm club, Larker signed with the Toei Flyers in Japan's Pacific League, where he played in 1965–1966. In 224 NPB games, he batted .267 with 194 hits, 28 doubles, 14 homers and 85 runs batted in. During his career, Larker also played winter ball with the Navegantes del Magallanes club of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, where he captured the batting crown with a .340 average in the 1955–1956 season.Gutiérrez, Daniel; González, Javier (2006); Records de la Liga Venezolana de Béisbol Profesional. LVBP. After leaving baseball, Larker entered private business in Long Beach, California, where he'd moved in the late 1950s during his tenure with the Dodgers. He died from cancer in Long Beach at the age of 76, survived by his wife, four sons and eight grandchildren.Long Beach Press-Telegram obituary (March 18, 2007), in The Dead Ball Era References External links *Baseball Library *Press Telegram *Retrosheet Category:1930 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:Asheville Tourists players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Greenwood Dodgers players Category:Hazleton Mountaineers players Category:Houston Colt .45s players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Mobile Bears players Category:Montreal Royals players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Navegantes del Magallanes players Category:People from Carbon County, Pennsylvania Category:People from Hazleton, Pennsylvania Category:St. Paul Saints (AA) players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sportspeople from Long Beach, California Category:Tacoma Giants players Category:Toei Flyers players ","title":"Norm Larker"},{"id":"10727214","text":"The Melbourne International Exhibition is the eighth World's fair officially recognised by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) and the first official World's Fair in the Southern Hemisphere. Preparations The laying of the foundation stone of the Exhibition Building on 19 February 1879 After being granted self-governance, Victoria (in 1851) and New South Wales (in 1856), saw a steady economic growth as result of the discovery and exploitation of gold reserves. This growth during the 1850s and 1860s led to rivalry between their respective capitals Melbourne and Sydney. In the 1870s the focus turned to the outside world and proposals were made for organising an exhibition modelled on the great exhibitions of Europe, with an aim to promote commerce and industry, along with art, science and education. Melbourne started preparations in 1879 and filed a plan to the Parliament. Melbourne's rival Sydney, the older of the two cities, wanted to be the first and organised an exhibition in record time. This Sydney International Exhibition started in October 1879, but it focused mainly on agriculture, so it was not really universal and therefore did not meet the criteria for official recognition by the BIE. Melbourne decided to start their exhibition shortly after the one in Sydney, so the participants could transport their exhibits during the winter of 1880. The Works at the Melbourne International Exhibition. 1878 In May 1878, the designs of Joseph Reed and Frederick Barnes were chosen for the Main Building of the Exhibition. On 19 February 1879 Governor Sir George Bowen laid the cornerstone in Carlton Garden for the new Exhibition Building. The building, built by David Mitchell, covered about 7 acres. Its nave measured 500 x 160 feet and the transept was 272 feet long. A large dome 60 feet in diameter rose 217 feet above the building. Two machinery annexes, each 460 x 138 feet, were built at the rear of the main building. Exhibition Prize Design for the Melbourne International Exhibition Building. 1878 Preparations for the exhibition The Melbourne International Exhibition was held from 1 October 1880 until 30 April 1881. It was the second international exhibition to be held in Australia, the first being held the previous year in Sydney. 1.459 million people visited the exhibition, made a profit of £1,570. The exhibition was also opened for entertainment and tourism.  Aftermath  The building was extended and reused in 1888 as venue for the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, celebrating the founding of European settlement in Sydney in 1788. The main building or Great Hall as it became known has been used for exhibitions, balls, banquets, and during World War II was used by the Royal Australian Air Force. On 1 October 1980 it was announced the Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II had conferred the title of \\"Royal\\" to the Exhibition Building. On 1 July 2004 the Royal Exhibition Building became the first building in Australia to become a World Heritage Site.

Itoh was fatally shot by Tetsuya Shiroo, a member of the yakuza, on 17 April 2007 and died the following morning. Early life Kazunaga Itō was born on 23 August 1945 in Nagato, Yamaguchi Prefecture, a week after the Surrender of Japan and two weeks after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Itoh's family moved to his father's hometown of Nagasaki when he was three years-old. Itoh first aspired to become mayor of Nagasaki while attending Nishi Prefectural High School, and after graduating from Waseda University with a degree in political science began working for the Nagasaki City Development Corporation. Itoh's first name (一長) was originally pronounced Kazunaga in the kun-yomi reading, but he elected to use more euphonious on- yomi reading of Itchō or Iccho for his mayoralty. Itoh's name was romanized as Itcho Ito by Mainichi Shimbun,\\"Nagasaki mayor dies after being shot by gangster\\" Mainichi Daily News 19 April 2007 Reuters, and Al-Jazeera.\\"Japanese mayor shot dead\\" Al-Jazeera .net 18 April 2007 CNN used the Iccho Ito romanization.\\"Murdered mayor sparks Japanese fears\\" CNN 18 April 2007 The Asahi Shimbun used Iccho Itoh.\\"Nagasaki Mayor Itoh dies after being shot by gang member\\" The Asahi Shimbun 18 April 2007 Itoh spelled his name romanized as Iccho Itoh in his English language letter to U.S. President George W. Bush. Career In 1973, Itoh became the chairman of the Nagasaki City Youth Organization Council, overseeing an event of 700 young people sailing from Nagasaki to Naha, Okinawa Prefecture and Busan, South Korea as part of a program to strengthen Nagasaki's ties with those cities. Itoh served in the Nagasaki city assembly and the Nagasaki Prefecture assembly as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party before he was elected as the mayor of Nagasaki in 1995. Itoh was recommended by the Liberal Democratic Party as their main candidate for mayor of Nagasaki, favored over more established LDP politicians and the controversial incumbent LDP mayor Hitoshi Motoshima. Itoh defeated Motoshima in the mayoral election in 1995, and was re-elected for his second term as mayor in 1999. Itoh won his third term in 2003, supported by both the LDP and Komeito, defeating candidates supported by the Liberal Party and the Communist Party by a large margin. =Mayor of Nagasaki= Itoh began his first term as mayor of Nagasaki on 2 May 1995, running a city government that was characterized as promoting tourism and revitalization of the city. Itoh was a vocal critic of nuclear weapons as mayor of Nagasaki, and the United States as one of the world's main nuclear states in particular. On 7 November 1995, Itoh made a speech at the International Court of Justice in the Hague stressing that, as the mayor of a city where an atomic bomb was dropped just two weeks before his birth, the use of nuclear weapons is a violation of international law. In August 2002, at a commemoration of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Itoh criticized the United States' nuclear weapons policy in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In May 2005, at a Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty conference, Itoh claimed that mankind and nuclear weapons cannot co-exist together. In 2006, Itoh criticized the United States and North Korea for conducting nuclear tests. Early in Itoh's mayorship, there was controversy over plans to demolish some ruins from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki to reuse the land, but this was eventually scrapped after a protest at Nagasaki Peace Park. Itoh's city government ran program encouraging Nagasaki schools to use vegetables and other ingredients produced in the local area in their school meals. In 2005, Itoh opened the Nagasaki Museum of History and Culture and Nagasaki Prefectural Art Museum to replace the former Nagasaki Prefectural Museum and Art Museum that had closed in 2002. Assassination Itoh's gravesite in Sotome, Nagasaki. On 17 April 2007, while campaigning for re-election for his fourth term, Itoh was shot twice in the back at point-blank range by Tetsuya Shiroo while exiting a car in front of his campaign office outside Nagasaki Station. Itoh was taken to the Nagasaki University Hospital in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest and underwent four hours of emergency operations, but he died early the next morning due to blood loss. Itoh's death triggered a new mayoral election held on 22 April 2007. Itoh's son-in-law, , and a city official, , filed for candidacy in the election. Taue was elected as Itoh's successor. Police arrested Shiroo on suspicion of the murder after he was detained by Itoh's entourage and passersby following the shooting. Shiroo was a leader of the Suishin-kai, a Nagasaki-based yakuza group affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest yakuza organization in Japan. Shiroo had shot Itoh with a Smith & Wesson Model 36 and was found with 20 bullets in his possession upon arrest. Several theories exist for Shiroo's motive to shoot Itoh, with the main theory being a personal grudge against Itoh and the city government for an incident in 2003. Shiroo filed an insurance claim for damage to his car when he drove it into a hole dug for public works, but the city refused to compensate him. Shiroo had mailed a letter to TV Asahi about the issue, and it was public knowledge before the shooting. Additionally, Shiroo was also reportedly angry that a construction company linked to the Suishin-kai had been denied a contract by the city government.明報新聞網 Itoh's assassination had not been approved by the Yamaguchi-gumi and led to greater public scrutiny of yakuza activity. The Suishin-kai's offices were raided by police for evidence, and the gang announced their intention to voluntarily disband days later. On 26 May 2008, the Nagasaki District Court sentenced Shiroo to death, but the Fukuoka High Court revoked the death sentence. Itoh was the second mayor of Nagasaki to be shot; his immediate predecessor was shot in 1990, but survived.

It was located near present-day Donji Petrovci village in Ruma municipality. Bassianae was second largest town in Syrmia, after Sirmium. It was located on a road that connected Sirmium and Singidunum. History Bassianae was founded as an autonomous civitas in the 1st century and existed until the 6th century. It obtained the municipium status in 124 AD, while in 214 AD it was recorded as a colony. Initially, the town was part of Pannonia province, but due to the subsequent divisions of this province, Bassianae was included into Pannonia Inferior (2nd century) and later into Pannonia Secunda (3rd century). It was one of the more important towns in the Pannonia province. During late Roman Empire, the town was a seat of one high official - procurator gynaecii Bassianensis Pannoniae secundae.

When Eastern Empire managed to capture Sirmium after defeat of the Gepids, new province of Pannonia with seat in Sirmium was established and town of Bassianae was included into that province. In the second half of the 6th century, the whole Syrmia region was conquered by the Avars. Archaeology Today only small amount of ancient town have been preserved. Archaeological excavations began in 1882 and were continued in 1935, when walls, towers, ceramics, coins, sculptures and mosaics were found.

They were originally described in the mesenteric microcirculation, and were thought to only reside there.Precapillary Sphincter definition. The Free Dictionary by Farlex. Medical Dictionary At the point where each of the capillaries originates from an arteriole, contractile mural cells encircle the capillary. This is called the precapillary sphincter. The precapillary sphincter has now also been found in the brain, where it regulates blood flow to the capillary bed. The sphincter can open and close the entrance to the capillary, by which contraction causes blood flow in a capillary to change as vasomotion occurs. Autoregulation and Capillary DynamicsPearson Education Inc., publishing as Benjamin Cummings In some tissues, the entire capillary bed may be bypassed by blood flow through arteriovenous anastomoses or through preferential flow through metarterioles. If the sphincter is damaged or cannot contract, blood can flow into the capillary bed at high pressures. When capillary pressures are high (as per gravity, etc.), fluid passes out of the capillaries into the interstitial space, and edema or fluid swelling is the result. Dispute over concept Precapillary sphincters and metarterioles were discovered in the mesenteric circulation in the 1950s. Medical and physiological textbooks, such as Guyton, Boron and Fulton, etc. were quick to claim the existence of said sphincters and metarterioles all over the body, despite lack of evidence. At least since 1976 there has been considerable debate about the existence of precapillary sphincters and metarterioles. In 2020, precapillary sphincters were identified as a mechanism for controlling cerebral blood flow.

It is located in the commune of Saint-Louis, between the towns of Saint-Louis and Arzviller in the département of the Moselle.  History  The Marne-Rhine Canal was built from 1838 to 1853. The main problem it solved was going through the Vosges Mountains and especially climbing up its eastern side to its lower point, the Col de Saverne. This was first solved by means of a ladder of seventeen locks, allowing an overall level change of 44.55 metres over a distance of 4 kilometres. In 1969, these locks were replaced by the Saint-Louis-Arzviller inclined plane. Before the advent of self-propelled barges, the barges were hauled by two to four horses or mules, until the beginning of the 20th century. Then came the tractors, first on railways then on tyres since 1933, with electrical motors first and later diesel engines. The greatest energy is needed to start the move. Thus, the traveling via the locks ladder was very laborious, tiring, expensive and long. With 314 kilometres and 17 locks, the travel from Vitry-le-François to Strasbourg took six to nine days. Just using the locks ladder of Arzviller needed one whole day. Additionally, due to the narrow width of this section, the crossing of two barges was barely possible. One person was needed to man each lock. These seventeen lock-keepers had to take care of the locks seven days a week and about twelve hours a day. They lived near the canal in houses owned by the state. Their duty was: * to allow the boats to pass through the locks; * to ensure good functioning and safety; * to maintain the valves, the toothed racks and the canal's surroundings. In winter, the canal was emptied, to allow the locks' upkeep. The seventeen locks wasted a lot of water (about 600 cubic metres per boat and per lock plus the leaks). In summer, the water need was greater than could be compensated for by the surrounding available small river and ponds.  The solution  Several projects resulting from an international contest had been successively studied and rejected, because some of the systems that were presented, in particular those of longitudinal type - such as the Ronquières in Belgium (1967) – were badly suited to the Vosgean site. The transverse system was the one best adapted to the topography of the site and also enabled the section of the old canal to be kept in service, limiting considerable cuts in navigation time. The only work of this type existing at the time was the Foxton inclined plane of Foxton, Leicestershire (1900). The new structure opened in 1969. = Principle = View from above The caisson The lifting gates The machine room The system works by basically lifting or lowering a caisson containing a boat on a carriage along a slope using a balancing counterweight. According to Archimedes' principle, the barge which enters the caisson drives back towards the canal a quantity of water equivalent to the mass of the barge. Thus, the caisson always weighs the same, whether or not it contains a barge. In principle, the system could function without an engine. Indeed, the caisson is more full at the upper level, because it stops 20 cm below the level of the canal, and less full at the lower level, since it stops 20 cm above the canal. The engines control only the speed, and require relatively low power compared to the transported weight. = Dimensions = Key numbers:Press file from the Navigation Service of Strasbourg, especially page 6. (French) * Reinforced concrete slope, with steel rails, allowing a horizontal move of 108.6 metres and a level change of 44.5 metres (slope of 41% - angle of 22°); * steel caisson 41.5 m long, 5.5 m wide and 3.2 m deep (730 cubic metres capacity), steel carriage on 32 steel wheels, the whole weighing about 900 tonnes. It travels at the speed of 0.6 m/s (2.2 km/h); * four lifting gates (two at the caisson and one at each level); * two concrete counterweights on guided carriages of 450 tonnes each. Each counterweight is fastened to the caisson by means of 14 steel cables of 27 millimetres diameter; * in the machine room, two winches each driven by a 90 kW electrical motor which ensures operation; * a power-generating unit allows the inclined plane to be used even in the event of long power cuts. At the beginning, two caissons were planned but, with the decline of water transport, only one was built. = Performance and traffic = The inclined plane of Saint-Louis-Arzviller is able to carry 39 barges per day. Each journey is made in four minutes, making a total transportation time of twenty minutes between going in and going out. While the inclined plane is manned by two people, water losses are limited to 40 cubic metres and electrical consumption to 40 megajoules (10 kWh) per journey. The decline in merchant water transport is partly offset by tourist traffic and the carrying of thousands of pleasure boats per year. Evolution of traffic: * merchant boats : 1969 = 5788, 1979 = 2914, 1989 = 1015, 1999 = 272, 2004 = 284 * pleasure boats : 1975 = 145, 1979 = 521, 1989 = 5330, 1999 = 7486, 2004 = 6624 Since the early 21st century, a slight increase in merchant traffic and a slight decrease in tourist traffic have been observed; while energy costs still rise, this could be more effective. The tourist association of Saint-Louis-Arzviller inclined plane, which has managed the guided visits since the site opened, welcomes about 150,000 visitors per year. This makes this site the most visited one in Lorraine. = Incident of 4 July 2013 = Shortly before 12pm local time, while the tourist barge \\"Paris\\", which belongs to the Association and provides visits to tourists, was entering the caisson, the latter suddenly moved, jamming the barge with its 21 passengers and releasing a vast quantity of water into the valley below. An extensive operation by the emergency services was put into operation with occupants of a nearby camping and a restaurant in Lutzelbourg being evacuated. Through traffic on the canal was suspended while thorough inspection of the installation was undertaken, with closure originally estimated to last several months. The boat lift re-opened briefly in 2014 but closed again after damage was discovered to the caisson. Ultimately the boat lift re-opened again in the summer of 2015.

Later, in the Roman Empire, the area was part of the province Pannonia. The town, along with the entire Burgenland, belonged to Hungary (German West Hungary) until 1920/21. Since 1898, the Hungarian name for the town, Somfalva, was used as a result of the Magyarization policies of the government in Budapest. After the end of the World War I, German West Hungary was awarded to Austria after tough negotiations. In 1921, the town became part of the newly founded federal state Burgenland On 30 January 1927 the Frontkämpfervereinigung was involved in a confrontation with the Republikanischer Schutzbund. When the Frontkämpfervereinigung activists were found not guilty by a jury, the socialist organised a general strike which led to the July Revolt of 1927.

He's also the brother of former IBF Champion Ulises Solís. Pro career Solís started his professional boxing career in 1998 at 112 pounds at the age of 19. His early fights usually took place in Mexico. His first professional fight was a four-round bout against Bernardo Tule (2-1-0) on February 6, 1998, which Solís won via technical knockout (TKO). His first fight in the United States of America was against Juan Jose Mendez (3-2-1) on September 2, 2000 in the Don Haskins Center, El Paso, Texas, which he won in the 6th round by technical knockout. On October 27, 2001 Solís faced Ruben Estanislao (13-3-1) for the Mexican Super Bantamweight Championship, which he won and defended it against Jorge Munoz (22-17-2), Sammy Ventura (17-8-0) and Fernando Alanis (16-14-3). On June 6, 2003 Solis faced Wilson Alcorro (20-4-2) for the WBC Latin America Super Featherweight Title but the bout ended in a draw. In September 2004, Solis fought future champion Humberto Soto (35-5-2) in a bout which resulted in a \\"no contest\\" decision. Solis was knocked to the canvas by Soto in the third round, but the fight was stopped later in the round after Solis suffered a cut due to an accidental clash of heads.

By the mid- Triassic, there were many synapsid species that looked like mammals. The lineage leading to today's mammals split up in the Jurassic; synapsids from this period include Dryolestes, more closely related to extant placentals and marsupials than to monotremes, as well as Ambondro, more closely related to monotremes. Later on, the eutherian and metatherian lineages separated; the metatherians are the animals more closely related to the marsupials, while the eutherians are those more closely related to the placentals. Since Juramaia, the earliest known eutherian, lived 160 million years ago in the Jurassic, this divergence must have occurred in the same period. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs (birds being the only surviving dinosaurs) and several mammalian groups, placental and marsupial mammals diversified into many new forms and ecological niches throughout the Paleogene and Neogene, by the end of which all modern orders had appeared. Mammals are the only living synapsids. The synapsid lineage became distinct from the sauropsid lineage in the late Carboniferous period, between 320 and 315 million years ago. The sauropsids are today's reptiles and birds along with all the extinct animals more closely related to them than to mammals. This does not include the mammal-like reptiles, a group more closely related to the mammals. Throughout the Permian period, the synapsids included the dominant carnivores and several important herbivores. In the subsequent Triassic period, however, a previously obscure group of sauropsids, the archosaurs, became the dominant vertebrates. The mammaliaforms appeared during this period; their superior sense of smell, backed up by a large brain, facilitated entry into nocturnal niches with less exposure to archosaur predation. The nocturnal lifestyle may have contributed greatly to the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair. Later in the Mesozoic, after theropod dinosaurs replaced rauisuchians as the dominant carnivores, mammals spread into other ecological niches. For example, some became aquatic, some were gliders, and some even fed on juvenile dinosaurs. Most of the evidence consists of fossils. For many years, fossils of Mesozoic mammals and their immediate ancestors were very rare and fragmentary; but, since the mid-1990s, there have been many important new finds, especially in China. The relatively new techniques of molecular phylogenetics have also shed light on some aspects of mammalian evolution by estimating the timing of important divergence points for modern species. When used carefully, these techniques often, but not always, agree with the fossil record. Although mammary glands are a signature feature of modern mammals, little is known about the evolution of lactation as these soft tissues are not often preserved in the fossil record. Most research concerning the evolution of mammals centers on the shapes of the teeth, the hardest parts of the tetrapod body. Other important research characteristics include the evolution of the middle ear bones, erect limb posture, a bony secondary palate, fur, hair, and warm- bloodedness. Definition of \\"mammal\\" quadrate and articular bones are small and part of the middle ear; the lower jaw consists only of dentary bone. While living mammal species can be identified by the presence of milk- producing mammary glands in the females, other features are required when classifying fossils, because mammary glands and other soft-tissue features are not visible in fossils. One such feature available for paleontology, shared by all living mammals (including monotremes), but not present in any of the early Triassic therapsids, is shown in Figure 1 (on the right), namely: mammals use two bones for hearing that all other amniotes use for eating. The earliest amniotes had a jaw joint composed of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and the quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). All non-mammalian tetrapods use this system including amphibians, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs (including the birds), ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. But mammals have a different jaw joint, composed only of the dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (another small skull bone). In the Jurassic, their quadrate and articular bones evolved into the incus and malleus bones in the middle ear.Mammalia: Overview – Palaeos Mammals also have a double occipital condyle; they have two knobs at the base of the skull that fit into the topmost neck vertebra, while other tetrapods have a single occipital condyle. In a 1981 article, Kenneth A. Kermack and his co-authors argued for drawing the line between mammals and earlier synapsids at the point where the mammalian pattern of molar occlusion was being acquired and the dentary- squamosal joint had appeared. The criterion chosen, they noted, is merely a matter of convenience; their choice was based on the fact that \\"the lower jaw is the most likely skeletal element of a Mesozoic mammal to be preserved.\\" Today, most paleontologists consider that animals are mammals if they satisfy this criterion. The ancestry of mammals =Amniotes= The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes — their eggs had internal membranes that allowed the developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. This allowed amniotes to lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water (a few amphibians, such as the common Suriname toad, have evolved other ways of getting around this limitation). The first amniotes apparently arose in the middle Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs.Carroll R.L. (1991): The origin of reptiles. In: Schultze H.-P., Trueb L., (ed) Origins of the higher groups of tetrapods — controversy and consensus. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp 331-353. Within a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: mammals' synapsid ancestors and the sauropsids, from which lizards, snakes, turtles/tortoises, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds are descended. The earliest known fossils of synapsids and sauropsids (such as Archaeothyris and Hylonomus, respectively) date from about 320 to 315 million years ago. The times of origin are difficult to know, because vertebrate fossils from the late Carboniferous are very rare, and therefore the actual first occurrences of each of these types of animal might have been considerably earlier than the first fossil. = Synapsids = hole behind each eye, in a fairly low position on the skull (lower right in this image). Synapsid skulls are identified by the distinctive pattern of the holes behind each eye, which served the following purposes: *made the skull lighter without sacrificing strength. *saved energy by using less bone. *probably provided attachment points for jaw muscles. Having attachment points further away from the jaw made it possible for the muscles to be longer and therefore to exert a strong pull over a wide range of jaw movement without being stretched or contracted beyond their optimum range. The synapsid pelycosaurs included the largest land vertebrates of the Early Permian, such as the 6 m (20 ft) long Cotylorhynchus hancocki. Among the other large pelycosaurs were Dimetrodon grandis and Edaphosaurus cruciger.  Therapsids  Therapsids descended from pelycosaurs in the middle Permian and took over their position as the dominant land vertebrates. They differ from pelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including larger temporal fenestrae and incisors that are equal in size. The therapsid lineage that led to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very like their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with some that could easily be mistaken for mammals: *gradual development of a bony secondary palate. Most books and articles interpret this as a prerequisite for the evolution of mammals' high metabolic rate, because it enabled these animals to eat and breathe at the same time. But some scientists point out that some modern ectotherms use a fleshy secondary palate to separate the mouth from the airway, and that a bony palate provides a surface on which the tongue can manipulate food, facilitating chewing rather than breathing. The interpretation of the bony secondary palate as an aid to chewing also suggests the development of a faster metabolism, because chewing reduces the size of food particles delivered to the stomach and can therefore speed their digestion. In mammals, the palate is formed by two specific bones, but various Permian therapsids had other combinations of bones in the right places to function as a palate. *the dentary gradually becomes the main bone of the lower jaw. *progress towards an erect limb posture, which would increase the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was erratic and very slow — for example: all herbivorous therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semi-erect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semi-sprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semi- sprawling limbs. =Therapsid family tree= (simplified from; only those that are most relevant to the evolution of mammals are described below) Only the dicynodonts, therocephalians, and cynodonts survived into the Triassic. =Biarmosuchia= The Biarmosuchia were the most primitive and pelycosaur- like of the therapsids. =Dinocephalians= Dinocephalians (\\"terrible heads\\") included both carnivores and herbivores. They were large; Anteosaurus was up to 6 m (20 ft) long. Some of the carnivores had semi-erect hindlimbs, but all dinocephalians had sprawling forelimbs. In many ways they were very primitive therapsids; for example, they had no secondary palate and their jaws were rather \\"reptilian\\". =Anomodonts= Lystrosaurus, one of the few genera of dicynodonts that survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event The anomodonts (\\"anomalous teeth\\") were among the most successful of the herbivorous therapsids — one sub-group, the dicynodonts, survived almost to the end of the Triassic. But anomodonts were very different from modern herbivorous mammals, as their only teeth were a pair of fangs in the upper jaw and it is generally agreed that they had beaks like those of birds or ceratopsians. =Theriodonts= The theriodonts (\\"beast teeth\\") and their descendants had jaw joints in which the lower jaw's articular bone tightly gripped the skull's very small quadrate bone. This allowed a much wider gape, and one group, the carnivorous gorgonopsians (\\"gorgon faces\\"), took advantage of this to develop \\"sabre teeth\\". But the theriodont's jaw hinge had a longer term significance — the much reduced size of the quadrate bone was an important step in the development of the mammalian jaw joint and middle ear. The gorgonopsians still had some primitive features: no bony secondary palate (but other bones in the right places to perform the same functions); sprawling forelimbs; hindlimbs that could operate in both sprawling and erect postures. But the therocephalians (\\"beast heads\\"), which appear to have arisen at about the same time as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans). =Cynodonts= Artist's conception of the cynodont Trirachodon within a burrow The cynodonts, a theriodont group that also arose in the late Permian, include the ancestors of all mammals. Cynodonts' mammal-like features include further reduction in the number of bones in the lower jaw, a secondary bony palate, cheek teeth with a complex pattern in the crowns, and a brain which filled the endocranial cavity. Multi-chambered burrows have been found, containing as many as 20 skeletons of the Early Triassic cynodont Trirachodon; the animals are thought to have been drowned by a flash flood. The extensive shared burrows indicate that these animals were capable of complex social behaviors. Triassic takeover The catastrophic mass extinction at the end of the Permian, around 252 million years ago, killed off about 70 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species and the majority of land plants. As a result, ecosystems and food chains collapsed, and the establishment of new stable ecosystems took about 30 million years. With the disappearance of the gorgonopsians, which were dominant predators in the late Permian, the cynodonts' principal competitors for dominance of the carnivorous niches were a previously obscure sauropsid group, the archosaurs, which includes the ancestors of crocodilians and dinosaurs. The archosaurs quickly became the dominant carnivores, a development often called the \\"Triassic takeover\\". Their success may have been due to the fact that the early Triassic was predominantly arid and therefore archosaurs' superior water conservation gave them a decisive advantage. All known archosaurs have glandless skins and eliminate nitrogenous waste in a uric acid paste containing little water, while the cynodonts probably excreted most such waste in a solution of urea, as mammals do today; considerable water is required to keep urea dissolved. However, this theory has been questioned, since it implies synapsids were necessarily less advantaged in water retention, that synapsid decline coincides with climate changes or archosaur diversity (neither of which has been tested) and the fact that desert-dwelling mammals are as well adapted in this department as archosaurs,Darren Naish, Episode 38: A Not Too Shabby Podcarts and some cynodonts like Trucidocynodon were large-sized predators. The Triassic takeover was probably a vital factor in the evolution of the mammals. Two groups stemming from the early cynodonts were successful in niches that had minimal competition from the archosaurs: the tritylodonts, which were herbivores, and the mammals, most of which were small nocturnal insectivores (although some, like Sinoconodon, were carnivores that fed on vertebrate prey, while still others were herbivores or omnivores).Kielan- Jaworowska et al. (2004), p.5 As a result: *The therapsid trend towards differentiated teeth with precise occlusion accelerated, because of the need to hold captured arthropods and crush their exoskeletons. *As the body length of the mammals' ancestors fell below 50 mm (2 inches), advances in thermal insulation and temperature regulation would have become necessary for nocturnal life. *Acute senses of hearing and smell became vital. This accelerated the development of the mammalian middle ear. The increase in the size of the olfactory lobes of the brain increased brain weight as a percentage of total body weight. Brain tissue requires a disproportionate amount of energy. The need for more food to support the enlarged brains increased the pressures for improvements in insulation, temperature regulation and feeding. *Probably as a side-effect of the nocturnal life, mammals lost two of the four cone opsins, photoreceptors in the retina, present in the eyes of the earliest amniotes. Paradoxically, this might have improved their ability to discriminate colors in dim light. This retreat to a nocturnal role is called a nocturnal bottleneck, and is thought to explain many of the features of mammals. From cynodonts to crown mammals =Fossil record= Mesozoic synapsids that had evolved to the point of having a jaw joint composed of the dentary and squamosal bones are preserved in few good fossils, mainly because they were mostly smaller than rats: *They were largely restricted to environments that are less likely to provide good fossils. Floodplains as the best terrestrial environments for fossilization provide few mammal fossils, because they are dominated by medium to large animals, and the mammals could not compete with archosaurs in the medium to large size range. Tracks from the Early Cretaceous of Angola show the existence of raccoon-size mammals 118 Million years ago. *Their delicate bones were vulnerable to being destroyed before they could be fossilized — by scavengers (including fungi and bacteria) and by being trodden on. *Small fossils are harder to spot and more vulnerable to being destroyed by weathering and other natural stresses before they are discovered. In the past years, however, the number of Mesozoic fossil mammals has increased decisively; only 116 genera were known in 1979, for example, but about 310 in 2007, with an increase in quality such that \\"at least 18 Mesozoic mammals are represented by nearly complete skeletons\\". =Mammals or mammaliaforms= Some writers restrict the term \\"mammal\\" to the crown group mammals, the group consisting of the most recent common ancestor of the monotremes, marsupials, and placentals, together with all the descendants of that ancestor. In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe advocated this restriction, arguing that \\"ancestry... provides the only means of properly defining taxa\\" and, in particular, that the divergence of the monotremes from the animals more closely related to marsupials and placentals \\"is of central interest to any study of Mammalia as a whole.\\" To accommodate some related taxa falling outside the crown group, he defined the Mammaliaformes as comprising \\"the last common ancestor of Morganucodontidae and Mammalia [as he had defined the latter term] and all its descendants.\\" Besides Morganucodontidae, the newly defined taxon includes Docodonta and Kuehneotheriidae. Though haramiyids have been referred to the mammals since the 1860s, Rowe excluded them from the Mammaliaformes as falling outside his definition, putting them in a larger clade, the Mammaliamorpha. Some writers have adopted this terminology noting, to avoid misunderstanding, that they have done so. Most paleontologists, however, still think that animals with the dentary-squamosal jaw joint and the sort of molars characteristic of modern mammals should formally be members of Mammalia. Where the ambiguity in the term \\"mammal\\" may be confusing, this article uses \\"mammaliaform\\" and \\"crown mammal\\". =Family tree – cynodonts to crown group mammals= (based on Cynodontia:Dendrogram – Palaeos) Morganucodontidae and other transitional forms had both types of jaw joint: dentary-squamosal (front) and articular- quadrate (rear). =Morganucodontidae= The Morganucodontidae first appeared in the late Triassic, about 205M years ago. They are an excellent example of transitional fossils, since they have both the dentary-squamosal and articular-quadrate jaw joints. They were also one of the first discovered and most thoroughly studied of the mammaliaforms outside of the crown-group mammals, since an unusually large number of morganucodont fossils have been found. =Docodonts= Reconstruction of Castorocauda. Note the fur and the adaptations for swimming (broad, flat tail; webbed feet) and for digging (robust limbs and claws). Docodonts, among the most common Jurassic mammaliaforms, are noted for the sophistication of their molars. They are thought to have had general semi-aquatic tendencies, with the fish-eating Castorocauda (\\"beaver tail\\"), which lived in the mid-Jurassic about 164M years ago and was first discovered in 2004 and described in 2006, being the most well-understood example. Castorocauda was not a crown group mammal, but it is extremely important in the study of the evolution of mammals because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology) and it breaks the \\"small nocturnal insectivore\\" stereotype: See also the news item at *It was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils — about from its nose to the tip of its tail, and may have weighed . *It provides the earliest absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Previously the earliest was Eomaia, a crown group mammal from about 125M years ago. *It had aquatic adaptations including flattened tail bones and remnants of soft tissue between the toes of the back feet, suggesting that they were webbed. Previously the earliest known semi-aquatic mammaliaforms were from the Eocene, about 110M years later. *Castorocauda's powerful forelimbs look adapted for digging. This feature and the spurs on its ankles make it resemble the platypus, which also swims and digs. *Its teeth look adapted for eating fish: the first two molars had cusps in a straight row, which made them more suitable for gripping and slicing than for grinding; and these molars are curved backwards, to help in grasping slippery prey. =Hadrocodium= The family tree above shows Hadrocodium as an \\"aunt\\" of crown mammals. This mammaliaform, dated about 195M years ago in the very early Jurassic, exhibits some important features: *The jaw joint consists only of the squamosal and dentary bones, and the jaw contains no smaller bones to the rear of the dentary, unlike the therapsid design. *In therapsids and early mammaliaforms the eardrum may have stretched over a trough at the rear of the lower jaw. But Hadrocodium had no such trough, which suggests its ear was part of the cranium, as it is in crown- group mammals — and hence that the former articular and quadrate had migrated to the middle ear and become the malleus and incus. On the other hand, the dentary has a \\"bay\\" at the rear that mammals lack. This suggests that Hadrocodium's dentary bone retained the same shape that it would have had if the articular and quadrate had remained part of the jaw joint, and therefore that Hadrocodium or a very close ancestor may have been the first to have a fully mammalian middle ear. *Therapsids and earlier mammaliaforms had their jaw joints very far back in the skull, partly because the ear was at the rear end of the jaw but also had to be close to the brain. This arrangement limited the size of the braincase, because it forced the jaw muscles to run round and over it. Hadrocodium's braincase and jaws were no longer bound to each other by the need to support the ear, and its jaw joint was further forward. In its descendants or those of animals with a similar arrangement, the brain case was free to expand without being constrained by the jaw and the jaw was free to change without being constrained by the need to keep the ear near the brain — in other words it now became possible for mammaliaforms both to develop large brains and to adapt their jaws and teeth in ways that were purely specialized for eating. Earliest crown mammals The crown group mammals, sometimes called 'true mammals', are the extant mammals and their relatives back to their last common ancestor. Since this group has living members, DNA analysis can be applied in an attempt to explain the evolution of features that do not appear in fossils. This endeavor often involves molecular phylogenetics, a technique that has become popular since the mid-1980s. =Family tree of early crown mammals= Cladogram after Z.-X Luo. († marks extinct groups) =Color vision= Early amniotes had four opsins in the cones of their retinas to use for distinguishing colours: one sensitive to red, one to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue. The green opsin was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the red one. Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the red one and both of the blues. All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not always the same one: monotremes retain one blue-sensitive opsin, while marsupials and placentals retain the other (except cetaceans, which later lost the other blue opsin as well). Some placentals and marsupials, including higher primates, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is trichromatic. =Australosphenida and Ausktribosphenidae= Ausktribosphenidae is a group name that has been given to some rather puzzling finds that: *appear to have tribosphenic molars, a type of tooth that is otherwise known only in placentals and marsupials. *come from mid-Cretaceous deposits in Australia — but Australia was connected only to Antarctica, and placentals originated in the Northern Hemisphere and were confined to it until continental drift formed land connections from North America to South America, from Asia to Africa and from Asia to India (the late Cretaceous map here shows how the southern continents are separated). *are represented only by teeth and jaw fragments, which is not very helpful. Australosphenida is a group that has been defined in order to include the Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes. Asfaltomylos (mid- to late Jurassic, from Patagonia) has been interpreted as a basal australosphenid (animal that has features shared with both Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes; lacks features that are peculiar to Ausktribosphenidae or monotremes; also lacks features that are absent in Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes) and as showing that australosphenids were widespread throughout Gondwanaland (the old Southern Hemisphere super-continent). Recent analysis of Teinolophos, which lived somewhere between 121 and 112.5 million years ago, suggests that it was a \\"crown group\\" (advanced and relatively specialised) monotreme. This was taken as evidence that the basal (most primitive) monotremes must have appeared considerably earlier, but this has been disputed (see the following section). The study also indicated that some alleged Australosphenids were also \\"crown group\\" monotremes (e.g. Steropodon) and that other alleged Australosphenids (e.g. Ausktribosphenos, Bishops, Ambondro, Asfaltomylos) are more closely related to and possibly members of the Therian mammals (group that includes marsupials and placentals, see below). =Monotremes= Teinolophos, from Australia, is the earliest known monotreme. A 2007 study (published 2008) suggests that it was not a basal (primitive, ancestral) monotreme but a full- fledged platypus, and therefore that the platypus and echidna lineages diverged considerably earlier. A more recent study (2009), however, has suggested that, while Teinolophos was a type of platypus, it was also a basal monotreme and predated the radiation of modern monotremes. The semi-aquatic lifestyle of platypuses prevented them from being outcompeted by the marsupials that migrated to Australia millions of years ago, since joeys need to remain attached to their mothers and would drown if their mothers ventured into water (though there are exceptions like the water opossum and the lutrine opossum; however, they both live in South America and thus don't come into contact with monotremes). Genetic evidence has determined that echidnas diverged from the platypus lineage as recently as 19-48M, when they made their transition from semi-aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle. Monotremes have some features that may be inherited from the cynodont ancestors: *like lizards and birds, they use the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (\\"monotreme\\" means \\"one hole\\"). *they lay eggs that are leathery and uncalcified, like those of lizards, turtles and crocodilians. Unlike other mammals, female monotremes do not have nipples and feed their young by \\"sweating\\" milk from patches on their bellies. These features are not visible in fossils, and the main characteristics from paleontologists' point of view are: *a slender dentary bone in which the coronoid process is small or non- existent. *the external opening of the ear lies at the posterior base of the jaw. *the jugal bone is small or non-existent. *a primitive pectoral girdle with strong ventral elements: coracoids, clavicles and interclavicle. Note: therian mammals have no interclavicle. *sprawling or semi-sprawling forelimbs. =Multituberculates= Skull of the multituberculate Ptilodus Multituberculates (named for the multiple tubercles on their \\"molars\\") are often called the \\"rodents of the Mesozoic\\", but this is an example of convergent evolution rather than meaning that they are closely related to the Rodentia. They existed for approximately 120 million years--the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage--but were eventually outcompeted by rodents, becoming extinct during the early Oligocene. Some authors have challenged the phylogeny represented by the cladogram above. They exclude the multituberculates from the mammalian crown group, holding that multituberculates are more distantly related to extant mammals than even the Morganucodontidae. Multituberculates are like undisputed crown mammals in that their jaw joints consist of only the dentary and squamosal bones-whereas the quadrate and articular bones are part of the middle ear; their teeth are differentiated, occlude, and have mammal-like cusps; they have a zygomatic arch; and the structure of the pelvis suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young, like modern marsupials.Kielan-Jaworowska et al. (2004), p. 299 On the other hand, they differ from modern mammals: *Their \\"molars\\" have two parallel rows of tubercles, unlike the tribosphenic (three-peaked) molars of uncontested early crown mammals. *The chewing action differs in that undisputed crown mammals chew with a side-to-side grinding action, which means that the molars usually occlude on only one side at a time, while multituberculates' jaws were incapable of side-to-side movement—they chewed, rather, by dragging the lower teeth backwards against the upper ones as the jaw closed. *The anterior (forward) part of the zygomatic arch mostly consists of the maxilla (upper jawbone) rather than the jugal, a small bone in a little slot in the maxillary process (extension). *The squamosal does not form part of the braincase. *The rostrum (snout) is unlike that of undisputed crown mammals; in fact it looks more like that of a pelycosaur, such as Dimetrodon. The multituberculate rostrum is box-like, with the large flat maxillae forming the sides, the nasal the top, and the tall premaxilla at the front. =Theria= Therian form of crurotarsal ankle. Adapted with permission from Palaeos Theria (\\"beasts\\") is the clade originating with the last common ancestor of the Eutheria (including placentals) and Metatheria (including marsupials). Common features include: *no interclavicle. *coracoid bones non- existent or fused with the shoulder blades to form coracoid processes. *a type of crurotarsal ankle joint in which: the main joint is between the tibia and astragalus; the calcaneum has no contact with the tibia but forms a heel to which muscles can attach. (The other well-known type of crurotarsal ankle is seen in crocodilians and works differently — most of the bending at the ankle is between the calcaneum and astragalus). *tribosphenic molars. =Metatheria= The living Metatheria are all marsupials (animals with pouches). A few fossil genera, such as the Mongolian late Cretaceous Asiatherium, may be marsupials or members of some other metatherian group(s). The oldest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125M-year-old early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues. Didelphimorphia (common opossums of the Western Hemisphere) first appeared in the late Cretaceous and still have living representatives, probably because they are mostly semi-arboreal unspecialized omnivores. The best-known feature of marsupials is their method of reproduction: *The mother develops a kind of yolk sack in her womb that delivers nutrients to the embryo. Embryos of bandicoots, koalas and wombats additionally form placenta-like organs that connect them to the uterine wall, although the placenta-like organs are smaller than in placental mammals and it is not certain that they transfer nutrients from the mother to the embryo. *Pregnancy is very short, typically four to five weeks. The embryo is born at a very early stage of development, and is usually less than long at birth. It has been suggested that the short pregnancy is necessary to reduce the risk that the mother's immune system will attack the embryo. *The newborn marsupial uses its forelimbs (with relatively strong hands) to climb to a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly. The mother feeds the baby by contracting muscles over her mammary glands, as the baby is too weak to suck. The newborn marsupial's need to use its forelimbs in climbing to the nipple was historically thought to have restricted metatherian evolution, as it was assumed that the forelimb couldn't become specialised intro structures like wings, hooves or flippers. However, several bandicoots, most notably the pig-footed bandicoot, have true hooves similar to those of placental ungulates, and several marsupial gliders have evolved. Skull of thylacine, showing marsupial pattern of molars Although some marsupials look very like some placentals (the thylacine, \\"marsupial tiger\\" or \\"marsupial wolf\\" is a good example), marsupial skeletons have some features that distinguish them from placentals: *Some, including the thylacine, have four molars; whereas no known placental has more than three. *All have a pair of palatal fenestrae, window-like openings on the bottom of the skull (in addition to the smaller nostril openings). Marsupials also have a pair of marsupial bones (sometimes called \\"epipubic bones\\"), which support the pouch in females. But these are not unique to marsupials, since they have been found in fossils of multituberculates, monotremes, and even eutherians — so they are probably a common ancestral feature that disappeared at some point after the ancestry of living placental mammals diverged from that of marsupials. Some researchers think the epipubic bones' original function was to assist locomotion by supporting some of the muscles that pull the thigh forwards. =Eutheria= The time of appearance of the earliest eutherians has been a matter of controversy. On one hand, recently discovered fossils of Juramaia have been dated to 160 million years ago and classified as eutherian. Fossils of Eomaia from 125 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous have also been classified as eutherian. A recent analysis of phenomic characters, however, classified Eomaia as pre-eutherian and reported that the earliest clearly eutherian specimens came from Maelestes, dated to 91 million years ago. That study also reported that eutherians did not significantly diversify until after the catastrophic extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, about 66 million years ago. Eomaia was found to have some features that are more like those of marsupials and earlier metatherians: Fossil of Eomaia in the Hong Kong Science Museum. *Epipubic bones extending forwards from the pelvis, which are not found in any modern placental, but are found in all other mammals — early mammaliaforms, non-placental eutherians, marsupials, and monotremes — as well as in the cynodont therapsids that are closest to mammals. Their function is to stiffen the body during locomotion. This stiffening would be harmful in pregnant placentals, whose abdomens need to expand. *A narrow pelvic outlet, which indicates that the young were very small at birth and therefore pregnancy was short, as in modern marsupials. This suggests that the placenta was a later development. *Five incisors in each side of the upper jaw. This number is typical of metatherians, and the maximum number in modern placentals is three, except for homodonts, such as the armadillo. But Eomaia's molar to premolar ratio (it has more pre-molars than molars) is typical of eutherians, including placentals, and not normal in marsupials. Eomaia also has a Meckelian groove, a primitive feature of the lower jaw that is not found in modern placental mammals. These intermediate features are consistent with molecular phylogenetics estimates that the placentals diversified about 110M years ago, 15M years after the date of the Eomaia fossil. Eomaia also has many features that strongly suggest it was a climber, including several features of the feet and toes; well-developed attachment points for muscles that are used a lot in climbing; and a tail that is twice as long as the rest of the spine. Placentals' best-known feature is their method of reproduction: *The embryo attaches itself to the uterus via a large placenta via which the mother supplies food and oxygen and removes waste products. *Pregnancy is relatively long and the young are fairly well- developed at birth. In some species (especially herbivores living on plains) the young can walk and even run within an hour of birth. It has been suggested that the evolution of placental reproduction was made possible by retroviruses that: *make the interface between the placenta and uterus into a syncytium, i.e. a thin layer of cells with a shared external membrane. This allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products, but prevents the passage of blood and other cells that would cause the mother's immune system to attack the fetus. *reduce the aggressiveness of the mother's immune system, which is good for the foetus but makes the mother more vulnerable to infections. From a paleontologist's point of view, eutherians are mainly distinguished by various features of their teeth, ankles and feet. Expansion of ecological niches in the Mesozoic Restoration of Volaticotherium, a Middle Jurassic eutriconodont and the earliest known gliding mammal.Skull cast of Late Cretaceous Didelphodon, showing its robust teeth adapted to a durophagous diet. Generally speaking, most species of mammaliaforms did occupy the niche of small, nocturnal insectivores, but recent finds, mainly in China, show that some species and especially crown group mammals were larger and that there was a larger variety of lifestyles than previously thought. For example: * Adalatherium hui is a large sized, erect limbed herbivore from the Cretaceous of Madagascar. *Castorocauda, a member of Docodonta which lived in the middle Jurassic about 164 million years, was about long, weighed , had a beaver-like tail that was adapted for swimming, limbs adapted for swimming and digging, and teeth adapted for eating fish. Another docodont, Haldanodon, also had semi-aquatic habits, and indeed aquatic tendencies were probably common among docodonts based on their prevalence in wetland environments.Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: Bulletin 36 The eutriconodonts Liaoconodon and Yanoconodon have more recently also have been suggested to be freshwater swimmers, lacking Castorocauda's powerful tail but possessing paddle-like limbs; the eutriconodont Astroconodon has similarly been suggested as being semi-aquatic in the past, albeit to less convincing evidence. *Multituberculates are allotherians that survived for over 125 million years (from mid-Jurassic, about 160M years ago, to late Eocene, about 35M years ago) are often called the \\"rodents of the Mesozoic\\". As noted above, they may have given birth to tiny live neonates rather than laying eggs. *Fruitafossor, from the late Jurassic period about 150 million years ago, was about the size of a chipmunk and its teeth, forelimbs and back suggest that it broke open the nest of social insects to prey on them (probably termites, as ants had not yet appeared). *Similarly, the gobiconodontid Spinolestes possessed adaptations for fossoriality and convergent traits with placental xenarthrans like scutes and xenarthrous vertebrae, so it too might have had anteater like habits. It is also notable for the presence of quills akin to those of modern spiny mice. *Volaticotherium, from the boundary the early Cretaceous about 125M years ago, is the earliest-known gliding mammal and had a gliding membrane that stretched out between its limbs, rather like that of a modern flying squirrel. This also suggests it was active mainly during the day. The closely related Argentoconodon also shows similar adaptations that may also suggest aerial locomotion. *Repenomamus, a eutriconodont from the early Cretaceous 130 million years ago, was a stocky, badger-like predator that sometimes preyed on young dinosaurs. Two species have been recognized, one more than long and weighing about , the other less than long and weighing . abstract, in English * Schowalteria is a Late Cretaceous species almost as large if not larger than R. giganticus that shows speciations towards herbivory, comparable to those of modern ungulates. * Zhelestidae is a lineage of Late Cretaceous herbivorous eutherians, to the point of being mistaken for stem-ungulates.Michael J. Benton,Mikhail A. Shishkin,David M. Unwin, The Age of Dinosaurs in Russia and Mongolia * Similarly, mesungulatids are also fairly large sized herbivorous mammals from the Late Cretaceous * Deltatheroidans were metatherians that were specialised towards carnivorous habits,CHRISTIAN DE MUIZON and BRIGITTE LANGE-BADRÉ, Carnivorous dental adaptations in tribosphenic mammals and phylogenetic reconstruction, Article first published online: 29 MAR 2007 and possible forms like Oxlestes and Khudulestes might have been among the largest Mesozoic mammals, though their status as deltatheroidans is questionable. *Ichthyoconodon, a eutriconodont from the Berriasian of Morocco, is currently known from molariforms found in marine deposits. These teeth are sharp-cusped and similar in shape to those of piscivorous mammals, and unlike the teeth of contemporary mammals they do not show degradation, so rather than being carried down by river deposits the animal died in situ or close. This has been taken to mean that it was a marine mammal, likely one of the few examples known from the Mesozoic. Alternatively, its close relations to Volaticotherium and Argentoconodon might suggest that it was a flying mammal. *Didelphodon is a Late Cretaceous riverine species of stagodontid marsupialiform with a durophagous dentition, robust jaws similar to a modern Tasmanian devil, and a postcranial skeleton very similar in size and shape to an otter. This animal has been lauded as the strongest bite of all Mesozoic mammals. It possibly specialized on eating freshwater crabs and molluscs. * Tracks of a raccoon-sized mammaliaform representing the morphofamily Ameghinichnidae are described from the Early Cretaceous (late Aptian) Calonda Formation (Angola) by Mateus et al. (2017), who name a new ichnotaxon Catocapes angolanus. Evolution of major groups of living mammals There are currently vigorous debates between traditional paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists about how and when the modern groups of mammals diversified, especially the placentals. Generally, the traditional paleontologists date the appearance of a particular group by the earliest known fossil whose features make it likely to be a member of that group, while the molecular phylogeneticists suggest that each lineage diverged earlier (usually in the Cretaceous) and that the earliest members of each group were anatomically very similar to early members of other groups and differed only in their genetics. These debates extend to the definition of and relationships between the major groups of placentals. =Molecular phylogenetics-based family tree of placental mammals= Molecular phylogenetics uses features of organisms' genes to work out family trees in much the same way as paleontologists do with features of fossils — if two organisms' genes are more similar to each other than to those of a third organism, the two organisms are more closely related to each other than to the third. Molecular phylogeneticists have proposed a family tree that is both broadly similar to but has notable differences from that of the paleontologists. Like paleontologists, molecular phylogeneticists have differing ideas about various details, but here is a typical family tree according to molecular phylogenetics: (pdf version) Note that the diagram shown here omits extinct groups, as one cannot extract DNA from fossils. Here are the most significant of the differences between this family tree and the one familiar to paleontologists: *The top-level division is between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria, instead of between Xenarthra and the rest. However, analysis of transposable element insertions supports a three-way top- level split between Xenarthra, Afrotheria and Boreoeutheria and the Atlantogenata clade does not receive significant support in recent distance- based molecular phylogenetics. *Afrotheria contains several groups that are only distantly related according to the paleontologists' version: Afroinsectiphilia (\\"African insectivores\\"), Tubulidentata (aardvarks, which paleontologists regard as much closer to odd-toed ungulates than to other members of Afrotheria), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews, usually regarded as close to rabbits and rodents). The only members of Afrotheria that paleontologists would regard as closely related are Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (manatees, dugongs). *Insectivores are split into three groups: one is part of Afrotheria and the other two are distinct sub-groups within Boreoeutheria. *Bats are closer to Carnivora and odd-toed ungulates than to Primates and Dermoptera (colugos). *Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) are closer to Carnivora and bats than to Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). The grouping together of the Afrotheria has some geological justification. All surviving members of the Afrotheria originate from South American or (mainly) African lineages — even the Indian elephant, which diverged from an African lineage about . As Pangaea broke up, Africa and South America separated from the other continents less than 150M years ago, and from each other between 100M and 80M years ago.Historical perspective (the Dynamic Earth, USGS)Cretaceous map So it would not be surprising if the earliest eutherian immigrants into Africa and South America were isolated there and radiated into all the available ecological niches. Nevertheless, these proposals have been controversial. Paleontologists naturally insist that fossil evidence must take priority over deductions from samples of the DNA of modern animals. More surprisingly, these new family trees have been criticised by other molecular phylogeneticists, sometimes quite harshly:Insectivora Overview – Palaeos *Mitochondrial DNA's mutation rate in mammals varies from region to region — some parts hardly ever change and some change extremely quickly and even show large variations between individuals within the same species. *Mammalian mitochondrial DNA mutates so fast that it causes a problem called \\"saturation\\", where random noise drowns out any information that may be present. If a particular piece of mitochondrial DNA mutates randomly every few million years, it will have changed several times in the 60 to 75M years since the major groups of placental mammals diverged. =Timing of placental evolution= Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged late in the Cretaceous period, about 100 to 85 million years ago, but that modern families first appeared later, in the late Eocene and early Miocene epochs of the Cenozoic period. Fossil-based analyses, on the contrary, limit the placentals to the Cenozoic. Many Cretaceous fossil sites contain well-preserved lizards, salamanders, birds, and mammals, but not the modern forms of mammals. It is likely that they simply did not exist, and that the molecular clock runs fast during major evolutionary radiations. On the other hand, there is fossil evidence from of hoofed mammals that may be ancestors of modern ungulates. Fossils of the earliest members of most modern groups date from the Paleocene, a few date from later and very few from the Cretaceous, before the extinction of the dinosaurs. But some paleontologists, influenced by molecular phylogenetic studies, have used statistical methods to extrapolate backwards from fossils of members of modern groups and concluded that primates arose in the late Cretaceous. — a similar paper by these authors is free online at New light on the dates of primate origins and divergence However, statistical studies of the fossil record confirm that mammals were restricted in size and diversity right to the end of the Cretaceous, and rapidly grew in size and diversity during the Early Paleocene. Evolution of mammalian features =Jaws and middle ears= Hadrocodium, whose fossils date from the early Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of fully mammalian jaw joints and middle ears, in which the jaw joint is formed by the dentary and squamosal bones while the articular and quadrate move to the middle ear, where they are known as the incus and malleus. One analysis of the monotreme Teinolophos suggested that this animal had a pre-mammalian jaw joint formed by the angular and quadrate bones and that the definitive mammalian middle ear evolved twice independently, in monotremes and in therian mammals, but this idea has been disputed. For other opinions see \\"Technical comments\\" linked from same Web page In fact, two of the suggestion's authors co-authored a later paper that reinterpreted the same features as evidence that Teinolophos was a full-fledged platypus, which means it would have had a mammalian jaw joint and middle ear. =Lactation= It has been suggested that lactation's original function was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals): Lactating on Eggs *While the amniote egg is usually described as able to evolve away from water, most reptile eggs actually need moisture if they are not to dry out. *Monotremes do not have nipples, but secrete milk from a hairy patch on their bellies. *During incubation, monotreme eggs are covered in a sticky substance whose origin is not known. Before the eggs are laid, their shells have only three layers. Afterwards, a fourth layer appears with a composition different from that of the original three. The sticky substance and the fourth layer may be produced by the mammary glands. *If so, that may explain why the patches from which monotremes secrete milk are hairy. It is easier to spread moisture and other substances over the egg from a broad, hairy area than from a small, bare nipple. Later research demonstrated that caseins already appeared in the common mammalian ancestor approximately 200-310 million years ago. The question of whether secretions of a substance to keep eggs moist translated into actual lactation in therapsids is open. A small mammaliomorph called Sinocodon, generally assumed to be the sister group of all later mammals, had front teeth in even the smallest individuals. Combined with a poorly ossified jaw, they very probably did not suckle.Crompton, Alfred W.; Luo, Zhexi (1993). Mammal Phylogeny. New York, NY: Springer New York. pp. 30–44. doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-7381-4_4. . Thus suckling may have evolved right at the pre-mammal/mammal transition. However, tritylodontids, generally assumed to be more basal, show evidence of suckling. Morganucodontans, also assumed to be basal Mammaliaformes, also show evidence of lactation. =Digestive system= The evolution of the digestive system has formed a significant influence in mammal evolution. With the emergence of mammals, the digestive system was modified in a variety of ways depending on the animal's diet. For example, cats and most carnivores have simple large intestines, while the horse as a herbivore has a voluminous large intestine. An ancestral feature of ruminants is their multi-chambered (usually four-chambered) stomach, which evolved about 50 million years ago. Along with morphology of the gut, gastric acidity has been proposed as a key factor shaping the diversity and composition of microbial communities found in the vertebrate gut. Comparisons of stomach acidity across trophic groups in mammal and bird taxa show that scavengers and carnivores have significantly higher stomach acidities compared to herbivores or carnivores feeding on phylogenetically distant prey such as insects or fish. Despite the lack of fossilization of the gut, microbial evolution of the gut can be inferred from the interrelationships of existing animals, microbes and probable foodstuffs. Mammals are metagenomic, in that they are composed of not only their own genes, but also those of all of their associated microbes. Gut microbiota has co-diversified as mammalian species have evolved. Recent studies indicate that adaptive divergence between mammalian species is shaped in part by changes in the gut microbiota. The house mouse may have evolved not only with, but also in response to, the unique bacteria inhabiting its gut. =Hair and fur= The first clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164M years ago in the mid-Jurassic. As both mammals Megaconus and Castorocauda have a double coat of hair, with both guard hairs and an undercoat, it may be assumed that their last common ancestor did as well. This animal must have been Triassic as it was an ancestor of the Triassic Tikitherium. More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites pushes back the origin of mammalian hair much further back in the synapsid line to Paleozoic therapsids.P Bajdek, Microbiota and food residues including possible evidence of pre‐mammalian hair in Upper Permian coprolites from Russia, G. 2015, In the mid-1950s, some scientists interpreted the foramina (passages) in the maxillae (upper jaws) and premaxillae (small bones in front of the maxillae) of cynodonts as channels that supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and suggested that this was evidence of hair or fur. It was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae; the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the non-mammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. A trace fossil from the Lower Triassic had been erroneously regarded as a cynodont footprint showing hair, but this interpretation has been refuted.Olsen, Paul E. (2012): Cynodontipus: A procolophonid burrow – not a hairy cynodont track (Middle-Late Triassic: Europe, Morocco, Eastern North America) . Program for Northeastern Section – 47th Annual Meeting (18–20 March 2012) Hartford, Connecticut, the Geological society of America A study of cranial openings for facial nerves connected whiskers in extant mammals indicate the Prozostrodontia, small immediate ancestors of mammals, presented whiskers similar to mammals, but that less advanced therapsids would either have immobile whiskers or no whisker at all. Fur may have evolved from whiskers. Whiskers themselves may have evolved as a response to nocturnal and/or burrowing lifestyle. Ruben & Jones (2000) note that the Harderian glands, which secrete lipids for coating the fur, were present in the earliest mammals like Morganucodon, but were absent in near- mammalian therapsids like Thrinaxodon. The Msx2 gene associated with hair follicle maintenance is also linked to the closure of the parietal eye in mammals, indicating that fur and lack of pineal eye is linked. The pineal eye is present in Thrinaxodon, but absent in more advanced cynognaths (the Probainognathia). Insulation is the \\"cheapest\\" way to maintain a fairly constant body temperature, without consuming energy to produce more body heat. Therefore, the possession of hair or fur would be good evidence of homeothermy, but would not be such strong evidence of a high metabolic rate. =Erect limbs= Understanding of the evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete -- living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. Some scientists think that the parasagittal (non-sprawling) limb posture is limited to the Boreosphenida, a group that contains the therians but not, for example, the multituberculates. In particular, they attribute a parasagittal stance to the therians Sinodelphys and Eomaia, which means that the stance had arisen by 125 million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous. However, they also discuss that earlier mammals had more erect forelimbs as opposed to the more sprawling hindlimbs, a trend still continued to some extent in modern placentals and marsupials. =Warm-bloodedness= \\"Warm-bloodedness\\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of the following: *Endothermy, the ability to generate heat internally rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. *Homeothermy, maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Most enzymes have an optimum operating temperature; efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range. A homeothermic organism needs only to possess enzymes that function well in a small range of temperatures. *Tachymetabolism, maintaining a high metabolic rate, particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature because of the Q10 effect: biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10 °C. Since scientists cannot know much about the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism. However, it is generally agreed that endothermy first evolved in non-mammalian synapsids such as dicynodonts, which possess body proportions associated with heat retention,Bakker 1975 high vascularised bones with Haversian canals,JENNIFER BOTHA-BRINK and KENNETH D. ANGIELCZYK, Do extraordinarily high growth rates in Permo-Triassic dicynodonts (Therapsida, Anomodontia) explain their success before and after the end- Permian extinction?, Version of Record online: 26 JUL 2010 and possibly hair.Microbiota and food residues including possible evidence of pre-mammalian hair in Upper Permian coprolites from Russia Piotr Bajdek1, Martin Qvarnström2, Krzysztof Owocki3, Tomasz Sulej3, Andrey G. Sennikov4,5, Valeriy K. Golubev4,5 andGrzegorz Niedźwiedzki2 Article first published online: 25 NOV 2015 More recently, it has been suggested that endothermy evolved as far back as Ophiacodon. Modern monotremes have a low body temperature compared to marsupials and placental mammals, around . Phylogenetic bracketing suggests that the body temperatures of early crown-group mammals were not less than that of extant monotremes. There is cytological evidence that the low metabolism of monotremes is a secondarily evolved trait. Respiratory turbinates Modern mammals have respiratory turbinates, convoluted structures of thin bone in the nasal cavity. These are lined with mucous membranes that warm and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air. An animal with respiratory turbinates can maintain a high rate of breathing without the danger of drying its lungs out, and therefore may have a fast metabolism. Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates. Bony secondary palate Mammals have a secondary bony palate, which separates the respiratory passage from the mouth, allowing them to eat and breathe at the same time. Secondary bony palates have been found in the more advanced cynodonts and have been used as evidence of high metabolic rates. But some cold-blooded vertebrates have secondary bony palates (crocodilians and some lizards), while birds, which are warm-blooded, do not. Diaphragm A muscular diaphragm helps mammals to breathe, especially during strenuous activity. For a diaphragm to work, the ribs must not restrict the abdomen, so that expansion of the chest can be compensated for by reduction in the volume of the abdomen and vice versa. Diaphragms are known in caseid pelycosaurs, indicating an early origin within synapsids, though they were still fairly inefficient and likely required support from other muscle groups and limb motion.Markus Lambertz et al, A caseian point for the evolution of a diaphragm homologue among the earliest synapsids, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (2016). The advanced cynodonts have very mammal-like rib cages, with greatly reduced lumbar ribs. This suggests that these animals had more developed diaphragms, were capable of strenuous activity for fairly long periods and therefore had high metabolic rates. On the other hand, these mammal-like rib cages may have evolved to increase agility. However, the movement of even advanced therapsids was \\"like a wheelbarrow\\", with the hindlimbs providing all the thrust while the forelimbs only steered the animal, in other words advanced therapsids were not as agile as either modern mammals or the early dinosaurs. So the idea that the main function of these mammal-like rib cages was to increase agility is doubtful. Limb posture The therapsids had sprawling forelimbs and semi-erect hindlimbs. This suggests that Carrier's constraint would have made it rather difficult for them to move and breathe at the same time, but not as difficult as it is for animals such as lizards, which have completely sprawling limbs. Advanced therapsids may therefore have been significantly less active than modern mammals of similar size and so may have had slower metabolisms overall or else been bradymetabolic (lower metabolism when at rest). =Brain= Mammals are noted for their large brain size relative to body size, compared to other animal groups. Recent findings suggest that the first brain area to expand was that involved in smell. Scientists scanned the skulls of early mammal species dating back to 190–200 million years ago and compared the brain case shapes to earlier pre-mammal species; they found that the brain area involved in the sense of smell was the first to enlarge. This change may have allowed these early mammals to hunt insects at night when dinosaurs were not active.

NM705i/706i The FOMA NM705i is the NTT DoCoMo version of the 6120 classic released March 2008. The phone lacks the ability to install native applications, and also lacks HSDPA and an email client. NM705i has i-mode software (i-mode browser, i-mode mail, i-appli) instead of MIDP applications, MMS, and the Nokia web browser. Available colors are Black, White, and Orange (NM705i original). Later, August of same year, introduced FOMA NM706i carries a same exterior design as the 6124 classic and NM705i specifications. Available Black color is same as NM705i, but Red and Silver color is newly available instead of Orange and White. Features The American 6120 classic has UMTS 850/2100 MHz with HSDPA while the 6121 classic has UMTS 900/2100 MHz with HSDPA. Both models support quad band GSM. On a network supporting HSDPA 3 Mbit/s download rate is possible on this phone. The NM705i has FOMA 800/850 MHz, 2 GHz connectivity. All models feature a secondary front mounted camera for video phone calls. The resolution of the camera is only 320x240, since the video calls are only shown on other handsets screens. The front camera can also be used to take self-portraits. The regular camera is a 2-megapixel camera with 4x digital zoom, but no autofocus. Nokia has begun to move away from the traditional proprietary Pop-Port. The phone features a standard Mini USB connector which does not charge the battery. When a USB cable is connected, the phone asks what type of connection it should make, with the choice of media player, PC-suite or Data transfer. The data transfer mode allows the phone to function as a mass storage device making a card reader (to access the phone's microSD card) unnecessary. The base of the phone also features a 4-part 2.5 mm socket for the supplied headset. When the supplied 4-part 2.5 mm headset is plugged in, it can function as an antenna for the stereo FM radio that also has support for Visual Radio. It is possible to connect a 3-part 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapter to use with standard headphones, however as normal headphones do not have a microphone, this feature may be best suited for media viewing/listening only. The audio player supports MP3, M4A, eAAC+ and WMA formats. iTunes protected audio is not compatible, however iTunes Plus music can be played on the phone. The phone is capable of Video recording-QVGA with the resolution of 320x240 @15fps the front camera can also be used but only with a resolution of 176x144.

Granata (December 29, 1961 – April 16, 2007) was an American professor in multiple departments including the Departments of Engineering, Science and Mechanics (in which he was tenured) and Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), in Blacksburg, Virginia. Granata held an additional academic appointment as a professor in the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest School of Biomedical Engineering and was an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery. During the Virginia Tech shooting, he shepherded students into his office in order to safeguard them. He was then killed by Seung-Hui Cho after he went to investigate and intervene. Education and career St. Francis de Sales High School campus, planted in memory of Granata, who was a graduate of the school. A native of Toledo, Ohio, Granata attended St. Francis de Sales High School in Toledo, where he played football and served on the debate team for four years, graduating in 1980 with a 4.0 GPA. Granata was awarded a bachelor's degree in engineering physics & electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1984, a master's degree in physics from Purdue University in 1986, and a doctorate in biomechanics from Ohio State in 1993. He began his bachelor's degree in physics at John Carroll University in Cleveland, where he also played football, before transferring to Ohio State to finish the degree. After earning his master's degree from Purdue, Granata worked for three years as a research scientist in the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University. While there, he was contracted by the military and conducted research for the US Navy. Granata stayed at Ohio State for four years as a research scientist in the Biodynamics Laboratory after earning his doctorate degree there in 1993. In 1997, Granata arrived at the University of Virginia as an assistant professor in two departments, Orthopedics and Biomedical Engineering, where he published two journals and collaborated on a study with the Curry School of Education to determine why female athletes experience more knee injuries than their male counterparts. From 1997 to 2003, he also served as the Research Director of the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Virginia. In 2002, he was promoted to the position of associate professor for the orthopedics and biomedical engineering departments. While at Virginia, he worked at the university's Kluge Children's Rehabilitation Center with children who had cerebral palsy. He remained an adjunct professor at Virginia after leaving for Virginia Tech in 2003. Virginia Tech Granata was among the leading U.S. researchers on biomechanics and movement dynamics in cerebral palsy, in his work with the Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Laboratory at Virginia Tech. His research focused on muscle and reflex control and its relation to legged robotics, neuromuscular control of musculoskeletal movement, biomechanical stability and muscle dynamics, control of low-back pain, and computer simulation and clinical interpretation of pathologic walking and running. Professor Granata was recruited to the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics to continue his distinguished teaching and research. In particular, he developed innovative methods to quantify low back stability that are considered cutting edge by other leaders in the field. He served as mentor for numerous students and junior professors. When Granata was promoted to the rank of professor, one of these professors conveyed, \\"Countless times he has provided me with valuable guidance on research-related matters such as student advising, experimental issues, and manuscript preparation.\\" Darin Padua of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who earned his doctorate under Granata's tutelage at the University of Virginia, said that Granata particularly excelled at encouraging collaboration among experts in various fields, resulting in research that crossed many disciplines and areas of expertise. While focusing primarily on research into cerebral palsy, biomimetric robotics and biomechanics, Granata helped develop mobility aids for the elderly such as the MARC Robotic Walker. The MARC Walker is named for the Medical Automation Research Center at the University of Virginia, where Granata had taught until January 10, 2003. He presented a paper on the elderly walker at the 2003 International Conference on Robots and Systems in Las Vegas. Granata was an associate professor at Virginia Tech and in 2005, he achieved the honor of Virginia Tech College of Engineering Faculty Fellow. In 2006, he was awarded the Dean's Award for Excellence in Research for his work on lower back pain. In announcing the Dean's Award given to Granata, Virginia Tech stated he had \\"established a major research program, developing innovative methods to quantify low back stability that are considered cutting edge.\\" He was additionally honored as the Virginia Tech Scholar of the Week for his published work concerning lower back pain. His friends and colleagues at Virginia Tech called him \\"a man with a sharp intellect who answered a call to serve the cause of scholarship and higher education\\". Granata was a member of many professional societies and served as Associate Editor of the Journal of Applied Biomechanics and Journal of Electromyography & Kinesiology. Granata was a co-chair of the American Society of Biomechanics' annual meeting in 2006, hosted at Virginia Tech.American Society of Biomechanics Annual Meeting: September 6-9, 2006 At the time of his death, he was awaiting publication of four more articles in his name. Personal life Granata lived in Blacksburg with his wife, Linda Ankenman, whom he met at Purdue while they both participated in the Crew Club and married in May 1991. She is a research specialist in the Food Science Department at Virginia Tech. He enjoyed working with the Boy Scouts and other activities with his three children, and he was an avid athlete, participating in triathlons and biathlons for years. On the crew club at Purdue, he was on the JV rowing team that won a bronze medal at the Dad Vail Regatta in 1986. He loved to play golf and was a fan of Ohio State athletics. Granata was also a member of Triangle Fraternity, inducted at Ohio State. Death Granata was a victim of the Virginia Tech shooting on April 16, 2007. Upon hearing a commotion from his office on the third floor of Norris Hall, he brought 20 students from a nearby classroom into his office, where the door could be locked. He and another professor, Wally Grant, then went downstairs to investigate the situation. They were both shot by Seung-Hui Cho; Grant was wounded and survived, but Granata died from an injury to his temple. He was 45 years old. None of the students locked in Granata's office were injured or killed. One of Granata's fellow Virginia Tech engineering professors, Dr. Liviu Librescu, was also killed in the shootings. The Engineering Science and Mechanics Department Head, Dr. Ishwar Puri, remembered Granata and Librescu in a statement as \\"world-class\\" researchers. Dr. Puri stated about Granata, \\"The use of his research by other scholars worldwide had put him on a trajectory to become a notable star in these fields.\\" Memorial services were held in Blacksburg and a funeral Mass at Christ the King Church in Toledo, Ohio, where his parents, Joseph and Mildred, and siblings live, was later held.

Early career Tincher began her career on stage. In 1908 she was touring in California with The Merry Go Round Company. In August of that year she may have married fellow actor, Ned Buckley, on a dare. He was a Yale graduate and a resident of Bridgeport, Connecticut. She visited her lawyer at the New York Life Insurance Building at 112-114 Broadway (Manhattan). She asked him to obtain a divorce if he learned that she was truly wed. While performing on the Keith-Albee-Orpheum vaudeville circuit, Tincher was approached by a man who commented about her resemblance to actress Mabel Normand. She did not know Normand because she had never seen a movie in 1913. The agent gave her his card and said he wanted director D.W. Griffith to see her. The following day she came calling at Biograph Studios. In her first role Griffith cast her in the role of a vamp. Within three weeks she began to play comedy, at first slapstick, and later comedy drama. Films Advertisement (1919) Tincher played in Bill Manages A Fighter (1914), one of a series of Bill comedy shorts. It was made by the Komic Pictures Company of Los Angeles, California. The performers worked out of the Reliance Studios. Directed by Edward Dillon, former ex-lightweight fighter Hobo Dougherty was among the featured actors. In one scene Tincher encourages Dougherty to get knocked out on film. However she has trouble convincing the fight veteran that he is not really in a pugilistic contest. By the end of 1915 Tincher worked for the Fine Arts Film Company. Aside from comic roles, she often depicted working class types such as a laundry girl in Laundry Liz (1916). Dillon directed and Anita Loos was the scenarist. The short movie was released by the Keystone Film Company. In Skirts (1916) Tincher plays an artist's model who becomes a victim of drugs. This was a new type of role for her. Tully Marshall plays the artist. Griffith staged a presentation of comic bull fights, massive floats, theatrical comedy, and drama, in July 1915. The production was called the Pageant of the Photoplay. Audiences were able to view directors carrying megaphones, the process of film development, and movies being put together in make-up rooms. Tincher played a dramatic part in a comedy on the final day of the event. A stage was assembled and four scenes were acted out. In 1918 Tincher became head of her own company, Fay Tincher Productions. Her movies were released by the World Film Company. In the Andy Gump comedy series (1923–1928) Tincher played Min, who wears her hair bobbed. The series numbered around forty-five films and was produced by Universal Pictures and Samuel Von Honkel. American cartoonist Sidney Smith created the film characters. Tincher's final motion picture was All Wet (1930). This is a two reel comedy short directed by Sam Newfield. Inheritance Tincher inherited $25,000 from the bequest of the will of Mrs. Julian Dick, who died from inhaling illuminating gas on December 22, 1930. Dick's residence was at 116 East 36th Street in New York City. Her husband, Captain Dick, was a member of the New York Cotton Exchange. He had been accidentally shot to death by a friend in 1922. Personal life and death In May 1915 Tincher won a bathing suit contest at Venice Beach, California, winning a first prize of $50. She wore a costume that was resembled her famous typewriter dress, which she wore in movies. A crowd of approximately 75,000 attended the procession.\\"Fay Cops Fifty\\" Motography (June 5, 1915): 935. In 1918, she roomed with scenario writer, Maie B. Havey, in a small bungalow. Tincher liked working in the fine art of vitreous enamel. Fay Tincher, at age 99, died of a heart attack in Brooklyn, New York, in 1983.

The institutions were the Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore; Groupe ESIEE, France; Hewlett-Packard Company; National Center for Supercomputing Applications, USA; Tsinghua University, China; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA; University of New South Wales, Australia; and University of Waterloo, Canada. These were the founding members of Gelato. Representatives from these organizations met twice a year. The first few meetings (in Palo Alto, California 2001 and Paris 2002) were primarily a \\"strategy council meeting\\" where the by-laws and charter were hammered out. The Sydney meeting in October 2002 was the first that included a day of technical presentations. These became a regular feature of the meetings, eventually expanded to conferences, and thus the two conferences each year were entirely composed of technical presentations by vendors and members. The organization apparently ceased operation in 2009.shutdown notice  Membership  Gelato Federation membership The federation grew markedly after its inception. By April 2007, there were more than 70 members and sponsors around the world. Members were institutions, but there were a few individuals who, because of their contribution to IA-64 on Linux or to Gelato, were made Honorary Members. These included Clemens C. J. Roothaan (who contributed to the Itanium math libraries and floating point unit), Brian Lynn (the original HP representative), David Mosberger-Tang (original porter of Linux to IA-64) and Jean-Pol Taffin (ex-general secretary of ESIEE, and very influential in the early days of Gelato). Institutional members were sponsored by an IA-64 vendor, or came in on their own. Sponsored members typically had specific projects in mind.  Conferences  Gelato ICE The Gelato ICE: Itanium Conference & Expo alternated between San Jose, California and somewhere else in the world, often in Southeast Asia or Europe. Gelato conferences were where most of the collaboration and cooperation between members were established, and where Intel revealed some of their future strategy for the Itanium-based platform. The last conference was held in Singapore in October 2007.  Other activities  Gelato GCC on Itanium Workgroup Apart from the Members' activities, Gelato funded a Central Operations (hosted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Central Operations, in addition to running the twice-a-year meetings, tried to coordinate and manage a number of projects. These included: * Gelato GCC on Itanium Workgroup, a group of members and sponsors of the Gelato Federation and the GCC community interested in improving GCC (the GNU Compiler Collection) on Itanium processors. * Vanilla, a concerted effort to port and tune software for Itanium. In addition to the actual tuned binaries, the tuning process was documented. * Coconut, a system of access to Itanium machines for members. * The Gelato System Grant program, which provided Itanium systems for members.  Sponsors  Gelato was funded by HP, Intel, BP, Itanium Solutions Alliance, and SGI. Gelato Central Operations was housed at the Coordinated Science Lab at the University of Illinois.

The brigade was dissolved and then reformed on four occasions. 1st Formation The brigade was first mustered at the International Brigade headquarters in Albacete in December 1936.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War The custom was to name Brigades on formation after inspirational \\"heroes of the Left\\". The 13th Brigade was named after Jarosław Dąbrowski, a Polish general who died on foreign soil, fighting in the defence of the Paris Commune in 1871. It consisted of three battalions, and three artillery batteries. * Louise Michel (1) Battalion * Chapaev Battalion / Czapajew Battalion * Vuillemin Battalion * 1st Battery \\"Ernst Thaelmann\\" * 2nd Battery \\"Karl Liebknecht\\" * 3rd Battery \\"Antoni Gramsci\\" This brigade mutinied after receiving heavy casualties the Battle of Brunete in July 1937 . Its battalions were dissolved, the men were sent to other units, and its equipment was re-distributed. 2nd Formation The brigade was reformed on 4 August 1937, from Central European battalions. It again used Jarosław Dąbrowski as its exemplar. * Dąbrowski Battalion – Polish and Spanish * Palafox Battalion – Polish, Spanish, Balkan. * Rakosi Battalion – Hungarian, Spanish. It was dissolved on 23 September 1938, along with the other International Brigades, when the Negrin Government took the decision to send foreign volunteers home. This decision was taken after pressure from the Non-Intervention Committee to remove all foreign volunteers from both sides of the conflict in an endeavour to de-internationalise it. Negrin acquiesced because he believed the Nationalists would send their foreigners home too. 3rd formation The brigade was again reformed (in Monredón) on 1 October 1938 from exclusively Spanish conscript battalions. 4th formation In mid-January 1939, in Palafrugell, Catalonia, a group of Polish and Balkan volunteers requested permission of André Marty to return to fight the Nationalists' Catalonia Offensive. On 23 January, they were formed into the XIII International Brigade. It was placed in charge of a young second lieutenant.

Early life  Born in Brussels, Benoît Lengelé studied medicine at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain), graduating in 1987. (in French) He was interested by face morphology and face modifications caused by aging.  Work  As the Chief Professor of the Chair of Human Anatomy at UCLouvain (Brussels Woluwe campus), he is also head of the department of Experimental Morphology. Also a plastic surgeon, at UCLouvain's university hospital in Brussels, in 1991 he worked in maxillo-facial surgery at the Central University Hospital in Amiens, where he met Bernard Duchauvelle and Sylvie Testelin. With his colleagues, he developed several new techniques aimed at reconstructing by microsurgery, specific parts of the head and the neck, such as the larynx or the inferior lip. Together they came to the conclusion that results obtained by these autotransplants are imperfect and emit the idea that face allografts could be used to repair patients suffering from severe disfigurations. On 26 November 2005, Benoît Lengelé performed, with Bernard Dechauvelle and Sylvie Testelin in Amiens, the first partial face allograft to repair the mutilated face of Isabelle Dinoire, a young woman severely bitten by her dog. In 2009, he received honors from his country as a result of his work in allografts, and was knighted by King Albert II of Belgium for his contributions. (in French) He also received the title of Knight of the Legion of Honor by the French ambassador of Belgium in 2019. (in French) In addition, Benoît Lengelé is an artist.

It is also the oldest insurance company in Malaysia. In August 2007 it had S$45 billion in assets and 3 million policyholders. At 31 Dec 2005 it had assets in excess of RM26 billion, 2.6 million policies in force served by 24 branch offices and a service network of more than 17,000 agents nationwide. It has two distribution channels – the tied agency force and bancassurance. It is the only life insurance company to be listed on the Singapore Exchange, and the largest insurance company in South-east Asia in terms of assets and market capitalisation. History Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad started as a branch office of Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd. Incorporated on 26 August 1908, Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd claims to be the oldest and most established life insurance company in Singapore and Malaysia. OAC was incorporated in 1920 as the first composite insurer in Singapore. In 1999, Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad was localised as a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd in Singapore. In November 1999, Great Eastern Life underwent restructuring to become a wholly owned life insurance arm of a financial service holding company – Great Eastern Holdings Ltd. This was followed by a merger between Great Eastern Holdings and Overseas Assurance Corporation in December 2000. In June 2004, Great Eastern Holdings became a substantially owned subsidiary of OCBC Bank, Singapore’s longest established local bank. OCBC Bank has assets of S$164 billion and a network of 390 branches and representative offices in 15 countries and territories including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan, Brunei, Myanmar, Japan, Korea, Australia, UK and USA. This network includes more than 280 branches and offices in Indonesia operated by OCBC Bank's subsidiary, PT Bank NISP. OCBC Bank and its banking subsidiaries offer a wide range of specialist financial services, from consumer, corporate, investment, private and transaction banking to treasury and stockbroking services. In addition to Singapore where Great Eastern is headquartered, and Malaysia with 29 branches, Great Eastern also has a branch office in Brunei since 1975, a subsidiary company in Indonesia since 1996, and representative offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In June 2006, Great Eastern and Chongqing Land Properties Group launched their 50:50 joint venture life insurance company, Great Eastern Life Assurance (China) Co Ltd. This new company is headquartered in Chongqing which will act as a bridgehead for its expansion plans into the rest of China. The Company also holds at least 31% of the total shares in the Malaysian Share market (KLSE). Awards Great Eastern has picked up a number of awards, one of which is the Singapore Brand Award organised by IE Singapore, which it won for the fifth year running in 2006. Great Eastern is also well regarded as Singapore's 7th Most Valuable Brand and its brand value increased from S$609 million in 2005 to S$693 million in 2006.

The Capetians appear first in the records as powerful nobles serving under the Carolingian dynasty in West Francia, which later became France. As their power increased, they came into conflict with the older royal family and attained the crown several times before the eventual start of the continuous rule of the descendants of Hugh Capet (ruled 987–996). Hugh's paternal ancestral family, the Robertians, appear in documents that can trace them back to his great- grandfather Robert the Strong (d. 866). His origins remain unclear, but medieval records hint at an origin in East Francia, in present-day Germany, an area then still also ruled by the Carolingians. In particular, Regino of Prüm (died 915 CE) states that Robert the Strong's son Odo was said to be a relative (nepos) of a Count Meingaud, count of an area near Worms, who died in 892, and there are indications that Maingaud's family used the names Robert and Odo. Modern proposals about their ancestry further back are based on the idea that there was one family which frequently named its sons Robert, including Robert III of Worms (800–834), Robert the Strong (d. 866), and Robert I of France (866–923). For example, one proposed ancestor is Robert of Hesbaye (c. 800), about whom there are almost no records. The Robertian family figured prominently amongst the Carolingian nobility and married into this royal family. Eventually, the Robertians themselves produced Frankish kings such as the brothers Odo (reigned 888–898) and Robert I (r. 922–923), then Hugh Capet (r. 987–996), who ruled from his seat in Paris as the first Capetian king of France. Although Philip II Augustus (r. 1180-1223) was officially the last king of the Franks (rex Francorum) and the first king of France (roi de France), in (systematic application of) historiography, Hugh Capet holds this distinction. He founded the Capetians, the royal dynasty that ruled France until the revolution of the Second French Republic in 1848save during the interregnum of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Members of the family still reign in Europe today; both King Felipe VI of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg descend from this family through the Bourbon cadet branch of the dynasty. Origin The oldest known Robertians probably originated in the county of Hesbaye, around Tongeren in modern-day Belgium. The first certain ancestor is Robert the Strong count of Paris, probably the son of Robert III of Worms, grandson of Robert of Hesbaye, and nephew of Ermengarde of Hesbaye, who was the daughter of Ingram, and wife of Louis the Pious. Other related family includes Cancor, founder of the Lorsch Abbey, his sister Landrada and her son Saint Chrodogang, archbishop of Metz. History =Robert the Strong= The sons of Robert the Strong were Odo and Robert, who were both king of Western Francia and ruled during the Carolingian era. His daughter Richildis married a count of Troyes. The family became Counts of Paris under Odo and \\"Dukes of the Franks\\" under Robert, possessing large parts of the ancient Neustria. Although quarrels continued between Robert's son Hugh the Great and Louis IV of France, they were mended upon the ascension of Lothair I of France (954–986). Lothair greatly expanded the Robertian dominions when he granted Hugh Aquitaine as well as much of Burgundy, both rich and influential territories, arguably two of the richest in France. The Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of Louis V (d. 987). After the death of Louis, the son of Hugh the Great, Hugh Capet was chosen as king of the Franks, nominally the last ruler of West Francia. Given the resurgence of the Holy Roman Empire title and dignities in the West Francian kingdom, Europe was later believed to have entered a new age, so Hugh came to be known in historiography as the first king of France, as western civilization was perceived to have entered the High Middle Ages period. Hugh was crowned at Noyon on July 3, 987 with the full support of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named, after him, the Capetians. They ruled France as the Capetians, Valois, and Bourbons until the French Revolution. They returned after 1815 and ruled until Louis Philippe was deposed in 1848. However, they have continued to rule Spain, with two republican interruptions, through the Bourbon Dynasty right down to Felipe VI.

(Brother) Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis was an Augustinian Friar from Milan who served in London as envoy between the Duke of Milan and King Henry VII. He is known to have sailed with John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboto) during his 1498 expedition to North America. He may have founded a mission settlement and North America's oldest, and only medieval, church at Carbonear, Newfoundland and Labrador.\\"First Christian settlement in North America\\" , CBN Compass, 18 May 2010 History Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis accompanied Francesco Pagano's diplomatic mission to London at the start of 1490, as did Christopher Carbonariis, who appears to have some family connection. Jones says that \\"de Carbonariis\\" appears to be a family name. Giovanni Carbonariis' association to John Cabot has been known since the 19th century, based on his letter of 20 June 1498 to the Duke of Milan. He said that ‘Messer Giovanni Antonio de Carbonariis’ had accompanied Cabot's recently departed expedition. The Friar had left with five ships provided by King Henry VII of England.Williamson, Cabot Voyages, p. 227: Calendar of State Papers Milan, vol. 1 (1912), no. 571 & fn. The Spanish envoy in London, Pedro de Ayala, wrote to the Crown noting that one of the five ships in Cabot's expedition had been badly damaged in a storm and was forced to land in Ireland, leaving Cabot to sail on. The ambassador notes that on the damaged ship was ‘another Friar Buil.’ This was an allusion to Bernardo Buil, the Minim missionary who had accompanied Christopher Columbus's 1493 expedition.Primary Source: 'Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy in London, to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in Spain, 25 July 1498', The Smugglers' City website, Dept. of History, University of Bristol Based on limited information, historians thought that Carbonariis was a minor player in the expeditions, and may not have sailed further than Ireland. Historian James Williamson had ascertained that Carbonariis was 'a man of some importance', having served as an envoy between the Duke of Milan and Henry VII,Williamson (1962), Cabot Voyages, p. 93.] but the friar had been overlooked by most historians since then interested in the English voyages of exploration from Bristol. Augustinian Alwyn Ruddock of the University of London was one of the world's foremost experts on John Cabot's expedition and suggested in correspondence that Carbonariis had a more important role, but due to ill health was unable to publish her findings. After her death in December 2005, all of her research notes and materials were destroyed, according to instructions in her will. Learning of her research, Dr Evan Jones of the University of Bristol has re-investigated her claims, finding new documents and verifying some of her positions. This includes that Carbonariis was an Augustinian friar who had been educated in Pavia. In the late 15th century, he was serving as the deputy papal tax collector in England. Since his principal, Adriano Castellesi, had been in Rome since 1494, Carbonariis was in effective control of one of the most lucrative clerical appointments in England. In this period, the Church still owned about one third of the land in England, and the Pope took ten per cent of the income generated from that property.E. T. Jones, 'Alwyn Ruddock: \\"John Cabot and the Discovery of America \\"', Historical Research, 81, (May, 2008), 235-6 Based on his position, Carbonariis controlled institutional wealth and had access to King Henry. Fr. Giovanni Antonio Carbonariis emerges as a key player in Ruddock's account of John Cabot's voyages. While she never published a full account, she claimed that he was the explorer's most important backer in England, having arranged for Cabot to get a loan from Italian bankers in London for an expedition after the Venetian arrived in London in 1495. Even more importantly, she suggests that it was Carbonariis who secured Cabot an audience with King Henry VII of England. In March 1496 Cabot and his three grown sons were granted royal Letters patent for westward exploration. Ruddock also claims that Carbonariis outfitted a ship, called the Dominus Nobiscum, which accompanied the 1498 expedition. The ship carried other Italian friars who, with Carbonariis, are believed to have established a church and religious community in Newfoundland.Jones (2008), \\"Alwyn Ruddock: John Cabot, Historical Research, pp. 242–9. In his account of this period, historian Richard Hakluyt had mistakenly associated the friars and ship by that name with a 1527 voyage by Cabot's son Sebastian Cabot; but, the latter's ships for that expedition were named Samson and Mary of Guildford.James A. Williamson, The Voyages of the Cabots and the English Discovery of North America under Henry VII and Henry VIII (1929), pp. 256 – 7 While the religious community in Newfoundland is thought to have lasted at most only a few years, it would have been significant as North America's first Christian settlement. This church appears to have been named after the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara in Naples, which was the mother church of a group of reformed Augustinian Friars called the 'Carbonara'. Dr Ruddock suggested that the community was located at what is now Carbonear, Newfoundland and Labrador, the modern name being a relic survival of the 15th-century settlement.(Williamson had already noted a connection between the name of the papal deputy and Carbonear.) From 2010-14 archeological excavations were undertaken by Professor Peter Pope (d. 2017)https://www.mun.ca/archaeology/news.php?id=8824&type;=news of Memorial University of Newfoundland in Carbonear to study its colonial history.

Their records are distributed in North-America by Sub Pop Records.  Biography  = Early Days and first issue = The founding members of Les Thugs were two brothers, Eric and Christophe Sourice, from Angers, France. The Sourice brothers were teenagers in 1977 and were influenced by the English punk wave that was sweeping through France. Without knowing how to play any instruments, the band used the DIY ethic. Their first band was founded in 1979, a group called IVG. They then played in the groups Dazibao and Stress with Gérald Chabaud, Thierry Méanard and a fifth member (Philippe Brix) as singer. In April 1983, following the departure of the lead singer, they officially became Les Thugs. The band's name refers to the historical brotherhood of the Thuggee, followers of the goddess Kali, and not directly to the English loan word thug. Eric became the lead singer and the band quickly created its own repertoire, performing its first concerts in bars in Angers and surrounding towns. In July 1984, during a concert in Juvisy, near Paris, Les Thugs met the very young independent label Gougnaf Mouvement with whom they decided to release a 45rpm single. Frenetic Dancing, the group's first record, was released in January 1985 by Gougnaf Mouvement. This single includes two tracks Night Dance and Femme Fatale. Both were recorded in a basement in Juvisy with an 8 track tape recorder. The success of the record was well beyond the expectations of the group: the single, although limited, was internationally distributed and sold more than 3,000 copies. Response to the record in specialized fanzines was good; the group got reviews in maximumrocknroll in the United States and in Sounds in England. One hundred copies were sold in Vinyl Solution, a shop and a label in London run by two French expatriates in England. Greg Shaw, a protagonist in the Californian underground scene, put the track Femme Fatale on the Bomp! Records compilation Battle of Garage. = European rise = Les Thugs then recorded their first mini-album, Radical Hystery. They were approached by many labels such as New Rose records in France and Midnight in United States. Eventually the band chose Closer, a French independent label which was more established than Gougnaf Mouvement. The album was released in 1986 and sales were good, with 3,000 copies sold in France and 2,000 abroad. In 1987 the band left Closer to join the English label Vinyl Solution. The seven tracks on the mini-album Electric Troubles were recorded in London in July. On November 8, during their first tour of England, they participated in John Peel's Peel Sessions on BBC Radio 1. The year 1988 was mostly occupied by touring throughout Europe. In June their bassist Gerald left the band. He was replaced by the group's roadie, Pierre-Yves Sourice, the younger brother of Eric and Christophe. At the start of the year they released the EP Dirty White Race in Europe, and on 11 October the French quartet played in Berlin at Independence days festival. This performance brought them to the attention of the Seattle- based label Sub Pop. Later, Jonathan Poneman, founder of the label recalled > \\"I remember back in 1988, Bruce Pavitt and I scammed a trip to Berlin with > Mudhoney, who were scheduled to play the then state-funded, now defunct > Berlin Independence Days music festival. As an unofficial representative of > the insurgent American Rock Underground I was pleased to note that most of > the European bands that were playing this extravaganza were godawful. > Wondering just how horrible it could get, I decided to go check out a French > rock band for laffs. Maybe they would play some Mink DeVille covers. The > band was Les Thugs and they effortlessly blew my shit away.\\" This meeting resulted in the signing of the group to Sub Pop, who started to distribute the band's catalog in North America. During the summer of 1989 the group performed a two-month tour in North America in precarious conditions. They played in Seattle with PIL then toured with Blood Circus in the USA then with SNFU in Canada, and with Tad in Washington. It was during this time that they crossed paths with Jello Biafra. In the autumn of 1989 they released their first full-length album Still Angry, Still Hungry in Europe. This album was recorded in Wales during May by Iain Burgess (Big Black) and then mixed in Chicago. Les Thugs toured in England with Mega City Four, and performed many dates in France, including supporting Noir Désir at the Olympia in Paris. During 1993 Still Hungry, Still Angry was made available by Sub Pop in North America under the title of 'Still Angry'. = Wider success = In 1991, in the midst of the Gulf War, the song Stop the War and the album IABF were issued in the US by Alternative Tentacles, Jello Biafra’s label. Recorded in England, IABF (International Anti-Boredom Front) contains one of the best known tunes of the group: I Love You So. A European tour accompanied the album's release in spring 1991, followed by a US tour of 33 dates in autumn. During this period, for the 10th anniversary of Alternative Tentacles and the hundredth issue of the Californian label, Les Thugs were invited by Jello Biafra to contribute to a tribute album for the Dead Kennedys, Virus 100, alongside Faith No More, Sepultura and L7. The band recorded a cover of the Dead Kennedys’ track Moon Over Marin at Smart Studios in Madison with Butch Vig (Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Garbage). In 1993, they recorded the album As Happy as possible in Seattle with Kurt Bloch (Mudhoney, Tad). The album was their best commercial success with 40,000 copies sold worldwide, including 15,000 in both the USA and France. On February 19, 1994, they were the support for Nirvana during their concert in Neuchâtel in Switzerland. It was one of the last Nirvana concerts before the death of Kurt Cobain. In May, the Thugs toured in major French theaters, such as (Le Zenith de Paris), opening for The Breeders. In 1996, Sub Pop produced the album Strike, recorded by Steve Albini. In May the group performed its last US tour, opening for Therapy? and Girls Against Boys. Despite a good critical reception, the commercial impact of Strike was lower compared to the previous album and the band emerged disappointed by the collaboration with Steve Albini. After this, the group wanted to compose and record a new album as soon as possible. = Decline and separation = In 1997 they changed label again producing Nineteen Something themselves, which was licensed by Virgin in France and Sub Pop in the United States. The album was recorded in Angers with Kurt Bloch once again. The album showed the band moving towards a more melodic style of rock than the previous albums. For the first time, they sang in French on the track “'”. A tour of 60 dates in France and Switzerland followed the release of the album. It launched with an unpaid gig at Vitrolles stadium with Noir Désir in support of the association “”, stripped of grants by the National Front (far right political party in France) municipality. Despite again receiving a good critical response and a good start on the American College Radio Charts, sales of Nineteen Something did not exceed 10,000 copies. At this point Christophe Sourice decided to leave the band because of internal disagreements. Before ending this part of their career Les Thugs recorded their last album Tout doit disparaître, produced by Christophe Sourice himself. This album was only released on the French market, in 1999. They performed their last tour with 20 dates in France. The band, who had played more than 700 concerts, performed their farewell show at La Roche-sur-Yon in December 1999. = Brief reformation = In 2008, they played a show in Seattle for the 20th anniversary of the Sub Pop label, and for some dates in France. This small tour was ironically called the No-Reform Tour. = New band = In 2018, two members (Eric and Pierre-Yves Sourice) launched a new band called LANE (Love And Noise Experiment) with Pierre-Yves' son, Félix, and two members of another similar band, Daria, the brothers Etienne and Camille Belin. One album was issued in 2019 which gained critical acclaim, \\"A Shiny Day\\". \\"Pictures of A Century\\" followed in june 2020.

(2006): Cognitive Psychology. 4th Ed. Thomson Wadsworth. is a bottom-up process proposed by Irving Biederman in 1987 to explain object recognition. According to RBC theory, we are able to recognize objects by separating them into geons (the object’s main component parts). Biederman suggested that geons are based on basic 3-dimensional shapes (cylinders, cones, etc.) that can be assembled in various arrangements to form a virtually unlimited number of objects.Biederman, I. (1987) Recognition-by- components: a theory of human image understanding. Psychol Rev. 1987 Apr;94(2):115-147. Geons The recognition-by-components theory suggests that there are fewer than 36 geons which are combined to create the objects we see in day-to-day life.Eyseneck, M W. Keane, M T, 2010. Cognitive Psychology: A Students Handbook. 6th Edition. Hove: Psychology Press For example, when looking at a mug we break it down into two components – \\"cylinder\\" and \\"handle\\". This also works for more complex objects, which in turn are made up of a larger number of geons. Perceived geons are then compared with objects in our stored memory to identify what it is we are looking at. The theory proposes that when we view objects we look for two important components. *Edges – This enables us to maintain the same perception of the object regardless of viewing orientation. *Concavities – The area where two edges meet. These enable us to observe the separation between two or more geons.  Analogy between speech and objects  In his proposal of RBC, Biederman makes an analogy to the composition of speech and objects that helps support his theory. The idea is that about 44 individual phonemes or \\"units of sound\\" are needed to make up every word in the English language, and only about 55 are needed to make up every word in all languages. Though small differences may exist between these phonemes, there is still a discrete number that make up all languages. A similar system may be used to describe how objects are perceived. Biederman suggests that in the same way speech is made up by phonemes, objects are made up by geons, and as there are a great variance of phonemes, there is also a great variance of geons. It is more easily understood how 36 geons can compose the sum of all objects, when the sum of all language and human speech is made up of only 55 phonemes. Viewpoint invariance One of the most defining factors of the recognition-by-components theory is that it enables us to recognize objects regardless of viewing angle; this is known as viewpoint invariance. It is proposed that the reason for this effect is the invariant edge properties of geons.Biederman, I. (2000). Recognizing depth-rotated objects: A review of recent research and theory. Spatial Vision, 13, 241–253. The invariant edge properties are as follows: *Curvature (various points of a curve) *Parallel lines (two or more points which follow the same direction) *Co-termination (the point at which two points meet and therefore cease to continue) *Symmetry and asymmetry *Co- linearity (points branching from a common line) Our knowledge of these properties means that when viewing an object or geon, we can perceive it from almost any angle. For example, when viewing a brick we will be able to see horizontal sets of parallel lines and vertical ones, and when considering where these points meet (co-termination) we are able to perceive the object. Strengths of the theory Using geons as structural primitives results in two key advantages. Because geons are based on object properties that are stable across viewpoint (\\"viewpoint invariant\\"), and all geons are discriminable from one another, a single geon description is sufficient to describe an object from all possible viewpoints. The second advantage is that considerable economy of representation is achieved: a relatively small set of geons form a simple \\"alphabet\\" that can combine to form complex objects. For example, with only 24 geons, there are 306 billion possible combinations of 3 geons, allowing for all possible objects to be recognized. In addition, some research suggests that the ability to recognize geons and compound structures of geons may develop in the brain as early as four months old, making it one of the fundamental skills that infants use to perceive the world.Haaf, R., Fulkerson, A., Jablonski, B., Hupp, J., Shull, S., Pescara-Kovach, L. (2003). Object recognition and attention to object components by preschool children and 4-month-old infants. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 86(2), 108-123. Experimental evidence *Participants show a remarkable ability to recognise objects despite visual noise provided that the geons are visible. *Removal of feature-relation information (relations between geons) impairs object recognition. *No visual priming if different geons are used between trials Weaknesses RBC theory is not in itself capable of starting with a photograph of a real object and producing a geons-and-relations description of the object; the theory does not attempt to provide a mechanism to reduce the complexities of real scenes to simple geon shapes. RBC theory is also incomplete in that geons and the relations between them will fail to distinguish many real objects. For example, a pear and an apple are easily distinguished by humans, but lack the corners and edges needed for RBC theory to recognize they are different. However, Irving Biederman has argued that RBC theory is the \\"preferred\\" mode of human object recognition, with a secondary process handling objects that are not distinguishable by their geons. He further states that this distinction explains research suggesting that objects may or may not be recognized equally well with changes in viewpoint.

Santamaria have sold more than 700,000 albums in Portugal during a career spanning roughly a decade.  History  = Early years = Formed in Santa Maria de Lamas (hence the name Santamaria) a Portuguese civil parish located in the municipality of Santa Maria da Feira, in the district of Aveiro, Portugal, in 1997, Santamaria are the brainchild of producers Luís Marante and Tony Lemos and lead singer Filipa, Lemos' sister. At the time, Lemos was already an experienced studio man, having first emerged on the music scene in a duo with Filipa called Tó & Marlene, playing in county fairs during the summer seasons. Later, Filipa joined the short-lived act Taitibitileus, which managed to score a minor novelty hit with the song \\"O Meu Abião.\\" Longing for a change of pace, the siblings, joined by common friend Marante, started dabbling with Euro-dance, all of them inspired by widely popular acts like Ace of Base, Whigfield, and Corona. Recording enough songs for an album, Santamaria recruited two background singers and dancers, former model Dina Real and Yolanda. They shopped their demo CD around, and independent Portuguese label Vidisco took an interest. Consisting of re-recordings of all the tracks on the demo in more professional settings, debut album Eu Sei, Tu És... was released in early 1998. Boosted by the popular title track, the album went triple platinum in a year, even in the face of terrible reviews and a lack of airplay by the biggest radio stations in the country, their exposure mainly consisting of constant appearances in TV variety shows. Further hits with \\"Não Dá P'ra Viver Sem Ti\\" and the ballad \\"É Demais\\" consolidated Santamaria's success, leading to a successful spring and summer tour. = First change in line-up = As promotion was rolling on, Yolanda quit the group under acrimonious circumstances. A replacement was found in Magda Monteiro, thus forming a lineup that still remains unchanged. The group released its second album, Sem Limite, in 1999. This record marked the appearance of Rui Batista, who became the group's mainsongwriter (the first album had its lyrics written by Filipa) from that point forward, although he never became an official member. Keeping the formula of the debut, Sem Limite expanded on Santamaria's success by going platinum four times over in a year and becoming their most successful album to date, bolstered by hit singles \\"Tudo P'ra Te Amar,\\" \\"Falésia do Amor,\\" and \\"Quero-me Mais.\\" = Globos de Ouro Award = Maintaining their one-album-a- year schedule, Voar arrived in 2000. Boasting a sound with similarities to the Vengaboys, it went triple platinum. In 2001, the fourth album Reflexus was released. This CD marked another arrival, this time in the guise of Brazilian songwriter/producer Luís Jr., who like Batista also became a permanent side collaborator with the group. Even though Reflexus sold less than its predecessors by going double platinum, Santamaria nevertheless managed to grab an award for Best Musical Act at the prestigious Portuguese arts and entertainment awards show Globos de Ouro. With the release of fifth album 4 Dance in 2002, Santamaria made their first attempts at attaining an international following, in particular by recording their first completely English-sung track, \\"I Want You Anyway.\\" Aside from not achieving their export ambitions, Santamaria saw a dip in popularity. Where previous albums had gone multi-platinum, 4 Dance only managed a single platinum plaque. Signaling the end of their contract with Vidisco, the group released a greatest-hits album in 2003, Boogie Woogie. They promoted the album by touring for almost two years straight. Even so, Boogie Woogie only managed a gold certification, suggesting that Santamaria's popularity was on the wane. Breaking their album- per-year workload, Santamaria began their liaison with new label Espacial by releasing 2 Beat in 2005 it's they come back. It scored double platinum, returning some of their popularity. Returning to their typical album release schedule, 8 was issued in 2006. In July, 2007 the group takes releases \\"Elements\\" with the arrived of Lucas Jr (DJ Lucana) in the group. In 2008, Santamaria takes out \\"Virtual\\" and to celebrate their 10 years of career they take out late in the year a live DVD of a concert registered in Porto in August, 2008. In 2009 the group releases Xplosion, their 10th album, which makes big success in Portugal.

She is portrayed by Emily VanCamp. Character history =Background= Rebecca was thought to have been the daughter of William Walker, the late patriarch of the Walker family, and his longtime mistress Holly Harper, although it was later revealed that she was not William Walker's daughter. When Rebecca was 16, one of her teachers initiated an affair with her, which continued until his wife found out. Many people told the Harpers to press charges, but Rebecca begged her mother not to. The man and his family moved to Chicago. When he called Rebecca to apologize, the affair started again, and she moved there to be with him. When his wife found out again, he killed himself. She told everyone that she was studying theater at Northwestern University, and had dropped out of school and returned home. =Season 1= The Walker family first learned of Rebecca's existence while attempting to crack the password to a locked account which contained funds that William Walker had embezzled from Ojai Foods. Holly initially denied that Rebecca was William's daughter, revealing the truth only after the account was unlocked with the password \\"S-K-T-K-J-R\\" (the initials of the five Walker children, plus R for Rebecca.) Sarah, Tommy and Kevin, the three Walker siblings involved in the family business, initially agreed to keep Rebecca's existence a secret from the rest of the Walker family, although Saul eventually told Nora about Rebecca. Rebecca knew William Walker only as her mother's boyfriend, not as a father. Holly insisted that Rebecca's father was not William, but the struggling film director she had dated before she knew William. However, after Sarah informed Rebecca of her parentage and confronted Holly with the fact that there was an extra R in the computer password, Holly tried to reach Rebecca via a phone hook-up. Justin was the first Walker sibling to reach out to Rebecca, after meeting her and discovering that they had high school friends in common. Rebecca and Justin attended a party together, at which Rebecca used drugs and Justin got into a fistfight trying to protect her. In another conversation, Rebecca told Justin that \\"there's a new black sheep in town, get used to it & I'm ready to move to a new city\\". The rest of the Walkers were more reluctant to meet her, although they slowly made sincere attempts to reach out to her. Nora invited Rebecca to a family dinner, at which Kevin pulled out a strand of her hair to test her DNA. Horrified, Rebecca left the house quickly, although she later confided to her mother that although the Walkers struck her as crazy, she had always secretly wanted to be part of a large, crazy, dysfunctional but loving family who took care of her. Sarah, Tommy and Kevin extended social invitations to Rebecca, who agreed to meet them all at the Walker home. Kitty, who had been the most reluctant of the siblings to meet Rebecca, came home unaware that Rebecca was in the house and became irritated. Rebecca was invited to the Walker family game night, where she generally felt like an outsider. However, she bonded with Sarah's husband, Joe, over a shared love of music, and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. In the final question of trivia, Rebecca gave the wrong answer, saying that the last name of Juliet from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was Montague but it was really Capulet, and lost the Walker family the game. Later, Rebecca and Kitty bond for a moment when Kitty reassures her that getting the wrong answer during trivia wasn't the end of the world since she once did the same. At her first guitar lesson, Rebecca and Joe kissed. When she later told Justin, Rebecca reported that Joe had initiated the kiss, but did not reveal that she had been flirting quite openly with him and attempted to prolong the kiss after Joe backed away. Holly used the incident as an opportunity to get revenge on Sarah for revealing Rebecca's paternity, only later revealing that she did not, in fact, believe that Rebecca was a wholly innocent party. Rebecca and Holly got into a fight, and Rebecca moved into Nora's house with her own possessions, car & job with some extra benefits. =Season 2= In the early part of Season 2, Rebecca was still in the process of working out her place in the Walker family. She sometimes avoided expressing her own opinions on things for fear of alienating her new siblings, but as she began to feel more accepted by the Walkers she began to feel more confident, finally speaking up while shopping with her sisters for bridesmaid dresses for Kitty's wedding. She also arranged a job for her friend Lena as the office manager at Walker Landing, the winery business that Holly operated in partnership with Tommy Walker, but this ultimately resulted in Lena sleeping with both Tommy and Justin. However, things began to change when a former boyfriend of Holly's, a film director and photographer named David Caplan, unexpectedly arrived for a visit. With some guidance from David, Rebecca began exploring her own interest in photography as well. After a series of events caused Rebecca to begin doubting what she knew about her paternity, she took a DNA test which revealed that David Caplan was her father, rather than William Walker. She confronted David, who told her that he did not previously know she was his daughter and would not have been a stable or reliable father if he had known. She did not immediately tell the Walkers that she was not related to them, but kept the test results to herself until after Justin revealed that he had some romantic feelings for her. She then confronted Holly, who called Rebecca ungrateful for all the sacrifices Holly had made for her and threw her out of the house. The Walkers learned that the \\"R\\" in the computer password had never stood for Rebecca at all, but for Ryan, a child William had with yet another mistress. In the final episode of the season, Justin and Rebecca acknowledged that they had feelings for each other, and began to discuss the possibility of commencing a relationship. =Season 3= In the Season Premiere, Rebecca and Justin keep their relationship away from the rest of the family, but later he tells everyone. In the rest of the episodes, Justin and Rebecca become closer. In the episode Troubled Waters, She has suspicions about Tommy's new business deal. Later, Ryan Lafferty, the newly discovered half-brother for the Walkers gets a bit too close to Rebecca for Justin's comfort. Rebecca and Justin are now engaged at the end of season 3 Mexico. =Season 4= This season sees Rebecca still working at Ojai Foods as she plans her wedding with Justin. In Episode 7, she discovers she is pregnant but has yet to tell Justin. In the episode \\"Pregnant Pause,\\" she tells Kitty about her pregnancy. Justin hears the news through the grapevine and Rebecca confirms it. Justin tells her he is happy, while actually he begins to have second thoughts about everything. When their rehearsal dinner arrives, Rebecca and Justin have a huge argument that culminates in him telling her that he is unsure of everything. He then misses their rehearsal dinner because a child is injured in an accident and he comes to the boy's aid. After he realizes how much he wants to be a husband and a father, he goes to see an upset Rebecca and tells her about the accident, professing his love and telling her that he still wants to get married. Their wedding day arrives, where they decide to have a beach wedding. The ceremony is interrupted when Kitty collapses and no one can find her pulse. Kitty is fine after getting a bone marrow transplant from Ryan, but Rebecca miscarries the baby. In part 2 of \\"Time after Time\\", they elope and spend their honeymoon in the old Ojai Ranch. However, it is interrupted by Nora and Holly who are looking for Narrow Lake. Later, the rest of the Walkers who come to find Nora and celebrate Justin and Rebecca's marriage. =Season 5= A year has passed since the season 4 finale, and it is revealed Rebecca has moved out of the home she shared with Justin. Justin also reveals to his family that while he was in Afghanistan they divorced, however, they still have feelings for each other, when Holly once again forgets that Rebecca is her daughter she turns to Justin for comfort, this leaves Rebecca confused about the future because she was offered her dream job of Photography in New York. They end things for good and everything is final. Rebecca leaves to New York and leaves Justin devastated.

It is the only species of mammal endemic to the Azores. It has been recorded on most of the islands of the Azores, and remains common on some but is rare on others. Its numbers are threatened due to habitat loss caused by humans, and the remaining populations are quite fragmented. It is known to roost in hollowed-out trees, buildings, and caves. The species is related to the widespread lesser noctule, and in the past was treated as a subspecies of that species. Genetic studies have found that it originated recently from lesser noctules which colonised the Azores, and has low levels of genetic divergence from its parent species. It nevertheless is much smaller than the lesser noctule and weighs less, has darker fur and has a different frequency of echolocation calls (about 4–5 Hz higher), and is usually treated as a separate species. The Azores noctule is the only known species of bat in the world that hunts insects principally by day, although a single population of the soprano pipistrelle in northern Italy has also been discovered doing so. It has been hypothesised that the Azores noctules can forage during the day due to the absence of avian predators in the Azores, since it is thought that other bats forage nocturnally in order to avoid predatory birds such as hawks and falcons. Azores noctules still seem to exhibit some anti-predator behaviour, such as leaving their roosting sites in groups, but this may be related to foraging behaviour or non-avian predators such as rats.

Early life  Murray was born in Southfleet, Kent, England, the son of and Penelope Frances Elizabeth Pemberton Austin (the daughter of Brigadier-General Austin) and the Reverend George Edward Murray, the village's rector. He was also a grandson of the Right Reverend George Murray, Bishop of Rochester (who married Lady Sarah Hay-Drummond, daughter of Robert Hay- Drummond, 10th Earl of Kinnoull), a great-grandson of the Right Reverend Lord George Murray (who was second son of John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl, himself the eldest son of renowned Scottish Jacobite Lord George Murray, the sixth son of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl). He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. Career He entered the Foreign Office in 1873 and transferred to HM Treasury in 1880. From 1892 to 1894 he was private secretary to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in his role as First Lord of the Treasury, and remained private secretary to his successor, Lord Rosebery, until 1895.

In Fables 137 (Camelot, Part Six), Winter refers to a book her mother reads to her and her siblings all the time, about a land where there is always winter, but never Christmas;Fables 137: Camelot, Part 6 this is a reference to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. *Middle-Earth – A flashback in the Legends in Exile story arc shows short slaves (Hobbits) being whipped by goblins (orcs).

It was controlled by Baba Yaga, until she was captured in the Battle of Fabletown. Her Knights also patrolled the lands until they were beheaded by Boy Blue. Prose Page spent years in the Rus during her quest for knowledge in the Homelands.Jack of Fables 32: The Books of War, Volume Five Mundane Russia is approximately one-sixteenth the size of the magical Rus. *Dunhill, Viss, Haven, and Lamien – The home of Lumi, the Snow Queen.Jack of Fables 6: Jack Frost, Part One These were not conquered, as Lumi made a deal in which she would use her powers in the Adversary's service, if he would spare her world.Fairest 04: Wide Awake, Chapter Four *The Arabian Homeworld – The Arabic Fable Homeworld.Fables 42: Arabian Nights (and Days), Part One It is a primary Islamic world host to places such as Ali Baba's Cave,Fables 45: Arabian Nights (and Days), Part Four mythical versions of Baghdad and Samarcand and Fabletown East.

As the last remaining member of the Raj, the current Viceroy is Lord Mountbatten, a Clockwork Tiger crafted as a gift to Lord Viceroy Lovejoy by the craftsmen of Maharaja Sindu Baba Singh. The Indu might not be the home to Fables of Indian origin but rather those who are born from the British view on India, thus explaining why it was conquered alongside the European worlds instead of the Oriental worlds.Fables: The Dark Ages *The Golden Realm – Also known as The West. It was ruled by the King to the West, the father of the prince from the fairy tale Snow White and Rose Red. The Golden Realm borders on the Silver Realm and The North.

Apparently, Landfall was not conquered by the Adversary. \\"Jack Frost Two\\" spent time there during his career as a hero-for hire. The capital city is also called Landfall.Jack of Fables 41-45: The Fulminate Blade *The Hesse – The German Fable lands. The name Hesse is derived from one of the larger states in Germany. The Hesse is host to the Black Forest, the city of Hamelin, the town of Winsen and the Weser River. Much of the novel Peter and Max is set in Hesse, and Dunster Happ spent seven years in the Hesse trapping the last of the Baleful HernesFables 86: Boxing Days (presumably a reference to Herne the Hunter and Wild Hunt). *Erin – The mythical version of Ireland. The name Erin deriving from the Irish name for Ireland “Éirinn\\". *Albion – The Homelands version of England It is the home to many English Fables as the name derives from the eldest known name for the United Kingdom. *Ultima Thule – Seen in the mini-series Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love. Thule is a Fable homeworld that mainly draws its characters from Norwegian Folktales. Humans and trolls live side by side with sentient moose, foxes and polar bears. Thule was governed before, during and after the Adversary conquered it by King Valemon and his bride until they were overthrown by its current ruler, Cinderella's Fairy Godmother. Night lasts for six months in Ultima Thule.Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love *Oz – Also known as the Emerald Kingdom, from the classic Wizard of Oz series by L. Frank Baum. It and surrounding kingdoms are controlled by the Nome King.Fables 101: The Ascent The Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and Dorothy were imprisoned at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village until Jack Horner helped them escape.Jack of Fables: The Big Book of War Princess Ozma escaped and is currently a member of Fabletown's coven of magicians, witches and sorcerers.Fables: Witches It is revealed that a road is being constructed through the Deadly Desert linking Oz properly to surrounding lands and kingdoms.

Because the land is inhabited by toys from the mundane world,Fables 118: Cubs in Toyland, Chapter 5 it is possible that Toyland is not actually part of the Homelands, but part of another, alternate reality. *The Hidden Kingdom – The homelands version of Japan. The people of The Hidden Kingdom lived side by side with creatures from Japanese mythology, including the funa yurei,Fairest 09: The Hidden Kingdom, Chapter Two kappas, the legendary tanuki, kitsune, kirinFairest 11: The Hidden Kingdom, Chapter Four and assorted yokai. It was ruled by an Emperor, who is referred to as Heika, a term used to identify the emperor in Japanese. The Hidden Kingdom was conquered by the Adversary after the Seii Taishogun was secretly laying the way for an invasion. Many of the kingdom's citizens are living in exile in a secret Fable community in Tokyo. *The Roman Empire – While searching for her lost children, Rapunzel witnessed the birth of an empire, when she found a she-wolf suckling the infant Romulus and Remus.Fairest 10: The Hidden Kingdom, Chapter Three *The Kingdom of a Thousand Hills – A homeworld of African origin.

Never shown or referred to, except for a vague reference to Looking-Glass Land in the \\"who's who\\" in the Jack of Fables trade paperback Jack of Hearts, which refers to Alice as \\"a survivor of several adventures through a looking-glass, including a meal of questionable mushrooms\\". These lands are assumed to have been conquered since numerous playing cards and the Cheshire Cat are residents of Fabletown.Fables 6: Animal Farm, Chapter One Alice,Jack of Fables 2: The (Nearly) Great Escape, Part Two the Mad Hatter, the Dormouse and the March Hare,Jack of Fables 27: Turning Pages, Part Three the Walrus and the Carpenter (and the oysters they seem not to have eaten yet)Jack of Fables 1: The (Nearly) Great Escape, Part One were held prisoner at the Golden Boughs Retirement Village. Humpty Dumpty is also a prisoner and a violet/pink caterpillar (which may or may not be the Caterpillar) is shown eating a leaf while Humpty Dumpty tries to convince Jack Horner to let him escape with the others.Jack of Fables 3: The (Nearly) Great Escape, Part Three The Vorpal Sword is now Fabletown property, and has been referred to as the Jabberwock's bane.Fables 3: Legends in Exile, Chapter Three This could imply that Tulgey Wood has been conquered as well.  Places  *Keep at the End of the World – From East of the Sun and West of the Moon, this was the setting for The Last Castle, where the last Fable refugees escaped from to the Mundy world. *The Black Forest – Located in the Hesse and former home to Bigby Wolf, Frau Totenkinder and a whole array of malign spirits, ogres and bogeymen. It is not known whether the Forest itself was taken over by the Empire, because the Hessians themselves do not dare to enter it. The rest of the Hesse, on the contrary, was indeed conquered. In Peter and Max: A Fables Novel, it is revealed that the Adversary's troops did enter the Black Forests on numerous occasions (to try to hunt The Big Bad Wolf, as well as to travel to Hamelin). *Camelot – Appears in flashbacks in the story arc The Good Prince. According to the ghost of Sir Lancelot, the legend of Camelot and its fabled King Arthur set the standard of \\"true chivalry\\" for all of christendom and its legend touched much of the pagan worlds beyond. Lancelot's betrayal would eventually lead to Camelot's downfall.Fables 62: The Good Prince, Chapter Two *The Kingdom of Haven – The home of Flycatcher, they were shown being taken in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. Recently, he has returned there with his new army of ghosts and has set it up as a place of refuge for anyone wishing to escape the Adversary's control. He has become a consistent thorn in the Adversary's side, having defeated much of the Adversary's forces, including turning all of the Empire's wooden soldiers into a new enchanted grove, taking out the Empire's best fighters. *The Lands of Beauty and the Beast – These are assumed taken because Beast refers to their lands as \\"forever lost in the Homelands\\", in the Legends in Exile story arc. *The Lands of Old King Cole – These were shown being taken in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. *The Lands of King Noble – From the Reynard stories, these were shown as captured in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. Reynard helped most of the animals escape the invading forces. *Nottingham – Directly mentioned as being captured in The Last Castle, it was Robin Hood's home. *Colchester – Humpty Dumpty from Jack of Fables was a cannon for the Homelands version of the Siege of Colchester.Jack of Fables 5: The (Nearly) Great Escape, Chapter Five *Toad Hall – From Wind in the Willows, it is directly mentioned as being taken in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. Badger, Toad and Mole all escaped, and many assume Stinky the Badger on the Farm is in fact the same character as Mr. Badger. *Atlantis – The underwater kingdom of mermaids was shown being conquered in 1001 Nights of Snowfall. The only known survivor is Mersey Dotes, now turned into a mermaid. *Red City – Mentioned by the Snow Queen. Red City Plague originates from this City.Fables 53: Sons of Empire, Part Two Red City Plague might possibly allude to Edgar Allan Poe's Masque of the Red Death. *Bald Mountain – From Modest Mussorgsky's play. Directly mentioned in Jack of Fables. It is home to Chernobog, one of the Devils Jack made a deal with to prolong his life.Jack of Fables 16: Jack O Lantern *Rome – The Fabled version of the capital of Italy.

These lands were conquered by the Adversary's forces.Jack of Fables 36: Jack 'n' Apes *The Hundred Acre Wood – In the Jack of Fables story Jack 'n' Apes, a character looking remarkably similar to Winnie the Pooh (but drawn slightly differently, as Winnie the Pooh is currently under copyright) can be seen in flashbacks from the Homelands, barbecuing marshmallows with the sock monkey Saunders in what appears to be the Hundred Acre Wood. They were described as living in \\"blissful simplicity\\". In the works of author A. A. Milne, Sanders is the name of the person who resided at Pooh's home prior to Pooh making it his house, and Winnie the Pooh and several other characters from the books were based on the stuffed toys of Milne's son. Saunders and his friends were driven from their homes when the Adversary invaded, and Saunders ended up in Africa in the mundane world, along with the rest of the \\"civilized apes\\" that Jack Horner claims to have met. Winnie the Pooh and Piglet apparently made it to the Farm. Both make an obscure appearance in Fables: In part five of the Animal Farm story arc, when the foiled revolution threatens to flare up again, Pooh and Piglet appears in two panels, from a distance when Boy Blue tells everyone to move back, and then from behind in the following panel.Fables 10: Animal Farm, Chapter Five *Prospero's IslandFables 90: Witches, Chapter Four – The Island which is the setting of William Shakespeare's the Tempest.

Kansas is referred to in Cinderella: Fables Are Forever and was the former home of Dorothy Gale As could be expected from the Homelands, things are not so normal as they should be. The Idyll area seems to be populated entirely by zombies, all being loyal to the Bookburner (who is the head librarian of Americana, the library being located in Idyll),Jack of Fables 18: Americana, Part Two while the Great White North seems to represent how America views Canada and Alaska, as it is very clean, ice hockey being the biggest form of amusement and, according to Jack, having horrible bacon. Untouched by The Adversary's forces, Americana possesses advanced technology compared with the conquered European worlds where the absence of modern arms is crucial to sustain the ruling system. Vehicles and appliances seen are cars from the 1920s, steamtrains, various firearms and even modern household appliances.Jack of Fables 20: Americana, Part Four Besides, the only known way to enter Americana is by dressing as a vagrant and jumping on a train.Jack of Fables 17: Americana, Part One It is also quite possible that other areas are near or on Americana that resemble ancient Mesoamerica or Latin America.

The particular advantage of this type of approach is that it allows advantage to be taken of existing software for generating random variates from other, usually non- uniform, distributions. However, faster algorithms may be obtainable for the same distributions by other more complicated approaches. A number of distributions can be expressed in terms of the (possibly weighted) sum of two or more random variables from other distributions. (The distribution of the sum is the convolution of the distributions of the individual random variables).  Example  Consider the problem of generating a random variable with an Erlang distribution, X\\\\ \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Erlang}(k, \\\\theta). Such a random variable can be defined as the sum of k random variables each with an exponential distribution \\\\operatorname{Exp}(k \\\\theta) \\\\,.

It is an ability to use diverse techniques to collaborate across different social groups. Transliteracy combines a range of capabilities required to move across a range of contexts, media, technologies and genres. Conceptually, transliteracy is situated across five capabilities: information capabilities (see information literacy), ICT (information and communication technologies), communication and collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. It is underpinned by literacy and numeracy. (See figure below) The concept of transliteracy is impacting the system of education and libraries. right History While the term appears to come from the prefix 'trans-' (across) and the word 'literacy', the scholars who coined it say they developed it from the practice of transliteration, which means to use the letters of one language to write down a different language. The study of transliteracy was first developed in 2005 by the Transliteracies Research Project, directed by University of California at Santa Barbara Professor Alan Liu. The concept of 'transliteracies' was developed as part of research into online reading. It was shared and refined at the Transliteracies conference, held at UC Santa Barbara in 2005. The conference inspired the at the time De Montfort University Professor, Sue Thomas, to create the Production in Research and Transliteracy (PART) group, which evolved into the Transliteracy Research Group. The current meaning of transliteracy was defined in the group's seminal paper Transliteracy: crossing divides as \\"the ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools, and media from signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV, radio, and film, to digital social networks.\\" The concept was enthusiastically adopted by a number of professional groups, notably in the library and information field. Transliteracy Research Group Archive 2006-2013 curates numerous resources from this period. For a number of years, there was a gap between significant interest in transliteracy among professional groups and the scarcity of research. A group of academics from the University of Bordeaux considered transliteracy mainly in the school context. Freelance writer and consultant, Sue Thomas, studied transliteracy and creativity, while Suzana Sukovic, executive director of educational research and evidence-based practice at HETI, researched transliteracy in relation to digital storytelling. The first book on the topic, Transliteracy in complex information environment by Sukovic, is based on research and experience with practice-based projects.  Transliteracy in Education  Transliteracy is making an impact on the classroom setting because of how technologically advanced younger generations are today. In 2012, Adam Marcus, a teacher and librarian at NYCDOE, decided to incorporate transliteracy into his school's public library summer reading program. He had a desire to enhance the experience of reading for his students by allowing them to connect to the text differently by using social media. He used a tool called \\"VoiceThread\\" in order to have his students \\"take part in conversations, formulate ideas, and share higher-order thinking through a variety of media channels: video, audio, text, images, and music (Marcus, 2013).\\" Students were also enabled to communicate with the book's author through blogs and websites, and were given multiple modes of media to comprehend and engage with the text on a deeper level. Some of these examples include an audio-video glossary and web links that aimed to bring the details of the text to life. The results of his experiment were deemed to have a positive effect on the program as students responded well to this interactive experience they were given. Marcus believes that it is important for educators and librarians to enhance storytelling for children by providing them with a modern and transliterate experience that one could not receive back then. The Agence nationale de la recherche funded a program at a French high school from 2013 to 2015, where the transliteracy skills of students were tested and observed. Students were placed in groups of three or four members and were required to use all sorts of media and tools in order to collect data for their projects. They were not allowed to only use digital sources, and were advised to use a diversity of sources. The focus of this experiment was to observe \\"the possible diversity of media and tools employed, on the ways of and reasons for switching from one to another, on how these different media and tools are distributed within contexts, according to the academic requirements and tasks individually and collectively performed by the students. (Aillerie, 2017).\\" The conclusions of the experiment dealt with physical space and organization being an issue for students and teachers to deal with. Spatially, it was challenging for students to navigate through different mediums when their space inside the classroom was limited. It was noticed that students were prone to use something that took up less space, rather than focusing on expanding their diversity of sources. Organizationally, it was challenging for students to organize all of the information they collected since everything was not being search and collected for digitally. In addition, students were not allotted a lot of time to complete their projects which also impacted their final product.  Transliteracy in Libraries  In 2009, Dr. Susie Andretta, senior lecturer in Information Management at London Metropolitan University, conducted interviews with four different information professionals including an academic librarian, an outreach librarian, a content manager, and a scholar within the library science and information discipline. She was aiming to explore how transliteracy was colliding and combining with the print-world of libraries. Dr. Andretta defines transliteracy as \\"an umbrella term encompassing different literacies and multiple communication channels that require active participation with and across a range of platforms, and embracing both linear and non-linear messages (3).\\" The goals of these interviews ranged from the following: to test the information professional's awareness of transliteracy, to have them identify transliteracy and how it is integrated into their work, and to explain the impact transliteracy has had on they library they work at. Andretta found that out of all the information professionals interviewed, it was only the academic librarian who was vaguely familiar with the concept of transliteracy. Bernadette Daly Swanson, an Academic Librarian at UC Davis, expresses in her interview with Dr. Andretta how she would \\"like to think that the transliterate library is more of an environment where we do different things [...] I would take maybe about a third of the first floor of our library and transform it into a lab [...] where we can start to evolve [..] explore, and experiment in media development, content development, and do it not just with librarians; so open up the space for other people [...] so you don't get people working in isolation.\\" Although the other three candidates that Dr. Andretta interviewed had not heard of the term \\"transliteracy,\\" they responded well to the concept once it was explained to them and agreed with its impact on the workplace. Dr. Michael Stephens, an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at Dominican University, explains in his interview how the term transliteracy describes the courses he teaches on libraries and Web 2.0 technologies. Dr. Stephens states that students being educated in Web 2.0 technologies gives them \\"the opportunity to experience what the channel can be and the potential for that sharing learning, for asking questions, just for out loud thinking- I think it's incredibly valuable. [..] this is where this wonderful concept comes in, it was teaching them transliteracy and the fact that they can move across channels without getting worried about it (Andretta, 5).\\" Dr. Andretta concluded from her interviews how although transliteracy may not be a very well-known term yet, it has nonetheless established itself into the intuition of libraries while also transforming the traditional library to a world of enhanced and expanded services. \\"Inherent in this transition are the challenges of having to adapt to a constantly changing technological landscape, the multiple literacies that this generates, and the need to establish a multifaceted library profession that can speak the multiple-media languages of its diverse users (Andretta, 12).\\" Thomas Ipri, a librarian at the University of Nevada, advocates for libraries needing to make a change in their literary functions. He argues that the divide between digital and print makes it harder for libraries to accommodate their patrons and to share information. He focuses on how libraries need to establish their relationship with transliteracy because transliteracy \\"explores the participatory nature of new means of communicating, which breaks down barrier between academia and the wider community and calls into question standard notions of what constitutes authority by emphasizing the benefits of knowledge sharing via social networks.\\" Ipri argues how established experts are no longer the only ones in charge of producing and spreading information, but it is also the personal experiences and knowledge of people that are valuable in expanding and evolving bases. In what he describes, \\"the heart of librarianship,\\" it is the duty of librarians to undergo this development by modernizing their movements of communication and information. Relationship to other terms Related terms are \\"media and information literacy\\", \\"information literacy\\", \\"digital literacy\\", \\"multiliteracies\\" and \\"metaliteracy\\". Transliteracy is a unifying framework rather than a replacement of existing literacies. It considers \\"movement across\\" which requires a range of capabilities.

Description A specimen of common noctule. The short fur is dark brown after moulting in June (males) or July/August (females); later it changes to red-brown before the onset of winter.Braun M. & Dieterlen F. 2003 When awake, the body temperature is but it decreases significantly during inactivity.Kulzer E. 1967 The body mass of adult N noctula is and they have a wingspan of . The species forages with a rapid flying speed of , sometimes up to . Because of temporally limited availability of insect prey, they have short daily activity periods before sunrise and after sunset of in total one hour or less and so must cope with up to twenty-three hours of fasting a day.Dechmann, D. K., Wikelski, M., Varga, K., Yohannes, E., Fiedler, W., Safi, K., Burkhard, W.-D. and O'Mara, M. T. 2014. Distribution Most parts of Europe, central Russia, across the Ural mountain, Caucasus, Turkey, the Near East, to southwestern parts of Siberia, the Himalayas, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Japan. In Bulgaria it is widespread, prefers deciduous forests.\\"Nyctalus noctula\\", Science for Nature Foundation Biology =Reproduction and migration= Common noctules roosting in the crevice of a building. The common noctule is a migrating species with female bias, meaning that the females migrate but the males do not.Petit E. & Mayer F. 1999.Popa-Lisseanu A. G. & Voigt C. C. 2009. Mating season is in late summer in the wintering areas, and the females store the sperm in the uterus during hibernation until fertilization in spring. During early pregnancy in late April the females migrate north, as far as the Baltic region, to return to their natal maternity colonies and give birth after being pregnant for six to eight weeks. Each female rears one or two young per year.Racey P. 1982. At birth the offspring is about a third of the maternal body weight, and after three to four weeks of suckling the young leave the roost almost fully developed – so the female rears the offspring to full size entirely on milk.Kurta A., Johnson K. A. and Kunz T. H. 1987. Male N noctula do not migrate, but scatter along the females' migration routes to have higher chances of attracting the first females migrating back to the wintering regions. The reproductive cycle of male bats seems to correspond directly to season and food availability and spermatogenesis can be affected by body condition.Speakman J. & Racey P. 1986. In early autumn, males develop large testes and aim to attract females with singing calls. While in the harem roosts, males often do not enter torpor, but stay awake and mobile to defend the females from other males trying to copulate. Another reason for the avoidance of torpor during late summer and early autumn can be that spermatogenesis in bats can be delayed when resting metabolic rate is depressed, i.e. during torpor and hibernation.Kurta A. & Kunz T. H. 1988. During the summer, male noctules are solitary or form small bachelor groups. In Europe, the young are reared mainly in the northern parts of the distribution area, north of roughly 48°–49°N latitude.Strelkov, P.P. 1997. With the exception of the main breeding area, several smaller and isolated breeding areas are known – recorded in Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Iberian Peninsula and Italy.Görföl, T., Dombi, I., Boldogh, S., & Estók, P. 2009. =Hibernation= Common noctule bats hibernate in winter, and sometimes congregate in hibernation colonies of up to 1000 individuals. In late summer the adult females migrate back southwards to the wintering areas, the young following later. Hibernation at these latitudes is thought to avoid too many days in winter below .McNab, B. K. 1982. At the beginning of winter, usually in November (but this is strongly dependent on the ambient temperatures), N noctula start to hibernate in large groups with both sexes in the same roost. Tree holes are not warm enough so they use caves, objects like church steeples or blocks of flats in Eastern Europe,Ceľuch M. & Kaňuch P. 2005. where they are most common hibernating bat species in the cities. Sometimes summer territories and hibernating places are hundreds of kilometres apart. =Diet= When hunting, it often starts flying in early dusk, earlier than most European bats. It flies high above the forested areas that are its preferred habitat, reaching speeds of up to . Common noctule bats mainly eat beetles, moths and winged ants. =Echolocation= The common noctule uses two main calls for echolocation. The frequencies of the first are 26–47 kHz, have most energy at 27 kHz and an average duration of 11.5ms.Parsons, S. & Jones, G. 2000. The frequency of the second call is 22–33 kHz, having most energy at 22 kHz and an average duration of 13.8ms.Obrist, M.K., Boesch, R. and Flückiger, P.F. 2004. Range and habitat Common noctule ('Nyctalus noctula). An individual from the population in the Seeburgpark near Konstanz (Germany). Small to medium-sized woodlands are preferred but they may forage up to from the woodland at night. When roosting through the day, the noctule bat usually seeks out tree holes or even bat boxes attached to tree trunks. Generally, noctule bats live in wooded habitats, but some populations can be found in towns. There are many noctules in Hamburg, Vienna, Brno and some other central European cities. Conservation This species is protected in the European Union under the Habitats Directive. It is also listed in the Berne Convention and is specifically targeted by the UNEP-EUROBATS convention. Several national legislatures also protect this species and its habitats. In order to highlight the importance of protecting this species at the European scale, it was selected as \\"Bat species of the Year\\" 2016 and 2017 by the pan- European NGO BatLife Europe.

It is at the border Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany. With an elevation of , Mount Fumaiolo overlooks the villages of Balze di Verghereto, Bagno di Romagna and Verghereto, in Romagna, and thanks to its extensive fir and beech forests, it is a well-appreciated tourist area of natural interest. It is most famous for being the source of the Tiber, as well as the river Savio. The Springs of the river Tiber The source of the river Tiber (Tevere in Italian) consisted of two springs a few meters away from each other on the Mount Fumaiolo steeps. Although nowadays only one spring remains active, the area is still called \\"Le Vene del Tevere\\". The spring is located in a beautiful beech forest at 1,268 meters above sea level on the Southern steeps of Mount Fumaiolo, near the village of Balze di Verghereto in the Emilia Romagna region. In 1927, under Benito Mussolini dictatorship an antique marble column from the Roman Forum was placed on the spot, with an inscription on it: QUI NASCE IL FIUME SACRO AI DESTINI DI ROMA (\\"Here springs the river / sacred to the destinies of Rome\\"), to mark the association of the Fascist regime with the ancient Roman empire. A Roman eagle stands on the top of the column, and three wolf heads holding a ring in their mouths are visible on the sides. In its first kilometers the river Tiber runs in Emilia Romagna, then it enters in Valtiberina, in Tuscany, before crossing the Umbria region and the Lazio region and Rome. After 405 kilometers, the river Tiber pours its waters into the Tirrenian sea. The Tiber is the third Italian river by length (after the rivers Po and Adige), and the second per water discharge, after the river Po.

Like numerous other friendly societies of the time, its principal aim was the sharing of secret knowledge linked to the profession and mutual aid. In the 19th century, its activities of mutual insurance became predominant. By the end of the 20th century, it had become almost entirely extinct. In 1849, The Ancient Order of Free Gardeners Scotland formed at Penicuik. In 1956, due to falling attendances in Scotland, the Grand Lodge charter was transferred to Cape Town, South Africa. In September 2005, the Ancient Order returned to Scotland when the Countess of Elgin Lodge no. 105 received its Charter to meet in Dysart, Fife. 2006 sees the return of the Grand Lodge of Free Gardeners Scotland from Cape Town to Scotland. Although the Free Gardeners have always remained independent of Freemasonry, the history and organisation of the two orders show numerous similarities. Some commentators have pointed to possible mutual influences in the ancient history of the two organisations.Robert L.D. Cooper, Les francs- jardiniers Ivoire Clair (ed)(2000) 2–8 History The most ancient evidence of the order is a record of the minutes of the Haddington lodge, opened 16 August 1676, which begins with a compilation of fifteen rules called Interjunctions for ye Fraternity of Gardiners of East Lothian.Interjunctions for ye Fraternity of Gardiners of East Lothian Edzell Castle's walled garden, Scotland, dates back to 1604. Scotland was, in the 17th century, subject to civil unrest and intermittent famines. Rich landowners were interested in Renaissance architecture and the design of formal gardens for their vast estates. The first members of the Haddington lodge were not gardeners by profession, but small landowners and farmers who practised gardening for pleasure. Not practising an urban profession, they could not obtain the status of an incorporation (similar to a guild in England) and modelled their organisation on the masons, who had an organisation, additional to and independent of their incorporation: the lodge.Robert L D Cooper , op. cit., pp. 11–24 This organisation set up in Haddington could be viewed as a primitive form of trade union. It organised co-operation between members, provided practical training and ethical development, and supported the poor, widows, and orphans. The lodges of gardeners were also the first to organise floral exhibitions, from 1772. About 1715, a lodge similar to Haddington was founded in Dunfermline, supported by two members of the local aristocracy, the Earl of Moray and the Marquess of Tweeddale. From its origin, it admitted numerous non-gardeners as members. It created a charitable society to benefit the widows, orphans, and poor of the lodge, sponsored a horse race and organised an annual horticultural fair before transforming itself little by little into a mutual aid society. It reached a membership of 212. The lodges of Haddington and Dunfermline expanded their recruitment area widely without authorising creation of new lodges. It was only in 1796 that three new lodges were created: at Arbroath, Bothwell, and Cumbnathan.Robert L D Cooper , op. cit., pp. 87–93 During the 18th century, about twenty other lodges were created, always in Scotland, and on 6 November 1849, they organised a meeting with a view to create a Grand Lodge. Establishments then accelerated, and in 1859, in Edinburgh, the Grand Lodge gathered representatives from more than 100 lodges, including three established in the USA. At the peak of the movement there were more than 10,000 Free Gardeners for the Lothians alone, belonging to more than 50 lodges.Free Gardeners of the Lothians and Fife at HistoryShelf.org (consulted 8 April 2007) Encouraged by this success, competing horticultural societies appeared during the 19th century. Unlike the Free Gardeners, they did not have a charitable role, mutual help, or rituals, and they would accept anybody, male or female, who paid their dues. Free Gardener regalia on display in Edinburgh In the 20th century, the two World Wars called up most of the members. The economic crisis of 1929 weakened their charitable capacities. The social protection laws weakened the attraction of mutual aid, before the National Insurance Act 1946 removed their entire purpose. Even before the Second World War, the number of deaths exceeded the number of admissions to the lodges. In 1939, the minutes of the Haddington lodge were interrupted until 1952, when its eight last members attempted in vain to relaunch it. Despite the recruitment of new members, the Haddington fraternity pronounced its dissolution on 22 February 1953.The Fraternity of Gardeners of East Lothian at HistoryShelf.org (checked 8 April 2007) The Dunfermline lodge lasted until the middle of the 1980s.The Society of Gardeners in and about Dunfermline at HistoryShelf.org (checked 8 April 2007) These disappearances were part of a wider social change. In 1950 there were around 30,000 Friendly Societies in the UK, while in 2000 there were fewer than 150.Friendly societies at HistoryShelf.org (checked 8 April 2007) In 2000, the research of R. Cooper counted no more than a single lodge (in Bristol) for Great Britain, but mentioned the survival of the Order of Free Gardeners in the Antilles (Caribbean British Order of Free Gardners) and in Australia. In 2002, a conservation society was created in Scotland with aims of research and conservation of the traditions of this Order and some lodges were revived on this occasion.Adelphi Bluebell Lodge (consulted 13 March 2007) As of 2013, The Grand United Order of Free Gardeners still operates in Victoria, Australia from the East Kew Masonic Centre. It meets monthly under the auspices of the Victorian Grand Lodge No. 1, and is the only known lodge operating in the southern hemisphere. Ritual Fraternity documents from the end of the 17th century reveal no trace of secret knowledge or rituals. However, the interest rapidly shown by the members of the aristocracy suggests this association did not exclusively deal with mutual assurance.R. Cooper, op. cit., pp. 27–40 The oldest known mention of the existence of an initiation secret in this order appears on 28 January 1726, when the fraternity studied an internal complaint that accused one of its members of defaming certain of its officers in saying they could not correctly give its words and signs. In 1772, other documents established that the fraternity of the Free Gardeners had 'Words' and 'Secrets'. An 1848 document mentions a teaching, in the form of 'Signs, Secrets and Grips'. Historians have at their disposal complete rituals of the Apprentice, Companion and Master dating from 1930. Minutes of the lodges show that the ritual of the order progressively developed, from a fairly basic ceremony of transmission of the 'Word' at its very beginnings, to a system of three grades similar to that of Freemasonry at the end of the 19th century. Garden of Eden Paradisi in Sole (1629) by John Parkinson A conference of 1873 indicates that Free Gardening used the cultivation of soil as the symbol of the nurturing of the spirit in intelligence and virtue and made reference to the Garden of Eden. *The admission ritual of the Free Gardeners' apprentices shows many similarities to that of Freemason apprentices. Adam could thus symbolically be the first Free Gardener. Use is made of the compass and the square, to which is added the knife, presented as 'the simplest tool of gardening', allowing 'pruning the vices and propagating virtues by cuttings'. At the end of this ceremony, the apprentice received the apron of his grade. *The second degree made reference to Noah, the 'second Gardener' and made the Companion symbolically accomplish a voyage that led him towards the Garden of Eden then towards that of Gethsemane. *The third degree made reference to Solomon, the 'third Gardener', and to the symbol of the olive tree. The aprons are of two types: * Long aprons, reaching the ankle, embroidered with numerous symbols relating to the legends of the order.Regalia and Ritual and symbols (checked 19 March 2007) * Shorter aprons, with a semi-circular bib, strongly resembling the aprons of the Freemasons of Scotland.R. Cooper, op. cit., p. 45 That of the president is embroidered with the letters P, G, H, E, initials of Pishon, Gihon, Hiddekel (Tigris) and Euphrates (the four rivers of the Garden of Eden) and A, N, S, initials of Adam, Noah and Solomon, to which is added the letter O, probably for 'Olive'. Generally, the symbolism used by the Free Gardeners seems to have been strongly influenced during the 19th century by that of Freemasonry.Free Gardeners and Freemasons at HistoryShelf.org (consulted 18 March 2007) On numerous objects of the order dating from the very beginning of the 20th century, one finds an emblem composed of a square, a compass and a grafting knife. As there is not a trace of this emblem in the earlier documents, it is probable that it had also been inspired lately by that of Freemasonry.R. Cooper, op. cit., pp. 42–46 The first members There is little information on the professions of the members before the end of the 17th century. During this period the Haddington lodge included merchants, tailors and clerks as well as gardeners. All the members of the lodge were originally from the county. On the other hand, the lodge at Dunfermline, former capital of Scotland, prided itself on counting among its members \\"numerous renowned persons of Edinburgh, as well as East Lothian including the Marquess of Tweeddale, the count of Haddington (Earl of Haddington), Lord William Hay etc\\".R. Cooper, op. cit., pp. 47–77 The first record of the Dunfermline lodge was established in 1716 with the signatures of 214 members. At this time the membership was composed of a majority of gardeners by trade, but also numerous artisans and two members of the local aristocracy. Rapidly, the membership grew and the social level rose—to the point that the professional gardeners no longer formed the majority of new members—but the recruitment remained local. In 1721, 101 new members of all social statuses were admitted into the lodge, from gardeners and butchers to the Duke of Atholl. The following years saw a fairly large number of aristocrats initiated in Free Gardening in the Dunfermline lodge, even while they remain on the edge of the Haddington lodge, which remains mainly active. Most of these people possess famous gardens. Starting from 1736, the date of the creation of the (Masonic) Grand Lodge of Scotland, this tendency ceased and there were no more initiations of aristocrats in the Dunfermline lodge. Religiously, all the members of this time were Protestants and belonged to the Church of Scotland. Politically, on the other hand, there were all types. Comparisons with Freemasonry In the 1720s, Scotland had a profusion of societies, fraternities, and clubs. Freemasonry and the Order of Free Gardeners are merely those that spread the furthest and lasted the longest. Those two orders present important similarities concerning their organisation and development. Both were born in Scotland in the middle of the 17th century among groups of professional workers who very quickly accepted members from other professions. In both cases, members of the original profession became minorities from the beginning of the 18th century. In both orders also, certain lodges open very rapidly to 'accepted' members and in particular to the local nobility, whereas others, like that of Haddington for the Free Gardeners and that of Edinburgh for the Freemasons, are more reticent. Almost all known members who belonged to the two orders were Free Gardeners before becoming Freemasons. The largest group of Free Gardeners who later became Freemasons joined the Kilwinning Scots Arms Masonic lodge founded in 1729. There were nine members of the free gardeners Dunfermline lodge. None of them were gardeners by trade; they were aristocrats and soldiers. Freemasonry expanded rapidly in England and, after creation of the Grand Lodge in London in 1717, across the entire world. On the other hand, the Order of Free Gardeners remained principally Scottish. In both cases, the Scottish lodges seemed to have difficulties grouping together into larger structures called Grand Lodges. In the case of the Order of Free Gardeners, the first Grand Lodge only formed in 1849, and 15 lodges remained independent until the disappearance of the order. In both cases, it is in particular the lodges founded before their Grand Lodge that remain the most reluctant to renounce their independence. Miscellaneous Ancient Free Gardeners, an indie-rock band in Melbourne, Australia, takes its name from the Free Gardeners, though the group has no association. The inspiration came from a visit to the Melbourne branch of the Free Gardeners, situated in Elizabeth Street, one block north of the Victoria Market. Whilst the Free Gardeners no longer meet at that location, the building still bears its logo and inscription.

In 2005 the school was incorporated by virtue of an Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Government of the United States of America.  Overview  The Anglo-American School of Sofia (AAS) was established in 1967 for children from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Charter permits the School to enroll children from other diplomatic missions and generally from the international community in Sofia. The Anglo-American School of Sofia is a member of the Central & Eastern European Schools Association CEESA, as well as The Council of British International Schools (COBIS) and The European Council of International Schools (ECIS). The school is accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). AAS-Sofia is an authorized International Baccalaureate World School. The Anglo-American School is governed by a Board of Directors which consists of nine members - four appointed by the American Ambassador, four by the British Ambassador and the elected President of the Parent Teacher Organization. First Snow of the year at AAS  Campus  In September 2006 AAS moved into its new campus near Sofia. The school now boasts 7 hectares of land, about 70% of which are green areas. The Building won major architecture awards in Bulgaria such as Building of the year (2006) and Most sustainable building (2010).http://www.aas-sofia.org/page.cfm?p=517  Enrollment  Student Demographics 2016-17 Anglo-American School of Sofia is the largest international school in Bulgaria, with over 500 students. The students come from over 40 countries and the staff from more than 10. This gives AAS a very international culture and environment. Some students are enrolled into the school for short period of time because of the nature of their parent's occupation and some stay in the school from K-12.  Curriculum  The Anglo- American School curriculum seeks to combine elements of the American and British programs and emphasizes on individualized instruction. Based on students’ age the school is organized into three major sections - Elementary (Preschool – Grade 5), Middle (Grades 6-8) and High School (Grades 9 – 12). Through Grade 5 the homeroom teachers are responsible for the four core areas of English (Language Arts), mathematics, science and social studies and follow recently revised curricula. In Grades 6 and 10 there is more specialized departmental teaching. At all levels the core program is supported by programs in Art, French (from Grade 1), Spanish, ICT, Music and Physical Education. AAS Class The curriculum has four core elements: Language & Literacy, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. The curriculum is supported by a range of computer hardware and software and by a library. There is an intensive ESL program from Grades 1-5 and a flexible resource program for students with some limited learning disabilities. = Elementary school = The AAS Elementary School teaches Kindergarten through to grade 5. The curriculum encompasses Mathematics, Language Arts, Social Studies and Science and also regular specialist teaching in subjects such as Art, Music, ICT and Physical Education. Although the language of instruction is English, Bulgarian and French are offered as world language options. Enjoying the sun = Middle school = In order to facilitate the transition from elementary to middle school, grade 6 students are self-contained and taught by two core teachers. Students see specialist teachers for all other subjects. In grades 7 and 8, all students are taught by specialist teachers and benefit from a cohesive and diverse curriculum. The academic program is designed to ensure smooth transitions between all three areas of the school, from the elementary to the middle school and finally to the high school. The curriculum in grades 6, 7 and 8 continues to offer Mathematics, Science, English, Social studies, Physical Education, French and ESL.

She lived between c.1660 and 1729. The Gaelic name Sìleas is anglicised variously as Cicely or Julia. Life Sìleas came from a landowning family within the clan system still prevalent in the Highlands at the time. She was the daughter of the 15th Chief of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, Archibald (Gilleasbuig) Macdonald, and Mary Macmartin of the Macmartin Camerons. Her brother Coll was 16th Chief. Although the family of Keppoch had lost some status, they were still considered to be in the upper levels of Gaelic society. She was married to Alexander Gordon of Camdell, estate factor to the Duke of Gordon, and lived much of her adult life at Beldorney Castle, Banffshire, although she grew up in Lochaber.

It was a medieval seat and later a Renaissance residence of the princely House of Hohenlohe.  History  The castle was built in the 12th century as the first seat of the Lords of Hohenlohe. The exact year is not known, however the first mentioned family member was Conrad of Weikersheim in 1153. The family soon built further castles nearby, Hohlach (to become Hohenlohe) and Brauneck. In 1586, three brothers divided the protestant part of the county of Hohenlohe, with their main seats being Weikersheim, Langenburg and Neuenstein. The following year Wolfgang, Count of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim, moved here and reconstructed the medieval castle into a Renaissance palace, together with his wife Magdalena of Nassau-Dillenburg, a younger sister of William the Silent of Orange. The tall tower, the bergfried, however was kept as a symbol of its history. The new castle was competed in 1605. When Count Carl Ludwig inherited Weikersheim in 1709, he began to redecorate the apartments and gardens in their preserved baroque forms. When he died around 1760, his lands were divided between the Langenburg and Neuenstein branches. After World War II, Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, invited his cousin, Prince Constantin (1893-1973), an artist, to live in the castle and the latter restored it to its old glory. He also organized operas and concerts. After Langenburg Castle was heavily damaged by fire in 1963, Prince Kraft was forced to sell Weikersheim Palace to the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1967. Today the palace is a museum, but also home to the Jeunesses Musicales Germany during the summer and the Weikersheim Think Tank, a conservative think tank. It is also used for large gatherings and weddings. Visitors can tour parts of the Renaissance palace and the Baroque garden with many statues.

The source of the river is in the Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennine mountains in the Metropolitan City of Florence (which is in the Tuscany region of Italy). The river flows northeast and crosses the border into the province of Forlì-Cesena and passes through the localities of San Benedetto in Alpe, Portico di Romagna, Bocconi, Rocca San Casciano, Dovadola, Castrocaro, Terra del Sole and Forlì. Near Forlì, the river receives the waters of the Rabbi and curves northwest. It then flows northeast again and forms the border between the province of Forlì-Cesena and the province of Ravenna before flowing into the province of Ravenna. The river curves eastward and is joined by the Bidente- Ronco south of Ravenna. The combined rivers are known as the Uniti. The Battle of Ravenna was fought near the confluence with the Ronco in 1512. Also famous is the Acquacheta stream, mentioned by Dante Alighieri in his Divine Comedy.

He is the founder and former chairman of e-Bay. A philanthropreneur is an entrepreneurial philanthropist. The term is claimed to be coined by Internet entrepreneur Mark Desvaux in 2004;Magic Moments: Become a Philanthropreneur however, The Wall Street Journal used the term in a 1999 article,World Wide Words - Philanthropeneur and a publication entitled The Philanthropreneur Newsletter existed as far back as 1997.Word Spy - Philanthropreneur Philanthropreneurship is often considered the start of a new era in philanthropy, characterized by the development of the philanthropist’s role and the integration of business practices. The core objective of philanthropreneurship is to increase the philanthropic impact of non-profit organizations. Traditionally non-profit organization solely depended on donations, grants, or other forms of charitable-giving. However, this new generation of entrepreneurs prefers to invest rather than donate. Philanthropreneurs are active donors whose role surpasses that of check writers. They leverage their resources to achieve social change that is both scalable and sustainable. As a result, their contribution is meant to go beyond providing temporary \\"band-aid\\" solutions. Instead of directing efforts toward the purchase of medicine for the sick and the supply of food for the hungry, philanthropreneurs seek to eradicate the problem. Description Philanthropreneurs are people who bring a creative or entrepreneurial approach to philanthropy. They are interested in effecting positive changes in the world and alleviating suffering, and do so in new and creative ways. Philanthropreneurs are often \\"driven to do good and have their profit, too\\", as Stephanie Strom wrote in a New York Times article.What’s Wrong With Profit? - New York Times Theoretical framework of philanthropreneurship  As an emerging field there is no defined operating model or strategic approach. Still, philanthropreneurship marks the transitions from a grant-distributing model to a business-based model with predefined objectives and constant focus on quantifiable results. This form of “commercial giving” demands measurable return, which is why opportunities are assessed and evaluated according to different criteria. Factors such as profitability and quantifiable performance are fixed requirements for granting support. The shift in professional management has also resulted in a greater focus on long-term goals. The application of entrepreneurial practices in philanthropy drives the impact of connected non-profit organizations through strategic funding. Traditional philanthropy encouraged the promotion of social welfare exclusively through charitable giving. However, many well-intentioned projects fell through because of their disregard to set up revenue-generating strategies. In philanthropreneurship, prosperous ventures require the establishment of recurring income as a means of avoiding depletion of funds and ultimately preventing the social mission's dissolution. Philanthropic buying has a limited reach, which is why philanthropreneurs do not simply dispose of surplus funds, but strategically tailor investments by actively leveraging their resources (i.e. wealth, time, business expertise, networks, reputation, and prestige). For example, Pierre Omidyar, chairman of eBay, started Omidyar Network because of his dissatisfaction with the level of impact his donations had through conventional charities. Omidyar is an exemplar of how today’s philanthropists have taken on a greater role than their charitable predecessors. Apart from bringing their checkbook, affluent philanthropists are also expected to bring in their entrepreneurial know-how. Philanthropreneurship has been described as the emerging practice of driving social change in new and creative ways. The term has been in use since 2014. The Guardian on philanthropreneurship Practitioners — also known as philanthropreneurs or micro-preneurs — are entrepreneurial philanthropists. Philanthropreneurship is measured in impact, sustainability and scalability. Philanthropreneurship Forum Some practitioners — like Amr Al-Dabbagh in the Fortune article \\"How to Run Your Non-Profit Like a Startup\\" Fortune on How to Run Your Non-Profit Like a Startup — are deploying entrepreneurial business practices to help drive maximum impact, sustainability and scale. Philanthropreneurship Forum Additional examples of practitioners — featured in The Guardian article by Rajesh Chandy (\\"Welcome to the New Age of Philanthropy: PHILANTHROPRENEURSHIP\\") The Guardian on Welcome to the New Age of Philanthropy: PHILANTHROPRENEURSHIP—include Bill and Melinda Gates, Steve Case, Pierre Omidyar and Bill Clinton. Stephanie Strom featured these practitioners and more in her New York Times article \\"What's Wrong With Profit?\\" New York Times on What's Wrong With Profit? Philanthropreneurship is now supported by emerging new business models and legislation including low- profit limited liability companies (L3Cs), pioneered by tax attorney and entrepreneurial finance expert Marc J. Lane. Controversies Non-profit organizations have historically found it challenging to trust and accept the concept of \\"philanthro-capitalism\\". Critics note that many metrics of the commercial sectors, such as return on investment and other ratios, lack applicability to non-profit organizations. Moreover, the inclusion of commercial and enterprise strategies has generated concerns in maintaining the institution's culture and ideology. A particular concern is the risk that the organization's focus will shift away from the social mission. Nonetheless, its success has piqued the interest of an increasing number of non-profit organizations, but the performance assessment of philanthropreneurial ventures remains an area of concern for many, as there is no precise measurement for social impact. For example, in \\"impact investing\\", a core practice of philanthropreneurship, project selection for funding is based on estimated social impact and financial return. From an ethical context, many critics argue that the incorporation of a business model commercializes the nonprofit sector and further increases the risk of distorting the organization's mission and principles. Conversely, many supporters point out that traditional philanthropy alone cannot sustain social initiatives because of the shortage in sources of funding. In philanthropreneurship, a dependency in traditional fundraising is a strong predictor of failure, which is why historically the implementation of business practices enables philanthropreneurship to outperform age-old practices of philanthropy. 21st-century efforts Playpumps International is a nongovernmental organization (NGO) founded by Trevor Field. Today the Playpump-initiative is made up of two for-profit entities and one nonprofit. Playpump International is a nonprofit in the U.S. that is partnered with Roundabout Water Solutions, a manufacturing company in South Africa. The organization's mission is to promote public health in South Africa by providing easy access to clean, potable water in rural communities. Field designed a self-sustainable system that enabled water to be pumped into a storage tower. This model resulted in a mechanical water extraction process designed after a playground merry-go-round, which is attached to a water pump. Rotational energy generated by children playing is then used to fill the water storage tower. The system enhances living conditions and offers playing equipment for the young population. Since its invention, hundreds of water pump systems have been installed, particularly through the aid of monetary donations and governmental approvals. Before Playpumps attained global recognition, the organization had to be self-financed in order to ensure its continuity. Because of the infrequent number of charitable donations received and lack of fundraising sources, Field sought to generate an alternative flow of income. Income was generated by marketing contracts. Four-paneled billboards concealed the Playpump water storage towers and were used to display printed ads. The purpose of generating revenue was to recapitalize on the cost of the equipment (i.e. manufacturing and installation costs). With time, monetary donations increased significantly, and thus allowed for half of each tower's panels to be dedicated to promoting social messages, specifically HIV and AIDS awareness.

It was written by Sean Thompson and Chris Groom and Creative Directed by Tony Davidson and Kim Papworth. It features an actor (Simon Paisley Day) singing, riding and driving across the scenic shorelines and roads of New Zealand, Twin Ring Motegi in Japan, and the Iguazu Falls in South America.  Plot  A vintage record player starts playing a single, “Impossible Dream\\" by Andy Williams. A man reaches out for a jacket and crash helmet, and he sets forth from his trailer into a series of vintage Honda vehicles, starting with a diminutive minibike, and ending with a powerboat that leaps off the edge of a waterfall, emerging from the mist as a hot-air balloon with the Honda logo.  Details  The ad was part of a campaign developed by advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy London. Creative directors and contributors included Kim Papworth, Sean Thompson, Chris Groom, Tony Davidson, and agency producer Julia Methold. Director Ivan Zacharias and producer Nick Landon are from the film production company Stink where the ad is hosted. Director of photography was Jan Velicky. Editor was Filip Malasek, from Czech film editing company Robota. The original commercial was altered slightly for the England national football team's 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign. Flags displaying the St George's Cross were added to most scenes in the advert, such as on the back of the motorcycles and on the caravan shown at the beginning. In addition, the hot air balloon appearing at the end had a large George Cross on it, replacing the \\"Honda\\" text. The original advert, together with the England remake cost £4.5 million to produce. A making-of and karaoke version of the video were also made. This commercial was never released in the United States. The original version closed with a message addressed specifically to England, whilst the Australian version closes with a voice-over by Garrison Keillor saying \\"I couldn't have put it better myself\\" (This is now the standard version used in the United Kingdom). The music is Andy Williams singing \\"Impossible Dream (The Quest)\\" from the album 16 Most Requested Songs. The song is from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha. Songwriter Joe Darion won the 1965/66 Tony award for best Broadway lyrics. The last verses of the song are omitted to fit in two minutes.  2010 Extended Version  On 25 April 2010, an extended version debuted on the National Geographic Channel in The Netherlands.

Cradle of the King of Rome, Secular and Ecclesiastical Treasury, Vienna, Austria. Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot (1763–1850) was a French silversmith working in a neoclassical style. Business Maison Odiot, in English \\"House of Odiot\\", was established in 1690, during the reign of Louis XIV by Jean- Baptiste Gaspard Odiot, considered a fine silversmith. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte gave Jean-Baptiste Claude, grandson of Jean-Baptiste Gaspard, many prestigious commissions for himself and his family, such as the sacred scepter and sword and the King of Rome's cradle. Immense dinner services were ordered by Pauline Borghèse, by her mother and by the Emperor himself. Jean-Baptiste Claude was influenced by the return of the classical Greek and Egyptian motifs as expressed in the Directoire and Empire styles. Court commissions help further the reputation of Maison Odiot, and the firm provided vermeil services to courts across European. Charles Nicolas Odiot, who excelled in the rocaille style, succeeded his father and became the purveyor by appointment to His Majesty the King Louis-Philippe and to the Royal Family of Orleans. He was later succeeded by his son Gustave who received the House of Odiot's most important commission ever, id est, 3,000 pieces of solid gold flatware for Saïd Pacha, the Viceroy of Egypt. He later became the purveyor by appointment to the court of His Imperial Majesty the Tsar. Gustave was also the last member of the Odiot family to preside over the company. Works The only surviving work by him dating from before the French Revolution (1789–95) is a coffee urn (Monticello, Virginia, Jefferson Foundation) designed and commissioned by Thomas Jefferson. In 1802 he was awarded a gold medal in the third Exposition de l’Industrie in Paris. He executed a travelling service (c. 1795–1809) for Napoleon and a large table service (1798–1809; Munich, Residenz) for Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756–1825). Odiot’s most complex work was a set of dressing-table furniture made for Empress Marie Louise in 1810 (destr. 1832). =Cradle of the King of Rome= Among the most prominent commissions received by Odiot, was the Cradle of the King of Rome, a wood, bronze and silver gilt cradle given as a gift by the city of Paris to Napoleon and his wife Empress Marie-Louise, on the birth of their son Napoleon II. Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot (1763–1850) contributed to its making along with silversmith Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843) and is signed on two of the feet: Odiot et Thomire and Thomire et Odiot. It is in the Louvre today.

History The X SS Corps headquarters was formed in January 1945 with the use of men and equipment provided by the disbanded XIV SS Corps headquarters (a temporary HQ unit employed during Operation Nordwind). The Corps was subordinated to the 11th SS Panzer Army in February 1945, and then to the 3rd Panzer Army in March. They were deployed in the vicinity of Dramburg, Pomerania. In February 1945, the X SS Corps controlled the 5th Jäger Division and the 402nd Division. Generalleutnant Günther Krappe took command of the corps on 10 February 1945. In March 1945, the corps also had the 163rd Infantry Division under its control. In March 1945, the X SS Corps (and Korpsgruppe Tettau) were encircled by elements of the 1st Guards Tank Army, 3rd Shock Army, and the Polish 1st Army in an area approximately north of Dramburg. The two Soviet armies pushed against the pocket from the west and northwest while the Polish 1st Army drove from the south, east, and northeast, resulting in the destruction of the encircled German troops by 7 March 1945.

They are perhaps best known for their singles \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\" (1977, a cover of the hit by Tommy James & the Shondells), \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" (1979), and for the theme song to the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds. Although \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\", reaching No. 45 in 1977 has been their only charting hit, the group has a significant enduring cult following among fans of the power pop genre. History In November 1970, Tommy Dunbar and Jon Rubin formed the Rubinoos to play at a dance for Bay High School in Berkeley, California. Other founding members included Greg 'Curly' Keranen, Alex Carlin, Ralph Granich and Danny Wood. Inspired by siblings' 45s and the Cruisin' vintage radio recreations LP series, Jon Rubin and the Rubinoos played rock and roll oldies, including covers of songs by Chubby Checker, Bill Haley and the Comets, the Dovells, the Troggs, Little Eva, the Chiffons, and others. Soon after the performance at Bay High School, where Rubin and Dunbar were enrolled, the original band dissolved. In May 1971, they shortened the name to the Rubinoos and reformed as a quartet with Donn Spindt on drums and Tom Carpender on bass. The group now focused on original material by Dunbar, in association with Rubin and others. The band's early development was assisted and inspired by the success of Earth Quake, whose lead guitarist and principal songwriter was Tommy Dunbar's older brother, Robbie Dunbar. The Rubinoos often appeared as an opening act for Earth Quake in clubs such as the Longbranch Saloon and the Keystone, in Berkeley. After the expiration of their contract with A&M; Records, Earth Quake along with their manager, Matthew King Kaufman, founded Beserkley Records and started recruiting additional talent. This included Greg Kihn, Jonathan Richman and the Rubinoos. In June, 1973, Greg 'Curly' Keranen re-joined the group. In September, 1974, they recorded a cover of the DeFranco Family's \\"Gorilla\\", released as a single and included on the Beserkley Chartbusters compilation album. The group also provided accompaniment for Jonathan Richman on two Chartbuster cuts, \\"The New Teller\\" and \\"Government Center.\\" Shortly after the release of \\"Chartbusters\\" Keranen left the Rubinoos to join Jonathan Richman & the Modern Lovers. He was replaced by Royse Ader. Several 'high points' of the band's early career included: A performance at Bill Graham's Winterland Auditorium, September 24, 1974, on a bill with the Jefferson Starship. At this concert, the Rubinoos were joined on stage by Jonathan Richman, who danced to their version of The Archies' \\"Sugar, Sugar\\". This was greeted with intense booing and a pelting of unripe bananas by members of the audience. Having a number one single in Modesto, California, for 13 weeks. Having one of their concerts raffled off to a high school by Burger King. Appearing in Tiger Beat and 16 Magazine many times. In 1977, Beserkley released The Rubinoos, the group's eponymous debut album. It was well-reviewed and New York Rocker called it \\"The Best Pop Album of the Decade.\\" The single, a cover of Tommy James' \\"I Think We're Alone Now,\\" reached No. 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Beserkley's first hit. The group appeared on American Bandstand (live), So It Goes (by video) and Rolling Stone Magazine: The 10th Anniversary television special in which they were cast as a garage band, performed a tribute to the newly deceased Elvis Presley and morphed into claymation figures. The group's next album, Back to the Drawing Board (1979), featured the single \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,\\" which had been released in 1978 and received heavy airplay in England and Europe. In support of this album, the Rubinoos appeared on Rock Goes To College, The Old Grey Whistle Test, Top Pop and opened 56 shows for Elvis Costello on the U.S. portion of his 1979 Armed Funk tour. In 1980 Royse Ader was replaced by Al Chan. The Rubinoos then recorded the demos for a third album which never came to fruition. These demos, released in the 1990s as Basement Tapes, engineered by well known audio guru, Dan Alexander, is still thought to be one of their best efforts. Spindt and Chan left the group in 1982 when Tommy and Jon decided to move to Los Angeles. In 1983, the group, now consisting of just Rubin and Dunbar, signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the Mini LP Party of Two, produced by Todd Rundgren. Party of Two yielded the single and cult classic music video \\"If I Had You Back,\\" which has been in continuous rotation on MTV and VH1 for over 25 years. In 1984, they recorded the title song \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" for the film Revenge of the Nerds. The Rubinoos playing in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010 The Rubinoos began a long sabbatical in 1985. In 1989, Dunbar, Spindt, Chan, and John Seabury formed the group Vox Pop and recorded an album of material, co produced by Dunbar and Dan Alexander at Alexanders Coast Recorders. Also in 1989, Jon Rubin joined the noted Los Angeles a cappella Doo Wop group The Mighty Echoes. During the 1990s, two compilation CDs, Basement Tapes and Garage Sale were released. Their success led to the end of The Rubinoos sabbatical and a new album, Paleophonic (1999), produced by Kevin Gilbert. This album did not see the light of day until The Rubinoos' performance, their first in seven years, at the 1999 International Pop Overthrow Festival in Los Angeles. The lineup at IPO featured Rubin, Dunbar, Chan and Spindt. In 2000 Tommy and Jon were hired to sing the Flo and Eddie parts of Frank Zappa's 200 Motels at three concerts with the Netherlands' Philharmonic. In 2002 The Rubinoos toured Spain and Japan, released the all-covers Crimes Against Music (2002) and recorded the album Live in Japan (2004). In 2005 the group reunited with their original producer, Gary Phillips, to record Twist Pop Sin (2006). In 2007, Castle Communications issued the 63-song retrospective Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Rubinoos. Also in 2007, The Rubinoos toured Japan and released a two CD compilation titled One Two That's It. In 2009 the band toured Spain and released the compilation CD HodgePodge which featured one newly recorded track, a cover of The Hollies' classic, \\"Bus Stop.\\" The group was in the news after filing a plagiarism lawsuit in mid-2007 against Canadian pop-punk musician Avril Lavigne claiming that her song \\"Girlfriend\\" had too much in common with \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\". The parties confidentially settled out of court in early 2008. The conflict led to a re-interest in the Rubinoos' music, particularly on YouTube. Music critic John M. Borack called Paleophonic No. 36 in his list of the best power pop albums of all time, praising its \\"trademark pitch-perfect harmonies\\". In January 2010, The Rubinoos played their first kids show in support of their first all ages CD Biff-Boff-Boing. The CD is a mix of covers and new originals. In May 2010, to coincide with their Spain/Italy tour, the Rubinoos released their first new original album in five years - Automatic Toaster, produced by Robbie Rist. In 2015, to celebrate their 45th anniversary the band released the appropriately titled album 45. They continued to tour in Europe and Japan with a few sporadic dates in the US. In 2018 the group signed with Yep Roc Records, their first exclusive record deal since the 1980s, Long time fan and noted singer- songwriter Chuck Prophet was tapped to produce. The album, From Home, released in 2019, was recorded at Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, formerly Wally Heider Studios, where the group made some of its first recordings. Lawsuit In 2007, Dunbar and co-writer James Gangwer sued Canadian pop-rock singer Avril Lavigne, claiming that her hit song \\"Girlfriend\\" had too much in common with \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\". Filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the case also named Avril Lavigne Publishing, her songwriting partner Dr. Luke, RCA Records, and Apple Inc. as defendants. Lavigne's manager, Terry McBride, as well as Lavigne herself, denied that \\"Girlfriend\\" was copied from \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,\\" and pointed out that \\"Boyfriend\\" itself was similar to the Rolling Stones' \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\". The two parties reached a confidential settlement in January 2008.

It was first broadcast in January 2000 and the last series was first broadcast in 2002. Repeats continue to be shown on BBC and CBBC as well as in other countries. The first and second series were later reworked into two ninety-minute films. School location scenes from each of the three series were filmed at St. Laurence School in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire. Many of the castle scenes were filmed at Berkeley Castle in the Cotswolds. The Ghost Hunter series revolves around Roddy and Tessa Oliver, two ordinary children whose lives are turned upside down when William Povey, a shoeshine boy from Victorian England appears in Roddy's bedroom as a ghost and appeals to him for help. The Ghost Hunter is searching for William in order to obtain 'spectral energy' which is only obtainable from capturing ghosts. At first she seems concerned only to \\"collect\\" ghosts, but later her intentions become clear. She wants to use their energy to pass through Time itself and thereby have everlasting life. William's energy is especially high which makes him more attractive to the Ghost Hunter. As Roddy has second sight (the ability to see ghosts) and is the only person initially who can see William, he is the only person who can help him escape. Later, Roddy's sister Tessa also finds she has second sight and can also see William. In their on-going battles, the two boys and Tessa become firm friends and have many adventures together. Although the series was a ground-breaking one for children's television and influenced other series which followed it, and although it had very high ratings, a fourth series was never commissioned. Characters *Roddy Oliver, played by William Theakston - William's friend who has the ability to see and hear ghosts which is known as 'second sight'. *Tessa Oliver, played by Verity-Jane Dearsley - Roddy's sister, also has 'second sight' *William Povey played by Lee Godwin - The main protagonist, a shoeshine boy from the Victorian era who died and lived on as a ghost. *Elliot Town, played by Jack Quarmby - Roddy's best mate from the year 2027 *Mrs Croker, 'The Ghost Hunter' played by Jean Marsh - The titular antagonist, who detests ghosts and who is willing to do anything to avoid death. *Clarence DeSniff, played by Richard Hanson - The Hunter's assistant *Murdoch, played by Glyn Angell - the keeper of Newgate Prison. *Mr Oliver & Mrs Oliver, played by John McAndrew and Tracy Brabin - Roddy and Tessa's parents *Leo, played by Eddie Brown - Roddy's son from the year 2027 who inherits his father's ability to see ghosts. *Bex, played by Kelly Salmon - Roddy's daughter from the year 2027 who also inherits her father's ability to see ghosts. *Professor Darcy, played by Andrew Havill - Victorian inventor who begins working with 'The Ghost Hunter' in series 3. The Series =Series One= The main action takes place in Roddy and Tessa's village and school where the Ghost Hunter is active. One of the Ghost Hunter's chief abilities is her sense of smell. She can sniff out a ghost effortlessly. But Roddy and Tessa do not know who the Ghost Hunter is. They set about trying to discover this so that they can protect William. One of their ruses is to put garlic all round Roddy's bedroom, where the ghost is hiding, as the smell is said to keep ghosts and evil away. Eventually, the children realise that the Ghost Hunter is Mrs Croker, but only when she arrives at Roddy's house with her \\"ghost immobilising vapour\\" (GIV) with which she tries to freeze William, shrink him and put him in a bottle. Thanks to Roddy's quick wittedness, William escapes and the police almost arrest Mrs Croker but she escapes. Mrs Croker is also, and always, on the look out for other ghosts and has a whole collection of bottled ghosts that is discovered by Roddy, William and Tessa when the two boys save Tessa after she is kidnapped by De Sniff and left tied up and gagged in a secret hideout while Mrs Croker and De Sniff go back to the house to look for William. When she learns that there is to be an AGM (Annual Ghost Meeting) at Chillwood Castle, she and her side-kick DeSniff set up a powerful plan to bottle dozens of ghosts. Her plan is to use ghost-energy for her own wicked purposes, but the plan fails when she attacks the ghosts during a unique ghost celebration that allows them to assume their human bodies once again. Thanks to Roddy, Tessa and William, Mrs Croker falls from the battlements of Chillwood Castle, and is believed to have been killed. De Sniff escapes. =Series Two= The tone changes and becomes more sinister. DeSniff has discovered Mrs Croker is not dead. She has survived her fall from the castle and returns to work in a strange old mansion, called Deadlock Hall. Here, her demonic energy kicks into action again and she creates a machine called a \\"specktrika\\" which pulls ghosts towards it like a magnet. With this she intends to catch enough ghosts to power her \\"time travelling machine.\\" But by now the eccentric and foolish DeSniff has tasted power and he wants to time travel too. The Ghost Hunter manages to create a time hole in the fabric of the universe and both DeSniff and Croker are carried back to Victorian times. =Series Three= Mrs. Croker teams up with a Victorian scientist, Mr Darcy. They develop an elaborate plan together to catch masses of ghosts. Mrs Croker wants to use the ghost-energy so that she can become immortal. Returning to the modern era, 25 years have now passed since Roddy and Tessa last defeated Croker, and Roddy is a doctor with two children who are called Leo and Bex. Roddy is nervous when they question him about his old stories of the Ghost Hunter and William. William meets Roddy again, but Roddy can no longer see him, due to the loss of his second sight. Using the time portal, Croker and Darcy make millions of pounds, and plan to buy Roddy's former school, and set up \\"THE GHOST SCHOOL\\", which is now derelict and abandoned, apart from the ghosts who reside there. The year in the future is 2027. Bex and Leo, having gone through the time portal to 1890, help a Victorian baby (Albert Povey) who is seriously ill, by bringing him back to 2027. Their father, Dr Roddy, gives the baby antibiotics which saves its life, but by doing so, changes the course of history. Albert grows up to be a successful doctor and in the future, is widely celebrated. Meanwhile, an angry DeSniff thwarts Croker's plans by withdrawing all of the money Croker and Darcy have saved. A final showdown between the pair sees DeSniff donating all of the money to the charity which has been set up and is celebrating Albert Povey Day. Bex and Leo, back in Victorian times, where they have returned the baby Albert to its parents, get back to the Time Portal, only to find it is closed. William and his friends risk sacrificing themselves in order to re-open the portal. Bex and Leo return to the future and in doing so, the time portal closes, perhaps forever. Arriving at the place where the derelict school and The Ghost School had once stood, they see it is now a new hospital, dedicated to Albert Povey. Roddy comes out and tells them they are just in time to see a new ward opening up in honour of the man who donated so much to help... the DeSniff Ward.

Zur Kenntnis der allergischen Affektionen des Verdauugskanals vom Standpunkt des Chirurgen aus. Arch Klin Chir 1937; 188:36–64. Presentation may vary depending on location as well as depth and extent of bowel wall involvement and usually runs a chronic relapsing course. It can be classified into mucosal, muscular and serosal types based on the depth of involvement. Any part of the GI tract can be affected, and isolated biliary tract involvement has also been reported. The stomach is the organ most commonly affected, followed by the small intestine and the colon.  Signs and symptoms  EG typically presents with a combination of chronic nonspecific GI symptoms which include abdominal pain, diarrhea, occasional nausea and vomiting, weight loss and abdominal distension. Approximately 80% have symptoms for several years; a high degree of clinical suspicion is often required to establish the diagnosis, as the disease is extremely rare. It doesn't come all of a sudden but takes about 3–4 years to develop depending upon the age of the patient. Occasionally, the disease may manifest itself as an acute abdomen or bowel obstruction. * Mucosal EG (25–100%) is the most common variety, which presents with features of malabsorption and protein losing enteropathy. Failure to thrive and anaemia may also be present. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding may imply colonic involvement. * Muscular EG (13–70%) present with obstruction of gastric outlet or small intestine; sometimes as an obstructing caecal mass or intussusception. * Subserosal EG (4.5% to 9% in Japan and 13% in the US)) presents with ascites which is usually exudative in nature, abundant peripheral eosinophilia, and has favourable responses to corticosteroids. * Other documented features are cholangitis, pancreatitis, eosinophilic splenitis, acute appendicitis and giant refractory duodenal ulcer.  Pathophysiology  Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE are usual but not universal. The damage to the gastrointestinal tract wall is caused by eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation. As a part of host defense mechanism, eosinophils are normally present in gastrointestinal mucosa, though the finding in deeper tissue is almost always pathologic. What triggers such dense infiltration in EG is not clear. It is possible that different pathogenetic mechanisms of disease is involved in several subgroups of patients. Food allergy and variable IgE response to food substances has been observed in some patients which implies role of hypersensitive response in pathogenesis. Many patients indeed have history of other atopic conditions like eczema, asthma, etc. Eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory tissue is a complex process, regulated by a number of inflammatory cytokines. In EG cytokines IL-3, IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF) may be behind the recruitment and activation. They have been observed immunohistochemically in diseased intestinal wall. In addition eotaxin has been shown to have an integral role in regulating the homing of eosinophils into the lamina propria of stomach and small intestine. In the allergic subtype of disease, it is thought that food allergens cross the intestinal mucosa and trigger an inflammatory response that includes mast cell degranulation and recruitment of eosinophils.  Diagnosis  Spiral CT showing ascites and concentric thickening of colon and ileum in EG Talley et al. suggested 3 diagnostic criteria which are still widely used: # the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, # histological demonstration of eosinophilic infiltration in one or more areas of the gastrointestinal tract or presence of high eosinophil count in ascitic fluid (latter usually indicates subserosal variety), # no evidence of parasitic or extraintestinal disease. Hypereosinophilia, the hallmark of allergic response, may be absent in up to 20% of patients, but hypoalbuminaemia and other abnormalities suggestive of malabsorption may be present.CT scan may show nodular and irregular thickening of the folds in the distal stomach and proximal small bowel, but these findings can also be present in other conditions like Crohn's disease and lymphoma. The endoscopic appearance in eosinophilic gastroenteritis is nonspecific; it includes erythematous, friable, nodular, and occasional ulcerative changes. Sometimes diffuse inflammation results in complete loss of villi, involvement of multiple layers, submucosal oedema and fibrosis. Definitive diagnosis involves histological evidence of eosinophilic infiltration in biopsy slides. Microscopy reveals >20 eosinophils per high power field. Infiltration is often patchy, can be missed and laparoscopic full thickness biopsy may be required. Radio isotope scan using technetium (99mTc) exametazime-labeled leukocyte SPECT may be useful in assessing the extent of disease and response to treatment but has little value in diagnosis, as the scan does not help differentiating EG from other causes of inflammation. When eosinophilic gastroenteritis is observed in association with eosinophilic infiltration of other organ systems, the diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome should be considered.  Management  Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy with a 90% response rate in some studies. Appropriate duration of steroid treatment is unknown and relapse often necessitates long term treatment. Various steroid sparing agents e.g. sodium cromoglycate (a stabilizer of mast cell membranes), ketotifen (an antihistamine), and montelukast (a selective, competitive leukotriene receptor antagonist) have been proposed, centering on an allergic hypothesis, with mixed results. Oral budesonide (an oral steroid) can be useful in treatment, as well. An elimination diet may be successful if a limited number of food allergies are identified.  Epidemiology  Epidemiology may differ between studies, as number of cases are small, with approximately 300 EG cases reported in published literature. EG can present at any age and across all races, with a slightly higher incidence in males. Page 210. Earlier studies showed higher incidence in the third to fifth decades of life.

Gameplay  The game generates an LED maze behind a touchscreen. The player must then trace through the maze, using his or her finger, within the given time limit. Depending on the player's progress when time is up, arcade tickets or prizes are awarded. The most important aspect of the game is that the rate the timer ticks down increases as the player gets closer to the goal; anything less than a perfectly executed finish will usually result in losing the game. The touch screen the arcade cabinet uses has a fair amount of friction between the screen and the finger, making it difficult and physically tiring to move the finger rapidly and accurately. After an operator-adjustable number of failed attempts, the game will ease up on its difficulty somewhat, allowing the game to be won with less perfection.  Versions  In addition to the original game which distributes arcade tickets, Namco has also released a \\"merchandiser\\" edition which contains prizes behind locked compartments in the arcade cabinet.

The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting is also used to improve attributes for subsequent processes. Heat setting can eliminate the tendency of undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, the increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as \\"bulk development\\". All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term \\"thermal fixation\\" is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called \\"heat setting\\".  Crinkling tendency  The crinkle tendency is due to the technological conditions of the spun yarn production and the physical fiber properties. Above all, the \\"technological conditions of the spun yarn production\\" means the turning moment of the thread. A twisted thread will always try to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points in the form of a loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium. diagram by Müller Twisting in the opposite direction is due to the tensions resulting from the yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increased twisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in the opposite direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn's torque. These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the yarn by twisting.  The chemical process  There are completely different behaviors depending on the kind of yarn material. Much is known about the steaming of woolen yarns but more research is needed on the steaming behaviour of artificial fibers and cotton. = Wool = As soon as steam enters, the yarns quantity of moisture rises at once, caused by the heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann the following phenomena can be seen in the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the sulphur bridge, where cystine is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid. leftthumb500pxPhysical and chemical forces between two polypeptide chains 1\\\\. Hydrogen bridges between peptide groups (polar bond) 2\\\\. Cystine bridge (covalent bond) 3\\\\. Salt bridge between two amino acids (ionic bond) 4\\\\. Hydrophobic bond between a valine and an isolyeine rest (non-polar bond) The broken ellipse shows the part where water is displaced. An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration 4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is dried, i.e. the moisture balance occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside. The yarn or doubled yarn twist is set. Of course, the morphological structure of the fibers must be considered when equalizing the tensions by steaming. Since the woolen fiber very quickly gets the temperature for breaking up the hydrogen bridges and the steam for hydrolysing the cystine bridges, a relatively quick twist modification is possible which roughly corresponds to the values of an autoclave moderated yarn; however, the steaming quality of the Steamatic steaming process is much better with reference to the evenness of moisture absorption. = Synthetic fiber = Fiber strength and elongation 1\\\\. amorphous fiber domains 2\\\\. crystalline fiber domains 3\\\\. bonding forceSynthetic fibers can be divided up into two fiber domains, the crystalline (organized) domain and the amorphous (unorganized) domain. In crystalline domains physical forces of attraction are acting between the closely parallel lines of polymers. These forces acting transversely to the fiber axis make up the closeness of a fiber. If tension is applied to the fiber, these forces hinder the fiber from breaking. In contrast, the amorphous fiber domains act like links of the fibers. They are responsible for the flexional strength of the fibers. Additionally, the amorphous fiber domains make it possible for water or dye to enter. Properties of amorphous and crystalline fiber domains During steaming, the heating of the fiber causes its molecules to start oscillating. The increase of oscillation that can be influenced by the degree and the period of heating dissolves the electric bond forces in the fiber; at first in the amorphous domains, later in the crystalline ones and at last in the polymers. As with wool, the tensions brought in by spinning are set free. During drying or cooling of the fiber, the binding forces are rebuilt without having tensions in the inner part. The problem of synthetic fibers is that the reduction of the binding forces only takes place between the so-called deformation point (start of changing the firm solidified – amorphous fiber domains into a visco-elastic – easily deformable state) and the distortion point (the crystalline fiber domains change into a visco-elastic state, too) which is in a relatively high temperature range.  Glass transition temperature – and deformation point of artificial fiber  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Material ! scope=\\"col\\"  Deformation point ! scope=\\"col\\"  Distortion temperature - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Polyester  80-85 °C  230-240 °C - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Nylon 6  80-85 °C  180-200 °C - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Nylon 66  90-95 °C  220-235 °C } This is also an explanation for the fact that wool mixed with synthetic fibers is more difficult to set than pure wool. Setting synthetic fibers is only possible beyond a temperature range of 85 to 95 °C. In contrast, pure wool can set very well at these temperatures. = Cotton = In in-line steaming, cotton plays a more or less subordinate role. The exact physical or chemical process in the fiber are not well known.  Applications in the carpet industry  The quality of cut pile carpets is improved significantly by a reduction of inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results from the effects of steaming and heatsetting. = Carpet classification = Carpet styles are divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile carpets and cut pile carpets. Especially for cut-pile and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance. = Tip definition (pinpoint tip definition) = \\"Pinpoint tip definition\\" after Heatsetting Usually, when yarn is cut, the ends fray similar to the way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in cut-pile carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the \\"walker\\" as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn't absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called \\"pinpoint tip definition\\" in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.  Current heat setting processes  Several different heat setting processes are known in the textile industry. The most important are presented here. = Autoclave heat setting = Autoclave Heatsetting The oldest heat setting process is autoclave heat setting. Mostly, it is a discontinuous process. Autoclave installations use vacuum and/or pressure. Textile material is brought into the autoclave either on bobbins, in skeins or loose in a container. As nearly all autoclaves are exposed to certain pressures they are usually built in cylindrical shape and mounted horizontally. Most commonly, autoclaves are loaded and unloaded from the end of the cylinder but some may be loaded from one end and unloaded from the other end. Autoclaves mounted vertically exist but are less common. They are mostly used for the synthetic yarns like polyester, polyethylene, poly propylene and nylons. = Steamatic process = For automation in link spinning/winding there is the so-called \\"in-line steamer\\". The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package. The carpet industry currently utilizes two continuous processes, the Power-Heat-Set process and the TVP process which was derived from the autoclave technology. = Power-Heat-Set technology = The Power- Heat-Set process, formerly known as Suessen process, was developed in the beginning of the 1970s and was the first continuous heat setting system worldwide. The process itself was revolutionary in that it was the first system not operated with saturated steam and pressure, but with a superheated steam/airmix at atmospheric pressure. Using this innovative technology, completely new carpet collections were created. In the Power-Heat-Set process, the yarns and filaments oxidize slightly on the surface due to the existing oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere and the higher temperatures. This capillary oxide film causes the complete carpet later to be more stain resistant. Dirt particles adhere less to the fibers. = SUPERBA TVP process = In addition to the Power-Heat-Set technology there is the SUPERBA TVP3 process which is also a continuous process. In the TVP3 process yarn is placed on a conveyor belt and inserted through a lock into a pressure tunnel that could be up to 15 m long. Inside the tunnel, it undergoes a heat setting process with saturated steam. At the end of the tunnel the yarn is taken out through a second lock. The yarn which is still hot and moist is dried and cooled after heat setting and fed to the winding process. Up to 72 yarn ends can be processed at the same time.  Process description (exemplary with the Power-Heat-Set process)  Frieze and straight Yarn after Power-Heat-Setting In the Power-Heat-Set process yarn is heat set with superheated steam in an open system at atmospheric pressure. All the materials normally used in the carpet industry such as polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, Acrylic, PET, polyester and wool can be processed. The unprocessed yarn is provided on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At a speed of up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a \\"figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB). The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air- mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat setting machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.

The son of Harriet and John Goble, a wheelwright, he grew up in Thursley, Surrey. He first encountered pioneering early-instrument-maker Arnold Dolmetsch and his family in the autumn of 1917, when they took refuge from London air raids by renting a small house in Thursley before settling in nearby Jesses, Haslemere. He was later taken on by Dolmetsch as an assistant. In 1928, a music scholarship from Dolmetsch went to Elizabeth Brown, of Liverpool, who was to become Goble's wife in 1930; he survived her by 10 years. She was primarily a keyboard player; she later became a player of the bass viol. In the late 1930s he set up independently, making recorders and furniture. He also made a harpsichord for his wife, using a plucking mechanism that he had invented and was to patent; though it was not practical in the long run and he did not take it further. He had two sons: Andrea, born in 1931, followed his father into the business, and Paul, born in 1933, became a painter. During the Second World War, he went to work in a Gosport boatyard, making motor torpedo boats, and then at the branch of the admiralty that was based at Haslemere, where he made apparatus for radar research. In 1947, he moved to Headington, on the outskirts of Oxford, to a house with space for a large workshop. After his son Andrea left school to work with him, the firm of Robert Goble & Son came into being, making recorders (for the first five years), spinets, clavichords and harpsichords. His wife often decorated the soundboards. At this period of the early instrument revival, harpsichord builders were interested in updating the instrument, not only adding more features such as a low 16' set of strings and pedals to change the registers. They were also keen to find new materials to build with, such as metal and plastic, and new methods of manufacture like those used in piano construction, so the instrument could be made to stand up to the demands of concert touring with a robustness not found in historical instruments. Goble produced his first concert model in 1952, which was a success. Further improvements were made and his harpsichords were played by noted musicians, such as Millicent Silver; they were exported to Australia, the Netherlands and the United States. The workforce remained small; seven at its highest. In the 25 years the workshop sent off about 700 keyboard instruments. In about 1970, the historically informed performance movement caught up with him. Authenticity of sound was demanded, and this meant abandoning the search for improvement of previous decades and returning to the baroque models. But this was to be his son's task. The continuity of the firm was assured by the addition of his grandsons. The harpsichord played by American singer-songwriter Tori Amos on her 1996 album Boys For Pele and the subsequent Dew Drop Inn Tour was made by Robert Goble & Son. The model she used is the Christian Zell double manual, Hamburg 1728.

His father had worked in the Irish Civil Service. Fox was educated at Drayton Manor School in Hanwell. His father died in 1930 in a shooting accident, and his mother remarried. He went to the London School of Economics to read law, but his studies were interrupted by the war. His poor eyesight prevented him joining the armed forces during the Second World War, and worked in intelligence in the Admiralty from 1942-45. Instead of continuing at the London School of Economics he applied to read jurisprudence at Magdalen College, Oxford, after the war, gaining a second-class degree in 1947 and then the Bachelor of Civil Law in 1948. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1949. He joined the chambers of Cyril Radcliffe at 3 New Square, as a pupil of John Sparrow (later Warden of All Souls College, Oxford).

They had three sons and a daughter together. He took early retirement in 1992 as a result of his failing eyesight, and he spent much time at Nuthanger Farm, near Watership Down, Hampshire. Death Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in his later years, he died in 2007, and was survived by his wife and their four children. Judicial career He was appointed as a High Court judge in 1975, receiving the customary knighthood and becoming a Bencher at Lincoln's Inn. He was allocated to the Chancery Division, where he was involved in various high-profile cases. He refused an injunction to stop the Coventry Free Festival, held in Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, accepting undertakings to restrict the sound output and limit its opening hours; he granted an injunction to stop a clergyman from holding services at his church after he had been dismissed; and he granted Ladybird Books an injunction to stop David Sullivan publishing a \\"hardcore\\" pornographic magazine under the name \\"Ladybirds\\". He refused Bali bras permissions register their brand as a trade mark, as it would be confused with Berlei bras. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1981, and as is customary was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1984, he upheld the appeal by Victoria Gillick, that children should not be given contraceptives without their parents' consent, except in an emergency or with the permission of the court, [1985] 1 All ER 533.

In 1988, he ruled that Doreen Hill, mother of Jacqueline Hill, the last murder victim of the \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\", Peter Sutcliffe, was not entitled to damages from West Yorkshire police, on the grounds that the police did not owe a duty of care to the victims of criminals that they failed to catch, even if they were negligent, [1987] 1 All ER 1173. This decision was upheld by the House of Lords, [1988] 2 All ER 238. In 1990, he upheld the rulings that The Independent and The Sunday Times were in contempt of court for publishing extracts from Peter Wright's book Spycatcher, breaching court orders made against other newspapers, but fines of £50,000 were quashed. This decision was upheld by the House of Lords. Also in 1990, he rejected an appeal by \\"Miss Whiplash\\", Lindi St Clair, holding that her income from prostitution was subject to income tax as \\"profits from trade\\". He also delivered the lead judgment in influential cases such as Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold [1989] Ch 1, distinguishing a lease from a licence of land, and Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1991] Ch 547, on constructive trusts and the ability to trace funds.

She was an American Republican leader and rebel who was ousted from her party after publicly opposing its views on abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment. Crisp was significant in advancing issues related to women's rights.  Personal life and education  Mary D. Crisp attended Oberlin College before her political career Crisp was born on November 5, 1923 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the 7th child of Elizabeth (Patch) and Harry Dent. In 1946, Crisp graduated with a degree in botany from Oberlin College then studied political science at Arizona State University. In 1948, she married William Crisp. They had three children together, William, Barbara, and Anne. Mary and William divorced in 1976. Mary Dent Crisp had Parkinson's disease and died on March 24, 2007.  Political life  Crisp was active as a volunteer in politics, which she continued throughout her life. Her political career started in 1961 as a deputy registrar for the campaign of Barry Goldwater. Following this, Crisp was elected to positions within the Republican Party, serving as vice-chair of the Mariposa County Republican Committee from 1968 to 1970, and as vice-chair of Arizona's Republican State Committee from 1971 to 1972. In 1972 she became a Republican National Committeewoman in Arizona. In 1976 Crisp became Secretary of the Republican National Convention. From 1977 to 1980, after working her way up through the Republican Party, she served as Co-Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. For over 20 years, Crisp was an active member of the Republican Party. \\"From 1984 until the mid-1990s, Crisp served as director of a Washington-based political action committee, Business Executives for National Security, a nonpartisan group concerned about the economic effects of the arms race\\" .  Activism  In her speech at the 1980 Republican Convention, Crisp publicly challenged and spoke against the Republican Party’s decision to abandon the Equal Rights Amendment and support and abandon their anti-abortion platform. In 1977, she wrote to every Republican in Congress in order to gain support for a bill that would extend the ERA ratification deadline . 1980 Republican Convention, Crisp later challenged against the Republican Party After Crisp spoke out against the Republican Party, the party chairman, Bill Brock, told her that “[She] should adopt the lowest profile possible,.” Bill Brock ordered her remarks to be deleted from the program of the national nominating convention. In addition, he canceled two convention events that she Crisp was supposed to host. When Mary Crisp endorsed an independent Republican John B. Anderson of Illinois for president, Mary denied endorsing him and arranged with Brock that she would no longer talk to reporters and would not seek re-election of her position. Later, her friends said that Crisp agreed to listen to Brock to protect her staff members from being fired. An avid supporter of Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights, Crisp supported pro- choice and women's right to make their own reproductive choices. Crisp also protested the Republican Party's decision to oppose federal funding for abortion. In 1989, the Supreme Court in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, restricted federal funding for abortion Crisp then left her position under pressure from Reagan Operatives. In the same year, Crisp co-founded the National Republican Coalition for Choice, where she served as chair and spokesperson, in response to governments abandonment of the abortion and equal rights. In addition, she spoke out for federal support for childcare, redressing gender inequities in Social Security, and was against job discrimination. Shortly afterward, Crisp signed on as campaign manager for John B. Anderson's 1980 presidential run as an independent. She served on boards for numerous political organizations and \\"fought to return the Republican Party to what she believed were its ideological roots: individual freedom and limited government\\".Mary devoted her life as an ardent feminist to \\"promoting issues of women's freedom, opportunity, choice, and peace\\". Mary devoted her life to “promoting issues of women’s freedom, opportunity, choice, and peace” .

The target of most of her speeches were Republican organizations. In addition, Crisp gave speeches campaigning for Republican candidates running for office. After leaving the Republican Party, many of Crisps speeches related to her work for the National Republican Coalition for Choice.  Office wiretapping incident (June 1980)  In June 1980, the Republican National Committee officials investigated with an electronic inspection of their headquarters to see if it had been bugged. The report was inconclusive that Mary Crisp’s office was used in the wiretapping. However, chairman Brill Brock ordered for the investigation to stop after he found out that a police officer had entered the headquarters before they were there. Nothing was found after the search. The police officer had been sent by Winston Norman, who was the chief of security for the Republican national committee. Later, two electronic experts said that a magnetic field and suspicious wires that were found in Mary Crisp’s office could have been for eavesdropping.

The complex consists of three individual earthworks; Becca Banks/the Ridge, the South Dyke, and Woodhouse Moor Rein. History The date and function of the Aberford Dykes are not known for sure. It seems likely that the monuments were built at different times, and possibly for different purposes. Becca Banks/the Ridge has a strongly defensive nature, and may have been built to control a ford over the Cock Beck. Becca Banks/the Ridge runs across the Roman road between Castleford and Tadcaster. However the sequential relationship between the earthwork and the Roman road is not known. Some argue the monument was built to defend against a Roman invasion and the road was later built right through it. Others argue the monument was built to protect the road, possibly in the 'Dark Ages'. Where subjected to archaeological excavation, the monuments have been found to date from or after the late Iron Age, and it would seem they were silting up during the early Medieval period. Becca Banks/the Ridge is the principal monument in the group. This runs for nearly on a mostly east-west course along the north side of the Cock Beck valley. It consists of a bank with a ditch situated on its southern (downslope) side. A slight natural scarp slope is exploited in the positioning of the bank above the ditch, and the top of the bank would have stood up to above the base of the ditch. The other two monuments are located on the south side of the Cock Beck valley, and do not share the strong defensive characteristics of Becca Banks/the Ridge. For instance, the ditch of the South Dyke lies on the upslope side of its bank. The Aberford Dykes today As scheduled monuments, the Aberford Dykes are legally protected. They still have a role in the modern landscape, serving as field boundaries and marking county and parish boundaries. Much of the length of the Aberford Dykes can be walked via the public footpaths that run along them.

He played for Charlton Athletic, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Bradford City, Bournemouth and Hartlepool United, making over 200 appearances in the Football League. Early and personal life Born in Sidcup, Watson grew up in children's homes in London. Throughout his career he was known as \\"Flash\\", after the comic book hero, Flash Gordon. Club career =Charlton Athletic= Watson started his career with the youth team of Charlton Athletic. He made a \\"successful transition\\" into the senior squad, scoring seven goals in 31 appearances for them in the Football League. =Sheffield Wednesday= He signed for Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of £250,000, with a further £100,000 payable depending on appearances. He made his debut for the club in March 1991. He made his last appearance for the club in May 1995. He scored 15 goals in 66 Football League appearances for them, scoring six further goals in 21 appearances in other competitions. In March 1995, after four years at Hillsborough, Watson was signed by relegation-threatened Southampton (under manager Alan Ball) for a fee of £1,200,000. =Southampton= He made his Saints debut at Nottingham Forest on 18 March 1995 and scored against Newcastle United in his home debut four days later as the Saints came from a goal down after 89 minutes to snatch a \\"priceless\\" 3–1 victory. Watson went on to make 12 Premier League appearances (scoring three goals) in the 1994–95 season as Saints lifted themselves to a 10th-place finish. According to Holley & Chalk's In That Number, Watson was \\"an effervescent,never-say-die forward, the sort the crowd always love and, although not the most skilful of front-runners, he had a swashbuckling style that unnerved defences.\\" Alan Ball left The Dell at the end of the 1994–95 season, to be replaced by Dave Merrington. The 1995–96 season was a poor one for both the Saints (finishing in 17th place, just above the relegation zone) and Watson, with only three goals from 25 league appearances, with the goal-scoring being shared by Matthew Le Tissier and Neil Shipperley, with seven league goals each. For 1996–97, Saints appointed a new manager in Graeme Souness who brought in Egil Østenstad as first choice striker to play alongside Le Tissier, leaving Watson to make only the occasional appearance. His final appearance for The Saints was in a humiliating FA Cup defeat at Elm Park, Reading on 4 January 1997. =Bradford City= Two weeks later, Watson was sold to Bradford City for £500,000 and was the club's then record signing. On 1 February 1997, while making his third appearance for Bradford City, he suffered a double fracture of his right leg in a tackle with Huddersfield Town defender Kevin Gray. The tackle was described by football pundit, Jimmy Hill, as \\"late, dangerous and violent\\" and was one of the worst tackles he had ever seen. Watson and the club took the matter to court, suing both Huddersfield Town and Gray for negligence. Watson won the case, and was awarded initial damages of £50,000. Further damages were later awarded, bringing the total to £959,143. In his second game back for the club after injury, 18 months later, he scored two goals to help Bradford City to victory. He scored a total of five goals in 21 Football League appearances for the club. =Bournemouth= On expiry of his contract with Bradford City (now promoted to the Premiership) in June 1999, Watson declined the offer of a new contract explaining that he was not \\"fit enough or good enough to represent Bradford City in the top flight\\". In August 1999 he signed for Bournemouth in an effort to rebuild his career but only made 11 league and cup appearances in the 1999–00 season, without scoring. =Hartlepool United= After leaving Bournemouth he played for the reserve team of Portsmouth. He finished his career with Hartlepool United, scoring 23 goals in 49 games in the Football League. While playing for Hartlepool he continued to live on the south coast, training during the week with the Southampton squad, and flying up to Hartlepool for matches. He was top-scorer for the club during his first season with them, scoring 18 goals in all competitions, and he signed a new one-year contract in May 2002. At the start of his second season with the club he spoke of his desire to help the club get promoted. He broke his left leg in September 2002, playing for the club's reserves in January 2003, before returning to first-team training with the club in February 2003. He had previously spent time recuperating at Lilleshall. In July 2003, after leaving Hartlepool, he was linked with a return to former club Sheffield Wednesday, after trialling with the club. International career Watson won two caps for the England under-21 team. Later life After retiring as a player, Watson combined working in investments in the City of London with a media career. In March 2019 he spoke about former club Bradford City's relegation battle, saying it would be a \\"miracle\\" if they stayed up, and that they needed a complete overhaul in the summer.

Christianity is the largest religion in Peru, with Roman Catholics having the most adherents. Religion in Peru is traditionally related to religious syncretism originating from Catholicism with the ancient Inca religion after the Spanish Conquest. However, Protestant churches of various denominations have developed considerably in the popular sectors over the past 30 years. There has been a slow but consistent advance of irreligion especially among young people in urban areas. Religions such as Judaism and Buddhism, and more recently Hinduism and Islam, are present due to immigration. According to article 2 of the Peruvian Constitution: \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of conscience and religion, individually or in association. There is no persecution for reasons of ideas or beliefs. There is no crime of opinion. The public exercise of all confessions are free, as long as they do not offend morals or disturb public order.\\" Christianity =Roman Catholicism= History The Spanish conquerors not only conquered Peru militarily, but also sought to convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. Indigenous Andean religious beliefs and practices persisted, which the Catholic Church sought to suppress.Kenneth Mills, Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640-1750.

Some convents were also built on Inca sites. For example, in 1605, some Dominican nuns built the Convent of Santa Catalina in Cuzco atop the site of the \\"acllahuasi\\", once home to virginal young women dedicated to serving the ruling Inca. Another convent, the Convent of Santa Clara, was one of the first institutions the conquistadores of Cuzco built for \\"Indian nobles\\", the daughters of the indigenous elite whose collaboration made Spain's indirect rule over the Andes possible. At Santa Clara, Inca nobles were to be \\"raised Christian and to receive 'buenas costumbres' (literally, good customs or manners), shorthand for an education in Spanishness\\", which included knowledge, stitchery, and literacy. After graduating from this course in Spanish culture, charges were free to profess vows or leave the convent.Burns, 27. Miscegenation was not an issue among Spaniards. Many prominent Spanish men lived with elite Inca women, only to marry Spanish women later in life and marry off their Andean partners to less prominent Spaniards.Burns, 21. Modern era The Peruvian government is closely allied with the Catholic Church. Article 50 of the Constitution recognizes the Catholic Church's role as \\"an important element in the historical, cultural, and moral development of the nation.\\" International Religious Freedom Report 2007; Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; Published by U.S. State Department. Page 15 Catholic clergy and laypersons receive state remuneration in addition to the stipends paid to them by the Church. This applies to the country's 52 bishops, as well as to some priests whose ministries are located in towns and villages along the borders. In addition each diocese receives a monthly institutional subsidy from the Government. An agreement signed with the Vatican in 1980 grants the Catholic Church special status in Peru.Kevin Boyle and Juliet Sheen, Freedom of religion and belief: a world report. Routledge; 1997. Page 144. The Catholic Church receives preferential treatment in education, tax benefits, immigration of religious workers, and other areas, in accordance with the agreement. So Roman Catholicism could be considered the main religion of Peru. See also the following: Roman Catholicism in Peru with Partial list of Catholic universities in Peru; and Lord of Miracles, Peruvian religious festival. Although the Constitution states that there is freedom of religion, the law mandates that all schools, public and private, impart religious education as part of the curriculum throughout the education process (primary and secondary).Michael Fleet and Brian H. SmithThe Catholic Church and democracy in Chile and Peru. University of Notre Dame Press; 1997. Page 201-202. Catholicism is the only religion taught in public schools. In addition, Catholic religious symbols are found in all government buildings and public places. According to the 2017 Census, there were 76% of the population 12+ identifying themselves as Catholics. =Protestants= At the 2017 Census there were 14.1% of the population 12+ identifying themselves as Protestants, mainly Evangelicals. In Latin America most Protestants are called Evangelicos because most of them are Evangelical Protestants, while some are also traditional Mainline Protestant. They continue to grow faster than the national growth rate. Irreligion Irreligion in Peru refers to atheism, agnosticism, deism, religious skepticism, secularism, and humanism in the Peruvian society. According to the 2017 Peruvian Census data, 1'180.361 Peruvians or 5.1% of the population older than 12 years old describes themselves as being irreligious, but some sources put this number higher at 8.2%. The irreligious population is predominantly urban (85,5% live in cities) and males (61,4% are male), and most are young people within the ages between 18 and 29 (40,4%). Only 11,8% of irreligious people are 50 years old or older. Even though Peru is considered to be a Secular state, according to article 50 of the Peruvian Constitution the subject of Roman Catholicism is mandatory in Peruvian public schools. Many non-profit organizations promote the removal of the subject of Roman Catholicism in public schools, such as the Secular Humanist Society of Peru.  Other religions in Peru  =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims more than 578,000 members in Peru. There are currently 764 congregations that meet in Peru. There are currently two LDS temples in Peru, one located in La Molina, Lima, and the other in Trujillo. On October 6, 2012, the LDS church announced a third temple to be built in Arequipa. At the April 3, 2016 General Conference of the LDS church, it was announced that a fourth temple would be built in Los Olivos, Lima. This second temple in Lima will make the city one of the few in the world with two temples. Peru is also home to more than 100 stakes of the LDS church. =Buddhism= Buddhism was introduced to Peru in 1899 when the ship Sakura Maru arrived at Callao, Peru, with 790 people from Japan. Japanese, Chinese, and Korean immigration to Peru during the 19th and 20th Century brought Mahayana Buddhism to Peru, and followers of that style of Buddhism remain largely concentrated within those ethnic groups. While Mahayana remains the largest school of Buddhism in Peru, other schools such as the Diamond form have begun to spread so that Peru has more than 50,000 practicing Buddhists. = Baháʼí Faith = The Baháʼí Faith in Peru begins with references to Peru in Baháʼí literature as early as 1916, with the first Baháʼís visiting as early as 1919. A functioning community wasn't founded in Peru until the 1930s with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated Baháʼí pioneers from the United States which progressed into finding national Peruvian converts and achieved an independent national community in 1961. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 41,300 Baháʼís in 2005. = Islam = Mosque Bab ul Islam in Tacna under construction in 2007 The statistics for Islam in Peru estimate a total Muslim population of 5,000, largely based in the capital of Lima, Peru;Shaikh, Farzana. \\"Islam and Islamic groups: a worldwide reference guide\\", 1992 a number which has remained static since 1980. = Seax-Wica = Seax-Wica was introduced to Peru by Seax Gesith Ariel Phoenice, Witan of the Mimir's Well Seax Coven, Perú in 2001.

It was built to the designs of Thomas Hardwick in 1813–17. The present site is the third used by the parish for its church. The first was further south, near Oxford Street. The church there was demolished in 1400 and a new one erected further north. This was completely rebuilt in 1740–42, and converted into a chapel-of-ease when Hardwick's church was constructed. The Marylebone area takes its name from the church. Located behind the church is St Marylebone School, a Church of England school for girls. Previous churches =First church= The first church for the parish was built in the vicinity of the present Marble Arch c.1200, and dedicated to St John the Evangelist. =Second church= The marriage scene from A Rake's Progress by William Hogarth, showing the interior of the second St Marylebone church. Sir John Soane's Museum, London In 1400 the Bishop of London gave the parishioners permission to demolish the church of St John and build a new one in a more convenient position, near a recently completed chapel, which could be used until the new church was completed. The bishop stipulated that the old churchyard should be preserved, but also gave permission to enclose a new burial ground at the new site,Smith 1833, p.59 The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.Smith 1833, p.60 It was closer to the village, at the north end of Marylebone High Street. Having fallen into a state of decay, it was demolished in 1740.Smith 1833, p.60 It was in this church Francis Bacon was married in 1606, and its interior was portrayed by William Hogarth in the marriage scene from his famous series \\"A Rake's Progress\\" (1735). By 1722, its congregation was so large it needed a chapel of ease in the form of the Marybone Chapel, now St Peter, Vere Street. =Third church= A new, smaller, church built on the same site opened in April 1742. It was an oblong brick building with a small bell tower at the west end. The interior had galleries on three sides. Some monuments from the previous church were preserved in the new building. In 1818 it became a chapel-of-ease to the new parish church which superseded it .Smith 1833, p.60 It was demolished in 1949, and its site, at the northern end of Marylebone High Street is now a public garden. Charles Wesley lived and worked in the area and sent for the church's rector John Harley and told him \\"Sir, whatever the world may say of me, I have lived, and I die, a member of the Church of England. I pray you to bury me in your churchyard.\\" On his death, his body was carried to the church by eight clergymen of the Church of England and a memorial stone to him stands in the gardens in High Street, close to his burial spot. One of his sons, Samuel, was later organist of the present church. It was also in this building that Lord Byron was baptised in 1788. Admiral Horatio Nelson was a worshipper here and his daughter Horatia was baptised here; Richard Brinsley Sheridan was married to Elizabeth Ann Linley here. This is also the church in which the diplomat Sir William Hamilton married Emma Hart (Amy Lyon), later Nelson's lover. The architect James Gibbs was buried there in 1751.Smith 1833, p.68 The crypt was the burial place of members of the Bentinck family, including William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (died 1809).Smith 1833, p.83 The present church =Original design= Construction of a new church was first considered in 1770, with plans prepared by Sir William Chambers and leadership given by the 3rd and 4th Dukes of Portland (owners of much of the area, by now a wealthy residential area to the west of London that had outgrown the previous church), but the scheme was abandoned and the land donated for it in Paddington Street purchased for a burial ground. In 1810–11 a site was secured to build a chapel-of-ease on the south side of the new road near Nottingham Place.Smith 1833, p.83 facing Regent's Park.Britton and Pugin 1825, p.173 Plans were drawn up by Chambers's pupil Thomas Hardwick Smith 1833, p.89 and the foundation stone was laid on 5 July 1813. When construction was almost complete, it was decided that this new building should serve as the parish church, and so alterations were made to the design. On the north front, towards the new road, a Corinthian portico with eight columns (six columns wide, and two deep at the sides), based on that of the Pantheon in Rome, replaced the intended four- column Ionic portico surmounted by a group of figures. A steeple was built, instead of a planned cupola.Smith 1833, pp.88–89 No changes were made to the design of the interior, but plans to build houses on part of the site were abandoned.Britton and Pugin 1825, p.174 Entrance to the church from the north is through three doorways beneath the portico, each leading into a vestibule.Smith 1833, p.83 There are arched windows above the outer doorways. A blank panel above the central one was intended to house a bas-relief depicting Christ's entry into Jerusalem. Hardwick's church was basically rectangular in plan, with two small extensions behind the entrance front, and two wings placed diagonally flanking the far end (the liturgical east),Britton and Pugin 1825, p.174 which originally housed private galleries equipped with chairs, tables and fireplaces.Britton and Pugin 1825, p.178Smith 1833, p.91 Two tiers of galleries, supported on iron columns ran around three sides of the church.Smith 1833, p.91 The organ case was immediately above the altar screen; in the centre of the organ case was an arched opening with a \\"transparent painting\\" by Benjamin West, of the angel appearing to the shepherds. Other church furniture included a large pulpit and reading desk and high box pews. The steeple, placed over the central vestibule, rises around above the roof (and thus about above the ground).Britton and Pugin 1825, p.176 It is in three storeys;the first, square in plan, contains a clock, the second circular in plan, has twelve Corinthian columns supporting an entablature, while the third is in the form of a miniature temple raised on three steps and surrounded by eight caryatids, with arched openings between them. The whole structure is topped by a dome and weathervane.Smith 1833, p.90 The vaulted crypt, extending under the whole church, with extensive catacombs under the west side was used for burials until being bricked up in 1853. Since 1987, following the reinterment of the 850 coffins it previously contained at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, it has housed a healing and counselling centre. The church was completed in 1817, at an overall cost of £80,000. A local resident was Charles Dickens (1812–1870), in Devonshire Terrace, whose son was baptised in this church (a ceremony fictionalised in Dombey and Son). Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett were married in this phase of the church in 1846 (their marriage certificate is preserved in the church archives). The church was also used in location filming for the 1957 film recounting their story, The Barretts of Wimpole Street.Location used for The Barretts of Wimpole Street, 1957 film: IMDB.com website. Retrieved on January 15, 2008. Composer Sir John Stainer wrote an oratorio specifically for the choir at St Marylebone; The Crucifixion was first performed in the church on 24 February 1887, which was the day after Ash Wednesday. It has been performed annually at the church ever since, usually on Good Friday.Camden Review, 04 April, 2013 Sir John Stainer’s hymn to the people, Sarah Dawes =Later alterations= In 1826, the transparency above the altar was removed, the organ case reduced in size and the private galleries replaced by new ones for pupils of the National School.Smith 1833, p.91 In 1882 the energetic new rector, the Revd. W. Barker led the parish council to extensively redevelop the church, to (in Barker's words) \\"bring it more into harmony with the arrangements and decorations suited to the religious demands of the present day\\". The new plans, by Thomas Harris (architect and churchwarden of the parish), removed the end wall and the upper galleries along the sides of the church (uncovering the windows' full length and letting in more light), created a chancel for a robed choir (with new carved mahogany choir stalls with angel ends) and a sanctuary within the new apse, and added a marble mosaic floor, a fine marble pulpit and two balustrades (with Alpha and Omega on the latter). This new scheme combined Neo-Classicism with Pre-Raphaelitism, and included a gilded cross in the ceiling above the site of the original altar. Funded by subscription, it began in 1884 (with a memorial stone, laid by Mrs Gladstone, wife of the Prime Minister, in the outside wall of the apse) and was completed a year later. =Post-war= A bomb fell in the churchyard close by during the Second World War, blowing out all the windows, piercing the ceiling over the reredos in two places with pieces of iron railing from the school playground, and necessitating the church's closure for repairs until 1949, when fragments of the original coloured glass were incorporated into the new windows and a Browning Chapel created at the back of the church to commemorate the Brownings' marriage. This chapel later became a parish room known as the Browning Room, with the chapel transferred to the side of the church as the Holy Family Chapel. This room contained several items of Browning furniture which have since largely been stolen. The churchyard is now a Garden of Rest in the care of the City of Westminster. Rectors of St Marylebone The church provides a list of ministers of the parish since 1544. (It additionally notes that William Witham is given on Wikipedia as incumbent of St Marylebone until 1454, but states that he was in fact incumbent of St Mary-le-Bow.) In 1821 the parish Rectory, impropriated by the Dukes of Portland for the previous century, was restored to the incumbent clergyman (then Luke Heslop, incumbent since 1810). Heslop thus became Rector of St Marylebone. *1821–1825† Luke Heslop (as Archdeacon of Buckingham) *1825–1854† John Hume Spry *1855–1857 John Pelham (later Bishop of Norwich) *1857–1882 Charles Eyre *1882–1908 William Barker (later Dean of Carlisle) *1908–1942 William Douglas Morrison (criminologist) *1942–1954 Hubert Matthews (as Archdeacon of Hampstead from 1950) *1954–1958† James Harington Evans *1958–1978† Frank Coventry *1979–1990 Christopher Hamel Cooke *1990–1997 John Chater *1997–2010 Christopher Gower *2010– Stephen Evans Organ The church contains a four manual organ by Rieger Orgelbau.

It was formed by the damming of Big Creek, a tributary of the Escatawpa River in southwest Alabama. The reservoir was the subject of controversy in the 1980s over freshwater rights between Alabama and Mississippi. Geography Big Creek Lake is located at 30.74N, -88.34W, WNW of Fairview, Alabama. The reservoir is in surface area. The reservoir’s watershed covers 103 square miles (267 km²) and lies totally within Mobile County. History During the period from 1907 to 1940, the city of Mobile kept pace with providing water service for the population growth until the outbreak of World War II when it became increasingly apparent that the existing sources of supply were inadequate and undependable. A new source was necessary not only because of lack of sufficient quantity, but because the water sheds of Clear and Three Mile Creeks were becoming more urbanized and the quality of the supply was endangered. The source of supply recommended by the Mobile Water Works to the City and Planning Commissions was Big Creek, in the western part of Mobile County. The Big Creek project was placed in service in 1952 at a cost of about $7,000,000 including land, dams, pumphouse, reservoir and pipelines. Construction required two years. The Big Creek impoundment was named J. B. Converse Reservoir in 1987, but is commonly referred to as \\"Big Creek Lake\\". The pumping station was named S. Palmer Gaillard Pumping Station. Water is delivered from the lake and pumping station by pipes to two reservoirs where it is diverted either to domestic or industrial use. The reservoirs are at an elevation of 220 ft (67 m) and industrial water is delivered by gravity to industry at an elevation of about 25 ft (8 m). The industrial water line extends from the filter plant northward about 7 mi (11 km) to the industrial sites at Magazine Point. Pumps at Big Creek Lake provide treated water to Mobile and untreated water to local industries such as chemical plants and paper mills. Controversy The Big Creek tributary, like the Escatawpa, originates in Alabama and flows into Mississippi, joining the Escatawpa about nine miles (14 km) northeast of Robertson Lake. Big Creek Lake was a source of controversy regarding the equitable apportionment of limited fresh water resources between the states of Mississippi and Alabama in the early eighties. The City of Mobile utilizes waters from Big Creek Lake for their municipal drinking water supply, decreasing available flow for downstream uses in Mississippi.

It is common in some parts of the world with complex travel networks, notably the National Rail network of Great Britain. The term is sometimes used as a synonym of fare evasion.Light Transit Systems, p.162 Typical loopholes that lead to fare avoidance Apart from mileage, some rail systems or airlines calculate fare based on an individual route's popularity and a host of other factors. Therefore, instead of a fare directly from A to B, a passenger may go from A to P and then P to B for less. This price advantage is more pronounced if P is en route between A and B. Even if mileage is the sole factor in pricing apart from discounts, applicable to journeys exceeding a certain mileage, paradox may result for borderline cases. For example, a rail system practises a fare structure of $100 for the first 100 km and $6 for each additional 10 km. A ticket from A to B, 380 km apart, costs $268. If a discount of 15% applies to mileages exceeding 400 km only, a ticket from A to C, 420 km apart, would cost $292 × 85% = $248.2. A traveller may buy a ticket from A to C and alight at B, avoiding the $19.80. Frequently, smart cards, as a convenience, allow the user to run a negative balance. If this balance is greater than the cost of the card, the user may profit by simply discarding the card and purchasing another. One method is called scissoring, used for business air travel when return tickets are cheaper with a weekend between, assuming that tourists, not business people, travel like that. If two return journeys are done, A-B-B-A and once again a different week, two tickets can be purchased, A-B,B-A and B-A,A-B with weekends between in both tickets. Another loophole is when tickets are cheaper when booked early. Business travellers often book late, but for bigger companies cheaper tickets could be booked early on frequent routes, and be given to travellers when needing them. Some people have bought early tickets for popular routes and sold them later over the net. This is avoided by airlines by requiring a correct name and claiming high fees for changing that name. This has affected tourists who have misspelt their names, or changed names by marriage. Examples =Hong Kong= In the MTR system of Hong Kong, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau Station of East Rail Line serve as checkpoints for rail passengers between Hong Kong and mainland China and vice versa. If a passenger travels to/from stations from urban area (on or before Kowloon Tong), it is possible to save money by splitting the journey into 2 legs. For example, travelling directly from Hung Hom to Lo Wu costs HK$34.40. If the passenger exits and enters again at Sheung Shui Station, the journey costs HK$30.70 (Hung Hom - Sheung Shui: HK$9.10, Sheung Shui - Lo Wu: $21.60), which is HK$3.70 lower than the direct journey. =Sweden= The rail operator SJ had a loophole around 2010, where ticket prices were calculated the shortest way, even if going a detour with a train change. It was possible to book a short distance ticket with an extreme detour, and end the journey halfway. This loophole has been tightened. =United Kingdom= The comprehensive Great Britain National Fares Manual, Southern section The Privatisation of British Rail has resulted in a complex fare structure, with passengers regularly mis-sold tickets, or not aware of the full entitlement a ticket gives them. Enthusiasts, and those with connections to the industry, use the Great Britain railway technical manuals to identify which fares offer best value. This often involves purchasing tickets for stations which one has no intention of actually visiting, for a number of reasons. Since rail journeys in Great Britain are not always priced on mileage, often it is cheaper to buy a ticket from A to D via B and C, solely to travel from B to C (in some cases A = B or C = D). UK train operators have responded by often levying stiff penalty fares on passengers who attempt to leave the train before their ticketed destination when using an 'Advance Ticket' which does not allow a Break Of Journey. When splitting a journey it is important that the entire journey is covered by tickets and that where you transfer from one ticket to another the train must stop at that station. It is even possible for two or more legs to involve the same train with no need to alight, this is called a \\"tickety split\\". =United States= On the Amtrak system, state- sponsored trains such as the Pennsylvanian can sometimes carry much lower fares than Northeast Corridor trains. Travellers between New York and Philadelphia could purchase a ticket from New York to one of the branch line stations on the Harrisburg branch of the Northeast Corridor, and disembark in Philadelphia leaving the feeder portion of the ticket unused. Although the traveller would travel over the same physical line infrastructure, the cheaper ticket would only be valid on trains that were continuing beyond Philadelphia onto the feeder route, such as the Keystone Service trains. BART has several fares where the sum of the fares A–P + P–B is less than the direct fare A–B. The most dramatic is Fremont to Dublin/Pleasanton. The direct fare (paid by Clipper card, effective January 1, 2018 thru December 31, 2019) is $4.95; however if one exits and re-enters at Bay Fair (where a transfer is required anyway), the fare is $2.00 for each leg, for a total of $4.00.[https://www.bart.gov/tickets/calculator Fare Calculator] The Washington Metro sells a 7-day Short Trip Pass good for any trip during peak hours (when fares, effective 2014, can range up to $5.90) up to the maximum off-peak fare of $3.60, clearly under the assumption that it would not be worth people's time to exit and re-board. However, since someone traveling from West Falls Church to Eisenhower Avenue would have to transfer at Rosslyn station, rather than paying the $1.40 fee for the $5.00 peak fare they could exit and re-enter the paid area easily (as Rosslyn is one of 3 Metro stations with on-platform faregates), and have each of the two segments of their journey covered by their pass.

It is a problem in many parts of the world, and revenue protection officers and ticket barriers, manned or automatic, are in place to ensure only those with valid tickets may access the transport. The term fare avoidance is sometimes used as a euphemistic synonymLight Transit Systems, p.162 and sometimes used to refer to the lawful use of much cheaper tickets. Fare evasion and fare fraud may or may not be a crime depending on which jurisdictions. The fare not paid, compared to potential penalties and hassle, is generally considered \\"not worth it\\".Battaglia, J. The MetroCard Project. In 2600 Magazine, Spring Volume, Middle Island, N.Y., 2005. Retrieved from on June 23, 2008. Methods = On stations = Climbing over fence of a commuter train station in Moscow, Russia. One method of fare evasion is jumping or climbing over the turnstiles which bar the entryway into a subway system; hence the term, \\"turnstile jumping\\". Fare-dodgers also can walk right behind a passenger with a valid ticket before closing of some types of ticket barrier gates (this called tailgating). Other methods include adults traveling on children's tickets, or using discounted tickets or free passes that the passenger is not entitled to. They also can purchase a valid ticket for a shorter journey, at a much lower price than their actual journey to travel to cities where the target station is also served by many local services. However, ticket barriers are often watched by ticket inspectors and guards, and in that case fare-dodgers may climb over fences of a station or simply walk alongside railway tracks or use passes for railway staff to enter or exit the station without passing through ticket barriers. In some cases fare-dodgers can break and destroy fences around a train station to make a passage. = On vehicles = Fare-dodgers are running from ticket inspectors to the cars that they already checked. On vehicles fare-dodgers usually try to avoid ticket inspectors or conductors. On commuter trains with a sufficient number of passenger coaches one of the most common methods is walking away from ticket inspectors to other coaches and running on the platform in the opposite direction to the coaches that ticket inspectors already passed. On short commuter trains or especially intercity and long-distance passenger trains fare-dodgers can hide from ticket inspectors in toilets, luggage compartments, staff rooms and other utility chambers inside the train. Another issue occurs on the bus or tram; passengers either bypass the bus driver or enter through the rear door of the vehicle. In the New York City Bus system which causes fare lisses millions of dollars a year. If a bus or tram has a turnstile installed in it, fare-dodgers can jump over or crawl under the turnstile. In most countries passengers board a bus from any door, validate their tickets at machines and have no contact with the driver, thus increasing the potential for fare evasion. Passengers can also arrange for ticket inspectors to allow them to travel by offering bribes. A dangerous method of fare evasion is the riding on exterior parts of a vehicle (on a rooftops, rear parts, between cars or underneath a vehicle), also known as a \\"vehicle surfing\\" (train surfing, car surfing). Another method is hiding inside the utility cells under a railway car. Fare dodgers can practice this type of travelling unless it is very hard or impossible to hide from ticket inspectors inside a vehicle.

Countermeasures  = Technical devices =  Ticket barriers  Turnstiles are used to obstruct invalid access. Since most fare-dodgers know how to pass a gate without paying, turnstiles may be replaced with ticket barriers in a less easily transversed form, or may be integrated more closely with an electronic ticket system. Ticket barriers can also require the travellers to show their tickets upon exiting. Typically turnstiles are used at train stations, however some city transit systems install turnstiles inside city street vehicles, for example buses and trams.

This provided an impetus for renewed interests in evasion, because evaders could enter through gates when already opened by exiting passengers.Lysiak, Matt and D. Goldiner. Exit Gates as MTA’s ‘Free’ Way, Farebeaters Use Busy Stops to Advantage. In New York Daily News, April 30, 2009.  Closed circuit television (CCTV) Closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring is used by many public transport companies to combat vandalism and other public order crimes. Using CCTV to apprehend fare-dodgers in the act requires full- time human monitoring of the cameras. Sophisticated CCTV systems discriminate the scenes to detect and segregate suspicious behaviour from numerous screens and to enable automatic alerting. However, the attentiveness of the surveillance personnel may be threatened by false reliance on automatics. = Fare control staff =  Ticket inspectors  A railway conductor Ticket inspector and guard watching the turnstiles in Moscow Metro With manual fare collection, fare evasion can become more difficult and stigmatizing for the fare-dodging traveller, especially usage of discounted tickets (for example child, student or pensioner tickets) by passengers who are not allowed to use it. Ticket inspectors can verify tickets of passengers during the trip or during a boarding on vehicle (the last form of fare control is a common practice on long-distance rail transport). In some cases ticket inspectors are assigned to a certain vehicle during its trip on entire route (usually on long-distance or some commuter transport) and often, in another cases they randomly check multiple vehicles (usually city public transport and some commuter transport). Transit systems which use honor systems under normal circumstances may employ staff to collect fares at times and places where heavy use can be expected - for example, at stations serving a stadium after the conclusion of a major sporting event. Ticket inspectors can also watch for turnstiles at train stations to avoid unauthorized passing without a valid ticket and using discounted tickets. Ticket inspectors may or may not be allowed to use force to prevent or apprehend fare-dodgers.  Uniformed guards  The presence of uniformed guards can act as a deterrent to fare evasion, especially unauthorized passing through turnstiles. Guards may or may not be allowed to use force to prevent or apprehend fare-dodgers.  Police officers  Police officers can watch turnstiles and escort ticket inspectors in vehicles, and unlike ticket inspectors and guards they are allowed to use force to prevent or apprehend fare-dodgers. It is sometimes common for police officers dressed in plain clothes to patrol subway stations. As such, they have all the jurisdiction that normal officers have when policing the transit system. New South Wales trains in Australia use a combination of ticket inspectors and police patrols to enforce compliance with fare requirements. These police are part of NSW Police Force's transport command and are equipped with smart card readers to inspect tickets, NSW trains has eliminated paper tickets completely as of 2016.  Penalization  = Penalty fare = A penalty fare is a special fare charged at a higher than normal price because the purchaser did not comply with the normal ticket purchasing rules. Typically penalty fares are incurred by passengers failing to purchase a ticket before travelling or by purchasing an incorrect ticket which does not cover their whole journey. Penalty fares are not fines, and are used when no legal basis for prosecuting fare evasion exists, prosecution is deemed too drastic and costly, or is unlikely to result in conviction. Ticket inspector and police officers make up a fine for fare-dodger. = Civil and criminal penalties = On some systems, fare evasion is considered a misdemeanor. In such cases, police officers and in some cases transit employees are authorized to issue tickets which usually carry a fine. Then, charged persons can then be tried in court. Repeat violators and severe cases, such as ticket forgery, are punished more severely and sometimes involve incarceration. Wealthy offenders face stiffer penalties than poorer offenders. Evasion fines vary. On Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), evasion fines range from $85 to $235,Shaw, Chris. MARTA Jumpers Costing MARTA $3 Million a Year.

Early years In 1989, Lief's family moved to London where he studied at the American School in London. He went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he first became interested in South Africa and international development. In 1994, Lief visited South Africa to observe the country's transition to democracy. The experience had a profound impact on him, and when he returned to the US, he knew he wanted to become part of “the new South Africa.” In 1997, Lief returned to South Africa. He met Malizole “Banks” Gwaxula, a South African school teacher in a local shebeen in Port Elizabeth. Bonding over their shared passion for education, they founded Ubuntu Education Fund (renamed Ubuntu Pathways in 2017) to create equal educational opportunities for township children in Port Elizabeth. Career Soon after they began working in Port Elizabeth, Lief and Gwaxula realized they needed to pivot the mission to focus on the deeper issues affecting poverty. Today, Ubuntu's mission has significantly expanded into a holistic approach, aimed at providing South Africa's most vulnerable children with comprehensive education, health, and social support from birth/infancy to adulthood. This change spurred the organization's growth, pushing Ubuntu from its broom-closet origins to its position as an internationally recognized organization with offices on three continents. The organization recently launched the Ubuntu Advisory, a global consultancy practice that leverages the Ubuntu Model to help others achieve social impact. Lief's autobiography, I Am Because You Are, chronicles his journey as a young founder and his struggles to establish a quality nonprofit in post-apartheid South Africa. His vision has set forth what has been heralded as “a new, bold vision for breaking the cycle of poverty” (Rodale Inc, 2015). Recognition/Awards In 2016, Lief appeared in Fortune Magazine’s ‘40 Under 40’ list of the most influential young people in business. Lief was a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy and a visiting fellow at the University's new global policy research center, Perry World House. He was also the host of Philanthropy Unfiltered, a collaboration with the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania. Lief serves as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative Advisory Committee, was named one of the world's 101 Most Innovative Visionaries at the Decide Now Act Summit, has been recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader, and was selected as an Aspen Institute Global Fellow.

Early life  Born to Georgianna Derico, Hunt started his life in Pittsburgh, where his school friends, nicknamed him Tommy and it has stayed with him throughout his entire life. Music dominated his life and he was sent to reform school after spending his learning hours practicing for and entering talent shows. He was released from reform school when he was 10, and he and his mother moved to Chicago. The Flamingos After a stint in the United States Air Force, Hunt went AWOL in order to be with his mother, who was dying. He served time in prison for deserting, and after his release, returned to Chicago and formed a group called The Five Echoes. While performing in a club, he was approached by Zeke Carey of The Flamingos, and asked to take Carey's place, as he had recently been drafted. Hunt was kept on after Carey returned. In 1959 their biggest hit was \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\" which remains their most popular song, being used in film soundtracks and on compilation albums to this date. Solo career Hunt left the group in 1960 due to musical differences, but within three days he was approached by Luther Dixon and released \\"Parade Of Broken Hearts\\" which was slow to be picked up by the radio stations. In New York a disc jockey called Jocko Henderson introduced the song but played the B-side by mistake. The track aired was \\"Human\\", Hunt's biggest hit in the U.S. His 1962 B-side, \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\", written by Bacharach and David and produced by Leiber and Stoller, was the first recording of the song which later became a major hit for Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick and others. Hunt became a regular performing at The Apollo in New York alongside such artists as Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Shirelles, Dionne Warwick, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Sam and Dave. To the best of his knowledge, Hunt remains the only person to have his photograph framed twice in the Apollo foyer, both with the Flamingos and as a solo artist. Several years and a couple of minor hits later, Hunt sang for the U.S. Army in Germany. By 1969 he left his homeland, traveled back to Germany, through Belgium and across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. Northern soul Hunt in 2002 After several performances in the theater clubs throughout the UK, Hunt sang at the second anniversary of the Wigan Casino, and there followed success on the Northern soul scene. Hunt was approached by Russ Winstanly and Mike Walker of the Casino and released several hits on Spark Records. The first was a cover version of a song formerly sung by Roy Hamilton, entitled \\"Crackin' Up\\". It peaked at #39 in the UK Singles Chart in October 1975. This was followed by another chart success \\"Loving On The Losing Side\\" (UK #28, 1976). 1982/83 saw Hunt win the Male Vocalist of the Year, presented by Club Mirror. His track, \\"One Fine Morning\\", reached #44 in the UK chart in December 1976. Later years With the decline of the Northern soul, Hunt's shows dwindled and he hit the cabaret circuit further afield, moving to Amsterdam in 1986, and traveling the world. In 1996, the first of his recognitions came in the form of The Rhythm and Blues Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award for the Flamingos contribution to music. In 1997, Hunt relocated to the UK and embarked on a revived Northern soul scene. In later years, having turned his hand to songwriting, Hunt penned his autobiography, Only Human, My Soulful Life, with author, Jan Warburton, which was released in December 2008. Hunt started a new live show as Tommy Hunt & The New Flamingos, with members of the Spanish vocal group Velvet Candles. This show was presented on June 3, 2011, during the Screamin' Summer Festival in (Barcelona, Spain. Awards The award for the Flamingos from the Vocal Group Hall of Fame came in 2000, followed by the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame in 2001. The Flamingos were inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for their thirty-year contribution to music.

Career Capet came from the Paris proletariat. By the age of fifteen, he had to maintain himself by playing in bistros and cafes. He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris where he was a pupil of Jean-Pierre Maurin and later appeared as soloist with French orchestras. Between 1896 and 1899, he was the concertmaster of the orchestra of the Concerts Lamoureux. He also taught violin at the Société Sainte-Cécile de Bordeaux (1899–1903). His notable students include Jascha Brodsky and Ivan Galamian, both of whom became influential violin teachers of the latter part of the twentieth century. Lucien Capet had a successful career as a soloist and chamber musician, forming the Capet Quartet in 1893. Robert Casadesus & Lucien Capet The quartet went through many changes of personnel and made several recordings of Beethoven string quartets and Romantic and Classical works. Lucien Capet Quartet Capet was also a well-regarded teacher, known especially for his bow technique. With the violinist and chamber musician Suzanne Chaigneau, Capet founded the Institut moderne du violin in 1924.Massin B., Les Joachim – Une famille de musiciens (Paris: Fayard, 1999). Capet wrote a book on \\"Superior Bowing Technique\\" which is an essential treatise on all aspects of bowing technique for the violin; reprints are available (including translations into English by Margaret Schmidt and Stephen Shipps). Lucien Capet also worked closely with bowmaker Joseph Arthur Vigneron to develop a Lucien Capet model bow (modele Lucien Capet was often stamped on such bows). Vigneron's concept/design for these bows was a sort of rounded triangular cross section, which added stability to the bow (lower centre of gravity).\\"Filimonov Fine Violins Quotes Encyclopedia of the Violin - Alberto Bachmann Selected compositions * Le Rouet, symphonic poem * Prélude religieux, for orchestra * Devant la mer, for voice and orchestra * Poème, for violin and orchestra * 5 string quartets * 2 sonatas for violin and piano * 6 études for violin * Aria in A minor for violin, viola and piano, Op. 5 (1908) Recordings by the Quatuor Capet (Made c.1925-1930) * Beethoven: Quartet in A major, Op. 18 No. 5 (Columbia Records, D 1659-62). * Beethoven: Quartet in F major, Op. 59 No. 1 (Col.

CircuitLogix supports analog, digital, and mixed-signal circuits, and its SPICE simulation gives accurate real-world results. The graphic user interface allows students to quickly and easily draw, modify and combine analog and digital circuit diagrams. CircuitLogix was first launched in 2005, and its popularity has grown quickly since that time. In 2012, it reached the milestone of 250,000 licensed users, and became the first electronics simulation product to have a global installed base of a quarter-million customers in over 100 countries. Article regarding user base CircuitLogix was developed by Dr. Colin Simpson, an electronics professor at George Brown College, in Toronto, Canada, and John (Bud) Skinner, a computer programmer. The electronics program has won awards including the Award of Excellence from the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC). The professional version of CircuitLogix (CircuitLogix Pro) includes over 10,000 device models, as well as 8 virtual instruments. It also includes 3DLab, which is a software product that combines an interactive 3-dimensional learning environment and electronic devices and tools to enhance the user's comprehension of electronics. 3DLab virtual components include batteries, switches, motors, lamps, resistors, inductors, capacitors and instruments including oscilloscopes, Signal generators, and frequency counters. Overview Fast, accurate simulation of electronic circuits is essential because it provides the information needed to perform accurate analysis of circuit behavior. SPICE simulators are used to verify that analog and mixed-signal circuits will yield the expected outputs. A schematic netlist file and circuit input values are fed to the SPICE software, which simulates the circuit's behavior for a specified length of time. CircuitLogix allows for the observation of voltage and current levels at any circuit node as they change with frequency and time. It allows for obtaining accurate results even when simulating complex circuits where hierarchical blocks are reused. The CircuitLogix simulation engine is based on Berkeley SPICE, and contains a GUI to make circuit design easier and more efficient. The CircuitLogix 32-bit SPICE engine is interactive, allowing, for example, the frequency of sources to be changed, potentiometers adjusted, and switches thrown during simulation. The SPICE engine is fully integrated with the schematic capture and waveform tools; CircuitLogix passes schematic edits to the simulator automatically while running. Components such as fuses, LEDs and controlled switches are automatically updated in the schematic as the simulation runs. CircuitLogix simulates analog, digital, and mixed analog-digital circuits. The simulator first divides the circuit into analog and digital portions. The analog circuitry is simulated with the time-step driven SPICE engine, while the digital parts are simulated separately with an event-driven simulation engine. The CircuitLogix digital engine was developed directly in .NET, faster than SPICE macros. Because the simulator automatically performs signal conversion, it is possible to connect any analog or digital part to any other. The system’s model library contains hybrid parts for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion.  Mixed-mode simulation  CircuitLogix is a mixed-mode schematic editor, and includes both analog and event-driven simulation capabilities: any simulation may contain components that are analog, event driven (digital or sampled-data), or a combination of both. An entire mixed signal analysis can be driven from one integrated schematic. All the digital models in CircuitLogix provide accurate specification of propagation time and rise/fall time delays. The event-driven algorithm used by CircuitLogix is general-purpose and supports non-digital types of data. For example, elements can use real or integer values to simulate DSP functions or sampled data filters. Because the event-driven algorithm is faster than the standard SPICE matrix, simulation time is greatly reduced for circuits that use event-driven models in place of analog models. Mixed-mode simulation is handled on three levels by CircuitLogix: (a) with primitive digital elements that use timing models and a built-in 12-state digital logic simulator, (b) with subcircuit models that use the actual transistor topology of the integrated circuit, and finally, (c) with In-line Boolean logic expressions. These two modeling techniques use SPICE to solve a problem while the third method, digital primitives, uses mixed-mode capability.

The Trasimene Line (so-named for Lake Trasimene, the site of a major battle of the Second Punic War in 217 BC) was a German defensive line during the Italian Campaign of World War II. It was sometimes known as the Albert Line. The German Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, used the line to delay the Allied northward advance in Italy in mid June 1944 to buy time to withdraw troops to the Gothic Line and finalise the preparation of its defenses. Background After the Allied capture of the Italian capital of Rome on 4 June 1944 following the successful breakthrough at Monte Cassino and Anzio during Operation Diadem in May 1944, the German 14th and 10th Armies fell back: the 14th along the Tyrrhenian front and the 10th through central Italy and the Adriatic coast. There was a huge gap between the armies and with the Allies advancing some 10 km per day, the flanks of both armies were exposed and encirclement was threatened.Muhm, German Tactics in the Italian Campaign Two days after Rome fell, General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander, Commander-in- Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), received orders from his superior, General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, the Allied Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), to push the retreating German Army north to a line running from Pisa to Rimini (i.e. the Gothic Line) as quickly as possible to prevent the establishment of any sort of coherent enemy defense in central Italy. Battle On Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army front, the U.S. VI Corps, under Major General Lucian Truscott, was pushed up the coast along highway 1 and U.S. II Corps, under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, along highway 2 towards Viterbo. To their right the XIII Corps, under Lieutenant General Sidney Kirkman, part of the British Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese, headed up highway 3 towards Terni and PerugiaCarver p. 209 whilst V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, advanced up the Adriatic coast. Between 4 June and 16 June, whilst maintaining contact with the advancing Allies, Kesselring executed a remarkable and unorthodox maneuver with his depleted divisions, resulting in his two armies aligning and uniting their wings on the defensive positions on the Trasimene Line. Remarkable though this was, he was probably helped by the confusion caused in the Allied advance by the relieving of the U.S. II and VI Corps (substituted by Major General Willis D. Crittenberger's U.S. IV Corps and Lieutenant General Alphonse Juin's French Expeditionary Corps). The British X Corps, under Lieutenant General Richard McCreery, had also been brought into the line on XIII Corps' right whilst V Corps had been relieved by the Polish II Corps, under Lieutenant General Władysław Anders. By the last week of June the Allies were facing the Trasimene positions. Joachim Lemelsen's 14th Army had Frido von Senger und Etterlin's XIV Panzer Corps facing the U.S. IV Corps on the west coast and Alfred von Schlemm's 1st Parachute Corps facing the French Expeditionary Corps beside them. On 22 June, a U.S. armored attack near Massa Marittima was defeated by a German tank platoon under Oberfähnrich Oskar Röhrig from Heavy Tank Battalion 503. The German Tiger I's knocked out 11 Sherman tanks, while the terrified American tank crews abandoned another 12. The Germans suffered no losses. Röhrig was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for this action. Four Shermans were knocked out by two Tigers on 12 July near Collesalvetti. Heinrich von Vietinghoff's 10th Army had Traugott Herr's LXXVI Panzer Corps facing XIII and X Corps and Valentin Feurstein's LI Mountain Corps facing the Polish II Corps on the Adriatic. The toughest defenses were around the lake itself with XIII Corps' British 78th Infantry Division experiencing fierce fighting on 17 June at Città della Pieve and 21 June at San Fatucchio. By 24 June they had worked their way round to the north shore and linked with X Corps' 4th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions as the German defenders withdrew towards Arezzo.Carver, pp. 216-217 On 8 July, the 2nd Company of the German 508th Heavy Panzer Battalion knocked out four British Shermans near Tavarnelle Val di Pesa southwest of Florence. The U.S. IV Corps also found progress slow but by 1 July had crossed the river Cecina and were within of Livorno. Meanwhile, the French Corps had been held up on the river Orcia west of Lake Trasimene until the parachutist defenders withdrew on 27 June allowing them to enter Siena on 3 July.Carver, p. 217 Footnotes References  * External links *Battle of Lake Trasimeno.

A Republican activist, Fletcher lost to the Democrat Rodney Alexander of Quitman in Jackson Parish. Alexander prevailed with 86,718 votes to Fletcher's 85,744.Louisiana Secretary of State, Election returns, December 7, 2002. Fletcher's advertising agency known as \\"The Fletcher Group\\" was cited by the American Advertising Federation for its highly successful statewide television campaigns. He also hosted a political talk program on 92.7 Fox FM radio in Monroe in Ouachita Parish. In 2008, Fletcher's agency worked to elect Republican John C. Fleming of Minden in Webster Parish as the U.S. representative for Louisiana's 4th congressional district, vacated by the retirement of Republican Representative Jim McCrery of Shreveport. Fletcher served briefly as Fleming's chief of staff until sidelined by his fatal illness.\\"Former talk show host, political operative Lee Fletcher dies at 43, The Monroe New-Star, October 1, 2009. Early years and education Fletcher was born in E.A. Conway Medical Center in Monroe to Dewey Fletcher, Sr. (1943-2004), and the former Patricia Gaye Brown (born August 1944), later Patricia Irby, of Monroe. He was reared at the 9B Ranch, a horse ranch and a cotton farm, in Oak Grove in rural West Carroll Parish in northeast Louisiana by his maternal grandparents, Dayton C. Brown (1913–1994) and Pat Brown, who resides in West Monroe. He had two sisters, Nicki Hall of Tyler, Texas, and Ashley Simmons-Jones of West Monroe. He was a cousin of Louisiana 4th Judicial District Judge Wendell Manning of Monroe. In 1984, Fletcher graduated from Oak Grove High School. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural education from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston in August 1989. A member of the Sigma Nu fraternity, he was the Louisiana Tech student body president in 1988. He was a lifelong devotee of Louisiana Tech athletics.Obituary of Dewey Lee Fletcher, Jr., The Monroe News- Star, Retrieved October 3, 2009. Eleven years later, he obtained a Master of Business Administration degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Political activities As a youth, Fletcher campaigned for the election of Ronald W. Reagan for U.S. President. He worked in the George H. W. Bush administration and in the United States Department of Agriculture. He was a graduate and former faculty member of the Republican National Committee Campaign Management College and its Leadership Institute Campaign School in Arlington, Virginia. In 1996 and 1997, Fletcher was the campaign manager and then the chief of staff for U.S. Representative John Cooksey of Monroe, who limited himself to three terms. Cooksey edged out the comeback attempt of former U.S. Representative Clyde Holloway of Forest Hill in the south Rapides Parish, the last person to represent the since defunct Louisiana's 8th congressional district. He defeated in the runoff election, technically the general election in Louisiana the Democrat state legislator Francis C. Thompson of Delhi in Richland Parish. It was in the 2002 race to succeed Cooksey, who ran unsuccessfully that year for the United States Senate, that Fletcher lost to Rodney Alexander. Fletcher first edged out Clyde Holloway for the general election berth against Alexander. Also in the running was another major Republican candidate, then State Senator Robert J. Barham of Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish, now the director of Louisiana State Parks. Alexander led in the primary with 52,952 votes (29 percent). Fletcher followed with 45,278 (25 percent). Holloway polled 42,573 votes (23 percent), and Barham received 34,533 votes (19 percent). Three others divided the remaining but potentially crucial 5 percent of the primary ballots.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 5, 2002. Holloway hence fell 2,705 votes short of entering the second round of balloting with Alexander. Though he is a longtime Republican who later in life was a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Holloway endorsed the then Democrat Alexander over his fellow conservative Fletcher. Holloway's aberration was a reaction to the hard campaigning waged against him by Fletcher in the primary. Critics claim that Holloway was furious over negative, anonymous automated telephone calls. Not only did Holloway refuse to endorse fellow Republican Fletcher, but numerous Republican groups in the 5th Congressional District also backed the then- Democrat Alexander in the general election. The final outcome seemed to indicate that Holloway's endorsement and the support of such Republican activist groups contributed considerably to Alexander's narrow victory.Undated 2002 article from the Alexandria Daily Town Talk In 2004, Congressman Alexander switched parties and became a Republican with widespread support from district Republican leaders. That year, he handily defeated fellow Republican Jock Scott of Alexandria in the nonpartisan blanket primary. In 2006, Alexander supported the appointment of Holloway to a high position in the United States Department of Agriculture. The selection required the approval of President George W. Bush, who had supported Fletcher in the general election against Alexander. In a 2003 interview with James H. \\"Jim\\" Brown, the former Louisiana state senator, secretary of state, and insurance commissioner, Fletcher said that he did not have \\"a problem\\" with Holloway despite the disappointment to both in the 2002 congressional race.Jim Brown interview with Lee Fletcher, Politicsla.com, January 14, 2003. In 2007, Fletcher urged voters in the 32nd State Senate District to elect Neil Riser, the Republican businessman from Columbia, who defeated a Democrat for the seat vacated by term-limited incumbent Noble Ellington of Winnsboro in Franklin Parish. Riser beat the Democrat former State Representative Bryant Hammett of Ferriday in Concordia Parish and still holds this seat. In 2007, Fletcher devoted himself to electing more Republicans to office and served as the northeast Louisiana consultant for the successful gubernatorial candidate, Bobby Jindal. Fletcher's firm worked in eight campaigns and was successful in seven. The one loss occurred when the Fletcher-backed candidate advanced to the general election but then withdrew. Though self-described as a \\"Ronald Reagan Republican,\\" Fletcher was a consultant for the Democratic African American mayor of Monroe, Jamie Mayo, in the latter's re-election campaign in February 2008. Mayo told a friend that his hiring of Fletcher \\"made the difference between winning and losing.\\" In 2008, Fletcher developed and launched an all new talk FM format station named 92.7 Fox FM and hosted his own daily show, Townhall Show, on this regional talk station.Town Hall Show He had also earlier substituted at times for Moon Griffon.The Moon Griffon Show, radio talk show program then based in Monroe, Louisiana, October 1, 2009. Last days In February 2009, less than two months into his tenure as John Fleming's chief of staff, Fletcher was stricken with cancer. He underwent treatment in Ruston and Monroe as well as The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. A sarcoma in his back metastasized.T. Scott Boatright, \\"Fletcher dies at age 43,\\" Ruston Daily Leader, Ruston, Louisiana, October 1, 2009. He died at the age of forty-three at St. Francis Hospital in Monroe, with his grandmother at his side. Services were held on October 5, 2009, at the First Church of God in Oak Grove, with the Reverend Mark Foster, a Pentecostal pastor from West Monroe officiating, assisted by the Reverends Paul Ninemire, a Church of God minister from Oak Grove, and Dennis Anger, pastor of the Cypress Street Church of God in West Monroe. Interment was in Oak Grove Cemetery. Pallbearers included former U.S. Representative John Cooksey, political consultant Roy Fletcher (no relation), newspaper publisher Sam Hanna Jr., and Judge Wendell Manning. Honorary pallbearers were U.S. Representatives John Fleming and Rodney Alexander and state Senators Mike Walsworth and Neil Riser, and Fletcher's Sigma Nu fraternity brothers.

Biography He was educated in Essex where he started playing the piano and viola. He began to compose at 14, and two years later attended Colchester Institute. Here he studied piano with Frank Wibaut and composition with John Joubert at the Birmingham Conservatoire. As a founding member of the Thallein Ensemble, he performed works by Berio, Messiaen, Finnissy, Ives and Schnittke. In his final year he completed a dissertation on Schnittke's polystylism and was the soloist in his piano concerto. After graduating from Birmingham Conservatoire with a first class degree, he studied for three years at the Royal Academy of Music with Christopher Brown. In his last year he was Leverhulme Composition Fellow and won the major composition prizes; he graduated with MMus and DipRAM. He went on to develop contacts with period instrument performers and has written works for 'old' instruments which have recently been revived, including viols, harpsichord (commissions by Gary Cooper and Trevor Pinnock), and baroque orchestra. He lectures at Birmingham Conservatoire and runs education projects for English National Opera, The Stables, Milton Keynes and the Wigmore Hall. He taught composition and general studies at the Junior Department of the Royal Academy of Music until leaving at the end of the 2005-2006 academic year. He has since returned to cover David Knotts' timetable whilst his colleague was in America.

It is an important material due to its high electrical conductivity, hardness, chemical stability, and melting point. It is a black, lustrous, chemically inert powder with a low density. It has the cubic structure typical for metal hexaborides, with octahedral units of 6 boron atoms combined with calcium atoms. CaB6 and lanthanum-doped CaB6 both show weak ferromagnetic properties, which is a remarkable fact because calcium and boron are neither magnetic, nor have inner 3d or 4f electronic shells, which are usually required for ferromagnetism.  Properties  CaB6 has been investigated in the past due to a variety of peculiar physical properties, such as superconductivity, valence fluctuation and Kondo effects.. However, the most remarkable property of CaB6 is its ferromagnetism. It occurs at unexpectedly high temperature (600 K) and with low magnetic moment (below 0.07 \\\\mu_\\\\mathrm{B} per atom). The origin of this high temperature ferromagnetism is the ferromagnetic phase of a dilute electron gas, linkage to the presumed excitonic state in calcium boride, or external impurities on the surface of the sample. The impurities might include iron and nickel, probably coming from impurities in the boron used to prepare the sample. CaB6 is insoluble in H2O, MeOH (methanol), and EtOH (ethanol) and dissolves slowly in acids. Its microhardness is 27 GPa, Knoop hardness is 2600 kg/mm2), Young modulus is 379 GPa, and electrical resistivity is greater than 2·1010 Ω·m for pure crystals. CaB6 is a semiconductor with an energy gap estimated as 1.0 eV. The low, semi- metallic conductivity of many CaB6 samples can be explained by unintentional doping due to impurities and possible non-stoichiometry. Structural Information The crystal structure of calcium hexaboride is a cubic lattice with calcium at the cell centre and compact, regular octahedra of boron atoms linked at the vertices by B-B bonds to give a three-dimensional boron network. Each calcium has 24 nearest-neighbor boron atoms The calcium atoms are arranged in simple cubic packing so that there are holes between groups of eight calcium atoms situated at the vertices of a cube. The simple cubic structure is expanded by the introduction of the octahedral B6 groups and the structure is a CsCl-like packing of the calcium and hexaboride groups. Another way of describing calcium hexaboride is as having a metal and a B62− octahedral polymeric anions in a CsCl-type structure were the Calcium atoms occupy the Cs sites and the B6 octahedra in the Cl sites. The Ca-B bond length is 3.05 Å and the B-B bond length is 1.7 Å. 43Ca NMR data contains δpeak at -56.0 ppm and δiso at -41.3 ppm where δiso is taken as peak max +0.85 width, the negative shift is due to the high coordination number. Raman Data: Calcium hexaboride has three Raman peaks at 754.3, 1121.8, and 1246.9 cm−1 due to the active modes A1g, Eg, and T2g respectively. Observed Vibrational Frequencies cm−1 : 1270(strong) from A1g stretch, 1154 (med.) and 1125(shoulder) from Eg stretch, 526, 520, 485, and 470 from F1g rotation, 775 (strong) and 762 (shoulder) from F2g bend, 1125 (strong) and 1095 (weak) from F1u bend, 330 and 250 from F1u translation, and 880 (med.) and 779 from F2u bend.  Preparation  *One of the main reactions for industrial production is: :CaO + 3 B2O3 \\\\+ 10 Mg → CaB6 \\\\+ 10 MgO Other methods of producing CaB6 powder include: *Direct reaction of calcium or calcium oxide and boron at 1000 °C; :Ca + 6B → CaB6 *Reacting Ca(OH)2 with boron in vacuum at about 1700 °C (carbothermal reduction); :Ca(OH)2 +7B → CaB6 \\\\+ BO(g) + H2O(g) *Reacting calcium carbonate with boron carbide in vacuum at above 1400 °C (carbothermal reduction) *Reacting of CaO and H3BO3 and Mg to 1100 °C. *Low-temperature (500 °C) synthesis :CaCl2 \\\\+ 6NaBH4 → CaB6 \\\\+ 2NaCl + 12H2 \\\\+ 4Na results in relatively poor quality material. * To produce pure CaB6 single crystals, e.g., for use as cathode material, the thus obtained CaB6 powder is further recrystallized and purified with the zone melting technique. The typical growth rate is 30 cm/h and crystal size ~1x10 cm. *Single-crystal CaB6 Nanowires (diameter 15–40 nm, length 1–10 micrometres) can be obtained by pyrolysis of diborane (B2H6) over calcium oxide (CaO) powders at 860–900 °C, in presence of Ni catalyst.  Uses  Calcium hexaboride is used in the manufacturing of boron-alloyed steel and as a deoxidation agent in production of oxygen-free copper. The latter results in higher conductivity than conventionally phosphorus-deoxidized copper owing to the low solubility of boron in copper. CaB6 can also serve as a high temperature material, surface protection, abrasives, tools, and wear resistant material. CaB6 is highly conductive, has low work function, and thus can be used as a hot cathode material. When used at elevated temperature, calcium hexaboride will oxidize degrading its properties and shortening its usable lifespan. CaB6 is also a promising candidate for n-type thermoelectric materials, because its power factor is larger than or comparable to that of common thermoelectric materials Bi2Te3 and PbTe. CaB also can be used as an antioxidant in carbon bonded refractories.  Precautions  Calcium hexaboride is irritating to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system. This product should be handled with proper protective eyeware and clothing. Never put calcium hexaboride down the drain or add water to it.

A pink static dissipative bag, and a silver conductive bag. Note the two recurring ESD symbols An antistatic bag is a bag used for storing electronic components, which are prone to damage caused by electrostatic discharge (ESD). These bags are usually plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and have a distinctive color (silvery for metallised film, pink or black for polyethylene). The polyethylene variant may also take the form of foam or bubble wrap, either as sheets or bags. Multiple layers of protection are often used to protect from both mechanical damage and electrostatic damage. A protected device can be packaged inside a metalized PET film bag, inside a pink polyethylene bubble-wrap bag, which is finally packed inside a rigid black polyethylene box lined with pink poly foam. It is important that the bags only be opened at static-free workstations.JESD625-A/Requirements for Handling Electrostatic-Discharge- Sensitive (ESDS) Devices Dissipative antistatic bags, as the name suggests, are made of standard polyethylene with a static dissipative coating or layer on the plastic. This prevents buildup of a static charge on the surface of the bag, as it dissipates the charge to ground (i.e., whatever other surface it is touching). This bridge to ground is achieved with the inclusion of a tallow amine on the bags surface which attracts moisture that can conduct the charge to another surface, or to the atmosphere itself. In this sense, this type is truly 'antistatic' in that it hinders the formation of static charges. It, however, is not resistant to electrostatic discharge; if something else with a charge touches the bag (such as a person's hand), its charge would easily transfer through the bag and its contents. These bags are usually pink or red in color because of the dissipative chemical layer. Black bags also exist, wherein the polyethylene is manufactured containing trace amounts of carbon, forming a partial shield, though not a complete one. Conductive antistatic bags are manufactured with a layer of conductive metal, often aluminum, and a dielectric layer of plastic covered in a static dissipative coating. This forms both a shield and a non-conductive barrier, shielding the contents from static charge via the Faraday cage effect. These bags are preferred for more sensitive parts, but they also see use in environments where sparks would be hazardous, such as oxygen-rich areas in aircraft and hospitals. Metalized bags are more fragile than their nonmetal counterparts, however, as any puncture compromises the integrity of the shield. In addition, they have a limited shelf life, as the metal substrate can deteriorate over time. These bags are often gray or silver owing to the metal layer, while still being transparent to some degree. Foam also exists in both pink (dissipative) and black (conductive) varieties, used for storing individual leaded components by piercing the leads into the foam.
