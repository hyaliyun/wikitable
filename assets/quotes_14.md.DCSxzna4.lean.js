It is thirty-four miles south from Melbourne. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 data, the city had a population of 15,220. History =Pre-Columbian= Parts of a human skeleton were found north of Vero in association with the remains of Pleistocene animals in 1915. The find was controversial, and the view that the human remains dated from much later than the Pleistocene prevailed for many years. In 2006, an image of a mastodon or mammoth carved on a bone was found in vicinity of the Vero man discovery. A scientific forensic examination of the bone found the carving had probably been done in the Pleistocene. Archaeologists from Mercyhurst University, in conjunction with the Old Vero Ice Age Sites Committee (OVIASC), conducted excavations at the Old Vero Man site in Vero Beach in 2014–15. Starting in 2016, archaeologists from Florida Atlantic University joined the Old Vero Man site excavations. =Post-Columbian= In 1715, a Spanish treasure fleet wrecked off the coast of Vero. Eleven out of twelve Spanish ships carrying tonnes of silver foundered in a hurricane. The remains of the silver attracted pirates. A group of 300 unemployed English privateers led by Henry Jennings stole about £87,500 in gold and silver in their first acts of piracy. In 1872 Captain Allen W. Estes officially established the first land patent between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian River Lagoon, after settling in the area in 1870. In 1893 Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railway began operation through the area. The town of Vero was chartered on June 13, 1919. Vero was officially renamed \\"Vero Beach\\" and was switched from being part of St. Lucie County to become the county seat of Indian River County when it was formed in June, 1925. There are many theories on possible origin of the city name, but there's no consensus. During the war year of 1942 the U.S. Navy selected surrounding the Vero Beach Municipal Airport as the site of Fort Pierce Naval Amphibious Training Base, a Naval Air Station. Due to the bombing practices conducted during the WWII, there are many buried explosives and the Army Corps officials have conducted ongoing search & clearing exercises for the potentially dangerous items since 2014. In 1951 Barber Bridge was built from mainland to barrier islands. It was later demolished and replaced in 1995 with the Merrill P. Barber Bridge. It is named after Merrill P. Barber who was the mayor of Vero beach in 1947. In 1957 Piper Aircraft began research and development in Vero Beach. In 1961 Piper Aircraft moved administrative and manufacturing operations to Vero after completing building additions. In 1965 the A1A bridge over the Sebastian Inlet connected the two barrier islands. In 1979, the 17th Street Bridge was completed, allowing a second point of access from Vero Beach mainland to the barrier islands.

History Jacob City history goes back as far as the early 19th century, when many former slaves moved from Webbville to isolate themselves from harassment from the whites there, most of whose residents moved to Marianna in 1882. Webbville no longer exists, but was located around the current location of U.S. 231 and State Road 73. Marianna was known as the rich man's town and no blacks were welcome at all. The first known settlement of Jacob City was by a white man named Jacob Jones, who housed the first blacks on his land and property, that is where Jacob City got its name, as they would tell their friends \\"lets go to Jacob's.\\" As blacks arrived to escape oppression, they moved farther down and made horse wagon trails into dirt roads forming a small community. By the mid-19th century, the small town of Jacob was Jackson County's first black community. Blacks started their own store, but the owner was murdered and the store was never re-opened. By the late 19th century, St. Mary Missionary Baptist church was built on what is now Main Street and is commemorated by a Jacob City historical marker. By the early 20th century, Jacob's dirt roads were improved and its population rose, but the poverty level was high due to the lack of education as there was no school for black children. St. Mary's Church provided a school, but many of its students never made it past seventh grade because they had to help with farm work at home with their parents. In 1953, St. Paul's school was established near Cambellton as an elementary and high school where Jacob children could get a better education. The Cambellton school lasted until 1972. In the late 20th century, Jacob modernized and joined the Florida League of Cities. In 1984, Jacob became Jacob City and built a town hall.

The population was 6,102 at the 2010 census. In 2018 the estimated population was 7,091. It is the county seat of Jackson County, and is home to Chipola College. The official nickname of Marianna is \\"The City of Southern Charm\\". History Part of the historic downtown area Marianna was founded in 1828 by Scottish entrepreneur Scott Beverege, who named the town after his daughters Mary and Anna. The following year, it was designated as the county seat, superseding the earlier settlement of Webbville, which soon after dissolved and no longer exists. Marianna was platted along the Chipola River. Many planters from North Carolina relocated to Jackson County to develop new plantations to take advantage of the fertile soil. They relied on the labor of enslaved African Americans brought from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade. =Civil War era= John Milton was a major planter who owned the Sylvania Plantation and hundreds of slaves. Governor Milton was a grandson of Revolutionary War hero, John Milton (Georgia politician) (c. 1740/1757–1817), and a descendant of Sir Christopher Milton, the brother of the famous English poet, John Milton. However, Milton did not have to rely solely on a distinguished American founding family name. He was a remarkable, if not irascible, lawyer and personality. This famous Marianna resident was elected as governor of Florida, serving during the Civil War years. Governor Milton opposed the Confederate States of America rejoining the United States. As federal troops were preparing to take control of Tallahassee, Governor Milton received word that the Civil War had ended and that Florida would again be part of the United States. On April 1, 1865, as the southern cause was collapsing, Milton died of a gunshot wound from his gun at Sylvania. A New York Times article, written in polemic style, attributed Governor Milton's sudden death to suicide, which conflicted with local reporting from Florida. The Governor's words, likely political oratorical hyperbole, that he “would rather die” than suffer the humiliation of Federal invasion, were cleverly linked to his sudden death by the New York Times. The West Florida News reported the sudden death of Florida's Fifth Governor as a hunting accident. Governor John Milton was buried in the St. Luke's Episcopal churchyard at Marianna. The New York Times article created an unsubstantiated account that persisted in the difficult days of Reconstruction. Marianna was the site of a Civil War battle in 1864 between a small home guard of about 150 boys, older men, and wounded soldiers, and a contingent of approximately 700 Federal troops. =Reconstruction period= During the early years after the Civil War, violence flared in Marianna and Jackson County, where 150 to 200 Republicans, some black, were assassinated in what was known as the Jackson County War by members of the Ku Klux Klan in an effort to secure white supremacy. Locals claimed this was the work of \\"ruffians\\" from border states and carpetbaggers. Bishop Charles H. Pearce of Massachusetts, an AME minister who became a state senator in Florida, had first-hand knowledge of the situation. He placed the blame on the planters of Jackson County, who supported action against black Republicans. Disputes over farm land caused much of the disorder, as poor whites objected to negro ownership of choice farms. Historic Abstract Office, Downtown Marianna =Post-Reconstruction to mid-20th century= Violence continued in the state after Reconstruction, reaching a peak in most areas at the turn of the 20th century. This was the period in which southern states also disenfranchised most blacks and thousands of poor whites by raising barriers to voter registration. From 1900 to 1930, Florida had the highest rate of lynchings per capita in the South and the nation. Refusing to accept the violence, thousands of African Americans left the state during the Great Migration of the early 20th century, going to northern and midwestern industrial cities for work and other opportunities. Dekle-Brunner House, Marianna Historic District Lynchings in Marianna In 1934 Claude Neal, a local African-American man, was accused of rape and murder of a young white woman. He was moved between jails, but a lynch mob found him in Brewton, Alabama. The mob abducted him and brought him back to Florida, killing him near the Chattahoochee River and Greenwood. The men brought his body to the Cannady farm, where a larger mob of an estimated 2,000 persons was waiting; people shot and mutilated the body. Neal's body was hanged from a tree at the Marianna courthouse square. The next day, whites rioted in town, attacking blacks and destroying some of their houses. The governor ordered more than 100 troops of the National Guard to Marianna to suppress the violence. About 200 blacks and two police were injured. The six white vigilantes who led the lynching remain unidentified. Historic Chipola Hotel, Downtown Marianna In 1943 Cellos Harrison was taken from the county jail at Marianna by a white mob and hanged (lynched) near Greenwood. His case had been in the courts for two years in appeals after the African-American man was arrested and twice convicted by all-white juries and sentenced to death for the 1940 murder of a white man. He had confessed without benefit of counsel, and his convictions were overturned by the Florida Supreme Court as a result. But whites were tired of waiting for the case to be resolved, and lynched him. President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the Department of Justice to investigate Harrison's lynching; he felt it was terrible that blacks were getting lynched at home while the U.S. was ostensibly fighting for freedom in Europe. But no one was ever prosecuted for Harrison's death.Tameka Bradley Hobbs, Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home: Racial Violence in Florida, Oxford University Press, 2015 =Florida School for Boys= Florida Industrial School for Boys The Florida School for Boys, a large state reform school, operated in Marianna from January 1, 1900, to June 30, 2011. For a time, it was the largest juvenile reform institution in the United States. Throughout its 111-year history, the school gained a reputation for abuse, beatings, rapes, and torture of students by staff. It was rumored that students had died there as a result of injuries. Despite periodic investigations, changes of leadership, and promises by the state to improve conditions, the allegations of cruelty and abuse continued. Many of the allegations were confirmed by separate investigations by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2010 and the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice in 2011. State authorities closed the school permanently in June 2011. In 2015, a multi-year investigation of the cemetery and grounds by the University of South Florida (USF), which was attempting to find undocumented burials on the grounds, revealed details of a secret \\"rape dungeon\\", where boys younger than 12 were sexually abused. It positively identified five bodies from remains recovered on the grounds. By January 2016, the end of the USF's studies of the grounds and exhumation of remains, it had identified 55 previously unknown burials, made a match for seven bodies through DNA, and presumptively identified another 14 sets of remains of 51 found. 27 more graves were discovered in 2019. The team created a website containing documentation of their investigation and will continue to work with state agencies and families of former students to identify more remains. = Hurricane Michael = The city was one of several Florida Panhandle communities devastated by Category 5 Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018.

Astor lies entirely within the boundaries of the Ocala National Forest. History The Astor area and much of the land along the St. Johns River was inhabited by Timucua natives prior to settlement by Europeans. Early attempts at settlement included an English trading post in 1763, and in 1822 a plantation growing sugar cane and oranges was established by Jewish immigrant Moses Elias Levy. By 1838 the Seminole Wars had begun and the United States government established Fort Butler to defend the river as the primary route of transportation inside Florida. These earliest efforts at settlement all met with failure due to war or disease, and until the 1870s the area was largely deserted.Wass de Czege, A.: The History of Astor on the St. Johns, Astor Park, and the Surrounding Area, Third, Extended Edition, pages 11, 14-18. Danubian Press, 1996 In 1874, William Backhouse Astor Jr. from New York City's wealthy Astor family purchased over of land, upon which he began to establish a town he called \\"Manhattan\\". New settlers arrived by steamboat to the town which Astor had endowed with a church, schoolhouse, botanical garden, and free cemetery. William Astor also built a hotel, saw mill, and eventually a railroad, the St. Johns and Lake Eustis Railway, which headed southwest towards the communities of Eustis and Leesburg. A few miles to the west of town, a satellite community called Astor Park grew up along the shore of Lake Schimmerhorn (named for Astor's wife, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor). Over the next twenty years Astor saw his town grow, but the Manhattan name never caught on. When William Astor died in 1892, the town was officially renamed \\"Astor\\" in his honor. John Jacob Astor IV inherited his father William's estate and continued to promote the town and their business interests in Florida. Following his demise in the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, the estate passed to his son, Vincent. William Vincent Astor was not interested in his grandfather's Florida enterprises, and so the Astor family's interests in the area were sold.

History New Ocklawaha Hotel Golf Grounds The people of Eustis, on the east shore of Lake Eustis, took their time deciding on a name. First it was Highlands, then Pendryville, and finally Lake Eustis, itself named about 1825 for General Abraham Eustis. General Eustis, prominent in the Seminole Wars, had skirmished with the Indians on the south shore, near present-day Tavares, Florida. In 1876, A.S. Pendry homesteaded and set out a citrus grove. In 1877 he opened the Ocklawaha Hotel. The post office in the lobby carried the sign Pendryville\\". Before railroads came in the 1880s, Eustis was a busy port for steamers plying Lakes Harris, Eustis, Dora, and Griffin. In 1883 the \\"Lake\\" was dropped and the town became just Eustis. Although the U.S. opened up the area for homesteading in the 1850s, settlement was delayed by the Civil War. Surveying was finally completed in 1875 and settlement began in earnest. Among the earliest settlers was Guilford David \\"G.D.\\" Clifford, who established a store and began the first mail service for the new settlement. It was in the Clifford General Store second floor meeting hall that the town's first churches were formed. Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups all organized and held services there before they had their own buildings.\\"The First One Hundred Years\\", First Presbyterian Church website, January 8, 2011. The first homes were those of D.W. Herrick, A.D. Herrick, and Henry Key. In 1881 Clifford and Smith built the first general store in the building later occupied by A.D. and C.D. Miller. A big year was 1878 when the town's first telegraph line connected Eustis, Leesburg, and Sanford. The railroad arrived in 1880, the first train coming from Astor to Fort Mason, where passengers and freight made lake steamer connections to Leesburg, Helena, Yalaha, Bloomfield, Lane Park, and Tavares. Bertie Clifford was the first baby born before Eustis was incorporated in 1883, and Edith Hutchins the first baby of the newly incorporated town. D.W. Herrick was the first mayor. G.D. Clifford's dream home in Eustis was designed in 1894 but the Big Freeze of 1894-95 postponed its completion until 1911. Says Eustis historian Louise Carter, \\"Even though the freeze brought the town's economy to a standstill, Mr. Clifford kept his lakefront general store open and extended credit until people could recover.\\" According to an 1887 business directory, the Clifford Store on Lake Eustis sold groceries, hardware, building material, fertilizers, stoves, crockery, glassware, hay, and grain. The opera house, on the second floor, was a cultural center of Eustis and a wide swath of Central Florida. The eighteen- room house at the corner of Bay Street and Bates Avenue today houses the Eustis Historical Museum and Preservation Society, and takes visitors back to the gracious Lake County lifestyle of one hundred-odd years ago. Dr. J. H. Potter, the founding pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, encouraged the development of Eustis Seminary in 1886, under the direction of Professor Byron F. Marsh (for whom Marsh Memorial Park is named). The seminary served students from first through twelfth grades. Its buildings were located near the present site of Eustis High School on Washington Avenue. Struggling financially, the school closed around 1895. By the early 1900s, Eustis was already a winter vacation spot for many. The Ocklawaha Hotel catered to the wealthy. Eustis continues to be a popular winter destination.

History Fruitland Park antedates the American Civil War, although the name of the town only came later, as it was originally called Gardenia. The earliest settler was M. Calvin Lee, of the Evander Lee family of Leesburg, who planted a citrus grove. After the war, a son-in-law of the Lee family, P.S. Bouknight, homesteaded near Mirror Lake. In 1875, the State of Florida sent Captain Kendricks to the northern part of the United States to talk about the advantages of living in Florida. Due to Major Orlando P. Rooks' poor health, and already considering a move, he had his wife, Josephine, moved to Fruitland Park.Fruitland Park hiking tour They built their first home on Crystal Lake in 1877. It was here that the first white child, Frederic, was born in 1882. The Fruitland Nurseries of Augusta, Georgia, was owned by J. P. Berckmann, friend of Major Rook. Major Rook named the town Fruitland Park for the nurseries, and the main street Berckmann Street for this friend. The postal authorities refused to recognize the name Fruitland Park as there was already a Fruitland in the state. At their request, the name was changed to Gardenia in 1884. The Florida Railroad, put through the town just prior to this, had listed the town as Fruitland Park in all their printed matter and refused to recognize the new name of Gardenia. Consequently, all freight and express had to be directed to Fruitland Park and all mail addressed to Gardenia. This caused a great deal of confusion, which lasted from 1884 to 1888, when a petition was sent to the postal authorities to have the name changed back to Fruitland Park. The petition was granted in 1888. On December 20, 1884, Rev. G.W. Butler organized the first \\"community\\" church in Fruitland Park, it was called the Community Church a Methodist Episcopal church founded by the Illinois conference. The church had acquired lots on College Ave., between Fountain St. and Lime St. The church was built in 1886–1887. That building burned in 1934, but was rebuilt in 1935. That building was later sold to the United Pentecostal Church and still remains today. Fruitland Park was granted a Charter by the state on May 25, 1927. Today the city boasts churches, schools, and numerous businesses. It still calls itself \\"Hometown USA.\\" Fruitland Park is also home to the oldest Dirt Kart Track in America. The 1/6 mile clay oval has hosted Saturday Night Dirt Kart Racing for Go Kart enthusiasts since opening in 1956. =Expansion of The Villages= On December 10, 2013, The Villages of Lake-Sumter Inc. closed on a deal to purchase property in Fruitland Park for $8 million from a private owner. Subsequently, they also began the annexation and rezoning process with the city. The property is currently the construction site for 2,038 new Villages homes, a project with final completion projected sometime in 2016. It was determined that the city of Fruitland Park stands to earn approximately $13 million in impact fees and building permits as a result of the expansion, not including ongoing tax revenues upon completion.

Groveland case In 1949 four young African-American men (Samuel Shepherd, Walter Irvin, Charles Greenlee, and Ernest Thomas) were charged with raping a seventeen-year-old white farm girl in Groveland, Florida. They were convicted by an all-white jury. The case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court which found that: > Two witnesses for the State testified as to the identity of the four [men]. > From the description of the automobile as given by the two witnesses the > same was later located. The three defendants testified they were driving the > car in question during the same hours of the early morning except they were > driving in the Orlando area, which was in the opposite direction.Shepherd v. > State, 46 So. 2d 880 (Fla. 1950). In addition to the eyewitness testimony, there was physical evidence linking the car in which the young men were riding to the crime. The Florida Supreme Court stated: > Near the scene of the crime a handkerchief and some cotton were found. The > woman was found near the scene of the crime about dawn. A large track about > the scene fit the shoe of one of the appellants. Cotton or lint about the > car and broken glass in the automobile testified to by the woman assisted > the officers in identifying the car which the appellants admit they were > riding in at the exact hour the State charge the crime was committed. The victim testified that she had known Shepherd for years and that Irvin was someone she had seen in and around the Groveland community before the night of the assault. She reported the rape to the police within five hours after it occurred. One of the three men she accused (Thomas) was shot and killed by the police during his arrest. After the Florida Supreme Court decided to uphold the guilty verdicts, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Attorney Thurgood Marshall, then the special counsel with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, represented the Groveland Boys, on the briefs, taking their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Oral argument was conducted by attorney Franklin H. Williams. The Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdicts. The Court found that sensational headlines in the local papers (\\"Night Riders Burn Lake Negro Homes\\" and \\"Flames From Negro Homes Light Night Sky in Lake County\\"), and newspaper reports of the sheriff's statement that the young men had confessed while in custody, resulted in an unfair trial. \\"These defendants were prejudged as guilty and the trial was but a legal gesture to register a verdict already dictated by the press and the public opinion which it generated.\\" A new trial was ordered.Shepherd v. Florida, 341 U.S. 50, 71 S. Ct. 549 (1951), Per Curiam. In 1949, Harry T. Moore, the executive director of the Florida NAACP, organized a campaign against the conviction of the Groveland Four. Soon afterward, Sheriff Willis V. McCall of Lake County, Florida, shot Shepherd and Irvin. He asserted that they were trying to escape. Shepherd was killed, and Irvin was seriously wounded. When Irvin recovered, he told investigators that the sheriff had shot the two prisoners, without provocation, while they were in handcuffs. Moore demanded that the sheriff be indicted for murder and requested that the Governor suspend McCall from office. On December 25, 1951, a bomb exploded in Moore's house, killing him and his wife, Harriette. Some alleged that Sheriff McCall was associated with ordering this bombing; however, an extensive FBI investigation at the time and additional separate investigations have failed to produce any evidence supporting allegations of McCall's involvement. Although members of the Ku Klux Klan were suspected of the crime, the people responsible were never brought to trial.PBS - Freedom Never Dies: The Story of Harry T.

The population was 20,117 at the 2010 census. As of 2019, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 23,671. Leesburg is in central Florida, between Lake Harris and Lake Griffin, at the head of the Oklawaha River system. It is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. Leesburg is the home of Lake–Sumter State College (LSSC), which also has campuses in Clermont and Sumterville, Florida. It is also the home of Beacon College. History Historic Mote-Morris House Leesburg was first settled in 1857 by Evander McIver Lee. Several of his brothers followed him to the area. One of them, Calvin Lee, was credited with giving the town its name. The city was incorporated in 1875, and was designated as the county seat of Sumter County for a time. When Lake County was formed in 1887, Tavares was designated as its seat. In the early 20th century, Leesburg was an important center for watermelon production. In 1930, it held its first Watermelon Festival, an annual tradition that lasted for nearly 30 years. But gradually watermelon production dwindled and, for the last festival in 1957, watermelons had to be brought to the city from outside the area. In 1938, during the Great Depression, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration invested in infrastructure and improvement projects across the county. Its Works Progress Administration began work on the Venetian Gardens waterside park, located on the shores of Lake Harris. These canals and gardens have been a centerpiece of the community ever since. Lake Square Mall, the city's major shopping mall, opened in 1980. On March 19, 1982, Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist Randy Rhoads, as well as the band's cook and bus driver, were killed in a plane crash at Flying Baron Estates. The citrus industry was the principal business in this area for decades, but devastating freezes in December 1983 and February 1985 persuaded growers to move their groves further south. In 1997, Leesburg Bikefest started. It has since become an annual spring tradition, with upwards of 250,000 people attending every year. Today, most of Leesburg's growth and economic development is the result of its increasing popularity as a retirement destination. In addition, the rapid growth of nearby Orlando has resulted in demand for housing here, as many people commute to Orlando for work. In 2011 and 2017, the Leesburg High School boys' basketball team won the 4A state championship. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (23.65%) is water. Several major highways pass through Leesburg, including U.S. Highway 27, U.S. Highway 441 and S.R. 44. Florida's Turnpike passes just to the south and west of Leesburg. Leesburg was on the western leg of the Dixie Highway. Airport Leesburg International Airport is a small hub airport at the intersection of CR 44 and US 441, in front of Lake-Sumter State College.

It presents a diverse schedule of programs and services for all ages from toddlers to senior citizens. The library checks out more than 20,000 items each month to patrons. The library has developed a great deal since its beginnings around 1875 as the private book collection of Mrs. A.B. Efird, stored in her husband’s store on the north side of Main Street in Leesburg, approximately where the Tropic Theater is now. In 1892, R. F. E. Cooke provided space for the library and Sara Julian became Leesburg's first librarian. By 1920 the building had deteriorated. The Leesburg Women’s Club moved and preserved the collection for several years in the club building. Many of the club's members were also active members of the Friends of the Leesburg Public Library. The library finally got a room in the community building at Venetian Gardens in 1953 when the City of Leesburg established a library charter. As the collection grew it moved in 1965 to the old post office and then again in 1983 to the old downtown Sears store building.Tolle, Lois B. (1965).

The town of Mount Dora began in 1874 when the area was settled by David Simpson, his wife, and two children. In 1880, Ross C. Tremain became the town's first postmaster, and later a major real estate developer for the area. A post office called Mount Dora has been in operation since 1883. Tremain named the unincorporated village Royellou, after his children, Roy, Ella, and Louis. The community was renamed for Dora Ann Drawdy, who was an early settler of the town in the mid-1880s. In 1846, the surveyors named Lake Dora after her, and in 1883 the town was renamed after the lake. The Mount in Mount Dora reflects the fact that the town is on a plateau 184 feet above sea level. In addition to this, Dora is memorialized through Dora Drawdy Way, an alleyway located in the downtown area.

He lived in a large house called The Castle overlooking Lake Dora, with a swimming pool on the roof. It was torn down in the 1980s. The book Doesn't She Look Natural by Angela Hunt is also set in Mount Dora. Mount Dora and several of its landmarks are among the main settings of the fantasy book series The Salem Concord by J. A. Areces. = Film = The buildings in downtown Mount Dora were painted pink for the feature film, Honky Tonk Freeway. Being a movie location provided an economic boost for merchants, helped restore the downtown area, and gave Mount Dora a dose of national publicity. An independent Italian-American production crew filmed a horror film titled Witch Story in the downtown area. The film was never released in the United States. Two years following Witch Story, an HBO movie titled Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture was filmed. The movie starred Roy Scheider and Bonnie Bedelia. The tennis film, The Break, took place partly in the city of Mount Dora. It was filmed by an independent production company and aired on cable TV.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Captiva CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 28.15%, are water. Originally part of neighboring Sanibel Island to the southeast, it was severed in 1926 when a hurricane's storm surge created a new channel, Blind Pass. The channel filled in over subsequent years, but was reopened by dredging in the summer of 2009. Like Sanibel, Captiva is a barrier island to Pine Island (to the east of Captiva and north of Sanibel), however it is much narrower. The only automobile access to Captiva is via the Sanibel Causeway and Sanibel-Captiva Road, which ends in the CDP of Captiva, the island's only CDP. Captiva was homesteaded in 1888 and a tiny cemetery next to The Chapel by the Sea has the grave of the original resident, William Herbert Binder (1850–1932), an Austrian. Half the island is in private ownership, with \\"Millionaire's Row\\", luxury homes on the gulf and bay sides of Captiva Drive. The South Seas Island Resort entry gate is at the end of this road. Roosevelt Channel on the east side of the island, is named for Theodore Roosevelt who fished there. North Captiva Island or Upper Captiva is another island, in turn severed from Captiva in a 1921 hurricane, creating Redfish Pass. North Captiva has power from lines that originate on the north end of Captiva, and is privately owned. The island can only be accessed via boat or small plane. Captiva was seriously damaged in August 2004 when the eastern eyewall of Hurricane Charley struck North Captiva, immediately before hitting Charlotte Harbor to the north-northeast. Initial reports indicated that 160 buildings were destroyed and another 160 seriously damaged. Reports indicate that the storm surge cut a path wide across the narrowest part of North Captiva, separating the island. The separation of the two halves of the island began three years earlier during a series of tornadoes caused by Tropical Storm Gabrielle that passed through the area in September 2001.http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/hurricanes/charley/ The new pass filled in within a few years and is now back to its pre-Charley state. Most of the invasive Australian pines on the island blew over in the hurricane, making room for native mangroves and sabal palms.

The Wall Street Journal selected Sanibel and Captiva Islands as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes in 2010.10 Best Places for Second Homes History According to local folklore, Captiva got its name because the pirate captain José Gaspar (Gasparilla) held his female prisoners on the island for ransom. However, the supposed existence of José Gaspar is sourced from an advertising brochure of an early 20th-century developer, and may be a fabrication. Around 3000 B.C., the sands of Captiva started to erode, resulting in the eventual formation of Sanibel Island. The Gulf of Mexico waters were eight feet lower than they are today. It is said that the first inhabitants of Captiva were the Calusa Indians. The population of the Calusa is believed to have reached as many as 50,000 people. \\"Calusa\\" means \\"fierce people\\", and they were described as a war-like people. The Calusa Indians were resistant to colonization and attacked any explorers who came into their territory. Calusa Indians built their houses on stilts without walls. They wove palmetto leaves together to build roves (twisted strands of fibers). The Calusa Indians fished for food on the coast, bays, rivers, and waterways. They did not farm. “The men and boys of the tribe made nets from palm tree webbing to catch mullet, pinfish, pigfish, and catfish. They used spears to catch eels and turtles. They made fish bone arrowheads to hunt for animals such as deer. The women and children learned to catch shellfish like conchs, crabs, clams, lobsters, and oysters.” The Calusa Indians used the shells on the island for utensils, jewelry, tools, weapons, and ornaments. By the late 1700s most of the Calusa Indians had died out. Many were captured and sold as slaves while others died from diseases such as smallpox and measles. An Austrian named Binder (b. 1850) was on a German freighter headed to New Orleans when the ship crashed and he was shipwrecked off Boca Grande. He then washed up to shore on what has been since 1921, Upper Captiva. “He lived for several weeks on what the unoccupied island had to offer, built a makeshift raft, and got himself to Pine Island, where he was helped to return to his home. By 1888, due to his having fought with the U.S. Army, he became naturalized, and was allowed to homestead on Captiva in 1888, when he was 38 years old. For 10 years he was Captiva’s first and only inhabitant. He died in 1932.” Notable residents Captiva was the full-time home of artist Robert Rauschenberg. His home still stands there.Lee, Daniel. \\"The Art of Parallel Purposes\\", nationalreview.com. 7 September 2020. Retrieved 7 September 2020.

Florida Gulf Coast University is located just north of the Estero village limits.Map of Estero Planning District History Estero was established and incorporated by the followers of Cyrus Teed, who proposed a theory that people live on the inside of the Earth's outer skin, and that celestial bodies are all contained inside the hollow Earth. This theory, which he called Koreshan Unity, drew followers to purchase and occupy a tract in 1894. They were business-oriented and lived communally, prospering enough to found their own political party (\\"The Progressive Liberty Party\\") and incorporate the town on September 1, 1904, as Estero. The 1908 death of Teed (who claimed to be immortal) was a critical blow to the group's faith, whose membership dwindled into the 1960s. The foundation remains as \\"The College of Life Foundation\\", which contributed (for example) at least $25,000 to the Gulf Shore Playhouse in or around 2007. The Koreshans' original tract is now owned by Florida as the Koreshan State Historic Site. Estero incorporated as a village in December 2014.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village of Estero has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.05%, are water. Historically and culturally, the heart of Estero is the spring-fed Estero River, which flows to Estero Bay. Some of the earliest settlers of the area (notably the Alvarez, Fernandez, Johnson, and Soto families) were fishing families that lived on Mound Key, a mangrove-ringed island that dominates Estero Bay. During the early 20th century, these families moved upriver to the settlement which came to be known as Estero. Estero is also the location of a utopian community called the Koreshan Unity, which is now preserved as the Koreshan State Historic Site. Until the 1970s, most settlement and development in Estero was near the river.

History  = Early history = The Calusa Indians first inhabited Estero Island, the island that Fort Myers Beach, occupies, 2,000 years ago. The Calusa Indians resisted Spanish colonization attempts successfully including those by Ponce de León in 1513 and 1521. The Calusa met their demise 150 years later due to disease, hostilities, and political and economic upheaval. In the mid to late 1700s, Cuban fishermen then began to settle a small fishing village known as a Ranchero. This effectively displaced the remaining Calusa. In 1845, Florida became the 27th state. = American settlement = The Homestead Act of 1862 initiated American settlements on Estero Island. In 1862, Robert Gilbert received a homestead grant at the end of Connecticut Street, the highest point on Fort Myers Beach. In 1911, William Case developed the first subdivision and cottage rental industry. By 1914, all the property on the island was homesteaded with little industry beyond a hotel, fishing, gardening, and a sawmill operated by the Koreshan Unity (a communal society based on mainland Estero). At this point, Estero Island was named Crescent Beach. Development on Crescent Beach was slow until the 1920s when Florida gained national attention as a vacation destination. In 1921, a toll bridge was opened connecting the beach to the mainland, followed closely by the construction of two casinos, hotels, a pier and the island's first canal. The land boom ended with the hurricanes of 1921 and 1926 that challenged the paradise appeal of southwest Florida. Despite entering a depression, Crescent Beach continued to gain small businesses, restaurants, subdivisions, and a school. In the 1950s, Crescent Beach continued to modernize. Many hotels were built including the Rancho del Mar, which boasted the first swimming pool. Additionally, the swing bridge was electrified to facilitate traffic. During this time, \\"pink gold\\" or pink shrimp were discovered igniting the shrimping industry and ancillary businesses to support it as the population increased by 50 percent. During this second land boom, numerous civic organizations, churches, local newspapers, weather and US Coast Guard stations, and the Beach Library were added to the island. = Incorporation = Fort Myers Beach has continued to develop to the present day. The island has a mix of year-round and seasonal residents, as well as a vibrant tourism industry. On December 31, 1995, legislation was passed to incorporate the town of Fort Myers Beach.

The population was 1,750 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Punta Rassa is located in southwestern Lee County at (26.5104, -81.9988), at the west end of a peninsula bordered to the north by the Caloosahatchee River, to the west by San Carlos Bay, and to the south by the Gulf of Mexico. The community sits at the east end of the Sanibel Causeway, which crosses San Carlos Bay to Sanibel Island. McGregor Boulevard (County Road 867) forms the southern edge of the community; the highway leads northeast to Fort Myers, the Lee county seat. Punta Rassa is bordered to the east by the unincorporated community of Iona. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Punta Rassa CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 46.55%, are water. History The location was named Punta Rasca (Spanish for \\"smooth or flat point\\" and later corrupted to \\"Punta Rassa\\") by the Spanish Conquistadors in the mid-16th century, who unloaded cattle in the area. By the middle of the 18th century fishermen from Cuba had established permanent fishing stations, called ranchos, along the southwest Florida coast from Tampa Bay to San Carlos Bay. The Spanish Cubans would stay in Florida from September until March drying and salting fish caught along the coast to supply Havana. Indians living in the area, possibly Calusa at first, and later Seminole, worked seasonally at the ranchos, staying on in the area during the off-season. Dr. Benjamin Strobel visited a rancho at Punta Rassa in 1833, where he found ten or so wood-framed houses. \\"Ponte Rasa\\" was named as a \\"rancho\\" in an 1835 letter from William Buner (presumably William Bunce) to Wiley Thompson. =Seminole Wars= Between 1835 and 1842, and again between 1855 and 1858, Punta Rassa was in the theater of war during the Seminole Wars. As a result, Fort Dulany (also spelled \\"Dulaney\\", \\"Delany\\" and \\"Delaney\\") was built there in 1837 as an army supply depot, with a hospital. The fort was abandoned the next year, and then re-occupied in 1841, when it was used to hold Seminole prisoners before they were sent west to the Indian Territory. A hurricane destroyed Fort Dulany in October 1841. Army operations were moved up the Caloosahatchee River to a site named Fort Harvie. Fort Harvie was abandoned in 1842. After a white trader was killed by Seminoles on the Peace River in 1849, the Army returned to the Caloosahatchee River in 1850. The new Fort Myers was built on the burned ruins of Fort Harvie. Fort Dulany was reopened during the Third Seminole War, in 1856, and then closed again in 1858. =Civil War= Southwest Florida was relatively quiet in the early part of the Civil War. Union troops and refugee Union sympathizers occupied Useppa Island in December 1863, and mounted a small raid into Charlotte Harbor and up the Myakka River, which resulted in some skirmishes with Confederate troops and irregulars. In January 1864 Union troops landed at Punta Rassa and marched overland to Fort Myers, which they were able to seize before Confederate sympathizers could burn it. The troops on Useppa Island then moved to Fort Myers. As the year progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to built a barracks and a wharf there. The barracks was , set on pilings to place the building above storm surges. At the end of the Civil War, the U.S. military withdrew from the area. =Telegraph= In 1866, the newly formed International Ocean Telegraph Company (IOTC) received from the U.S. government, the state of Florida and the government of Spain the exclusive right to operate an underseas telegraph cable between Florida and Cuba. In 1867 the IOTC constructed a telegraph line from Lake City, where it connected with the national telegraph network via Western Union, to Punta Rassa, where the underwater cable would come ashore. The underwater cable was laid from Havana to Key West, and then on to Punta Rassa, and the line opened to public use on September 11, 1867. The U.S. Congress had, in 1866, authorized telegraph companies to run their lines across, take supplies from, and place stations on federal public domain lands without charge. The IOTC placed its office in one room of the now abandoned barracks at Fort Dulaney, while the station agent lived in another room. =Cattle port= Pre-1906 photo of the \\"Barracks\\", also known as the Tarpon House, at Punta Rassa, Florida Punta Rassa became a thriving cattle shipping town in the later 1800s. The first cattle drive to Punta Rassa had been in 1833, when P. B. Prior purchased ten cattle and some calves from Seminoles living near the Peace River in what is now Hardee County, and drove them to Punta Rassa, possibly for transport to Sanibel Island. Florida cattlemen began shipping cattle to Cuba after the end of the Third Seminole War. Shipments at first were made from Tampa, and then from Fort Ogden and Punta Gorda on the Peace River. Cattle shipments to Cuba were curtailed, but not completely stopped, by the Union blockade of Florida during the Civil War. After the war ended, shipments of cattle from the Peace River ports resumed to Cuba, to Savannah, Georgia, and to Charleston, South Carolina. Some of the cattle shipments to Cuba were made out of Punta Rassa starting in 1869, and by 1872 18,000 out of a little more than 21,000 cattle shipped from Florida to Cuba went through Punta Rassa. Most cattle drives in Florida were relatively small and short. Three or four hundred steers would be driven by three to five cowboys for or so from the open range of central Florida to Punta Rassa. A few cattle drives were larger, up to 1,500 cattle moved by ten or so cowboys. The longest drives were , from Fernandina, by the Georgia border, to Punta Rassa. Water was a problem; too much during the wet season, not enough in the dry season. In the dry season, the cowboys might have to rope alligators to pull them out of water holes so that the cattle could safely drink. The International Ocean Telegraph Company controlled the wharf that had been part of Fort Dulaney, and for many years charged 15 cents a head for cattle loaded on ships from the wharf. Francis A. Hendry later built pens and a wharf at Punta Rassa, and charged 10 cents a head for cattle shipped from his wharf. Another cattleman, Jake Summerlin, who had owned holding pens at Punta Rassa since 1868, built a hotel (the Summerlin House) in 1874. When the hotel was full, cowboys would camp out under the building. Summerlin bought Hendry's pens and wharf for $10,000 in 1878. Cattle would be loaded at the port onto ships destined for Cuba. It was one of the home bases for the \\"King of the Cracker Cowboys\\" Jake Summerlin, who by the time he was 40 was one of the wealthiest of the Florida cattle barons. The town of Punta Rassa was lined with wooden buildings, including a hotel and several bars, which were frequented by the many merchants and cattle sellers. =Sport fishing and tourism= In the 1880s, the area became known as a great sport fishing area and was frequented by the wealthy, who came in search of the prized tarpon sport fish. Soon, however, visitors relocated to Boca Grande, north of Punta Rassa by land after the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway was completed to that destination. Although the distance seems great, these areas are only separated by approximately of water. A railroad line was built towards Punta Rassa in the early 1920s by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad as part of an effort by Seaboard president S. Davies Warfield to reestablish a deepwater port at Punta Rassa. The line branched off the Seaboard's main line, which ran along the west bank of the Ten Mile Canal, in South Fort Myers near where Six Mile Cypress Parkway crosses the canal. It ran through where Lakes Park currently sits, and then roughly paralleled what is now Summerlin Road, terminating just east of Punta Rassa at Truckland. Due to their financial state, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad discontinued all operations in the Fort Myers area in 1952. Despite never fully reaching Punta Rassa, the abandoned line is still referred to as Seaboard's Punta Rassa Branch. An FPL transmission line currently sits on a portion of the Punta Rassa Branch's former right of way just south of Summerlin Road. The area figured prominently in the 1984 historical novel A Land Remembered, by Patrick D. Smith.

The population was 6,469 at the 2010 census, with an estimated 2018 population of 7,402. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The island, also known as Sanibel Island, constitutes the entire city. It is a barrier island – a collection of sand on the leeward side of the more solid coral-rock of Pine Island. Most of the city proper is at the east end of the island. After the Sanibel causeway was built to replace the ferry in May 1963, the city was incorporated in 1974 and the residents asserted control over development by establishing the Sanibel Comprehensive Land Use Plan, helping to maintain a balance between development and preservation of the island's ecology. Due to easy causeway access, Sanibel is a popular tourist destination known for its shell beaches and wildlife refuges. More than half of the island is made up of wildlife refuges, the largest being J. N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. The Island hosts the Sanibel Historical Village and a variety of other museums including the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum and theaters, as well as many non-profit organizations such as the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, the Clinic for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife, and the Sanibel Sea School. History View of the Lighthouse at the southern tip of Sanibel Island Sanibel and Captiva formed as one island about 6,000 years ago. The first known humans in the area were the Calusa, who arrived about 2,500 years ago. The Calusa were a powerful Indian nation who came to dominate most of Southwest Florida through trade via their elaborate system of canals and waterways. Sanibel remained an important Calusa settlement until the collapse of their empire, soon after the arrival of the Europeans. In 1765, the first known appearance of a harbor on Sanibel is shown on a map as Puerto de S. Nibel (the \\"v\\" and \\"b\\" being interchangeable); thus, the name may have evolved from \\"San Nibel\\". Alternatively, the name may derive, as many believe, from \\"(Santa) Ybel\\", which survives in the old placename \\"Point Ybel\\", where the Sanibel Island Light is located. How it would have gotten this name, however, is a matter of conjecture. One story says it was named by Juan Ponce de León for Queen Isabella I of Castile; the island may indeed be named for this queen or the saint whose name she shares, either by Ponce de León or someone later. Another attributes the name to Roderigo Lopez, the first mate of José Gaspar (Gasparilla), after his beautiful lover Sanibel whom he had left behind in Spain. Like most of the lore surrounding Gasparilla, however, this story is apocryphal, as the above references to recognizable variants of the name predate the buccaneer's supposed reign. Sanibel is not the only island in the area to figure prominently in the legends of Gaspar; Captiva, Useppa, and Gasparilla are also connected. Sanibel also appears in another tale, this one involving Gaspar's ally-turned-rival Black Caesar, said to have been a former Haitian slave who escaped during the Haitian Revolution to become a pirate. According to folklore, Black Caesar came to the Gulf of Mexico during the War of 1812 to avoid interference from the British. In the Gulf he befriended Gasparilla, who allowed him to establish himself on Sanibel Island. Eventually the old Spaniard discovered Caesar had been stealing from him and chased him off, but not before his loot had been buried. Legendary pirates' dens aside, the first modern settlement on Sanibel (then spelled \\"Sanybel\\") was established by the Florida Peninsular Land Company in 1832. The colony never took off, and was abandoned by 1849. It was this first group that initially petitioned for a lighthouse on the island. The island was re-populated after the implementation of the Homestead Act in 1862, and again a lighthouse was petitioned. Construction on the Sanibel Island Lighthouse was completed in 1884, but the community remained small. In May 1963 a causeway linking Sanibel and Captiva to the mainland was opened, resulting in an explosion of growth. The City of Sanibel passed new restrictions on development after it was incorporated; these were challenged by developers, to no avail. Currently the only buildings on the island taller than two stories date before 1974, and there are no fast food or chain restaurants allowed on the island except a Dairy Queen and a Subway, which were on the island before the laws were enacted. A new causeway was completed in 2007; it replaced the worn out 1963 spans, which were not designed to carry heavy loads or large numbers of vehicles. The new bridge features a \\"flyover\\" span tall enough for sailboats to pass under, replacing the old bridge's bascule drawbridge span. The original bridge was demolished and its remains were sunk into the water to create artificial reefs in the Gulf of Mexico.  Development  The main town is located on the eastern end of the island. The city was formed in 1974, as a direct result of the main causeway being built in 1963 to replace the ferry, and the rampant construction and development that occurred afterward. Developers sued over the new restrictions, but the city and citizens prevailed in their quest to protect the island. The only buildings above two to three stories now on the barrier island were built during that period. A short bridge over Blind Pass links Sanibel to Captiva Island. More than half of the two islands are preserved in its natural state as wildlife refuges. Visitors can drive, walk, bike, or kayak through the J. N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge The island's most famous landmark, the Sanibel Lighthouse, is located at the eastern end of the island, adjacent to the fishing pier. The main thoroughfare, Periwinkle Way, is where the majority of stores and restaurants are located, while the Gulf Drives (East, Middle and West) play host to most of the accommodations. The Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, has also been a key player in helping to curb uncontrolled commercial growth and development on the island. Since 1967, SCCF has been dedicated to the preservation of natural resources on and around Sanibel and Captiva and has led efforts to acquire and preserve environmentally sensitive land on the islands including critical wildlife habitats, rare and unique subtropical plant communities, tidal wetlands, and freshwater wetlands along the Sanibel River.\\"Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation\\" The Wall Street Journal selected Sanibel and Captiva Islands as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes in 2010.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704869304575109461496208030?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read Geography Beach near the western end of Sanibel Sanibel is located at (26.439608, -82.080456).

Ecology Marsh rabbits are common in Sanibel The island's curved shrimp-like shape forms Tarpon Bay on the north side of the island. It is linked to the mainland by the Sanibel Causeway, which runs across two small manmade islets and the Intracoastal Waterway. A short bridge links Sanibel Island to Captiva Island over Blind Pass. The Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum on Sanibel is the only museum in the world dedicated entirely to the study of shells. The Gulf-side beaches are excellent on both Sanibel and Captiva, and are world-renowned for their variety of seashells, which include coquinas, scallops, whelks, sand dollars, and many other species of both shallow-water and deeper-water mollusks, primarily bivalves and gastropods. Sanibel Island is home to a significant variety of birds, including the roseate spoonbill and several nesting pairs of bald eagles. Birds can be seen on the beaches, the causeway islands, and the reserves, including J. N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Common sights include pelicans, herons, egrets, and anhingas, as well as the more common birds like terns, sandpipers, and seagulls. Loggerhead turtle track on a beach in Sanibel There is a population of American alligators on Sanibel Island. A lone rare American crocodile had been seen at the Wildlife Refuge for over 30 years, but she died in 2010 of unseasonably cold winters or old age. A memorial was set up at J.N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge honoring \\"Wilma\\", as she was known by the residents. A new crocodile was introduced in May 2010 when she was found on a private property and relocated to J.N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Plants on the island include the native sea grape, sea oats, mangroves, and several types of palm trees. The Australian pine is an introduced species that has spread throughout the island, to some extent overpowering native vegetation and trees. Once mature, the pine blocks sunlight and drops a thick bed of pine needles that affect the soil's pH and prevents new native growth. The ground is very soft under these pines. The local form of the marsh rice rat has been recognized in some classifications as a separate subspecies, Oryzomys palustris sanibeli.Wolfe, J.L. 1982. Oryzomys palustris. Mammalian Species 176:1-5. =Wildlife refuges= Bobcats are sometimes seen in Sanibel Preserving the island's natural ecology has always been important to its citizens and visitors alike. A driving force in the preservation of the island is the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation which was founded in 1967 with a mission to \\"preserve natural resources and wildlife habitat on and around the islands of Sanibel and Captiva.\\" of land on Sanibel are under the supervision of the Foundation; included in this land there is a \\"Marine Laboratory which actively conducts research in areas including seagrasses, mangroves, harmful algal blooms, fish populations and shellfish restoration.\\" Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation also has a project called RECON (River, Estuary and Coastal Observing Network) which includes a \\"network of eight in-water sensors that provide real-time, hourly readings of key water quality parameters.\\" The foundation also serves to protect the wildlife on the island and has a variety of education programs designed to instruct people about the island's unique ecology. The biggest wildlife refuge on the island is the J.N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, Covering more than of land, the refuge strives to ensure that these lands are \\"preserved, restored and maintained as a haven for indigenous and migratory wildlife as part of a nation-wide network of Refuges administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\\" The lands also serve to provide a home for many endangered and threatened species. Currently the refuge provides a home for over 220 species of birds native to the island. Visitors to the refuge can walk, bike, drive, or kayak though the wildlife drive which takes you through of mangrove tree forests and tidal flats, this drive is perfect for watching the island's wildlife and looking at the island's native vegetation. To show that preserving the wildlife really is important, the drive is closed one day every week, Friday, so that the wildlife can have a day to themselves where they can scavenge for food closer to the drive and not have to be bothered by or fearful of humans. There is also an education center which features \\"interactive exhibits on refuge ecosystems, the life and work of \\"Ding\\" Darling, migratory flyways, and the National Wildlife Refuge System.\\" Beaches and seashells A view looking north on the beach at West Gulf Drive Beach access point #7, Sanibel, Lee County, Florida. The whitish objects are all shells, and so are some of the brown objects. Sanibel beaches attract visitors from all around the world, partly because of the large quantities of seashells that frequently wash up there. Many sand dollars can be found as well. One of the reasons for these large accumulations of shells is the fact that Sanibel is a barrier island which is \\"part of a large plateau that extends out into the Gulf of Mexico for miles. It is this plateau that acts like a shelf for seashells to gather.\\" Sanibel also has an \\"east-west orientation when most islands are north-south. Hence, the island is gifted with great sandy beaches and an abundance of shells.\\" People who are lucky enough to find the elegant brown-spotted shell of a Junonia on a Sanibel beach often get their picture in the local newspapers. Junonia volutes are reasonably common living in deep water, but they only rarely wash up; a beach find of a whole shell is greatly prized. Junonia shells can be purchased at local shell shops, or can be seen on display in the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum, in some of the glass display tables at the Sanibel Cafe, or at the Sanibel Shell Fair in early March. Throughout the year, many people come to the beaches of Sanibel to gather shells. People are often seen bending down as they look for seashells, and this posture is known as the \\"Sanibel Stoop.\\" There are beaches almost all around the island. There are even beaches along the Sanibel causeway, and these are great for fishing and windsurfing. However, beach parking on Sanibel itself is very limited, and in high season finding a convenient parking space can be a challenge. Lighthouse Beach is named after the famous Sanibel Lighthouse, which includes a popular fishing pier and nature trails. The most secluded beach on the island is Bowman's Beach; there are no hotels in sight and the beach has a \\"pristine and quiet\\" atmosphere. Barron's selected Sanibel and Captiva Islands as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes in 2010. Climate Sanibel Island, located in southern Florida, has a climate that is \\"tropical and humid\\" with daily high temperatures ranging from in midwinter to around in the summer. The months of January through April (peak tourist season on the island) have the coolest temperatures, ranging from during the day to a cool at night, and there is very little rainfall on the island during those months. The summer heat and humidity on the island, which has been recorded as high as , is cooled by the ocean seabreezes from the Gulf of Mexico, and by almost daily afternoon and evening rain showers, which are responsible for much of the island's rainfall. June is when the Island gets most of its rain. The area is prone to being hit by tropical cyclones and hurricanes; the hurricane season starts in June, but most of the activity occurs in September and October. However, local communities have \\"adapted to cope with these occasional storm threats.\\" =Hurricanes= Southwest Florida rarely suffers direct strikes by hurricanes, but every 20 or so years it takes a significant hit, and about every 40 years a major one. Most of these have affected Sanibel. On August 13, 2004, Sanibel Island was hit hard by Hurricane Charley, a category four hurricane with winds. It was the strongest to hit Southwest Florida since Hurricane Donna in September 1960. While much of the native vegetation survived, the non-indigenous Australian Pines suffered serious damage, blocking nearly every road. Wildlife officials also reported that the nests of birds and sea turtles were destroyed. The Sanibel Lighthouse survived with little damage, the Sanibel Causeway suffered relatively minor damage except for a toll booth being tilted partly over, and a small seawall was eroded. Blind Pass was again cut through, but refilled less than one month later. Residents who left before the August 13 storm were not allowed back by the city government until August 18, due to hundreds of downed trees and electric power lines, and the lack of potable water and sanitary sewerage. A temporary city hall for Sanibel was set up on the mainland in a Fort Myers hotel, until utilities and transport could be restored to the island. Infrastructure A view looking toward the mainland from the bay side of Sanibel shows the causeway in the distance. =Transportation= A new three-section causeway bridge to Sanibel was completed during the summer of 2007, with a high-span section replacing the original drawbridge. Library Sanibel Public Library was built in 1994, and was expanded in 2004. The library houses more than 60,000 titles. Notable people The city's best-known resident is former CIA Director Porter Goss, who spearheaded the island's incorporation, became its first mayor, and represented the area in Congress from 1989 until his appointment as CIA Director in 2004. Other notable people who reside or used to reside on Sanibel include: *R. Tucker Abbott, leading 20th century malacologist/conchologist *Horace William Baden Donegan, Bishop of New York, Episcopal Church in the United States of America *Clifton Fadiman, author and radio/TV personality *Helaine Fendelman, appraiser *Jean Shepherd, author, screenwriter and radio raconteur *Willard Scott, TV personality *Randy Wayne White, writer of crime fiction and non-fiction adventure tales In literature Sanibel Island is the main setting for crime novels written by local author Randy Wayne White.

White's main fictional character is named Doc Ford and due to his popularity, White opened a restaurant in his character's name, Doc Ford's Sanibel Rum Bar & Grill. In film Parts of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead were shot on Sanibel Island. Romero had a second home on Sanibel, from which he rewrote Day of the Dead in 1984.Pittsburgh Film History: On Set in the Steel City by John Tiech, The History Press, 2012, pp. 45-48 Night Moves was filmed on the Island in 1975, directed by Arthur Penn.

The population was 702 at the 2010 census. The Cedar Keys are a cluster of islands near the mainland. Most of the developed area of the city has been on Way Key since the end of the 19th century. The Cedar Keys are named for the eastern red cedar Juniperus virginiana, once abundant in the area. History =Early= While evidence suggests human occupation as far back as 500 BC, the first maps of the area date to 1542, when it was labeled \\"Las Islas Sabines\\" by a Spanish cartographer. An archaeological dig at Shell Mound, north of Cedar Key, found artifacts dating back to 500 BC in the top of the mound. The only ancient burial found in Cedar Key was a 2,000-year-old skeleton found in 1999. Arrow heads and spear points dating from the Paleo period (12,000 years old) were collected by Cedar Key historian St. Clair Whitman and are displayed at the Cedar Key Museum State Park. Followers of William Augustus Bowles, self- declared \\"Director General of the State of Muskogee\\", built a watchtower in the vicinity of Cedar Key in 1801. The tower was destroyed by a Spanish force in 1802. In the period leading up to the First Seminole War, the British subjects Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister used the Cedar Keys to deliver supplies to the Seminoles. The Cedar Keys may have been a refuge for escaped slaves in the early 1820s, and an entry point for the illegal slave trade later that decade. =Indian War= During the Second Seminole War, the United States Army established Fort No. 4 on the mainland adjacent to the Cedar Keys. (The name \\"No. 4\\" was later applied to a boat channel next to the fort, and then to a railroad trestle and a highway bridge over that channel.) In 1840, General Zachary Taylor requested the Cedar Keys be reserved for military use for the duration of the war, and that Seahorse Key be permanently reserved for a lighthouse. In 1840, General Walker Keith Armistead, who had succeeded Zachary Taylor as commander of United States troops in the war, ordered construction of a hospital on what had become known as Depot Key. (The island's name may reflect the establishment of a depot there by Florida militia general Leigh Read. The primary depot for the U.S. Army in Florida at the time was at Palatka, Florida.) Depot Key was the headquarters for the Army in Florida, but Fishburne states headquarters was not in a fixed place, but wherever the commander was. Cantonment Morgan was established on nearby Seahorse Key by 1841 and used as a troop deployment station and as a holding station for Seminoles who had been captured or who had surrendered until they could be sent to the West. A hurricane with a storm surge struck the Cedar Keys on October 4, 1842, destroying Cantonment Morgan and causing much damage on Depot Key. Some Seminole leaders had been meeting with Army officers at Depot Key to negotiate their surrender or a retreat to a reservation in the Everglades. After the hurricane, the Seminoles refused to return to the area. Colonel William J. Worth had declared the war to be over in August 1842, and Depot Key was abandoned by the Army after the hurricane. =Pre-Civil War= In 1842, the United States Congress had enacted the Armed Occupation Act, a precursor of the Homestead Act, to increase white settlement in Florida as a way to force the Seminoles to leave the territory. With the abandonment of the Army base on Depot Key, the Cedar Keys became available for settlement under the act. Under the terms of the act, several people received permits for settlement on Depot Key, Way Key, and Scale Key. Augustus Steele, US Customs House Officer for Hillsborough County, Florida, and postmaster for Tampa Bay, received the permit for Depot Key, which he renamed Atsena Otie Key. In 1843, he bought the buildings on the island, and built some cottages for wealthy guests. In 1844, he became the Collector of Customs for the port of Cedar Key, as well as for Tampa, Florida. A post office named \\"Cedar Key\\" was established on Atsena Otie Key in 1845. The Florida legislature chartered the \\"City of Atseena Otie\\" in 1859. Cedar Key became an important port, shipping lumber and naval stores harvested on the mainland. By 1860, two mills on Atsena Otie Key were producing \\"cedar\\" slats for shipment to northern pencil factories. As a result of the growth, the US Congress appropriated funds for a lighthouse on Seahorse Key in 1850. The Cedar Key Light was completed in 1854. The lighthouse lantern is above the ground, but the lighthouse sits on a hill, putting the light above sea level. The light was visible for . Wood-frame residences were added to each side of the lighthouse several years later. In 1860, Cedar Key became the western terminus of the Florida Railroad, connecting it to Fernandina Beach, Florida on the east coast of Florida. David Levy Yulee, U.S. senator and president of the Florida Railroad, had acquired most of Way Key to house the railroad's terminal facilities. A town was platted on Way Key in 1859, and Parsons and Hale's General Store, which is now the Island Hotel, was built there in the same year. On March 1, 1861, the first train arrived in Cedar Key, just weeks before the Civil War began. =Civil War and the Gilded Age= With the advent of the American Civil War in 1861, Confederate agents extinguished the light at Seahorse Key and removed its supply of sperm oil. The defense of Cedar Key was assigned to the Columbia and New River Rifles, two companies of the 4th Florida Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lt. Colonel M. Whit Smith. On July 3, 1861, four Federal war prize schooners appeared off Cedar Key. The schooners, originally captured by the USS Massachusetts off New Orleans, were under the command of U. S. Navy Lieutenant George L. Selden, nephew of former Treasurer of the United States William Selden, and manned by nineteen sailors. Col. Smith led his two rifle companies along with one six-pounder cannon twenty miles offshore on the steamer Madison and captured the schooners after firing two warning shots. With the recovery, Col. Smith and his men liberated fifteen Confederate sailors, recovered the vessels’ valuable cargo of railroad iron and turpentine and effected the first capture of a U. S. Naval officer at sea during the war. The USS Hatteras raided Cedar Key in January 1862, burning several ships loaded with cotton and turpentine and destroying the railroad's rolling stock and buildings on Way Key. Most of the Confederate troops guarding Cedar Key had been sent to Fernandina in anticipation of a Federal attack there. Cedar Key was an important source of salt for the Confederacy during the early part of the war. In October 1862 a Union raid destroyed sixty kettles on Salt Key capable of producing 150 bushels of salt a day. The Union occupied the Cedar Keys in early 1864, staying for the remainder of the war. In 1865, the Eberhard Faber mill was built on Atsena Otie Key. The Eagle Pencil Company mill was built on Way Key, and Way Key, with its railroad terminal, surpassed Atsena Otie Key in population. Repairs to the Florida Railroad were completed in 1868, and freight and passenger traffic again flowed into Cedar Key. The Town of Cedar Keys was incorporated in 1869, and had a population of 400 in 1870. Early in his career as a naturalist, John Muir walked from Louisville, Kentucky to Cedar Key in just two months in 1867. Muir contracted malaria while working in a sawmill in Cedar Key, and recovered in the house of the mill's superintendent. Muir recovered enough to sail from Cedar Key to Cuba in January 1868. He recorded his impressions of Cedar Key in his memoir, A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf, which was published in 1916, after his death. = Decline and restoration of wildlife = When Henry Plant's railroad to Tampa began service in 1886, Tampa took shipping away from Cedar Key, causing an economic decline in the area. Earlier, growth in population had led to the Cedar Key town limits being expanded in 1881 and again in 1884. But with the decline in the local economy, the town limits were contracted in 1890. Also in 1890 the island town was affected by the reign of terror of Cedar Keys mayor William Cottrell, who took advantage of his Florida state legislature connections and the restricted one-way road access to impose his will and conduct acts of violence. He was deposed from power only after the island was invaded by a naval (U.S. Coast Guard) boat manned with a squad of U.S. Marshals, who were sent there after Custom House officers and other federal government workers requested federal aid due to being unable to discharge their duties on the islands. The 1896 Cedar Keys hurricane was the final blow. Around 4 am on September 29, 1896, a storm surge swept over the town, killing more than 100 people. Winds north of town were estimated at , which would classify it as a category 3. The hurricane wiped out the juniper trees still standing and destroyed all the mills. A fire on December 2, 1896, further damaged the town. In following years, structures were rebuilt on Way Key, a more protected island inland, but the damage was done. Today, only a few reminders of the original town on Atsena Otie Key remain, including stone water cisterns, and a graveyard whose headstones conspicuously date prior to 1896. Also, many of the eastern red cedar trees that originally attracted the pencil company, and for which the community was named, are gone. Workers gathered outside E. Faber's Cedar Mill in Cedar Key, Florida, circa 1890 At the start of the 20th century, fishing, sponge hooking, and oystering had become the major industries, but around 1909, the oyster beds were exhausted. President Herbert Hoover established the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge in 1929 by naming three of the islands as a breeding ground for colonial birds. The lighthouse was abandoned in 1952, just as the tourism industry began to grow as a result of interest in the historic community, but it remains in use as a marine biology research center by the University of Florida in Gainesville. =Present= The old-fashioned fishing village is now a tourist center with several regionally famous seafood restaurants. The village holds two festivals a year, the Spring Sidewalk Art Festival and the Fall Seafood Festival, that each attract thousands of visitors to the area. In 1950, Hurricane Easy, a category-3 storm with winds, looped around Cedar Key three times before finally making landfall, dumping of rain and destroying two-thirds of the homes. Luckily, the storm came ashore at low tide, so the surge was only . Hurricane Elena followed a similar path in 1985, but did not make landfall. Packing winds, the storm churned for two days in the Gulf, to the west, battering the waterfront. All the businesses and restaurants on Dock Street were either damaged or destroyed, and a section of the seawall collapsed. After a statewide ban on large-scale net fishing went into effect July 1, 1995, a government retraining program helped many local fishermen begin farming clams in the muddy waters. Today, Cedar Key's clam-based aquaculture is a multimillion-dollar industry. A local museum exhibit displays a reproduction of one of the first air conditioning installations. The system, with compressor and fans, was used in Cedar Key to ease the lot of malaria patients. Cedar Key is home to the George T. Lewis Airport (CDK). =National historic status= Cedar Key's importance in Florida's history, which began as far back as 1000 BC with pre-Columbian habitation of the region, was recognized on October 3, 1989, by the federal government. At that time, in and around the town were added to the National Register of Historic Places under the title of the Cedar Keys Historic and Archaeological District. Cedar Key Museum building The Cedar Key Museum State Park depicts the town's 19th century history and displays sea shells and Indian artifacts from the collection of Saint Clair Whitman. Tours of Whitman's restored 1920s house are available during museum hours. As the museum photo indicates, the building was constructed to withstand the hurricane conditions that the town is subjected to periodically. Historic marker commemorating John Muir's visit The naturalist John Muir visited Cedar Key in 1867 on his historic walk from Kentucky to Florida. He wrote: > For nineteen years my vision was bounded by forests, but today, emerging > from a multitude of tropical plants, I beheld the Gulf of Mexico stretching > away unbounded, except by the sky. What dreams and speculative matter for > thought arose as I stood on the strand, gazing out on the burnished, > treeless plain! The John Muir historic marker was placed on the museum grounds in 1983, commemorating his visit. Geography Cedar Key is located at .

Historically located in the county of Berkshire, it moved to Oxfordshire in 1974 as a result of the 1972 Local Government Act. Wallingford is north of Reading, south of Oxford and north west of Henley-on-Thames. The town's population was 11,600 in the 2011 census. The town has played an important role in English history starting with the surrender of Stigand to William the Conqueror in 1066, which led to his taking the throne and the creation of Wallingford Castle. The castle and the town enjoyed royal status and flourished for much of the Middle Ages. The Treaty of Wallingford, which ended a civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, was signed there. The town then entered a period of decline after the arrival of the Black Death and falling out of favour with the Tudor monarchs before being called on once again during the English Civil War. Wallingford held out as the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Berkshire before surrendering after a 16-week siege. Fearing that Wallingford Castle could be used in a future uprising, Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction. Since then Wallingford has become a market town and centre of local commerce. At the centre of the town is a market square with the war memorial and 17th century arcaded town hall to the south, the Corn Exchange theatre to the east and numerous shops around the edges. Off the square there are alleyways and streets with more shops and a number of historic inns. Although it was a small town, Wallingford once had 14 churches; now, there are three ancient churches within the Parish of St Mary-le-More and St Leonard, a modern Roman Catholic church, a Quaker Meeting House dating from 1724 and Baptist, Methodist and community churches. History = Early history = Wallingford developed around an important crossing point of the River Thames. There is evidence of Roman activity in the area who have left traces of occupation, burials, roads, coins and pottery. The place-name 'Wallingford' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 821, where it appears as Wælingford. It appears as Welingaford circa 891, and as Walingeford in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means 'the ford of Wealh's people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.493. The Anglo-Saxons built the first settlement. Wallingford has been fortified since the Anglo-Saxon period when it was an important fortified borough of Wessex with the right to mint royal coinage. It was enclosed with substantial earthworks by King Alfred the Great in the ninth century as part of a network of fortified towns known as burhs, or burghs, to protect Wessex against the Vikings. These defences can still be clearly discerned as a group of four roughly square areas around the centre of the town and are well-preserved. Wallingford became the chief town of Berkshire and the seat of the county's Ealdorman. = Medieval period = During the Norman conquest in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon lord Wigod allowed William the Conqueror's invading armies into Wallingford to rest and to cross the Thames unopposed. It is in Wallingford that Stigand the Archbishopric of Canterbury surrendered and submitted to William thereby all but ending opposition to William's ascent to the throne. From Wallingford, William with Stigand and his armies rode east to Berkhamsted where he received the final surrender from Edgar and the rest of the English leadership before marching on London for his coronation on Christmas Day. At that time, the river at Wallingford was the lowest point at which the river could be forded. The town subsequently stood in high favour with the Normans. The Domesday Book of 1085 lists Wallingford as one of only 18 towns in the kingdom with a population of over 2,000 people. Ruins in the Wallingford Castle Gardens Wallingford Castle was built soon afterward on the orders of William and became a key strategic centre controlling the Thames crossing and surrounding area.  Establishment of Wallingford Priory (1097)  Wallingford Priory, also known as Holy Trinity Priory, is believed to have stood on the site of the Bullcroft recreation ground off the High Street. This Benedictine priory was established on land granted to St Albans Abbey in 1097 by Henry I, and Geoffrey the Chamberlain gave the priory to St Albans Paul, 14th Abbot of St Albans, who sent some of his monks to establish a cell there. Wallingford Priory produced the mathematician Richard of Wallingford and the chronicler John of Wallingford.  The Anarchy (1135–1153)  Wallingford provided refuge for the Empress Matilda's party during the civil war that began after her father Henry I's death. After the fall of Oxford Castle to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, according to some historic accounts in the snow under a moonlit sky.The Borough of Wallingford: Introduction and Castle, A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 (1923), pp. 517–531. Retrieved 26 April 2011. Wallingford Castle was besieged unsuccessfully a number of times with the Treaty of Wallingford ending the conflict there in November 1153.  The Royal Charter (1155)  The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1155 by the new king, Henry II, being the second town in England to receive one.  Seizure of Wallingford by Prince John (1189)  During Prince John's unsuccessful revolt against his brother king Richard I whilst Richard was involved with the Third Crusade, John seized Wallingford Castle in 1189. The rebellion failed, and John was forced to return the castle to the king's administrators.  King John I (1199–1216)  King John reclaimed the castle after his inheriting the crown in 1199. John modernised, fortified and greatly enlarged the Castle and used it extensively during the First Barons' War.  The Black Death (1349)  The castle was a regular royal residence until the Black Death arrived in 1349; at least a third of the townspeople died, and only four churches were left in use. The castle declined subsequently, much stone being removed to renovate Windsor Castle.  Abingdon Bridge (1416)  The road from London to Gloucestershire passed through Wallingford, and the town flourished as a trading centre throughout most of the Middle Ages. The road was diverted, and a bridge was constructed at Abingdon. The opening of Abingdon Bridge and loss of traffic that the road had brought caused the town to enter a steep economic decline.  Catherine of Valois and Owen Tudor (1422)  Catherine of Valois In 1422 Wallingford and its castle was granted to Catherine of Valois, widowed Queen of Henry V. Catherine lived at Wallingford with her son Henry VI, who was tutored there. While she lived at Wallingford, Catherine met Owen Tudor, whom she later married in secret. Catherine and Owen's eldest son Edmund Tudor fathered Henry VII who defeated Richard III at Bosworth Field and founded the Tudor Dynasty. = The Tudor dynasty (1485–1603) = One of the last documented uses of Wallingford as a royal residence was during 1518. Letters between Cardinal Wolsey and his secretary Richard Pace discuss Henry VIII's dissatisfaction with Wallingford and his desire to move on. The priory was dissolved in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey, partly in order to fund the building of the Cardinal College in Oxford. King Henry VIII separated the Honour of Wallingford which included rights of control over the town and its castle from the Duchy of Cornwall in 1540. He combined it with the Honour of Ewelme which included the rights over his existing residence and lands at Ewelme. Ewelme is six miles from Wallingford, so this was done to consolidate of control in the area. In return Henry transferred as compensation several areas of Cornish property into the Duchy of Cornwall for Prince Edward. After taking control of Wallingford in 1540, King Henry VIII did not favour choosing Wallingford Castle as an official residence. Instead, he opted to transfer materials from it to Windsor to enlarge and improve his own castle there. This practice of dismantling Wallingford Castle to improve Windsor Castle was continued in the reigns of Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. = English Civil War and aftermath = Maintenance and repair of Wallingford Castle during the English Civil War was vital to the success of the Royalists' plans owing to the fact that the royal headquarters were in Oxford, which made the defence of Wallingford, which controlled the area to the south, especially strategically important. In August 1643 Colonel Blagge was granted warrants from the King and Prince Rupert to collect taxes from Reading and other local towns in order to proceed with the repairs. In April 1643 the king marched south from Wallingford in order to relieve Reading, which was besieged by the Earl of Essex. The Parliamentary army was 16,000 strong and laid siege to Reading using cannons. Reading was unable to hold out long enough for the King and Prince Rupert to arrive and break the siege and surrendered on 27 April 1643 with \\"the garrison joining the royal army and together they retreated through Wallingford back to Oxford\\". In 1643 a group of Parliamentary commissioners came to Wallingford in search of an audience with the king, Blagge received them with encounter being recorded as \\"worrying\\". \\"He received them, 'not rudely, but with haughtiness enough,' sending a troop of horse to escort them as if they had been prisoners. High words followed; the commissioners feared they might have had their throats cut by the garrison and gladly took their leave of the 'proud governour.\\" King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria 4 October 1643 was the last time the king and queen visited the town together although they did visit Abingdon staying at Barton Lodge on 17 April 1644. It was also the last time that any British king and queen stayed at the castle together owing to its destruction at the end of the war. By May 1644 the war had turned decidedly against the Royalists in Berkshire, and a failure of communications among the commanders left Abingdon open to occupation by the Parliamentarians. General Waller took the town, and the garrison retreated to Wallingford. After the Second Battle of Newbury on 27 October 1644 where neither side had gained a true victory, King Charles retreated through Wallingford on his way to Oxford. Although his retreat went initially unchallenged, the next day at a meeting of the War Council, it was resolved that Cromwell, Balfour and Sir Arthur Hesilrige were allowed to take cavalry to pursue the King. They were too late, and by the time they reached Wallingford, they found the Royalists had already advanced to Oxford with the castle blocking their path. It was this annoyance of missing an opportunity to capture the king that led to Cromwell forming his New Model Army.  Siege of Wallingford  Colonel Thomas Blagge The first assault on the town was led by Colonel Baxter, the governor of Reading in 1645. However, finding that the fortifications exceeded his expectations, he retreated quickly to Reading. By the end of 1645, the situation had worsened with the king's defeat at the Battle of Naseby by General Fairfax. By this point Wallingford, Faringdon and Donnington were the only strongholds still loyal to the king in the county of Berkshire. The king held up at Oxford for the winter with the intention of riding south to relieve and retake positions in Berkshire; however, the failure of reinforcements to arrive from the west and the imminent threat of siege by General Fairfax forced him to flee north. The siege of Wallingford began on 4 May 1646 by General Fairfax, the Parliamentarians laid siege to Oxford on 11 May. Oxford held out until 24 June when the garrison of 3,000 men including the king's nephews, Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice, were marched out of the city with full honours. General Thomas Fairfax Now only Wallingford remained, its garrison faithfully holding the town and castle for the king under the leadership of Colonel Blagge. However, his position was now impossible to hold, with the town being blockaded on all sides. It was only a matter of time, but still Blagge held that he would not surrender without the king's order and even threatened to set fire to the town during a full assault. A Parliamentary special council met and decided that the difficulty of any full assault would cause unacceptable losses. Waiting and trying to starve Blagge out would give the king time to build his forces, and they were also very concerned that they were risking making a martyr of the town to the Royalist cause in Berkshire if the townspeople suffered too much in either a prolonged siege or assault. The council resolved to draw up preferential terms for Wallingford's surrender. Initially, Blagge refused even these with the same answer that he would need the king's consent to surrender the town. However, by July, with the Kings surrender to the Scotch Army and Wallingford now being the only stronghold in Berkshire still loyal to the crown, he knew that there would be no relief or reinforcements. The blockade had over time also been tightened, and with the prospect of desertion and mutiny from his starving soldiers, Blagge was forced to reopen negotiations. The terms of Blagge's surrender were drawn up on 22 July 1646. Fairfax respected Blagge as a fellow soldier for his work in resurrecting the castle for the war and for the manner in which he chose to hold for as long as possible instead of surrendering; therefore, Fairfax still granted Blagge the original favourable terms of surrender he was initially offered even though the situation had long changed. The surrender stipulated that the town and its castle would be surrendered to General Fairfax on 29 July and that all of the town's arms, ordinance and provisions of war would be handed over to Fairfax. Blagge and his garrison would then be allowed to march out of the town with full honours allowed to leave with their horses, arms and baggage. They would then be permitted to march ten miles out of the town before disbanding. Blagge was, however, forced in the end to surrender the castle to Fairfax early on the 27th after a mutiny broke out within the garrison. Fairfax sent a regiment into the town to restore order, and the garrison's exit was made unimpeded. Only two castles now remained supporting the royalist cause, Raglan and Pendennis, and they both fell by August. A new governor, Evelyn, was installed although he petitioned for the immediate destruction of the castle; Parliament instead decided to use it for the imprisonment of Presbyterian prisoners after the Prides Purge.  Slight of the castle  Continued turmoil, unrest in the country and a fear that the residents of Wallingford were still loyal to the crown caused Oliver Cromwell to fear that Wallingford Castle could again be fortified against him in a future uprising. On 17 November 1652, the Council of State decided that Wallingford Castle should be \\"forthwith demolished and the workes thereto belonging effectually slighted.\\" Materials from the castle were used again for improvement works at Windsor Castle and for the repair and improvement of the church of St Mary-le-More. = William of Orange's visit = On his way to London to claim the throne, William of Orange visited Wallingford and stayed at the Lamb Inn before crossing the river and proceeding to Henley. = Georgian period = Sir William Blackstone Sir William Blackstone, a famous English jurist, judge and Tory politician lived in Wallingford and held the office of Recorder of the town. The Blackstone family owned an estate in and around Wallingford, and William, upon inheriting it, built a house called Castle Priory to live in. William is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England; these are noted for their influence on the American Constitution. Sir William died in Wallingford in 1780 and is buried in St Peter's Church. By the end of the 18th century, the Parliamentary Borough of Wallingford was known as being one of the worst rotten boroughs. During the Reform Act of 1832, the constituency borders were increased geographically, and the number of MPs cut from two to one. =20th century=  Second World War  On 9 September 1944 a Halifax bomber of No. 426 Squadron RCAF, returning from an abandoned raid over the French port of Le Havre while still carrying a full bomb load, caught fire over Wallingford after its port outer engine exploded. Ordering most of his crew to bail out, the pilot, 23-year-old Flying Officer John Archibald Wilding, and his flight engineer, 22-year-old Sergeant John Francis Andrew, remained at the controls in order to steer the plane away from the town, crashing into the fields at Newnham Murren and thus preventing loss of many civilian lives. Both Wilding and Andrew were mentioned in dispatches for their bravery, with Wilding being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. They are commemorated by a memorial at the junction of Wilding Road and Andrew Road in Wallingford and by the Canadian flag that is flown over Wallingford Town Hall every year on 9 September in their memory.  Post-war  The 1972 the Local Government Act declared that in 1974 the Borough of Wallingford would be disbanded and the town would be transferred into a new local government district called South Oxfordshire. This also meant that Wallingford would be removed from the county of Berkshire and would join Oxfordshire. A town council was also formed with some of the old borough's responsibilities for town affairs allocated to it. Paul's Malt on Hithercroft Road, built in 1958, was demolished in 2001; thus the malting industry ended, which had been key to Wallingford for hundreds of years. At one time there were at least 17 maltings in the town.  Landmarks and structures  = Wallingford Bridge = Wallingford Bridge The Wallingford Bridge is a medieval road bridge over the River Thames connecting Wallingford to Crowmarsh Gifford. Wallingford has historically been an important crossing point of the Thames owing to the presence of a ford which was used before the construction of a bridge. This ford was used by William the Conqueror and his armies on his journey to London after his victory at Hastings in 1066. The first reference to a bridge is from 1141 when King Stephen besieged Wallingford Castle. The first stone bridge is credited to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and four remaining arches are believed to contain 13th-century elements. Major repairs used stone from the dissolved Holy Trinity Priory in 1530. Four arches were removed so that a drawbridge could be inserted during the siege of the castle in the Civil War of 1646, and these were replaced with timber structures until repair in 1751. Following a flood, three arches were rebuilt by Richard Clarke from 1810–1812 to a design by John Treacher (1760–1836) developed in 1809, and a parapet and balustrade added. The street lights on the bridge were made in the town and feature the Wilder mark on the base. = Wallingford Castle = Castle Wallingford Castle was a major medieval castle. Established in the 11th century as a motte-and-bailey design within an Anglo-Saxon burgh, it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as \\"one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries\\". During The Anarchy the castle held the Empress Matilda and her son the future King Henry II. It was the site of the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, which began the end of the conflict and set the path to a negotiated peace. Over the next two centuries Wallingford became a luxurious castle, used by royalty and their immediate family. After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII, the castle fell into decline. Refortified during the English Civil War, Wallingford was held as a Royalist stronghold commanded by Colonel Thomas Blagge. In 1645 General Thomas Fairfax placed Wallingford Castle under siege; after 16 weeks, during which Oxford fell to Parliamentary forces, the castle finally surrendered in July 1646 under generous terms for the defenders. The risk of civil conflict continued, however, and Oliver Cromwell decided that it was necessary to slight the castle in 1652, as it remained a surprisingly powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation, although a brick building continued to be used as a prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a Gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837. The mansion, abandoned due to rising costs, was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument as well as a Grade I listed building. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, sections of the castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. St Peter's Church = St Peter's Church = An earlier church on the site was destroyed in 1646 during the siege of Wallingford in the Civil War. Building of the present church started in 1763, the contractors being William Toovey and Joseph Tuckwell. In 1767 the interior of the church was paved, pews were added and the exterior was stuccoed under the supervision of Sir Robert Taylor. A spire designed by Taylor was added in 1776–77. A local resident, Sir William Blackstone, a lawyer and author of the Commentaries on the Laws of England, took an interest in the building of the spire and paid for the clock face visible from his house. The chancel was built in 1904, designed by Sydney Stephenson. The church was declared redundant on 1 May 1971, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 26 July 1972. St Peter's is the final resting place of Sir William Blackstone, who is buried in his family vault under the church. = St Mary-le-More Church = St Mary-le- More from the rear The Church of St Mary-le-More is located in a prominent position in the town square behind the Town Hall. The church appears in records from 1077, when the advowson belonged to St Alban's Abbey. The west tower was originally 12th century, but its upper stages were rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style out of the stone from Wallingford Castle when it was demolished by Oliver Cromwell after the Civil War. The nave and aisle were built in the 13th and 14th century, and the chancel was built later. However, all were rebuilt in 1854 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect David Brandon. The west window of the north aisle has stained glass made in 1856 by Thomas Willement. The pulpit was made in 1888 by the sculptor Onslow Ford. The church tower features a ring of ten bells. A ring of eight including the tenor was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry re-cast the second bell of that ring, now the fourth bell of the present ring, in 1887, the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 2003 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble and second bell, increasing the number of bells to ten. = St Leonards Church = St Leonards ChurchSt Leonards is the oldest church and is regarded as the oldest surviving place of worship in Wallingford. There has been a church on the site since Saxon times, when it was known as the Church of the Holy Trinity the Lesser. The current building still features distinctive Saxon stone work in the herringbone style around the north wall. Estimates for the start of construction point as early as the 6th century. Parliamentary forces used the church as a barracks during the Siege of Wallingford in 1656. Their occupation caused substantial damage to the building. Repair works were only completed in 1700 when it reopened. John Henry Hakewill directed a reconstruction of the church in 1849, although the Church was rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style the restoration works preserved large sections of the original Saxon Building. The church interior is noted for a series of four angel murals painted in 1889 by acclaimed artist George Dunlop Leslie who at the time lived on St Leonard's Lane. The Church now forms part of the Parish of St Mary-le-More with services being held on Sundays. = Wallingford War Memorial = Wallingford War MemorialWallingford war memorial, designed by Edward Guy Dawber and William Honeybone, unveiled in 1921. The memorial was updated to include those who died in the Second World War. The inscription reads \\"TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND IN HONOURED AND GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THE MEN OF WALLINGFORD WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1919. THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE/PASS NOT THIS STONE IN SORROW/NO SORROW BUT IN PRIDE/AND STRIVE TO LIVE/AS NOBLY AS THEY DIED\\" (At the base there is an added date to include the Second World War, 1939–1945) First World War (1914–1918) - Total names on memorial: 81 Second World War (1939–1945) - Total names on memorial: 36 = Kine Croft = The Kine Croft was known as the Canecroft in the 13th and 14th centuries, and in the 16th and 17th centuries as Kenny Croft. It comprises an open area of about seven acres surrounded on the south and western sides by ancient Saxon earthworks and formed part of the defensive fortifications of the town when it was an important Bhur in the kingdom of Wessex. Events held in the Kine Croft include Bonfire night, Bunkfest, The Vintage Car Rally, The Wallingford Festival of Cycling and The Circus. = Bull Croft = The Bull Croft is an open area within the town's Saxon defences. During the Saxon period the Parish Church of Holy Trinity stood in the southwest part of the present Bullcroft and by 1085 it had been taken over by the great abbey of St Albans and become part of the new Wallingford Priory. When the Priory was torn down by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525, the area was used as for farming. The Bull Croft was given to the town in trust by Mr Powyss Lybbe in 1912 and is now used as a public park. Facilities on the site include a children's play area, tennis courts and football pitches. = Town Hall = Wallingford Town Hall Wallingford Town Hall was constructed in 1670 and is located on the southern side of the market square with the War Memorial in front and the church of St Mary-le-More behind. The main hall and council chambers are on the first floor and feature a coved ceiling installed in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Jubilee. The building currently hosts the Town Council for meetings and civic events. The balcony is used by the towns Mayor at annual events. The ground floor has the town's Tourist Information Office, and, until the Corn Exchange was built in 1856, the open area under the hall was used for the town's corn market. The hall is open to all residents as a venue for private hire. = Corn Exchange = The Corn Exchange The Corn Exchange building dates to 1856. The iron arches supporting the roof of the building were cast at the Wilders foundry on Goldsmiths Lane. The Building has seen a variety of uses since its construction but until the outbreak of the First World War the building hosted the grain exchange and weekly corn market. In the inter-war years uses included boxing, cinema and auctions. After the Second World War the Social Security Ministry used the Building as a food and unemployment office before it fell into disuse. It was purchased by the Sinodun players in 1975 for use as a theatre. They dedicated it to Agatha Christie, who was president of the society from 1951 to 1976. The Corn Exchange has productions put on by the Sinodun players as well as providing space for other dramatics groups. The building functions as the town cinema. The Corn Exchange & Sinodun Players were awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2020. = Winterbrook house = Winterbrook House Winterbrook House was the home of author Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan from 1934 until her death in 1976 and his in 1978. It is believed that she based the fictional home of her fictional character Miss Marple called Danemead, which was in the village of St. Mary Mead on Winterbrook House. The house is still a private residence and forms part of the Agatha Christie Trail. = Flint House = Flint house Flint House is owned by Wallingford Town Council and is the current home of the Wallingford Museum. The frame may date back to the late 15th century and the flint exterior dates to the 17th century. = Wilders New Foundry, Goldsmiths Lane = Built in 1869 by Richard Wilder the new foundry was built to support the existing foundry on Fish Street. By this time there was rapidly increasing demand for the towns of cast iron working and equipment so more capacity was essential. The Building was decommissioned in 1983 and was converted into residential flats by 1984. Governance =UK Parliament= During the Third Reform Act 1884 the constituency of Wallingford was abolished. Wallingford became part of the Wantage constituency. The Wantage constituency was recreated in 1983. The Conservative Party's Ed Vaizey served as MP for Wantage from 2005 until the 2019 general election in which Vaizey announced that he would be standing down. Shortly prior to this, Vaizey had the Conservative whip removed after voting against Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 3 September 2019. Vaizey had the Conservative whip restored on 29 October 2019. David Johnston was selected as the Conservative candidate to represent Wantage and was duly elected as the new MP for Wantage at the 2019 general election. =Local government= The 1972 the Local Government Act set out in law that in 1974 the Borough of Wallingford would be disbanded and the town would be transferred into a new local government district called South Oxfordshire. In 1973 the town elected three district councillors to the South Oxfordshire District Council (SODC). In 2003 two electoral wards were created, Wallingford North and Cholsey & Wallingford South, which each elected two district councillors. Since 1974 the Wallingford ward has elected a county councillor to Oxfordshire County Council. The county councillor is Lynda Atkins, one of five Independent members of the Oxfordshire County Council. Wallingford is also run by a town council consisting of 16 members. The town council provides local services including maintenance of important buildings such as the Town Hall.  Geography  =Climate= As with the rest of the British Isles and Oxfordshire, Wallingford experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. There has been a weather station at the nearby Centre for Ecology & Hydrology collecting data on the local climate since 1961. Temperature extremes at Wallingford vary from recorded in January 1982 to recorded in July 2006. Recent low temperatures include during January 2010 and during December 2010. =Transport= River The River Thames has been a transport route for centuries, and Wallingford's growth as a town relied partly on it. Coal was supplied from North East England by coaster to London and then by barge upriver to Wallingford. This supply could be unreliable in seasons when river currents were too strong or water levels were too low. In 1789 the Oxford Canal reached Oxford from Warwickshire, and the Duke's Cut at Wolvercote gave it a connection to the Thames.Compton, 1976, page 52 This allowed coal from the Midlands to reach Wallingford by a shorter and more reliable route than by sea and river from the northeast. In 1799 the Oxford Canal consolidated its commercial position by buying an 80-year lease on a wharf on the Thames just above Wallingford Bridge.Compton, 1976, pp. 65–66 Chalmore Lock, a summer or low-water lock and weir, was built at Chalmore Hole, Wallingford in 1838, However, much of the time the fall was only 18 inches, and the lock was open at both ends. It fell into disrepair, and the lock was removed in 1883. The missing lock is the subject of confusion in Jerome K. Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat\\". A ferry had operated at the site from 1787 to transport horses across the river where the towpath changed banks. As the removal of the lock and weir meant that this was the longest clear stretch of the upper river, it was an ideal site for rowing, so the Oxford University Boat Club which had long trained here built a boathouse at Chalmore in 2006. In addition to the old Wallingford Bridge, a new bridge was built at Winterbrook in 1993 to carry the A4130 bypass around Wallingford. Rail On 2 July 1866 the Wallingford and Watlington Railway was opened between and Wallingford. Its relative speed and reliability enabled it to take a large share of goods previously carried on the Thames. Two months earlier, in May 1866, the Overend, Gurney & Co bank had crashed, causing one of the severest financial crises of the 19th century. The Bank Rate was raised to ten percent, which made it impossible for the W&WR; to raise the capital for its planned continuation to Watlington. The company sold the line to the Great Western Railway in 1872, and it became known as the Wallingford Bunk. British Railways closed the line to passengers in 1959 and to goods traffic in 1965, but the track between Hithercroft Road and Cholsey continued in use to serve the now demolished maltings until 1981 when BR removed the junction at Cholsey. However, the line has been preserved as the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway. Presently, the closest regular railway station to Wallingford is in Cholsey, about three miles away. Bus Bus services for the town are operated by Thames Travel. RiverRapids comprises three routes between Oxford and Reading, each running about once an hour. All three connect Oxford and Wallingford; the X38 continues from Wallingford to Henley-on-Thames via Nuffield and Nettlebed, the X39/X40 both continue from Wallingford to Reading, the X39 via Cane End and the X40 via Woodcote. Connector route X2 operates between Wallingford and Oxford via Didcot.  Economy  Castle Street and High Street corner Historically, Wallingford was a centre for local trading in livestock and corn as well as the general trade of other goods. This decreased after the construction of the bridge at Abingdon. The town developed as a centre for the production of iron and machinery in the 18th century; this continued until the 1980s. The brewing industry was important with two breweries and 17 maltings in the town. This link was ended with the demolition of Paul's Malt in 2001. The Lamb arcade was originally known as the Lamb Coaching Inn and In 1980 after being derelict for some years was converted into an Antiques Arcade. Open Since 1869 Champions hardware store has been serving the residents of the town for nearly 150 years.Waitrose branchIn 2005, Waitrose moved into a new store in the town centre after occupying an old site in the south of the town for decades. The new store has 22000 sq ft of retail space. A new Lidl is planned to open in 2019 on the Hithercroft Road. Wallingford has a selection of the nations big Banking groups. The main employers are primarily on the Hithercroft Trading Estate, established in the 1970s. There are some located at Howbury Park the other side of the river and also at Winterbrook Bridge. Rowse Honey is the UK's largest manufacturer of honey and has been located in the town since 1987 after being founded in the nearby village of Ewelme in 1954. Other businesses are the Royal Mail, HR Wallingford, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and Fugro. To the south east of the town is the headquarters for the non-profit agricultural organisation CABI. Sport and leisure Wallingford Sports Park A number of sports societies, clubs and associations are co-located at the Wallingford Sports Park. Wallingford Hockey Club traces its beginnings to 1894 and now comprises nine senior teams as well as the Wallingford Wildcats youth setup. Since 1995 the club has been based in the Wallingford Sports Centre. Wallingford Town F.C. was founded in 1922 is the local association football club. They currently play in the Hellenic Football League, and their home games are played at the Wallingford Sports Centre. Originally founded in 1967 as Cholsey RFC, the club changed its name to Wallingford Rugby Club when it moved to the Hithercroft sports ground in 1997. The club has a senior set up which includes fielding three competitive men's senior teams as a development squad and three women's teams known as the Maidens. The club is still headquartered on the Hithercroft which is now known as the Wallingford Sports Park. There are two Squash clubs in Wallingford. Wallingford Squash Club is in the town centre and the second is located at the Wallingford Sports Park. Pétanque Wallingford, the only pétanque club in Oxfordshire, is based at the Park. =Rowing= Wallingford Rowing Club Wallingford Regatta, formerly the Wallingford Skiff Regatta, was the only organised boating community in 1949 on the longest stretch of the Thames between locks (Benson to Cleeve Locks). It had taken place every year in peacetime since the late 1890s, and there is evidence that it existed as early as 1861. In 1949 the regatta committee founded the Wallingford Rowing Club, which started competing in other regattas. The regatta was developed as a conventional regatta although it still awards the Wallingford Skiff Regatta Cup. The town hosts the Wallingford Rowing Club, the Oxford Brookes University Boat Club. and the Oxford University Boat Club. The regatta was held on the same reach at Wallingford for most of its existence, but river conditions caused problems, and there was a growing need for larger facilities. In 2001 the Regatta moved to a new home at Dorney Lake in Windsor where it is still held. The event is the largest single day rowing regatta in the UK. In 2008 the new Oxford University Boat Club opened in Wallingford. Located on the site of the disused Wallingford marina on the Thames Path, the building designed by Tuke Manton Architects LLP replaced the club's historic home on the Isis, which was destroyed by fire in 1999. =Wallingford festival of cycling= The Wallingford Festival of Cycling started in 2015 with attendance of 3000. In 2018 British cycling billed the event one of the largest cycling events of the year with events including both 50 km and 110 km road sportives. In excess of 7500 were expected to attend. The event in 2015 was used as the backdrop for the filming of the Midsomer murders episode called breaking the Chain. Breaking the Chain was the third episode of the 18th series. =Music festivals= thumb Starting in 2002 in the Cross Keys pub, BunkFest usually held in the first week in September, has become the largest free multi-day festival in the UK with an attendance of over 25,000 in 2017.

The festival is intended to appeal to a wide audience. The main stage features light music and dancing during the day and lively folk, folk-rock and world music acts in the evening. Other venues around the town feature a wide variety of acts, ranging from quiet, contemplative folk artists and singer-songwriters to raucous rock bands. It attracts between thirty and fifty dance sides. The dance programme has included Cotswold and Border Morris, Appalachian and Eastern European forms, as well as traditional Irish, Scottish and Welsh forms. RugFest is Wallingford's summer music festival located at the Wallingford Sport Park on the Hithercroft. Founded in 2008, RugFest took two years off due to site refurbishments, returning in 2018. The 2018 festival was headlined by Scouting for Girls. =Vintage Car Rally= Founded in 2002 the Wallingford vintage car rally takes place on the Kine Croft in mid May with a parade that includes the whole town. In 2018 the number of cars in the parade increased to over 350 with the total number of vehicles on show being just over 400. The event is run for local charitable causes and raised £14,000 in 2018, which brought the cumulative total to over £100,000. Education St John's (a primary school), Fir Tree, (a junior school), and St Nicholas (an infants' school) are all located within the town itself, with additional primary schools at Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, Cholsey and Crowmarsh Gifford serving the surrounding areas. = Wallingford School = Wallingford School is the successor to Wallingford Grammar School founded in 1659 when Walter Bigg left money for a school in his will.

The population was 16,323 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice Metropolitan Statistical Area. History In 1955, a New York syndicate led by developer Sydney R. Newman purchased the area now known as Bayshore Gardens on the west side of U.S. 41 along the eastern shore of Sarasota Bay, just north of the Sarasota/Manatee county line, and platted an area between what was dubbed Bayshore Gardens Parkway running from U.S. 41 to 26th Street West and Sarasota Bay that would become Bayshore Gardens. The property was purchased for about 2 million dollars, making it the most expensive land purchase in the area since the 1920s.This 3,200-acre area, once fields for growing tomatoes, would include recreation areas and a marina, schools, churches, shopping centers and medical facilities as well as homes in the popular style of that time, now called Mid-Century Modern. By its grand opening in 1956, 4 model homes were built and 7 available designs had been created for future residents to pick from, including the Seagrape, the Gladiola, and the most popular, The Bird of Paradise. Prices ranged from $8,000 to $15,000 for a home with a lot and lower rates for veterans were advertised. The first home in Bayshore Gardens was sold in July 1956 to Jennie and Samuel Gibson in the Hibiscus style. By April 1958, the neighborhood had 400 homes, all of which were designed by Bradenton architect Sidney Wilkinson and built by Richard Morton’s Bayshore Gardens Inc. The neighborhood was opened up that year to other developers and home builders, including Richmond Homes and Arrow Home Builders. Designs added by Richmond Homes included the Cayman, Expo, Lenfield, Something Special, Tarlton, and Windward. Arrow Home Builders were known for adding larger custom homes on the Bayshore Gardens waterfront In November 1959, Bayshore Gardens Shopping Center held a grand opening with stores that included Publix, a beauty shop, barbershop, hardware store, shoe repair, and clothing stores. The neighborhood grew rapidly and by 1960, it was the largest voting precinct in the county. That year, the shopping center was expanded to add more stores and a movie theater.  Historical Preservation  In 2014, students from the University of Florida and community members began inventorying the mid-century homes in the neighborhood as part of a project to have Bayshore Gardens designated as the state's largest and most historically significant collection of mid-century residential architecture. Bayshore Gardens is still in the process of gaining a historical designation from the State of Florida.

On December 29, a streetcar line would begin operation going from Bradenton to the neighboring city of Manatee and would go west crossing Wares Creek to the nearby community of Fogartyville. The company operating the line would have financial difficulties likely due to a lack of ridership and would cancel the line in 1906. In 1912, the first road, Range Road leading from present day Bradenton (then, Manatee) to Sarasota was built. The original county courthouse was bought and moved to a new location becoming a grade school for black students in the area, Lincoln Academy Grammar School that same year. A new courthouse would be built on the site of the old one which still stands today in the following year, 1913.

The population was 1,171 at the 2010 census, and 1,278 in the 2018 U.S Census estimates. It is part of the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city occupies the southern part of Anna Maria Island and is one of three municipalities on the island. The others are Holmes Beach in the center and Anna Maria in the north. History Bradenton Beach was originally referred to as Cortez Beach since it was close to Cortez. Construction on a wooden bridge to the mainland would begin in the summer of 1921. The 1921 Tampa Bay Hurricane that October would destroy 80% of the bridge that was built up to that point. Despite a majority of the bridge being destroyed, it would later be completed sometime in June 1922; 8 months later. Bradenton Beach started to be known as its present-day name during the mid 1920s as the Florida land boom was occurring. Real estate developers saw this as a way to convince possible buyers that it was closer to Bradenton. Sometime in early 1926, a county bond was approved to build a wooden bridge linking Bradenton Beach to Longboat Key with the bridge being finished in August. However, the bridge was only open until October after a hurricane damaged it. On March 6, 1932, the bridge would be swept away during a high tide. It would not be replaced until 1957. A post office called Bradenton Beach has been in operation since 1941. Bradenton Beach would later be incorporated in 1952. The main wooden bridge to the island from Cortez would be replaced by a concrete one in 1957 as local residents wanted a stronger bridge. A parade lead by an elephant was hosted by the city to display it strength and to convince the local residents as well. To offset the cost of bridge, the local government made it a toll bridge until 1964 when it was reimbursed. Cars were charged 30¢ entering the island and no toll was put in place on those leaving the island.

Library The Tingley Memorial Library is located at 111 2nd Street, North, behind City Hall. It was built with a $600,000 bequest from the estate of Beulah Rebecca Hooks Hannah Tingley (1893–1986) and is maintained without the use of public funding. In 2000, Beulah Tingley was declared a \\"Great Floridian\\" by the state and a plaque attesting to that honor was placed above the front door of the library.

The population was 4,491 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice Metropolitan Statistical Area. History = Early History = Present-day Cortez was a part of the Safety Harbor culture region from about 900 CE until the 1700s. The Safety Culture people formed chiefdoms and villages along the shoreline of Tampa Bay and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico coast. Safety Harbor culture is defined by the presence of Safety Harbor ceramics in burial mounds, which have been excavated from nearby archaeological sites in present-day Manatee County. The Safety Harbor culture virtually disappeared due to disease and incursions by other Native Americans. The Calusa people, often referred to as the \\"Shell Indians\\", also inhabited the southwest coast of Florida. The Calusa were first recorded by Spanish explorers in 1513, but were likely living on the coast long before they were recorded doing so. The Calusa became the dominant power in the Tampa Bay area with the waning of the Safety Harbor Culture in the 1600s. The Calusa are believed to have stayed in the area until 1763 when the remaining Calusa, their numbers having already dwindled due to disease and warfare, left Florida to settle in Cuba. The Calusa are believed to have lived along inner waterways in homes built on stilts. Unlike many other tribes, the Calusa did not hunt but rather fished for subsistence. The Calusa people were prolific fishermen. The Calusa people made nets from palm tree webbing in order to catch the following: mullet, pin-fish, pig-fish, and catfish. They used spears topped with arrowheads crafted from fish teeth and spines in order to hunt eels and turtles. Women and children of the tribe caught shellfish including: crabs, lobsters, oysters, clams, and conch. They used the shells they collected to make a variety of things such as tools, utensils, ornaments, weapons, and jewelry. The eventual demise of the Calusa people is attributed to invasions from other tribes and disease brought by Spanish and French explorers. Cuban fisherman, or Cuban Ranchos, began journeying upward in order to fish the waters of the Gulf Coast of Florida around the mid-1700s. Once the journey to Florida had been made, the Ranchos would set up temporary camps where they would reside for around half a year while they fished the plentiful waters of the area. Catches were dried and salted so that they could be transported back to Cuba to be sold. This proved effective as the Ranchos would return home before Lent to sell their catch when fish was in high demand. The waters surrounding Cuba are viable fishing waters, however they were fished heavily. The waters near the Gulf Coast of Florida were particularly appealing to the Ranchos because there were not yet any permanent settlements in the area. This means that the water in the area was an untapped resource of fish, all theirs for the taking. This area was made all the more appealing because its environment was conducive to inshore net fishing (the preferred method of the Ranchos). = Founding and 19th Century = The E. P.

Originally called Hunter’s Point, Cortez was settled in the 1880s by families from Carteret County, North Carolina. When a post office was established in 1888, the village needed a new name to avoid confusion with another Hunter's Point in Florida. Although the origins of the name Cortez cannot be officially proven, the community may have been named after the Spanish Conquistador Hernán Cortés. In its early days, Cortez was a fishing village so rural that it was more often reached by water than by land. The mainstay of Cortez was and still is its success in the commercial fishing industry.  The 1890 Bratton/Burton Store  The first commercial building in Cortez was built by William C. Bratton in the 1890s. This building helped to connect Cortez with the outside world. The Bratton/Burton Store housed the post office, general store, and steamboat wharf. About a decade after its original construction, construction on rooms began in order to expand it into the Albion Inn. The Albion Inn along with the 1912 school house were some of the only buildings on the waterfront to survive the hurricane of 1921. The Inn eventually closed and was sold to the United States Coast Guard. The Bratton/Burton Store served as U.S. Coast Guard Station Cortez from 1974 until 1991 - when it was slated for demolition. Cortez residents came together to save the Bratton/Burton Store portion of the building from demolition. In 2006, it was moved to the grounds of the Florida Maritime Museum.Information on a sign constructed by the Manatee County Historical Commission in conjunction with the Manatee County board of County Commissioners in 2006 = Cortez in the 20th Century = Some boats landed in front of the Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse after the Hurricane of 1921. Photo courtesy of Manatee County Public Library System.  1912 Rural Graded Schoolhouse  Prior to 1912, the young children of Cortez were educated in a one-room, wood schoolhouse. In 1912, the one-room schoolhouse was replaced with a larger, brick schoolhouse referred to as the Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse. The Cortez Mother's Club played a large part in the construction and success of the new schoolhouse. This new schoolhouse became a community hub for Cortez, and provided shelter for many during the hurricane of 1921. The Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse was first build with three classrooms, but in 1933 one of the classrooms was extended to serve as an auditorium. This building was used as a school for the children of Cortez until 1961. An art school then leased the building before being sold to weaver Robert Sailors in 1974. Sailors used the schoolhouse as his home and studio. After his death, Manatee County purchased the schoolhouse and began the process of restoring it in 1999. In 2006, the schoolhouse was reopened as a museum. Today, the Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse houses the Florida Maritime Museum.Sign commissioned by the Manatee County Historical Commission in 2006  World War One  When the United States entered World War I in 1917, residents served in a variety of capacities. Ten residents are known to have served with eight going into the US Army and two in the US Navy.  Building of the Cortez Bridge  Construction on the Cortez Bridge connecting Anna Maria Island to Cortez began for the first time in 1921. Anna Maria Island was not connected to the mainland prior to this and so could only be accessed by boat. Construction on the bridge came to a screeching halt after the hurricane of 1921 hit destroying any progress that had been made on the bridge. In 1922, construction began again and the wooden bridge was completed. The wooden bridge connected Cortez Road to Bradenton Beach's Bridge Street. In the 1950s, the wooden Cortez Bridge was replaced with the current concrete bridge. To prove how stable the new bridge was, elephants from Ringling Circus were even brought over and paraded across the bridge for all to see.  The Hurricane of 1921  In October 1921, Cortez was unexpectedly and brutally hit by a hurricane estimated to have been either a category three or four. The hurricane of 1921 was reportedly the most damaging to hit the Tampa Bay area since the mid 1800s. The people of Cortez had little to no warning that the storm was coming before it hit, so they took refuge in the 1912 Rural Graded Schoolhouse. The hurricane of 1921 almost completely destroyed the waterfront. Leaving few structures standing, the waterfront had to be rebuilt and is now barely recognizable from what it once was.  Roaring Twenties and Great Depression  During the 1920s many new changes would come to the village of Cortez. For the first time ever shipments of seafood were delivered by road as residents got cars. Electricity would also become common in the village reducing much of the work load. Cortez during the Great Depression was notably one of the only communities in the United States to not receive federal aid.  World War Two  As with all other areas of the country, Cortez was greatly impacted by WWII. Most men in Cortez went to war whether they enlisted or were drafted and those that enlisted largely did so in the United States Navy or the United States Coast Guard as sailing was their way of life. Many women also went off to war as well to serve the country as nurses and medical personnel. Those left behind during the war effort worked to ensure the survival of Cortez and its fishing industry. Although fishing prior to WWII was seen as a family business, with most of the young men and many of the women of Cortez gone workers were hired from outside of the family. Women and young girls began working and fishing for seventy five cents an hour to support their families and fill in for the men. Geography Cortez is located at (27.463550, -82.672610).

Longboat Key is south of Anna Maria Island, between Sarasota Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. It is almost equally divided between Manatee and Sarasota counties. The town of Longboat Key was incorporated in 1955 and is part of the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town's population was 6,888 at the 2010 census, down from 7,603 at the 2000 census.  History  = European discovery, 1538-1848 = Longboat Key was originally inhabited by Native Americans. The area what is now Longboat Key was scouted by Juan de Añasco who was the first known European to explore the key and Hernando De Soto's scout. He spent about 2 months attempting to find a landing site and he was also most likely the first man to see and explore Sarasota Bay, Boca Ceiga Bay and the Manatee River. According to local legend, he believed the Indians were hostile. When the party reached land on the island, the Indians fled leaving their Longboat in a bayou. Pirate Jean Lafitte was said to have been shipwrecked near or on Longboat Key. For the next 304 years, the key was relatively undisturbed. = Earliest, 1842?-1882 = It is known that there were Cuban and Spanish fisherman, along with squatters, whom had made a camp and trading post on the northern part of the island before 1842. At the time, the area was referred to on maps as \\"Saraxola\\" and \\"Zarazote\\". There is little known about the island after 1848. It has been known that an early settler of Sarasota and its first post master, Charles Abbe, had a plantation for citrus and pineapples on an unknown location on the island. = Official, 1882-1921 = In the late 19th- century, Longboat Key was opened up for settlement. Longboat Key had appeared to be inhabited by Colin and Rowlin W. Witt in 1882, who claimed on the north end of the island. Thomas Mann, a notable settler, had purchased land and moved to it with his sons in 1884, receiving on the key. He moved to the key permanently in 1888 with his family, and his house was located in the north end of the key. A year after buying the land, the town was given the name Longbeach. With a passage being dug in 1895 from Sarasota Bay to Tampa Bay, steamships and paddle boats could access the island. Soon, a mail service was established that brought residents mail from Cortez. More land was sold in 1905 for $500 for commercial development. In the early 1900s, Longboat Key was a farming community. Longboat Key was very popular, mostly for growing fruits and tomatoes, with Byron Corey owning a farm which was on the New Pass on the southernmost point of the key. In 1912, The Sarasota Times headline read: \\"From a lonely Key, it is now a center of trucking and fruit growing.\\" = Post-hurricane until incorporation, 1921-1955 = In 1921, the key lost most of its agricultural land and buildings during a hurricane. There were no roads that led to the key until 1929 when a bridge was built to St. Armands, therefore most transportation was done with a ferry dock on the north end of the key. That same year, the island was split between two counties, Sarasota and Manatee. In 1925, on the south end of the key, John Ringling, a developer, built the Ritz Carlton Hotel. The hotel began construction in March 1926, never being completed and eventually, it was torn down. In 1936, for the first time, telephone service was brought to the South End of the island. By 1939 or 1940, service was brought to the North End. In World War II, Longboat Key housed a bombing range. In 1942, it was used by B-26 planes, and from 1943-1945 it was used by P-40 and P-51 planes. The island was used from 8 A.M to 5 P.M, closing during these training sessions. = Incorporation, 1955 = On November 13, 1955, the town was incorporated by a 186–13 vote. At the time, only about a third of Longboat Key was developed and roughly 215 people lived on the key. When the town was incorporated, it changed its name from Longbeach to Longboat Key. = Largescale development, 1960s-present = In the 1960s and 1970s the Arvida corporation purchased the south end of Longboat Key and developed it for $13.5 million. President Bush had arrived on Longboat Key on September 10, 2001, the day before the September 11 Attacks, to read to second graders in a campaign at the Emma E. Booker School in Sarasota. On November 14, 2015 the town of Longboat Key celebrated its 60-year anniversary. Government The town of Longboat Key has a commission-manager form of government. The United States Postal Service operates a post office on Longboat Key, with the entire island having the ZIP code of 34228. The post office was established on October 10, 1907, as \\"Longbeach\\" and was located in the community of that name on the north end of the key. On February 1, 1958, the name of the Longbeach post office was changed to Longboat Key. There was also a post office named \\"Longboat\\" established on March 27, 1914, in the Sarasota County portion of the key, but it was discontinued on January 14, 1922, and its functions were assumed by the Sarasota post office.Bradbury, Alford G., and Hallock, E. Story, A Chronology of Florida Post Offices, 1962, reprinted 1993, Port Salerno, Florida: Florida Classics Library, p. 49. The quasi-governmental form of the Condominium Association exists in one of its most complex forms in and on Longboat Key, comprising the \\"Federation of Longboat Key Condominiums\\". In addition to the Longboat Key Chamber of Commerce, and in concert with the Town of Longboat Key, these entities have made Longboat Key an exemplar of local government and citizen cooperation in participation and management for communities of its type. Longboat Key is served by two newspapers published year-round, the Longboat Observer and the Longboat Key Newshttp://www.lbknews.com/ In recent years, \\"federalizing\\" the Key by having the U.S. Congress create the \\"Longboat Key National Seashore\\" has been suggested. Currently Longboat Key is located within two Florida counties, Manatee County in the north and Sarasota County in the south, but there have been calls for the Florida Legislature to pursue an initiative to create a 68th county, \\"Longboat Key County,\\" to simplify governance of the island. Neither of these initiatives is likely to be passed, however. As of February 2019, Longboat Key officials had not started any comprehensive effort to put Longboat in one county or the other. Officials did, however, ask state legislators to request the Florida Legislature's OPPAGA perform an analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of moving into only one county. Geography White heron in the Durante Community Park on Longboat Key Longboat Key is located north of St. Armands Key, with its circle of shopping and dining, and Lido Key, and south of Bradenton Beach, Holmes Beach, and Anna Maria, which are located on adjacent Anna Maria Island. The nearby cities of Sarasota and Bradenton and the Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport round out Longboat Key's varied list of geographic amenities. State Road 789 (Gulf of Mexico Drive) runs the length of the island, with ancillary boulevards branching off to residential neighborhoods. From some locations one can see both Sarasota Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. At other points the island widens and accommodates various homes owned both singly and in condominiums, hotels, and sports clubs. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 74.19%, is water. Some Longboat Key residents are \\"snowbirds\\", who vacation on or own second homes on Longboat Key, and are present only during the winter months. Others are homesteaders, utilizing the various homestead exemptions provided to Florida citizens who own and occupy their principal residences within the state, as set forth under the Florida Constitution. There are numerous restaurants on Longboat Key, Mar Vista, The Lazy Lobster, The Dry Dock, Pattigeorge's Restaurant, Chart House, the Longboat Key Club Restaurant, Euphemia Haye, Maison Blanche, Bayou Tavern, and Harry's. There are also full-service grocery stores, including Publix, and pharmacies, located centrally. Most of the Gulf side of Longboat Key comprises beaches. The southernmost area of the key is mostly part of the Longboat Key Club. File:Longboat Key FL beach bdwk01.jpgBoardwalk to beach File:Longboat Key FL beach03.jpgBeach on Gulf side of key File:Longboat Key FL beach01.jpgBeach expanse Real estate Much of the land area of Longboat Key is occupied by either single-family homes or condominium apartments. Most of the condominium associations co-own common elements which comprise pools, tennis courts, sites with water views and access to beaches. Almost the entire land area of Longboat Key is now occupied. The remaining older, singly owned houses are as much as 45 years old, annexed to comparatively small parcels, again an outgrowth of the ½ acre limitation on homestead property area within municipalities as set forth in the Florida Constitution. In the last few years, these properties have been purchased by new owners who sought to and did demolish them in order build small, ornate homes worth much more, many being valued to amounts on the order of as much as a few million dollars, a peculiar outgrowth of the unlimited-in-value homestead exemption for principal residences from forced sale provided to homesteaders under the Florida Constitution. This diverse mix of homes owned both singly and in condominium line the many cul-de-sacs and boulevards branching off main roads towards both the bay and the gulf, with the length of the island served by Gulf of Mexico Drive. Water A perennial problem for Longboaters was water quantity and quality. Salinity and sedimentary factors threatened the availability of potable water to island residents, visitors, and businesses. This problem was alleviated sufficiently when the Governing Board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District approved a connection to Sarasota County's water supply, augmenting the existing connection to that of Manatee County.http://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/news/viewarticle.php?id=221 swfwmd.state.fl.us Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 7,603 people, 4,280 households, and 2,846 families residing in the town.

The population was 4,492 at the 2010 census. According to the U.S Census estimates of 2018, the city had a population of 5,022. It is part of the Ocala Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city name, Belleview, comes from the French words Belle and view, meaning beautiful view,. \\"The City with Small Town Charm\\" is the city's motto History A post office has been in operation at Belleview since 1883. Like many parts of Marion County, one of Belleview's first recorded white land owners was a transplanted South Carolinian, J. F. Pelot Sr. In 1854, he settled on a farm about three miles west of where the current Belleview City Hall is located. Pelot bought his land while he still resided in Hardyville, S.C., according to Pelot's grandson, Frank Pelot III, in a 1986 Star-Banner story. Prior to Pelot's arrival, the area around Lake Lillian was a popular resting place for Indian bands including Seminoles under Osceola. In April of 1839, United States soldiers held talks with a group of Seminoles on an over-night excursion somewhere near Lake Lillian, which was called Nine Mile Pond at the time. The name came about because the pond was located nine miles south of Fort King in present-day Ocala. Further evidence of Indian habitation of the Lake Lillian area came during the 1930s when dredging of the lake unearthed Indian arrowheads and other artifacts. \\"When Lake Lillian was dredged back in the '30s to make it more round, we picked up arrowheads by the buckets-full,\\" said Frank Pelot III, in the 1986 Star-Banner story by Elaine Hamaker. According to Sybil Browne Bray, writing in \\"Salty Crackers\\" (No. 8, 1990), by as early as 1843, folks were receiving land under the Armed Occupation Act. By the 1850s, the Pelots, the Eichlbergers, the Roachs and the Foggs, among others, had developed sizable plantations.\\" Members of the Eichlberger and Fogg families served with a company of Confederate soldiers called the Marion Hornets during the Civil War, joining forces with the Marion Dragoons after the battle of Gaines Mill in Alachua County. When the Florida Railway and Navigation Company railroad arrived in the county during 1882, a new development firm called the Marion Land and Improvement Company was formed to promote and sell the land around Lake Lillian. Lake Lillian has had several names. From Nine Mile Pond to Butlers Pond to Roach's Pond when the land around the lake was owned by early settler King Roach. It is not known how or when the name Lake Lillian came to pass. By 1886, it was referred to as Lake Lillian in a booklet about Belleview published by the Marion Land and Improvement Company. According to Belleview history expert Gene Scroggie, the name Lillian was thought to belong to the wife of one of the men who formed the Marion Land and Improvement Company. One story passed down about the name of the town, Belleview, was Pelot named it after his daughter Belle. But according to a history of the town written in 1950, the name was derived by the founders in 1884 from a combination of French word \\"belle\\" and \\"view\\", to promote mean beautiful vistas to be seen around the fledgling town. Belleview was called \\"The City of Oaks\\" in \\"The Story of Belleview\\" written by former Belleview Chamber of Commerce President Vincent Razzano in the late 1950s. The area was considered \\"a health haven in the midst of natural and attractive scenery, rolling terrain, fertile soil and mild equable climate. Its attractiveness to northerners in feeble health seeking a place for winter residence was soon recognized. The Lakeview Hotel, then known as the Hotel Sanitatia, was owned and operated by Dr. H. Knight. Its desirability attracted men of prominent standing in all walks of life.\\" John F. Dunn was listed as a major stockholder in the Marion Land and Improvement Company. He was an attorney and banker in Ocala and a stockholder in the Dunnellon Short Railway. He was also involved with the development of Heather Island on Lake Weir. Dunn would also head the development of the community of Dunnellon in the 1880s and was deeply involved in the phosphate boom in Marion County during the 1890s. The President of the company was the Hon. C. L. Robinson, an attorney from Jacksonville. Ocala merchant E.W. Agnew was the vice president, Dunn was the treasurer, and the Rev. H. Woodward, formerly of Keene, NH, and a Methodist minister, was the secretary. Others reportedly holding stock in the company were Dr. Harvey Knight, of Lowell, Mass., who later opened a sanitarium and hotel, C.A. Babb, and Ocala's C. W. Campbell. Bray writes in \\"Salty Crackers\\" that, \\"the local government, made up mostly of northerners removed many features common to small southern towns, for instance the free roaming hogs through the streets. Admirable sanitary regulations were being adopted and were strictly enforced.\\" Another thing the New England founders prohibited was the inbibing of alcoholic beverages. In fact, they wrote the prohibition laws into the original deed restrictions for the land sold. From 1851-1882, the Concord Stage Line used Lake Lillian as watering stop before changing the teams and getting food for the passengers at a station on the top of a hill about two miles south of town. The route south from Jacksonville to Tampa included stops at Palatka, Orange Springs, Orange Lake, Ocala, Camp Izard, Augusta, Melendex, Pierceville, and Fort Taylor. The route followed the old military road established after the U.S. gained the territory of Florida during the 1820s and 1830s. Today that road is U.S. 301. Another route out of Belleview to the south, according to Bray, was the Old Wire Road. \\"The International Ocean Telegraph strung its wires along this route. This became Western Union and Florida Railway and Navigation Company became Florida Central and Peninsular Railway and the Seaboard Coastline.\\" By 1880, the area, around what would become Belleview, had a population of about 350 people. By comparison, Ocala had more than 2,600; Weirsdale (then Foster's Pond) had 28; Summerfield had 50; and Miami had 150. The town was founded in 1884 and was incorporated and held its first election on May 8, 1885. Sixty-three people voted, 44 of them for Alfred Stetson, who became the first mayor of Belleview. With the arrival of more and more people came the need for schools, a library, police and fire service, a church, funeral home, a cemetery and a city hall. The first city hall was a frame building built in 1884 by the Marion Land and Improvement Company. It included a bell tower and stage. On Feb. 12, 1925, the building burned to the ground after a fish fry. A second city hall was built on the site of the first one, but on April 8, 1935, it also burned to ground, catching fire when shards from a fire built by a local Methodist minister, raking and burning leaves blew into the bell tower. The Belleview Fire Department, of the period, was an all-volunteer outfit with one forty gallon water tank with a hose, mounted on two iron wheels and it was hand-drawn. With insurance money and help from Works Progress Administration workers during the New Deal, a third city hall, constructed with limestone from the area, was built between 1935-1940. The Belleview Library was established on November 26, 1886 by the Library Association of Belleview. It is the sixth oldest library in Florida and the second oldest in continuous operation in Florida. With the help of a group of ladies known as the Belleview Workers, the Library Association worked “to establish a reading room and promote socially and intellectually the best interest of the people.” The reading room was first located in the home of Professor George Gray Bush and Ellen Bush, who were the main proponents for founding a library. In 1877, Marion Land and Development Company donated two lots to be used for a library building. The land was fenced until funds could be collected for construction to begin. During that time, the reading room was in several different locations including the Belleview Hotel (paying $3.75 a month rent), The Whittier Building, the Block Building, and the Belleview Blade (one of the first newspapers in Belleview). In 1890 and in 1904, the buildings housing the library burned, leaving only the books in circulation. It was decided that a stone building was needed, so the Library Association and the Belleview Workers set out to raise funds for the proposed building. On March 19, 1908, a limestone building was completed and dedicated as the Belleview Library. As Belleview grew so did the library. In the late 1960s, librarian Alice Nesbitt donated money in honor of her late husband to build a children’s wing and office space. With that donation and the assistance of a fundraising campaign, the new wing was dedicated on June 17, 1969. In 1988 it was noted that the original 80-year-old section of the library was badly in need of repair. In February of that year the Friends of the Library Association was formed and by June 26th the renovations were completed with funds from various donations and fundraisers. In the early 1990s, Phillip Felburn, a philanthropist interested in preserving old libraries, donated $100, 00.00 for an addition to almost double the size of the library building. His only stipulation was that the original 1908 section was to be preserved. On Dec 12, 1993, with the additional help of the Friends of the Library, the Felburn Nature Study Room and the newly renovated Belleview Library was dedicated. In 2002 it was decided that the library was just too small and a search for a suitable location inside the Belleview city limits began. The Goolsby family of Belleview offered a few acres of land along highway 484 for the new library site. On May 31, 2008, the new 16,000 square foot Belleview Library was opened. The original 1908 building now houses a small museum in the original section and the Friends Book Nook which sells donated books to fund children’s programs, purchase books for the library and other needs not covered in the library budget. http://friendsofbelleviewlibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-Walk- Through-the-History-of-Belleview-Library.pdf The Blade was among the earliest newspapers in Belleview. Its editor was George P.E. Hart. Later newspapers included the Belleview Newsletter, the Belleview News and the Voice of South Marion. The first Belleview Grammar School was a large two-room building complete with bell tower. Prior to that, classes were held in the city hall building. In 1913, a Miss Callie was the teacher for the primary grades and a Professor Rickards, who was also a surveyor for the Atlantic Coast Line Railway from Ocala to Leesburg, taught the older students. A growing population prompted a move back into city hall for some classes. In 1926 a new five-room school building of Spanish design was built. It housed grades one through 12. The old school was dismantled and reassembled as the Belleview- Santos School for African American students in approximately 1933, first just as an elementary school and then in 1950 high school classes were added (prior to that African American high school students attended Howard Academy in Ocala). By the early 1950s, only grades one through eight attended school in Belleview Elementary, the older students took a bus to Ocala or Summerfield to attend high school. The present Belleview Elementary School was built in 1962 on 15 acres donated by Sham Sani, President of Belleview Heights Inc. The city purchased the site of the old school in 1963, and converted it into a city hall building. Desegregation came to Belleview in about 1969 with the blending of students from Belleview Elementary and Belleview-Santos. The students were divided so that students in grades K–2 attended Belleview Elementary and students in 3-5 attended Belleview-Santos Upper Elementary. In 1973 Belleview Elementary and Belleview-Santos Elementary both returned to teaching students in grades K-5, with middle school and high school students from both schools attending Lake Weir Middle and Lake Weir High.https://www.ocala.com/article/LK/20100707/News/604190257/OS https://www.marionschools.net/domain/7133 The new Belleview High school and Belleview Middle school were built in the early 1990s. Belleview was also the site of a college, founded by the previously-mentioned George Bush in 1889. Bush, who came to Belleview from New England, had one other teacher on staff. He was Hezekiah Butterworth, who also served as the editor of the nationally- circulated Youth's Companion. The college was in operation for just three years, with only two graduates, one of them Bush's daughter. Religious life in Belleview centered around several churches. The Church of Nazarene, originally built in 1900 as a Methodist Church, is the oldest church building still standing. Different denominations arranged for a joint pastorate by two clergymen. In 1904, the Methodist minister would arrive from Island Hope and flag the night train to stop with a burning newspaper for the return trip. Belleview has had three railroad depots, all located near the present-day County Road 25 crosses the railroad tracks at Baseline Road just east of U.S. 441. The first depot was built around 1884 and was noted for its decorative \\"gingerbread\\" woodwork. It was a tradition for year-around residents to greet the winter residents in the fall and to see them off again in the spring when they returned home. A second and larger depot, complete with loading dock, was built in 1910 on the same site. A third depot, nearly the same size as the second one but just for freight, was built in the 1950s. This depot was later moved to land near city hall on U.S. 441 to house the Belleview and South Marion Chamber of Commerce. \\"Woodeater\\" was the name given to one of the first trains to run through Belleview. But on May 26, 1953, the \\"Silver Meteor\\" with a diesel engine rolled through town at 80 mph. Mail arrived by rail, being thrown off the passing train. Outgoing mail was grabbed off a mail arm on the side of the tracks as the train rolled through town. During the 1920s, fire destroyed almost all of the wood buildings in the center of town. Only the Masonic Hall, which housed the post office, was spared and it still stands to this day. That building is located on Front Street. A second post office was built on the corner of Magnolia and Southeast Hames Road in 1954. A third post office was built in the 1960s, right next door to the second one on Hames Rd. Today's post office was built during the early 1990s and is located on Southeast 110th Street just west of U.S. 441. Industry in the 1930s included an ax handle factory that was later converted into a tomato canning factory. Wilke's Canning Company also canned boiled peanuts and shipped their products to wholesalers. Before that, around 1912, there was a saw mill south of the railroad tracks. Timber was readily available and logs hauled from three or four miles away by teams of oxen were cut and shipped out by rail. Another important industry for the area was turpentine distilling. Land owners would rent their pine-covered property to still operators to extract turpentine and rosins for the naval stores business in the first 40 years of the 20th century. Belleview was also known for its citrus, producing more than 250,000 bushels of fruit each year until freezes in the late 1890s forced many growers out of the business. Chicken farming was another agricultural industry to develop around Belleview by the 1920s. Several large poultry farms located in and around the town were started by several immigrants of Polish descent who came to the area from Michigan. Later, during the 1930s and 1940s, cattle ranching became popular as tick-borne diseases were being controlled with a state-sponsored eradication program and a fence law was passed by the state legislature in 1949 ending the open range in Florida. By 1900, Florida was already a popular destination for winter tourists. The Dixie Highway, which was developed between 1915 and 1927, had divisions running down the east coast (present-day U.S. 1) and the center of the state (present-day U.S. 441) was an important route for early \\"Tin Can Tourists\\" to reach the southern part of the Sunshine State. In the early 1900s, what would later become the Dixie Highway was just a narrow dirt road in Belleview. Marion County would use prisoner labor working on chain gangs, cutting tree limbs away from road's edge and repairing potholes with lime rock and clay. Now, it is U.S. 27-301-441 from north Marion County to Belleview, where 301 splits off. The current County Road 484 was a bicycle path in 1913, heading west out of Belleview according to Bray. Between two and three miles out of town was a cutoff, Southeast 120th Street today, which went west towards Eichelberger Cave, located near present- day County Road 467. Mrs. Charles Temere would lead Sunday afternoon excursions to the cave. Once there, they would light torches and enter the cave, which had two large rooms. The second room was so large it had a balcony-like natural formations above it. There were steps leading through a narrow passage back to the springs. Indians had inhabited the caves, and the young people of Marion County continued to explore it until the early 1970s when it was dug up for the lime deposits located around it. The proximity of water is always a source of concern to any settlers but particularly in Florida. A waterhole known as the Grotto provided Belleview with water for many years. A pump at the top of the Grotto pumped water directly out of a spring fed by the Floridian aquifer to residents. Occasionally, heavy rains would wash the pump into the spring, leaving the town without water until another pump was installed. Today, the Grotto, once a natural wonder the city used in its promotional material, is protected from intruders by a fence. Water was a serious problem in 1982-83 when 2,000 water customers in Belleview were forced to boil their water after gasoline was detected in the water supply. In September of 1982, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation closed Belleview's three downtown water wells, claiming some 10,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline had leaked into the municipal water supply. The DER banned consumption of water from the supply, an edict lifted a few weeks later when an order to boil water was enacted, an order that remained in effect, for eight months, until two new city water wells began pumping clean water in May of 1983. The end result was the drilling of the new wells and the replacement of most of the water system including the tearing down of the 75,000 gallon water tower and the building of a new 400,000 gallon water tower located near the Grotto. Cleanup of the contaminated wells was not completed until the early 1990s. Geography Belleview is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

History Plaque marking the discovery of phosphate in Dunnellon Dunnellon was founded in 1887. In 1889, phosphate was discovered in the area, leading to an expansion of the area until the early 1910s. The original mining took place in and around the Rainbow River (formerly called 'Blue Run'), using the river's natural flow to transport phosphates. What is now the 'Blue Cove' subdivision, was one of the original mining pits. Areas in and around Dunnellon served as filming locations for the 2001 horror film Jeepers Creepers, with a great deal of location work on Tiger Trail (a.k.a. High School Road), the road to Dunnellon High School, officially known as SW 180th Avenue Rd., just outside Rainbow Springs State Park.

Hobe Sound is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Martin County, Florida, United States. The population was 11,521 at the 2010 census. Geography Hobe Sound is located at . Hobe Sound is an exurban area in southern Martin County near the Atlantic Ocean. It stretches along the coast between Port Salerno and Jonathan Dickinson State Park but does include Jupiter Island. Hobe Sound is home to Hobe Sound Public Beach, one of Martin County's four guarded beaches.  History  Hobe Sound is the anglicized form of the name of a village of the Jaega, a Native American group that lived in the area before European settlement. The Spanish recorded the village name as Jobe or Jove . Jonathan Dickinson, whose party was shipwrecked near the town in 1696, spelled the name of the village \\"Hoe-bey\\". Parts of Hobe Sound were included in the of the Gomez grant given by Spain to Don Eusebio in 1815. In 1821, Gomez sold , including Jupiter Island, to Joseph Delespine for $1 per acre. Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, Henry Flagler built his railroad along the east coast of Florida passing through Hobe Sound. This gradually created many opportunities including jobs, the birth of tourism, and other related industries. 'Bubble House' in Hobe Sound During the land boom of the 1920s elaborate plans were announced for Hobe Sound by the Olympia Improvement Corporation. Their goal was to create a town, in Greek style, where motion pictures could be produced. Street names bore the Greek theme with names such as Zeus, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Olympus, Venus, Pluto and Athena. For a brief time Hobe Sound was renamed \\"Picture City\\" and plans were presented for a movie picture production center. The boom collapsed after the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane and the original name was restored. Street names remained, however, as did the cement streetlights along Dixie Highway. In 1924, the building which soon would become the new schoolhouse in Hobe Sound was constructed. The Martin County Board of Public Instruction secured the use of the new school building from the Picture City Corporation in 1925, and in October of that year, the Olympia School opened. The school was designated the \\"Picture City School\\" of Martin County. It remained in use as a school until 1962. Other mementos of the past are gone, including the ice plant, which was south of Bridge Road, and the old train station, which now, refurbished and relocated west of Hobe Sound, serves as an office building for Becker Groves and the Texaco station east of the Winn-Dixie plaza, which no longer supplies gasoline but continues to serve the community with car rentals and a livery service, operated by its founding family. Hobe Sound is positioned at the southern end of environmentally-sensitive Martin (named after Governor Martin) County. It has been stated that at Hobe Sound's front door lies the Gold Coast and that at her back door lies the Treasure Coast. Thus, Hobe Sound can lend to both while retaining its proud heritage and unique personality. Hobe Sound's proximity to the coast affords immediate access to the Atlantic Ocean and the deep-channeled Intracoastal Waterway, a water route that provides a sheltered passage for boats along the eastern seaboard. Another significant historical association possessed by Hobe Sound is the brief stay there of former Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1949 between his resignation from that post and his death. March 15, 1997: During a stay at golfer Greg Norman's Jupiter Island Estate, after conversing late into the night, Norman was escorting then President Clinton to a cottage on his estate when the president fell while descending four dark-wood steps to a stone landing. In the darkness, he apparently misjudged the final step, said White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry. \\"He remembers his right knee buckling out. He heard a very loud pop,\\" said Navy Capt. Connie Mariano, the president's personal physician. Alcohol was not a factor, Mariano told reporters while still in Florida. Paramedics at Norman's estate rushed to the president's side. They found Clinton lying on the ground being comforted by Norman and a Secret Service agent. The paramedics checked Clinton's vital signs, put ice and a splint on his leg and put him into an ambulance. Hobe Sound is a predominantly wealthy community whose residents have included such celebrities as \\"Tiger\\" Woods, Alan Jackson, Celine Dion, and Burt Reynolds among others. Over the decades, it was home or a winter home for wealthy businessman and industrialists, politicians, and sports and entertainment celebrities. Police protection for Hobe Sound is provided by the Martin County Sheriff's Department. The Martin County Fire Rescue Department provides modern fire, rescue, as well as EMS Services. State-of-the-art inter-facility EMS services are also provided by the Martin Health System.

The population was 6,083 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Port St. Lucie Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Seaboard Air Line Railway depot, now demolished Indiantown was originally established by the Seminole people as a trading post. Tribes fleeing southwards from the US Army after the First Seminole War found the area an attractive place to settle due to a relatively higher elevation and ample hunting and fishing spots. It was then settled by white American migrants in the 1890s. In 1924, Indiantown was transformed when S. Davies Warfield built an extension of the Seaboard Air Line Railway from Coleman, Florida to West Palm Beach, passing directly through—and stopping in—Indiantown.McIver. 198 Warfield planned to make Indiantown the southern hub of the Seaboard rail line. Toward that end, he planned a model city, laying out streets and building a school, housing, and a railroad station. Warfield also built the Seminole Inn, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The Seminole Inn However, the Florida land boom of the 1920s fizzled out after 1926. Warfield died a year later, putting an end to plans to make Indiantown the Seaboard's southern headquarters. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane wreaked significant destruction and halted further development. A serious effort to revitalize the local economy began in 1952 when the Indiantown Development Corporation was sold and restructured as the Indiantown Company. The Company was involved in the construction of new water and sewage systems, housing developments, docks making use of the St. Lucie River, and a 6000 foot airstrip for bringing in small cargo and civilian air traffic. In the 1950s and 1960s Indiantown was home to the Circle T Ranch, and its Circle T Rodeo Bowl. The 1963 Rodeo event drew approximately 15000 visitors, making it the largest tourist attraction in Florida at the time. The Ranch would later be bought out and turned into a filming studio. Seaboard trains continued to stop at the Indiantown depot through the 1960s but passenger service to the station was eliminated when Amtrak took over in 1971. The depot was demolished several years later. The Seminole Inn is virtually all that remains of the 1920s boom. Warfield's contributions to Indiantown are memorialized in, among others, Warfield Boulevard (the main route through Indiantown) and Warfield Elementary School. Currently, the economy of Indiantown relies heavily on seasonal agriculture. The town also continues to make use of its position near the intersections of many major roads to act as a transportation and infrastructure hub. There are also attempts to take advantage of nearby natural wetlands and to revitalize the Rodeo in order to draw in tourists. Geography Indiantown is located at (27.0263, -80.4728).

Recreation The main public beach in Jensen Beach is on Hutchinson Island and is called Jensen Sea Turtle Beach. It is a wide sandy beach on the Atlantic Ocean. Martin County life guards are in attendance. The beach is used for sun bathing, surfing, and swimming. Ecology Jensen Beach is known in the marine biology community for being a location for sea turtles to nest. Designated sections of the Jensen Sea Turtle Beach are barricaded off in order to protect the nests of the sea turtles. The three species found on this beach are the loggerhead, leatherback turtle and green sea turtle. Loggerhead nests are the most common type found on this and adjacent beaches. Locations of the sea turtles' nests are marked with the approximate date in which the eggs were laid and the expected date in which the eggs will hatch. These notifications are meant to discourage tourists and residents from visiting the beach in the evening hours during these time periods. Efforts are made to protect both species of sea turtles since nests have been declining in recent years due to the severe erosion of the beach. History The history of Jensen Beach in the 19th century revolved around pineapple farming. John Laurence Jensen, an immigrant from Denmark, arrived in 1881, and set up his pineapple plantation, which became the town of Jensen. By 1894, the Florida East Coast Railway reached Jensen Beach, and freight shipments were loaded directly onto the freight cars. By 1895, Jensen was called the \\"Pineapple Capital of the World,\\" shipping over one million boxes of pineapples each year during the June and July season To help handle the increased pineapple production, a pineapple factory was built. A hard freeze in 1895 devastated most of the small pineapple plantations. Two fires, in 1908 and 1910, destroyed most of Jensen Beach and its remaining pineapple farms. The industry finally collapsed in 1920 due to a wide variety of financial and agriculture problems. Growers decided to turn their efforts in another direction: raising citrus. The pineapple has become a symbol of Jensen Beach. The fruit legacy is celebrated annually during the Jensen Beach Pineapple Festival. In 2004 Jensen Beach was hit by two hurricanes. On September 5, 2004, Hurricane Frances made landfall at Hutchinson Island with winds of 105 mph. On September 25, 2004, Hurricane Jeanne made landfall on Hutchinson Island with winds of 120 mph.

Early settlers were fisherman who lived along the banks of the Manatee Pocket, a small natural bay in the St. Lucie River. Some decedents of these original settlers remain in the area with some owning family land for over 100 years. The area increased in population and importance after World War II, with many people from the northeastern United States moving to Florida. In 1960, the name was changed to Port Salerno, in order to differentiate it from that of the Italian city. The 1967 film Gentle Giant was partially filmed in and around Port Salerno.

Brownsville, (also known as Brown Sub), is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in metropolitan Miami, Florida, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 15,313, up from 14,393 in 2000. After three decades of population loss, Brownsville gained population for the first time in over 40 years in the 2010 US Census. History Brownsville was originally a settlement for white families in the 1920s. Blacks began moving into the neighborhood between the late 1940s and early 1960s as the population surrounding nearby Liberty Square expanded and many inner-city whites moved to newly built suburban subdivisions surrounding Miami city proper in the wake of World War II. In 1945, two black couples who lived in Brownsville were arrested and jailed for allegedly mishandling their garbage disposal. That same year, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses in lawns and marched against black home ownership in the area. By the mid-1960s, Brownsville was a thriving community for black professionals. However, the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that outlawed the restrictive covenants and riots in 1968 and 1980 brought the black flight of middle and upper-class families from the community. Brownsville experienced continued population loss from 1970 until 2000, as part of a greater suburbanization trend of among the U.S. upwardly- mobile middle class. By the 2010 US Census, Brownsville had gained population for the first time in over 40 years, rising to 15,313 residents.http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/21/v-fullstory/2277104/brownsville- residents-work-to.html Construction began on a transit oriented development \\"Brownsville Transit Village\\" in 2010, on the 5.8-acre site of the Brownsville Metrorail station parking lot.

History The Country Walk community was originally designed and built by Arvida/Disney Corp. Country Walk Arvida broke ground on the first homes in 1978 and construction finished in 1994. In 1985, Janet Reno prosecuted the Country Walk case, allegedly an example of day-care sex-abuse hysteria. In August 1992, Country Walk was severely destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. 90% of the 1,700 homes in Country Walk were destroyed. Following the hurricane, property owners filed lawsuits against the developer of Country Walk, Arvida for shoddy construction. In the subsequent years, the homes were slowly rebuilt. Unlike the destroyed homes which were made of wood frame construction, the new homes were rebuilt with concrete walls. Although many areas of Miami were heavily affected by Hurricane Andrew, Country Walk was one of the worst affected and remains a reminder of the hurricane's extensive disaster in the CDP today.http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/17/2956273/photo- gallery-08-17-141113.htmlhttp://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/18/2958131/the- fury-of-andrew.html Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 10,653 people, 3,234 households, and 2,820 families residing in the CDP.

The area adjoining the western border of the estate later became the Cutler census-designated place (CDP) through the time of the 2000 census, after which it was incorporated into the Village of Palmetto Bay. The population was 17,390 at the 2000 census. History Originally called the Hunting Ground due to its long use for that purpose by Native American tribes, the area was part of the 36-square-mile survey township granted to Henry Perrine by the United States Congress in 1838. In 1864, John and Mary Addison arrived at the Hunting Ground from Manatee County and built a home. By the 1870s, the area was being called Addison's Landing. In the early 1880s, Dr. William C. Cutler visited the area and subsequently purchased 600 acres. In 1882, Cutler persuaded his friend, William Fuzzard, to settle in the area, and in 1883, Fuzzard built a wooden two-story home. In 1884, Fuzzard, along with several other settlers, cut a path from his homestead to Coconut Grove, which eventually became Old Cutler Road. By the end of the year, the population had reached 75, and a post-office with the name \\"Cutler\\" was established near a wharf built at the northeastern part of the settlement. The Brown & Moody General Store in Cutler, circa 1900 In 1896, residents built the Cutler Schoolhouse. That same year, Samuel H. Richmond built a large, two-story balloon frame home known as the Richmond Cottage, which in 1899 was transformed into the area's only inn. A factory, stores, and other buildings were located around the intersection of what is now S.W. 168th Street (Richmond Drive) and S.W. 72nd Avenue (then the location of Old Cutler Road). The post office was moved to the Brown & Moody General Store. However, after the Florida East Coast Railway bypassed Cutler in 1903 for the new railroad town of Perrine 2 1/2 miles west, the town fell into a decline as farmers and settlers left to be closer to the railroad. From 1914 to 1917, Charles Deering purchased most of the land in the area, subsuming it within his estate. Except for the Richmond Cottage, which Deering incorporated into his estate, all of the buildings in the town were torn down. Suburban development slowly began to approach the boundaries of the Deering Estate in the 1960s. By the end of the 1970s, the area west of the Estate was almost fully developed and became the Cutler CDP. In 1986, after Charles Deering's last surviving daughter died, the Estate was purchased by the State of Florida. The Village of Palmetto Bay was incorporated on September 10, 2002, and took the territory formerly held by the Cutler CDP, as well as the eastern half of Perrine that had become the East Perrine CDP.\\"About our village .\\" Village of Palmetto Bay.

As of 2015, Fisher Island had the highest per capita income of any place in the United States. The CDP had only 218 households and a total population of 467. Named for automotive parts pioneer and beach real estate developer Carl G. Fisher, who once owned it, Fisher Island is three miles off shore of mainland South Florida. No road or causeway connects to the island, which is accessible by private boat, helicopter, or ferry. Once a one-family island home of the Vanderbilts, and later several other millionaires, it was sold for development in the 1960s. The property sat vacant for well over 15 years before development began for very limited and restrictive multi-family use. History Fisher Island was separated from the barrier island which became Miami Beach in 1905, when Government Cut was dredged across the southern end of the island. Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when Carl G. Fisher, a land developer, purchased the property from businessman and real estate developer Dana A. Dorsey, southern Florida's first African-American millionaire. In 1925 William Kissam Vanderbilt II traded a luxury yacht to Fisher for ownership of the island. After Vanderbilt's death in 1944, ownership of the island passed to U.S. Steel heir Edward Moore. Moore died in the early 1950s, and Gar Wood, the millionaire inventor of hydraulic construction equipment, bought it. Wood, a speedboat enthusiast, kept the island a one-family retreat. In 1963, Wood sold to a development group that included local Key Biscayne millionaire Bebe Rebozo, Miami native and United States Senator George Smathers and then former U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, who had promised to leave politics. During his subsequent presidency from 1968–1973, and during the Watergate scandal, Nixon maintained a home on nearby Key Biscayne known as the \\"Key Biscayne Whitehouse\\" that was the former residence of Senator Smathers and next door to Rebozo, but none of the three ever resided on Fisher Island. The Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) of the University of Miami maintained the Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory on Fisher Island from 1972 to 1990 under the leadership of Robert Ginsburg. After years of legal battles and changes in ownership, further development on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s Spanish style mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible to the public and uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards as it was in the days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains mansions, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private marina. Boris Becker, Oprah Winfrey, and Mel Brooks are among the celebrities with homes on the island. Buildings under construction in the summer of 2001 In 2005, the island attempted to incorporate as a town, but the Miami-Dade County Commission did not support this initiative. =Controversies= In 2006, the Service Employees International Union began organizing the workers on Fisher Island in preparation for a petition for recognition as those employees' bargaining representative. The campaign culminated on June 15, 2007 with a march to the mainland ferry terminal that ended with a worker's arrest. The New York Times wrote an exposé on the situation. In the article, residents were portrayed as not caring about the welfare of the community, but residents dispute this characterization, insisting that the island includes financially successful, compassionate people who have established several charitable activities on the island, provide health insurance to their employees and are involved in various arts organizations in the Miami-Dade area. The union argues that the wages provided by the island are too low for employees to care for their families and that the health insurance provided is out of the reach of most island employees. =The Fisher Island bankruptcy case= One of the last developable parcels of land on the island, a 15-acre site approved for residential development facing the shipping channel that separates the island from Miami Beach, was for a number of years subject to a protracted legal battle between Inna Gudavadze, the widow of the late Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili, and investors aligned with his distant relative and former business associate, Joseph Kay.

It is located in the upper Florida Keys on the islands of Elliott Key and other nearby keys, such as Totten Key. It was the only municipality in the Florida Keys not located in neighboring Monroe County. The population was 18 at the 2010 Census. Most residents of the city were National Park Service employees. In the 2010 Primary Election, the Miami-Dade County Commission was empowered via a charter amendment to abolish Islandia. On December 6, 2011, Miami-Dade County Commissioners unanimously approved an ordinance to abolish the city, with final action to be taken after a public hearing.http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/08/25/1790925/voters- approve-2-charter-measures.html Following a public hearing, the ordinance abolishing Islandia received final approval on March 6, 2012, and took effect on March 16, 2012.Miami-Dade Legislative Item File Number: 112413 History Islandia, and in particular Elliott Key, was originally fished by the Native American Tequesta people. It subsequently became a haven for shipwreck survivors. By the mid-1800s, a group of Bahamians had made their way to the key, where they unsuccessfully tried farming on an island with a base of coral rock. By the early 1900s, Islandia had its own school district and more than 100 residents. However, the number of residents dwindled over time due to the lack of electricity, poor farming, and the relatively long distance from the mainland. In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board announced a plan to build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned a series of bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve, and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. When the Dade County Planning Board was unable to secure a right of way for the highway across the southern end of Key Biscayne, it dropped the plan. At the end of 1960, however, 13 of the island's 18 registered voters approved the incorporation of a municipality, and the 33 northernmost islands of the Florida Keys became the city of Islandia. Developers and the residents revived the plan to build a causeway across the bay, and sought to fill Elliott Key with luxury hotels, golf courses, oceanfront homes, and a six-lane roadway running down the center of the key. A grassroots opposition of fishermen, gardeners, and elected state leaders opposed the plan, and sought to include the islands in the national park system. Islandia mayor Luther Brooks and his small city council fought back, and at one point obtained a large bulldozer and cleared a wide swath down the center of Elliott Key as the beginning of the proposed six-lane Elliott Key Boulevard. Nevertheless, the purchase by the federal government of most of the land on Elliott Key ended those plans, and in 1968, Islandia was made a part of Biscayne National Monument (which later became Biscayne National Park). What remains today of the failed Elliott Key Boulevard is an wide nature trail covered by a tree canopy that is mockingly referred to as \\"Spite Highway.\\" By 1990, exasperated by decades of the city not filing papers or following municipal procedures, the state of Florida ruled all of Islandia's elections illegal on the grounds that only land owners, as opposed to all residents, had been permitted to vote, in violation of voting-rights laws. The state called for the dismantling of the municipality. In December 2011, the Miami-Dade County Commission finally agreed, and the area reverted to unincorporated status in March 2012 after the Commission gave final approval to the ordinance abolishing the City of Islandia.

In 1925, Carl Fischer constructed the Fulford- Miami Speedway in the present-day Sky Lake neighborhood. The wooden race track was then billed as the world's fastest. It was unfortunately destroyed by the devastating 1926 hurricane. One of the region's most notable features, Greynolds Park, was established in 1936 as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) 'New Deal' programs.Miami-Dade Parks, \\"Greynolds Park History.\\" The park was named after Mr. A.O. Greynolds, owner of the Ojus Rock Company, who donated 110 acres of his property in exchange for naming the park after him. Over the years, the park has expanded to include a golf course, a boathouse, and has even hosted popular musical acts during the 1960s such as the Grateful Dead. Greynolds Park was declared a historic site in 1983.

It is administered by the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements in technology, it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The system was adopted throughout the valley, and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States. Water-power was first introduced to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power to the process of producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills – sometimes developing a pre-existing community – with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site. A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce. Mills and workers' settlements were established at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright's competitors. Arkwright-type mills were so successful that sometimes they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright. The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline in the first quarter of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation to markets and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public. Location and coverage The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site covers an area of Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 13. and spans a stretch of the Derwent Valley, in Derbyshire, from Matlock Bath in the north to Derby city centre in the south. Within the site are mill complexes, settlements including workers' housing, weirs on the River Derwent, and the transport network that supported the mills in the valley.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 10. The site consists of the communities of Cromford, Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey, and includes 838 listed buildings, made up of 16 Grade I, 42 Grade II*, and 780 Grade II. A further nine structures are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. The buildings are a mixture of mills, workers' housing, and structures associated with the mill communities. The Cromford Canal and Cromford and High Peak Railway, which aided the industrialisation of the area, are also part of the World Heritage Site.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 32. History Lombe's silk mill In the late 17th century silk making expanded due to demand for silk as part of fashionable garments. In an attempt to increase production through the use of water power, Thomas Cotchett commissioned engineer George Sorocold to build a mill near the centre of Derby on an island in the River Derwent. Although the experiment was unsuccessful, it convinced John Lombe – an employee of Cotchett – that if water power could be perfected there was a market for its produce. He engaged in industrial espionage and gained plans of Italian machines. He patented the design in 1719 and built a five-storey mill next to Crotchett's mill. By 1763, 30 years after Lombe's patent had expired, only seven Lombe mills had been built because the silk market was small, but Lombe had introduced a viable form of water powered machinery and had established a template for organised labour that later industrialists would follow.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 93–94. Model of a water frame at the Historical Museum in Wuppertal As silk was a luxury good, the market was small and easily saturated by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 94. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors to make sure the machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96 spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 96. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 94–95. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 96–97. Arkwright sought financial assistance, and Peter Nightingale – a local landowner (and grand uncle of Florence Nightingale) – bought the Cromford Estate for £20,000 (£ as of ). Nightingale also built Rock House as a residence for Arkwright, overlooking the mill, and gave him a further £2,000 (£) to build the second mill and £1,750 (£) for workers' housing. Between 1777 and 1783, Arkwright and his family built mills at Bakewell, Cressbrook, Rocester, and Wirksworth, spread across Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Jedediah Strutt, who was Arkwright's partner in the first Cromford Mill, built mills at Belper and Milford in 1776–1881. Thomas Evans, a landowner in Darley Abbey, bought a further in the area around Darley Abbey at a cost of £1,140 (£) and in 1782 built a cotton mill in the village.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 106. Arkwright was paid royalties by those who had copied his machines, although some people risked prosecution by engaging in piracy. The construction of Masson Mill in Matlock Bath began in 1783, instigated by Arkwright.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 98. Contemporaneous with Arkwright's expansionism was the entry of Jedediah Strutt into the cotton spinning industry. Strutt had the advantage that Arkwright had already done all the necessary experimentation with machinery, so he did not have to invest in researching new technology. He established a mill at Belper, about south of Cromford; it was probably complete in 1781. The site was expanded with the addition of a second mill in 1784. Strutt also built a mill in Milford, about south of Belper. By 1793, two further mills were added for printing and bleaching. The Strutts estimated that by 1789 they had invested £37,000 (£) in theirs mills at Belper and Milford (£26,000 at Belper and £11,000 at Milford), and had a return of £36,000 (£) per year.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 101–102. Workers' cottages in Cromford Arkwright had a reputation as a paternalistic employer who was concerned for the well- being of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200 children.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 100. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the Willersley Estate. Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at Willersley Castle. The family's attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period. The foundations of the 1775 Cromford Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1890, with wheel chamber on the right. Richard Arkwright junior was uninterested in the cotton business, and after the death of his father the Arkwright family ceased to invest in the industry. The Strutt family continued to invest, fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper. They continued building mills into the 1810s, and by 1833 their business employed 2,000 people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 102–104. As Arkwright had done at Cromford, the Strutts provided housing for their employees. Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills, so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self-sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 103. The Strutts provided education, and in 1817 650 and 300 children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 105. Compared with Cromford, whose population had plateaued at around 1,200 in the early 19th century, the population of Belper rose from 4,500 in 1801 to 7,890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 100–104. Darley Abbey also expanded as a worker's settlement although it had no market place, so providing food for the inhabitants was problematic. The settlement doubled in size between 1788 and 1801, and between 1801 and 1831 the population increased from 615 to 1,170 with the addition of much worker's housing. A Sunday School for 80 children was established in one of the mills and a church and school were built in 1819 and 1826 respectively.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 110. Despite being a major power of the cotton industry in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 32, 102–103. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site. Transport =Cromford canal= Cromford Wharf, the terminus of the Cromford Canal The Erewash Canal, begun in 1777, was intended to primarily transport coal. It flowed from the River Trent in Sawley to Langley Mill, south of Cromford. In 1788, Richard Arkwright asked William Jessop to estimate the cost of building a canal connecting the mills at Cromford to Langley Mill. The figure Jessop came up with was £42,000 (£ as of ) which was raised within a couple of weeks. Local mill owners Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans opposed the proposed canal, fearing it would interfere with the water supply for their own mills, but in 1789 Parliament granted permission to construct the canal.Cooper (1983), p. 191. When the Cromford Canal was opened in 1794, it had cost nearly twice Jessop's original estimate. Between Langley Mill and Cromford Wharf, where the canal terminated in the mill complex, the canal crossed two aqueducts, traversed of tunnel beneath some ironworks at Bull Bridge, and fourteen locks. Three quarters of the cargo transported on the canal was coal and coke, while the rest consisted of gritstone, iron ore, and lead.Cooper (1983), p. 192. When the Derby and Nottingham Canals were completed by Jessop and Benjamin Outram in 1796, they provided direct routes to the important textile centres of Derby and Nottingham. In January 1845, the Cromford Canal Company decided to have a permanent pump built to provide enough water during dry conditions. This was made by Graham and Company at the Milton Iron Works, Elsecar. The canal was successful until the mid 19th century when the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway extended its line south of the canal. In 1852, the canal was sold to the railway company which accelerated its decline. By 1889 the canal was mostly used for local traffic. It was eventually closed in 1944 as the cost of maintaining and repairing the canal were too great. Derbyshire County Council acquired the canal in 1974 and the Cromford Canal Society undertook the task of restoring it.Cooper (1983), p. 193. =Cromford and High Peak Railway= Workshops and offices at High Peak Junction – the southern terminus and the junction with the former Midland Railway now the Derwent Valley Line In the early 19th century, a canal had been proposed to connect the Peak Forest Canal, which terminated at Whaley Bridge, with the Cromford Canal, providing a direct route between markets in Lancashire and Derbyshire. However, costs were prohibitive and the plan was abandoned. Josias Jessop, the son of William Jessop, believed that a wagonway would be much cheaper than a canal.Cooper (1983), pp. 199–200. On 2 May 1825 an Act of Parliament for the construction of a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed. The proposal – backed by William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, Richard Arkwright junior, and several Manchester bankers – was ambitious; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line, even though the technology was in its infancy and George Stephenson did not build his revolutionary Rocket until 1829. The south part of the railway, from Cromford Wharf to Hurdlow, south east of Buxton, opened on 29 May 1830, and on 6 July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge.Cooper (1983), p. 200. The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841; before that, the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons.Cooper (1983), p. 202. The railway ascended from above sea level at Cromford Wharf to a height of above sea level at Ladmanlow, before descending to at the wharves of the Peak Forest Canal. The changes in height, which would have necessitated many locks for a canal, was relatively easy for a railway. However, for a time the Comford and High Peak Railway did have the sharpest curve out of all railways in Britain and the steepest incline for vehicles without steam power.Cooper (1983), pp. 200, 202. The construction of the railway cost was £180,000, higher than the original estimate of £155,000 (£ and £ respectively as of ) but much lower than the £500,000 the canal was predicted to cost (£ as of ).Cooper (1983), pp. 200, 203. Having been built to connect the Peak Forest and Cromford Canals, the railways fortunes were closely tied with those of the canals. The line was not profitable as by the time it had opened traffic had declined along the Cromford Canal.Cooper (1983), pp. 203, 205. In 1855, an Act of Parliament allowed the line to transport passengers as well as freight.Cooper (1983), p. 203. Although passenger travel became more important to the railway, it went into decline and closed on 21 April 1967.Cooper (1983), p. 206 Legacy Slater Mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, incorporated many elements of the factory system developed in the Derwent Valley, and was built by Samuel Slater from Belper. The Derwent Valley is considered the birthplace of the factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted out of a sense of paternalism.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 27. Arkwright's innovations were not confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200 Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 28. New Lanark in Scotland – also a World Heritage Site – was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark was identified as a potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and at least two of the mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 29. Saltaire – another World Heritage Site – was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 30. In 1774, the British government passed an act outlawing the export of \\"tools or utensils\\" used in the cotton and linen industries. As a result, the only way for the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through industrial espionage. Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright's inventions to Johann Gottfried Brugelmann; Brugelmann used the information to establish a mill in Ratingen, near Düsseldorf, which began production in 1784. He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford. The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe. The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America. In 1790, the United States had fewer than 2,000 spindles which were powered by spinning jennys, compared to 2.4 million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time. The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by migrants from England, many of whom were unskilled. Among them was Samuel Slater who was from the Derwent ValleyDerwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), pp. 30–31. and an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt.Mason (2004) He founded Slater Mill.Conrad Jr (1995), p. 1. Many of the technologies developed in the Derwent Valley Mills endured and were adopted for other textile industries; until the mid-20th century, carding was still performed with machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. The factory system made it possible to produce cheap textiles and clothing. Preservation Cromford Mill was purchased by The Arkwright Society in 1979 after the site was abandoned by its previous owners, a dyes and paints company. Out of the Arkwright Festival held in 1971, The Arkwright Society was formed.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 134. The Cromford Mill complex was bought by The Arkwright Society in 1979, saving the buildings associated with the mill from demolition. The charity purchased the site for the purpose of conservation and with the intention of beginning restoration. The mills had been contaminated by industrial processes involving pigments and dyes which were stored in the mills after they stopped processing cotton. With the help of local councils, the East Midlands Development Agency, English Heritage, the Heritage Lottery Fund, and at the cost of £5 million, the mills were restored and decontaminated. Now Cromford Mill is now used by small businesses and used for education. Many of the mills built in the Derwent Valley for the cotton industry survive and were reused after the decline of the industry. Some have been reused. Most of the worker's housing survives and are still in used as homes. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, local authorities in partnership with English Heritage attempted to prevent the deterioration of the houses and mills by giving advice to owners and using grants to undertake conservation work. When the application for World Heritage Site status was made in 2000, 26 of the 838 listed buildings in the area were on English Heritage's At Risk Register and were in a state of disrepair. In 2000, the Derwent Valley Mills were nominated to become a World Heritage Site. Along with Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, New Lanark, and Saltaire (all now World Heritage Sites), the site was proposed to increase the representation of industrial archaeology on the list of World Heritage Sites.Derwent Valley Mills Partnership (2000), p. 3. The proposal was successful and in 2001 the Derwent Valley Mills were designated a World Heritage Site. Its status as a World Heritage Site is intended to ensure its protection; all such sites are considered to be of \\"outstanding value to humanity\\". The site was listed under the second and fourth Heritage Site selection criteria. The Derwent Valley Mills pioneered worker's housing as well as much technology developed by Richard Arkwright, producing an industrial landscape and heralding industrial towns. The Derwent Valley Mills Partnership is responsible, on behalf of the British government, for the management of the site. In June 2009, Bath Street Mill in Derby was damaged by fire. The building was part of the World Heritage Site and dated from the 18th century. In 2018, the \\"Cromford Mills Creative Cluster and World Heritage Site Gateway Project\\" was listed as a finalist for the \\"Best Major Regeneration of a Historic Building or Place\\" in the Historic England Angel Awards.The Cromford Mills Creative Cluster and World Heritage Site Gateway Project, Derbyshire In 2019, the Arkwright Society employed 100 persons at the Cromford Mills siteAbout Us; the restoration expenditure by that time was £48 million.Inside the £130m ‘conservation challenge of the century =Museums= * Richard Arkwright's Masson Mill is now a working textile museum with the largest collection of bobbins in the world. * Leawood Pumphouse is now a working museum which still does the original job of pumping water from the Derwent to Cromford Canal, Open on selected weekends. * At Belper, while much of the site has been converted to other business uses, the Belper North Mill building houses the Derwent Valley Visitor Centre.

History At the beginning of World War II, the United States Navy purchased of land in southwestern Dade (now called Miami-Dade) County, Florida for the purpose of constructing an airship base. The land was owned by the Richmond Timber Company, a major supplier of Dade County Pine (a denser, harder, sub- species of Pinus Palustris, or Long Leaf Pine). The base was named Naval Air Station Richmond, after the lumber company and was home to the 25 ships of ZP-21(Patrol, Airship Squadron 21 and Airship Wing 2). NAS RICHMOND was the second largest airship base in the United States, NAS LAKEHURST being the largest. NAS RICHMOND was destroyed by a hurricane and fire in September 1945. After the end of World War II, Captain Frank C. Martin, a Pan American pilot, purchased farm land adjacent to the base in rural southwest Dade County. With this purchase he created Richmond Heights, as a new community for returning African American Veterans. Of the original he purchased in 1949, the Federal Government used eight hundred acres to build the headquarters of Naval Air Station Richmond, a blimp base constructed in the early months of World War II Richmond, and was eventually home to 25 K-series blimps, three hangars, and 3,000 men. The hangars were 16 stories tall, built of Douglas fir brought in by train. The blimps protected ship convoys in the Florida Straits, and Richmond was the headquarters for the fight against U-boats operating in the Caribbean.

History Before the early 1950s, Shelter Key (on which most of Key Colony Beach is located) was a low-lying island. Then, Phil Sadowski began dredging around the island, adding to its size and increasing its height to above mean sea level, and later built developments on the island. Around 1956–1957, residents of nearby Marathon began discussing incorporating the entire area. Sadowski was not keen on having his development swallowed up into Marathon, so he began the process of incorporating the island into its own city. The Florida Legislature passed legislation in June 1957 allowing incorporation, which local residents passed unanimously in September, thus creating today's Key Colony Beach. Incorporation became a blessing in 1960, when much of the city was destroyed by Hurricane Donna. As a separately incorporated city, Key Colony Beach received its own federal grant to rebuild; nearby Marathon (not yet incorporated) had to settle for a portion of the grant given to Monroe County. However, the storm (and then the takeover of Cuba by Fidel Castro) depressed real estate prices, and it took several years to for prices to stabilize.Historical Notes on Key Colony Beach Geographical layout Key Colony Beach is reached over the Sadowski Causeway, which connects Key Colony Beach to Marathon, on the east side of the city. It lies directly south of the City of Marathon, spanning a narrow cut. Along the causeway are some charter fishing boats and a dockside restaurant called Sparky's Landing. At the base of the causeway, West Ocean Drive branches off first to the right and East Ocean Drive soon after branches to the left. On West Ocean Drive is the police station, along with the post office and town hall. In the same vicinity is a small park with a fountain and a gazebo. The entire ocean-facing side of West Ocean Drive is lined by various condominium complexes, while the side facing Marathon houses the Key Colony Inn and a par 3 golf course. Starting at the far end of East Ocean Drive, streets are numbered one to fifteen east to west, and run from south to north toward Shelter Bay. The most notable buildings along East Ocean Drive are the Key Colony Beach Motel and the Key Colony Beach Club. At the tip of West Ocean Drive is Sunset Park, the place closest to where a woman was fatally struck by a spotted eagle ray. Many news reports were recorded from this park overlooking the shallows where the Vaca Cut meets the Atlantic Ocean.

The population was 10,433 at the 2010 census. The name comes from the Spanish Cayo Largo, or \\"long key\\". It is both the first island and town of the Florida Keys to be reached from the Overseas Highway to Key West. It was also the location of one of the stations of the Overseas Railroad. Geography Key Largo is located at (25.106637, -80.429917). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 39.6 km2 (15.3 mi2), of which 31.5 km2 (12.2 mi2) is land and 8.1 km2 (3.1 mi2) 20.54% is water. A southeast-pointing cape on the north end of El Radabob Key, , just south of Rattlesnake Key, is the east endpoint of the longest distance between any two points of land within the fifty states of the United States, as measured via Google Earth. The other endpoint is at the tip of a spit of sand on Green Island, Hawaii, 5,857.46 miles away. Key Largo is also the location of the first undersea park in the United States, established in 1963, and called the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park (located at Mile Marker 102). The park is primarily offshore and stretches three miles into the Atlantic Ocean and is 25 miles long. Adjacent to this is the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary covering 178 square nautical miles. Both areas were designed to protect marine life, including the extensive coral reefs in the area.

Together with all or parts of the separate islands of Dredgers Key, Fleming Key, Sunset Key, and the northern part of Stock Island, it constitutes the City of Key West. The Island of Key West is about long and wide, with a total land area of . It lies at the southernmost end of U.S. Route 1, the longest north–south road in the United States. Key West is about north of Cuba at their closest points. It is also southwest of Miami by air, about by road, and north-northeast of Havana. The City of Key West is the county seat of Monroe County, which includes all of the Florida Keys and part of the Everglades. The total land area of the city is . The official city motto is \\"One Human Family\\". Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States and the westernmost island connected by highway in the Florida Keys. Duval Street, its main street, is in length in its 14-block-long crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the Straits of Florida and the Atlantic Ocean. Key West is the southern terminus of U.S. Route 1, State Road A1A, the East Coast Greenway and, before 1935, the Florida East Coast Railway. Key West is a port of call for many passenger cruise ships. The Key West International Airport provides airline service. Naval Air Station Key West is an important year- round training site for naval aviation due to the tropical weather, which is also the reason Key West was chosen as the site of President Harry S. Truman's Winter White House. The central business district is located along Duval Street and includes much of the northwestern corner of the island. History =Precolonial and colonial times= At various times before the 19th century, people who were related or subject to the Calusa and the Tequesta inhabited Key West. The last Native American residents of Key West were Calusa refugees who were taken to Cuba when Florida was transferred from Spain to Great Britain in 1763. Cayo Hueso () is the original Spanish name for the island of Key West. Spanish-speaking people today also use the term when referring to Key West. It literally means \\"bone cay\\", cay referring to a low island or reef. It is said that the island was littered with the remains (bones) of prior native inhabitants, who used the isle as a communal graveyard. This island was the westernmost Key with a reliable supply of water.Windhorn, Stan & Langley, Wright 1973. Yesterday's Key West Between 1763, when Great Britain took control of Florida from Spain, and 1821, when the United States took possession of Florida from Spain, there were few or no permanent inhabitants anywhere in the Florida Keys. Cubans and Bahamians regularly visited the Keys, the Cubans primarily to fish, while the Bahamians fished, caught turtles, cut hardwood timber, and salvaged wrecks. Smugglers and privateers also used the Keys for concealment. In 1766 the British governor of East Florida recommended that a post be set up on Key West to improve control of the area, but nothing came of it. During both the British and Spanish periods no nation exercised de facto control. The Bahamians apparently set up camps in the Keys that were occupied for months at a time, and there were rumors of permanent settlements in the Keys by 1806 or 1807, but the locations are not known. Fishermen from New England started visiting the Keys after the end of the War of 1812, and may have briefly settled on Key Vaca in 1818. =Ownership claims= In 1815, the Spanish governor of Cuba in Havana deeded the island of Key West to Juan Pablo Salas, an officer of the Royal Spanish Navy Artillery posted in Saint Augustine, Florida. After Florida was transferred to the United States in 1821, Salas was so eager to sell the island that he sold it twice – first for a sloop valued at $575 to a General John Geddes, a former governor of South Carolina, and then to a U.S. businessman John W. Simonton, during a meeting in a Havana café on January 19, 1822, for the equivalent of $2,000 in pesos in 1821. Geddes tried in vain to secure his rights to the property before Simonton who, with the aid of some influential friends in Washington, was able to gain clear title to the island. Simonton had wide-ranging business interests in Mobile, Alabama. He bought the island because a friend, John Whitehead, had drawn his attention to the opportunities presented by the island's strategic location. John Whitehead had been stranded in Key West after a shipwreck in 1819 and he had been impressed by the potential offered by the deep harbor of the island. The island was indeed considered the \\"Gibraltar of the West\\" because of its strategic location on the –wide deep shipping lane, the Straits of Florida, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. On March 25, 1822, Lt. Commander Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, claiming the Keys as United States property. No protests were made over the American claim on Key West, so the Florida Keys became the property of the United States. After claiming the Florida Keys for the United States, Perry renamed Cayo Hueso (Key West) to Thompson's Island for Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson, and the harbor Port Rodgers in honor of War of 1812 hero and President of the Navy Supervisors Board John Rodgers. In 1823, Commodore David Porter of the United States Navy West Indies Anti-Pirate Squadron took charge of Key West, which he ruled (but, according to some, exceeding his authority) as military dictator under martial law. The United States Navy gave Porter the mission of countering piracy and the slave trade in the Key West area. =First developers= Soon after his purchase, John Simonton subdivided the island into plots and sold three undivided quarters of each plot to: * John Mountain and U.S. Consul John Warner, who quickly resold their quarter to Pardon C. Greene, who took up residence on the island. Greene is the only one of the four \\"founding fathers\\" to establish himself permanently on the island, where he became quite prominent as head of P.C. Greene and Company. He was a member of the city council and also served briefly as mayor. He died in 1838 at the age of 57. * John Whitehead, his friend who had advised him to buy Key West. John Whitehead lived in Key West for only eight years. He became a partner in the firm of P.C. Greene and Company from 1824 to 1827. A lifelong bachelor, he left the island for good in 1832. He came back only once, during the Civil War in 1861, and died the next year. * John Fleeming (nowadays spelled Fleming). John W.C. Fleeming was English-born and was active in mercantile business in Mobile, Alabama, where he befriended John Simonton. Fleeming spent only a few months in Key West in 1822 and left for Massachusetts, where he married. He returned to Key West in 1832 with the intention of developing salt manufacturing on the island but died the same year at the age of 51. Simonton spent the winter in Key West and the summer in Washington, where he lobbied hard for the development of the island and to establish a naval base on the island, both to take advantage of the island's strategic location and to bring law and order to the town. He died in 1854. The names of the four \\"founding fathers\\" of modern Key West were given to main arteries of the island when it was first platted in 1829 by William Adee Whitehead, John Whitehead's younger brother. That first plat and the names used remained mostly intact and are still in use today. Duval Street, the island's main street, is named after Florida's first territorial governor, who served between 1822 and 1834 as the longest-serving governor in Florida's U.S. history. William Whitehead became chief editorial writer for the \\"Enquirer\\", a local newspaper, in 1834. He preserved copies of his newspaper as well as copies from the \\"Key West Gazette\\", its predecessor. He later sent those copies to the Monroe County clerk for preservation, which gives us a view of life in Key West in the early days (1820–1840). In the 1830s, Key West was the richest city per capita in the United States. In 1852 the first Catholic Church, St. Mary's Star-Of-The- Sea was built. The year 1864 became a landmark for the church in South Florida when five Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary arrived from Montreal, Canada, and established the first Catholic school in South Florida. At the time it was called Convent of Mary Immaculate. The school is still operating today and is now known as Mary Immaculate Star of the Sea School. Key West, ca. 1856 =American Civil War and late 19th century= Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West, active during the Civil War, contains the largest collection of Civil War cannons ever discovered at a single location. During the American Civil War, while Florida seceded and joined the Confederate States of America, Key West remained in U.S. Union hands because of the naval base. Most locals were sympathetic to the Confederacy, however, and many flew Confederate flags over their homes.A Chronological History of Key West A Tropical Island City, Stephen Nichols, 3rd ed. Fort Zachary Taylor, constructed from 1845 to 1866, was an important Key West outpost during the Civil War. Construction began in 1861 on two other forts, East and West Martello Towers, which served as side armories and batteries for the larger fort. When completed, they were connected to Fort Taylor by railroad tracks for movement of munitions. Fort Jefferson, located about from Key West on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas, served after the Civil War as the prison for Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, convicted of conspiracy for setting the broken leg of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln. In the 19th century, major industries included wrecking, fishing, turtling, and salt manufacturing.June Keith, June Keith's Key West & The Florida Keys: A Guide to the Coral Islands (5th ed.: Palm Island Press, 2014), p. 8. From 1830 to 1861, Key West was a major center of U.S. salt production, harvesting the commodity from the sea (via receding tidal pools) rather than from salt mines. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Union troops shut down the salt industry after Confederate sympathizers smuggled the product into the South. Salt production resumed at the end of the war, but the industry was destroyed by an 1876 hurricane and never recovered, in part because of new salt mines on the mainland. During the Ten Years' War (an unsuccessful Cuban war for independence in the 1860s and 1870s), many Cubans sought refuge in Key West. A fire on April 1, 1886 that started at a coffee shop next to the San Carlos Institute and spread out of control, destroyed 18 cigar factories and 614 houses and government warehouses. By 1889, Key West was the largest and wealthiest city in Florida. The sailed from Key West on her fateful visit to Havana, where she blew up and sank in Havana Harbor, igniting the Spanish–American War. Crewmen from the ship are buried in Key West, and the Navy investigation into the blast occurred at the Key West Customs House. =20th century= The railway yard and station on Trumbo Point in Key West, circa 1930 Key West was relatively isolated until 1912, when it was connected to the Florida mainland via the Overseas Railway extension of Henry M. Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway (FEC). Flagler created a landfill at Trumbo Point for his railyards. The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the railroad and killed hundreds of residents, including around 400 World War I veterans who were living in camps and working on federal road and mosquito-control projects in the Middle Keys. The FEC could not afford to restore the railroad. The U.S. government then rebuilt the rail route as an automobile highway, completed in 1938, built atop many of the footings of the railroad. It became an extension of U.S. Route 1. The portion of U.S. 1 through the Keys is called the Overseas Highway. Franklin Roosevelt toured the road in 1939. Pan American Airlines was founded in Key West, originally to fly visitors to Havana, in 1926. The airline contracted with the United States Postal Service in 1927 to deliver mail to and from Cuba and the United States. The mail route was known as the Key West, Florida – Havana Mail Route. John F. Kennedy was to use \\"90 miles from Cuba\\" extensively in his speeches against Fidel Castro. Kennedy himself visited Key West a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Prior to the Cuban revolution of 1959, there were regular ferry and airplane services between Key West and Havana. In 1982, the city of Key West briefly asserted independence as the Conch Republic as a protest over a United States Border Patrol blockade. This blockade was set up on US 1, where the northern end of the Overseas Highway meets the mainland at Florida City. A traffic jam of ensued while the Border Patrol stopped every car leaving the Keys, supposedly searching for illegal immigrants attempting to enter the mainland United States. This paralyzed the Florida Keys, which rely heavily on the tourism industry. Flags, T-shirts and other merchandise representing the Conch Republic are still popular souvenirs for visitors to Key West, and the Conch Republic Independence Celebration– including parades and parties –is celebrated annually, on April 23. In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused substantial damage with wind and flooding, killing three people. Geography Key West is an island located at in the Straits of Florida. The island is about long and wide, with a total land area of . The average elevation above sea level is about and the maximum elevation is about , within a area known as Solares Hill. The city of Key West is the southernmost city in the contiguous United States, and the island is the westernmost island connected by highway in the Florida Keys. The city boundaries include the island of Key West and several nearby islands, as well as the section of Stock Island north of U.S. Route 1, on the adjacent key to the east. The total land area of the city is . Sigsbee Parkoriginally known as Dredgers Keyand Fleming Key, both located to the north, and Sunset Key located to the west are all included in the city boundaries. Both Fleming Key and Sigsbee Park are part of Naval Air Station Key West and are inaccessible to the general public. In the late 1950s, many of the large salt ponds on the eastern side of the island were filled in. The new section on the eastern side is called New Town, which contains shopping centers, retail malls, residential areas, schools, ball parks, and Key West International Airport. Key West and most of the rest of the Florida Keys are on the dividing line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The two bodies have different currents, with the calmer and warmer Gulf of Mexico being characterized by great clumps of seagrass. The area where the two bodies merge between Key West and Cuba is called the Straits of Florida. The warmest ocean waters anywhere on the United States mainland are found in the Florida Keys in winter, with sea surface temperatures averaging in the range in December through February. Duval Street, its main street, is in length in its 14-block-long crossing from the Gulf of Mexico to the Straits of Florida and the Atlantic Ocean. Key West is closer to Havana (about by air or sea) than it is to Miami ( by air or by road). Key West is the usual endpoint for marathon swims from Cuba, including Diana Nyad's 2013 record-setting swim as the first completed without a shark cage or fins\\"First person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage or fins\\".

The Key West Historic District includes the major tourist destinations of the island, including Mallory Square, Duval Street, the Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor. Old Town is where the classic bungalows and guest mansions are found. Bahama Village, southwest of Whitehead Street, features houses, churches, and sites related to its Afro-Bahamian history. The Meadows, lying northeast of the White Street Gallery District, is exclusively residential. Generally, the structures date from 1886 to 1912. The basic features that distinguish the local architecture include wood-frame construction of one- to two-and-a-half-story structures set on foundation piers about above the ground. Exterior characteristics of the buildings are peaked metal roofs, horizontal wood siding, gingerbread trim, pastel shades of paint, side-hinged louvered shutters, covered porches (or balconies, galleries, or verandas) along the fronts of the structures, and wood lattice screens covering the area elevated by the piers. Some antebellum structures survive, including the Oldest (or Cussans-Watlington) House (1829–1836) and the John Huling Geiger House (1846–1849), now preserved as the Audubon House and Tropical Gardens. Fortifications such as Fort Zachary Taylor, the East Martello Tower, and the West Martello Tower, helped ensure that Key West would remain in Union control throughout the Civil War. Another landmark built by the federal government is the Key West Lighthouse, now a museum. Two of the most notable buildings in Old Town, occupied by prominent twentieth-century residents, are the Ernest Hemingway House, where the writer lived from 1931 to 1939, and the Harry S. Truman Little White House, where the president spent 175 days of his time in office. Additionally, the residences of some historical Key West families are recognized on the National Register of Historic Places as important landmarks of history and culture, including the Porter House on Caroline Street\\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form for Dr. Joseph Y.

Southernmost point in the United States One of the most popular attractions on the island is a concrete replica of a buoy at the corner of South and Whitehead Streets that claims to be the southernmost point in the contiguous United States. The point was originally marked with a basic sign. The city of Key West erected the current monument in 1983.Key West History The monument was repainted after damage by Hurricane Irma in 2017, and is the most often photographed tourist site in the Florida Keys. Southernmost point monument in Key West The monument is labeled \\"Southernmost point continental U.S.A.\\", though Whitehead Spit is the actual southernmost point of Key West, on the Truman Annex property just west of the buoy. The spit has no marker since it is on U.S. Navy land that cannot be entered by civilian tourists. The private property directly to the east of the buoy, and the beach areas of Truman Annex and Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park, also lie farther south than the buoy. The southernmost point of the contiguous United States is Ballast Key, a privately owned island just south and west of Key West. The southernmost location that the public can visit is the beach at Fort Zachary Taylor park. The monument states \\"90 Miles to Cuba\\", though Key West and Cuba are about , apart at their closest points. The distance from the monument to Havana is about . Key West Library The first public library was officially established in 1853, which was housed in the then-Masonic Temple on Simonston Street, near where the federal courthouse is today. At the time, the first library president was James Lock, with the librarian being William Delaney. At the time, the library collected held 1,200 volumes for residents to access. In 1919, a hurricane destroyed the library. Key West residents moved the library to various locations across the island. The county took over and finally found a permanent location. The library's new location was found in 1959. It was built on Fleming Street, where it is still found today. At this time, there was also a book mobile service, which served the entire Keys. The Key West Library has an ever expanding collection of 70,000 items. One of these includes a letter from singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffet. Dated from October 22, 1984, the letter expresses gratitude for the library in giving inspiration for the songs he would eventually write, and for the air conditioning. =Notable residences= Little White House Little White House Several U.S. presidents have visited Key West with the first being Ulysses S. Grant in 1880, followed by Grover Cleveland in 1889, and William Howard Taft in 1912. Taft was the first president to use the first officer's quarters that would later be known as the Little White House. Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the Florida Keys many times, beginning in 1917. Harry S. Truman visited Key West for a total of 175 days on 11 visits during his presidency and visited five times after he left office. His first visit was in 1946.\\"Truman Little White House Truman Key West visits\\". trumanlittlewhitehouse.com. Truman Little White House. Retrieved December 2, 2018. The Little White House and Truman Annex take their names from his frequent and well-documented visits. The residence is also known as the Winter White House as Truman stayed there mostly in the winter months, and used it for official business such as the Truman Doctrine.\\"Truman Little White House Media center\\". trumanlittlewhitehouse.com. Truman Little White House. Retrieved December 2, 2018. Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed at the Little White House following a heart attack in 1955. John F. Kennedy visited Key West in March 1961, and in November 1962, a month after the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Jimmy Carter visited the Little White House twice with his family after he had left office, in 1996 and 2007. Ernest Hemingway house The Ernest Hemingway House Legend has it that Ernest Hemingway wrote part of A Farewell to Arms while living above the showroom of a Key West Ford dealership at 314 Simonton Street while awaiting delivery of a Ford Model A roadster purchased by the uncle of his wife Pauline in 1928. Hardware store owner Charles Thompson introduced him to deep-sea fishing. Among the group who went fishing was Joe Russell (also known as Sloppy Joe). Russell was reportedly the model for Freddy in To Have and Have Not. Portions of the original manuscript were found at Sloppy Joe's Bar after his death. The group had nicknames for each other, and Hemingway wound up with \\"Papa\\". Pauline's rich uncle Gus Pfeiffer bought the 907 Whitehead Street house in 1931 as a wedding present. The Hemingways installed a swimming pool for $20,000 in 1937–38 (equivalent to about $ in ). The unexpectedly high cost prompted Hemingway to put a penny in the wet cement of the patio, saying, \\"Here, take the last penny I've got!\\" The penny is at the north end of the pool.\\"Hemingway – The Legend\\". hemingwayhome.com. Hemingway Home. Retrieved December 2, 2018. During his stay he wrote or worked on Death in the Afternoon, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, and The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber. He used Depression-era Key West as one of the locations in To Have and Have Not—his only novel with scenes that occur in the United States. A polydactyl cat with seven toes at Hemingway's house The six- or seven-toed polydactyl cats descended from Hemingway's original pet \\"Snowball\\" still live on the grounds and are cared for at the Hemingway House, despite complaints by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that they are not kept free from visitor contact. The Key West City Commission has exempted the house from a law prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household. Pauline and Hemingway divorced in 1939; Hemingway only occasionally visited when returning from Havana until his suicide in 1961. Tennessee Williams house Tennessee Williams first became a regular visitor to Key West in 1941 and is said to have written the first draft of A Streetcar Named Desire while staying in 1947 at the La Concha Hotel. He bought a permanent house in 1949 and listed Key West as his primary residence until his death in 1983. In contrast to Hemingway's grand house in Old Town, the Williams home at 1431 Duncan Street in the \\"unfashionable\\" New Town neighborhood is a very modest bungalow. The house is privately owned and not open to the public. The Academy Award-winning film version of his play The Rose Tattoo was shot on the island in 1956. The Tennessee Williams Theatre is located on the campus of Florida Keys Community College on Stock Island. Even though Hemingway and Williams lived in Key West at the same time, they reportedly met only once—at Hemingway's home in Cuba, Finca Vigía. =Port of Key West= A cruise ship docked at the Navy Mole pier in Key West The first cruise ship was the Sunward in 1969, which docked at the Navy's pier in the Truman Annex or the privately owned Pier B. The Navy's pier is called the Navy Mole. In 1984, the city opened a pier right on Mallory Square. The decision was met with considerable opposition from people who felt it would disrupt the tradition of watching the sunset at Mallory Square. Cruise ships now dock at all three piers. Cruise Ship Statistics for 1994:A Chronological History of Key West: A Tropical Island City, Stephen Nichols * Number of visits: 368 * Passenger count: 398,370 * City revenues from docking charges: $852,887 In present times, several cruise ships dock on a regular basis at Key West, including the Royal Caribbean ship Majesty of the Seas and the Carnival Fascination, both of which visit weekly. In the last several years, however, larger cruise ships have increasingly bypassed Key West due to the narrowness of the island's main ship channel. On October 1, 2013, 74% of resident voters opposed a referendum that would have allowed the City Commission to request a feasibility study from the Army Corps of Engineers for a $36 million project to dredge a wider channel. Economic benefits from visiting cruise ship passengers are substantial but not attractive to all Key West citizens as the daily presence of thousands of tourists from cruise ships affects the character of the city, resulting in operation of facilities that cater to mass tourism rather than to an upscale clientele. There are also environmental issues as Key West is surrounded by coral habitat. Concerns over environmental protection were considered a prominent factor in the failure of the 2013 referendum. , there were 859,409 passengers annually.City of Key West Port Operations Office Climate Palm trees along a street in the Truman Annex Key West has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen Aw, similar to the Caribbean islands). Like most tropical climates, Key West has only a small difference in monthly mean temperatures between the coolest month (January) and the warmest month (July)with the annual range of monthly mean temperatures around . According to the National Weather Service, the Florida Keys and Miami Beach are the only places within the contiguous United States to have never recorded a frost or freeze. The lowest recorded temperature in Key West is on January 12, 1886, and January 13, 1981. Key West is located in USDA zone 11b (the warmest zone in the contiguous United States). According to the National Weather Service in Key West, low temperatures below 50 F (10 C) occur on average four times per decade. Prevailing easterly tradewinds and sea breezes suppress the usual summertime heating, with temperatures rarely reaching . There are 55 days per year with or greater highs, with the average window for such readings June 10 through September 22, shorter than almost the entire southeastern U.S. Low temperatures often remain above , however. The all-time record high temperature is on July 19, 1880, and August 29, 1956. =Wet and dry seasons= Like most tropical climates, Key West has a two-season wet and dry climate. The period from November through April is normally sunny and quite dry, with only 25 percent of the annual rainfall occurring. May through October is normally the wet season. During the wet season some rain falls on most days, often as brief, but heavy tropical downpours, followed by intense sun. Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon. Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent hurricanes may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts. On average, rainfall markedly peaks between August and October; the single wettest month in Key West is September, when the threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) is greatest. Key West is the driest city in Florida, averaging just under 40 inches of rain per year. This is driven primarily by Key West's relative dryness in May, June and July. In mainland Florida peninsular areas like Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Fort Myers, June and July average monthly rainfalls typically reach 7 to 10 inches, while Key West has only half such amounts over the same period. =Hurricanes= Flooding caused by Hurricane Wilma on Key Haven, island suburb of the City of Key West on Raccoon Key (October 24, 2005) Key West, like the rest of the Florida Keys, is vulnerable to hurricanes. In recent history, the island has been relatively unaffected by major storms. The most recent hurricane to impact Key West was Hurricane Irma, which made landfall in the Keys in the morning of September 10, 2017 as a Category 4 storm. Some locals maintain that Hurricane Wilma on October 24, 2005, was the worst storm in memory. The entire island was told to evacuate and business owners were forced to shut their doors. After the hurricane had passed, the resulting storm surge sent of water inland completely inundating a large portion of the lower Keys. Low-lying areas of Key West and the lower Keys, including major tourist destinations, were under as much as of water. Sixty percent of the homes in Key West were flooded.Key West Citizen \\"New commissioners' trial by wind and flood\\" October 27, 2005 The higher parts of Old Town, such as the Solares Hill and cemetery areas, did not flood, because of their higher elevations of .Key West Citizen October 25, 2005, pp 1-2, 6 The surge destroyed tens of thousands of cars throughout the lower Keys, and many houses were flooded with of sea water.

The storm destroyed the piers at the clothing-optional Atlantic Shores Motel and breached the shark tank at the Key West Aquarium, freeing its sharks. Damage postponed the island's famous Halloween Fantasy Fest until the following December. MTV's The Real World: Key West was filming during the hurricane and deals with the storm. In September 2005, NOAA opened its National Weather Forecasting building on White Street. The building is designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane and its storm surge. The most intense previous hurricane was Hurricane Georges, a Category 2, in September 1998. The storm damaged many of the houseboats along \\"Houseboat Row\\" on South Roosevelt Boulevard near Cow Key channel on the east side of the island. {style=\\"width:100%;text- align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\\" class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible\\" - !Colspan=14Climate data for Key West - !Month !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec !style=\\"border-left-width:medium\\"Year - !Average sea temperature °F (°C) style=\\"background:#FFA000;color:#000000;\\"71.2 (21.8) style=\\"background:#FFA000;color:#000000;\\"71.2 (21.8) style=\\"background:#FF8B00;color:#000000;\\"73.2 (22.9) style=\\"background:#FF5A00;color:#000000;\\"77.7 (25.4) style=\\"background:#FF3A00;color:#FFFFFF;\\"80.6 (27.0) style=\\"background:#FF1D00;color:#FFFFFF;\\"83.3 (28.5) style=\\"background:#FF0500;color:#FFFFFF;\\"85.5 (29.7) style=\\"background:#FA0000;color:#FFFFFF;\\"86.9 (30.5) style=\\"background:#FF0500;color:#FFFFFF;\\"85.5 (29.7) style=\\"background:#FF2300;color:#FFFFFF;\\"82.8 (28.2) style=\\"background:#FF5200;color:#000000;\\"78.4 (25.8) style=\\"background:#FF7D00;color:#000000;\\"74.5 (23.6) style=\\"background:#FF4900;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"79.2 (26.2) - !Mean daily daylight hours style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\\"12.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\\"13.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\\"13.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\\"14.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\\"13.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\\"13.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\\"12.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\\"12.0 style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\\"11.0 style=\\"background:#FFFF35;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"12.2 - !Average Ultraviolet index style=\\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\\"6 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"8 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"10 style=\\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 style=\\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 style=\\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 style=\\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 style=\\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\\"11 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"10 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\\"9 style=\\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\\"7 style=\\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\\"6 style=\\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\\"9.3 - !Colspan=14 style=\\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font- size:95%;\\"Source: Weather Atlas } Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 25,478 people, 11,016 households, and 5,463 families residing in Key West.

Many were sons and daughters of Loyalists who fled to the nearest Crown soil during the American Revolution.Windhorn, Stan & Langley, Wright Yesterday's Key West p.13 In the 20th century many residents of Key West started referring to themselves as Conchs, and the term is now generally applied to all residents of Key West. Some residents use the term \\"Conch\\" (or, alternatively, \\"Saltwater Conch\\") to refer to a person born in Key West, while the term \\"Freshwater Conch\\" refers to a resident not born in Key West but who has lived in Key West for seven years or more.The key to restoring conchs – URL September 21, 2006 The true original meaning of Conch applies only to someone with European ancestry who immigrated from the Bahamas, however. It is said that when a baby was born, the family would put a conch shell on a pole in front of their home. Many of the black Bahamian immigrants who arrived later lived in Bahama Village, an area of Old Town next to the Truman Annex. =Cuban presence= A typical Cuban sandwich available in many cafés and restaurants in Key West Key West is closer to Havana () than it is to Miami (). In 1890, Key West had a population of nearly 18,800 and was the biggest and richest city in Florida. Half the residents were said to be of Cuban origin, and Key West regularly had Cuban mayors, including the son of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, father of the Cuban Republic, who was elected mayor in 1876. Cubans were actively involved in reportedly 200 factories in town, producing 100 million cigars annually. José Martí made several visits to seek recruits for Cuban independence starting in 1891 and founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party during his visits to Key West. Key West was flooded with refugees during the Mariel Boatlift. Refugees continue to come ashore and, on at least one occasion, most notably in April 2003, flew hijacked Cuban Airlines planes into the city's airport. Government and politics Key West Government is governed via the mayor- council system. The city council is known as the city commission. It consists of six members each elected from individual districts. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote. =Mayors= Mayors of Key West have reflected the city's cultural and ethnic heritage. Among its mayors are the first Cuban mayor and one of the first openly gay mayors. One mayor is also famous for having water- skied to Cuba. Military presence NAS Key West, Boca Chica and the Truman Annex have been the home of U.S. ships, submarines, Pegasus-class hydrofoils and Fighter Training Squadrons like the VF101 detachment. NAS Key West is still a training facility for top gun pilots. Key West has had a military presence since 1823, shortly after its purchase by Simonton in 1822. John W. Simonton lobbied the U.S. government to establish a naval base on Key West, both to take advantage of its strategic location and to bring law and order to the Key West town. On March 25, 1822, naval officer Matthew C. Perry sailed the schooner Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag claiming the Keys as United States property. In 1823 A naval base was established to protect shipping merchants in the lower keys from pirates. The original base is now known as Mallory Square. Key West was always an important military post, since it sits at the northern edge of the deepwater channel connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (the southern edge away is Cuba) via the Florida Straits. Because of this, Key West since the 1820s had been dubbed the \\"Gibraltar of the West\\". Fort Taylor was initially built on the island. The Navy added a small base from which the USS Maine sailed to its demise in Havana at the beginning of the Spanish–American War. =Key West Naval Air Station= as seen at sunset in Key West on July 22, 2007. This ship is typical of the frigates, destroyers, and smaller military vessels that call at the port. Larger ships, such as aircraft carriers, are prohibited because of their deep draft and the shallowness of the harbor. At the beginning of World War II the Navy increased its presence from , including all of Boca Chica Key's and the construction of Fleming Key from landfill. The Navy built the first water pipeline extending the length of the Keys, bringing fresh water from the mainland to supply its bases. At its peak 15,000 military personnel and 3,400 civilians were at the base. Included in the base are: * Naval Air Station Key West – This is the main facility on Boca Chica, where the Navy trains its pilots. Staff are housed at Sigsbee Park. In 2006 there were 1,650 active-duty personnel; 2,507 family members; 35 Reserve members; and 1,312 civilians listed at the base. In the 1990s the Navy worked out an agreement with the National Park Service to stop sonic booms near Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas. Many of the training missions are directed at the Marquesas \\"Patricia\\" Target due west of the base. The target is a grounded ship hulk in length that is visible only at low tide. Bombs are not actually dropped on the target. * Truman Annex – The area next to Fort Taylor became a submarine pen and was used for the Fleet Sonar School. President Harry S. Truman was to make the commandant's house his winter White House. The Fort Taylor Annex was later renamed the Truman Annex. This portion has largely been decommissioned and turned over to private developers and the city of Key West. There are still a few government offices there, however, including the new NOAA Hurricane Forecasting Center. The Navy still owns its piers. * Trumbo Annex – The docking area on what had been the railroad yard for Flagler's Overseas Railroad is now used by the Coast Guard. Media Key West is part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale television market. It is served by rebroadcast transmitters in Key West and Marathon that repeat the Miami-Fort Lauderdale stations. Comcast provides cable television service. DirecTV and Dish Network provide Miami-Fort Lauderdale local stations and national channels.

The name Marathon dates back to the origin of the Florida East Coast Railroad. The name came from the railroad workers who were working night and day to complete the railway; due to the unrelenting pace and struggle to complete the project, workers complained that \\"this is getting to be a real marathon\\", and the word was later used to name the local railroad station.History of Marathon The Keys historian Dan Gallager in his book \\"Florida's Great Ocean Railway\\" credits New York playwright Witter Bynner for naming Marathon. According to Gallager, J.R. Parrott, then Florida East Coast Railway's President and General Manager, invited Brynner to the Keys to \\"plot stations for the railroad.\\" When asked to generate a name for the station at Key Vaca, Brynner proposed \\"Marathon\\", inspired by the following passage from Byron: \\"The mountains look on Marathon — and Marathon looks on the sea.\\" =Hurricane Irma= Marathon experienced significant damage from the September 10, 2017 U.S. landfall of Hurricane Irma.

The population was 20,978 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Okaloosa County. With an elevation of above sea level, it is one of the highest points in the state; it receives of rainfall annually, the second-most of any city in the state of Florida, after Fort Walton Beach with 69 inches. Crestview is a principal city of the Fort Walton Beach-Crestview-Destin Metropolitan Statistical Area. Etymology and nicknames Crestview’s name was chosen because of its location on the peak of a long woodland range between the Yellow and Shoal rivers which flow almost parallel on the east and west side of the city. The town was once known as \\"the icebox of Florida\\", due to its having the coldest winters in the state. Crestview is now known as the \\"Hub City\\", because of the convergence of Interstate 10, State Road 85, U.S. Highway 90, the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, and the Yellow River and Shoal River in or near the city. History Crestview was largely an outgrowth of the coming of railroad service to the west Panhandle of Florida.Turner, Gregg M., \\"A Journey Into Florida Railroad History\\", University Press of Florida, Gainesville, 2008, Library of Congress card number 2007050375, , p. 109. The Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad Company, chartered in 1881, opened its line between Pensacola and Chattahoochee in January 1883. Soon two express passenger trains, the Atlantic Express and the Gulf Express, and a local accommodation train that stopped everywhere, were in daily operation. The expresses took about six hours to make the run, the local, thirteen hours. When the railroad company was unable to cover the interest owed bondholders, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad covered the shortfalls until 1885, and then foreclosed, merging the route into their system as the L & N's Pensacola and Atlantic Division.Turner, Gregg M., \\"A Journey Into Florida Railroad History\\", University Press of Florida, Gainesville, 2008, Library of Congress card number 2007050375, , p. 110. In 1894, sawmill operator W. B. Wright opened the Yellow River Railroad between Crestview and Florala, Alabama via Auburn, Campton, and Laurel Hill. The L & N supplied the line with freight cars, and in 1906, purchased the operation,Turner, Gregg M., \\"A Journey Into Florida Railroad History\\", University Press of Florida, Gainesville, 2008, Library of Congress card number 2007050375, , pp. 166-67. as the Yellow River Branch. This line, without any major shippers on it to make it profitable, was used for freight car storage for a time in the early 1980s and then was abandoned with 25.3 miles of the route lifted after May 1985, although the right of way still exists, with some portions paved as local streets.

After Eglin Commanding Officer Brigadier General Grandison Gardner explained the economics of wartime to the city fathers, they chose a more reasonable replacement for town marshal. On July 31, 1949, the L&N; inaugurated the Gulf Wind streamliner through Crestview between New Orleans and Jacksonville, in conjunction with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, replacing the heavyweight New Orleans-Florida Limited.

As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round, Crestview experienced further population growth as the U.S. Army's 7th Special Forces Group relocated from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to a newly built cantonment facility on the northern end of the Eglin Air Force Base reservation, approximately six miles south of the city. In 2007, George Whitehurst, who had been mayor for nearly 20 years, resigned, leading to the election of David Cadle. Cadle had retired in 2006 as the long-time director of the Crestview High School band, The Big Red Machine. Cadle was replaced in 2019 by a retired member of the US Air Force, former high school teacher and city council member, JB Whitten, as the city switched to a council-manager form of government. Crestview, Florida from above Education For most of its history, education was provided only for white children. Crestview School, the first school for African-Americans in Crestview, was built in 1926. In 1944, a city block was purchased for a new high school for black students. In 1945, Crestview Colored High School was built on School Avenue. Later, it was renamed after George Washington Carver, and eventually was renamed Carver-Hill School in honor of the efforts of Ed Hill. After integration in 1966, high school students were transferred to the previously all-white Crestview High School and Carver-Hill was utilized for younger students until 1982, when it was converted to administrative use.

It is a principal city of the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin, Florida, metropolitan area. Located on Florida's Emerald Coast, Destin is known for its white beaches and emerald green waters. Originating as a small fishing village, it is now a popular tourist destination. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, over 80 percent of the Emerald Coast's 4.5 million visitors each year visit Destin. The city styles itself \\"The World's Luckiest Fishing Village\\",Goggin, Emma, \\"Destin Is Still Luckiest Fishing Village Around\\", Playground Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Wednesday 19 March 1975, Volume 30, Number 35, page 2C. and claims to have the largest fishing vessel fleet in the state of Florida. The city is located on a peninsula separating the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. The peninsula was originally a barrier island. Hurricanes and sea level changes gradually connected it to the mainland. In the 1940s, it technically became an island again with the completion of the Choctawhatchee-West Bay Canal. History Destin is named after Leonard Destin, a New London, Connecticut fishing captain who settled in the area between 1845 and 1850. He built a New England colonial home at the location of the Moreno Point military reservation.Angell, Joseph W. \\"History of the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command - Part One - Historical Outline 1933–1944\\", The Historical Branch, Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, Eglin AFB, Florida.

Condominiums were first built in Destin during the 1970s, although Destin was not incorporated as a municipality until 1984. The city has experienced rapid growth since the 1980s. Geography The city is located on a peninsula separating the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. The peninsula was originally an island; hurricanes and sea level changes gradually connected the island to the mainland. Destin is near several other cities in the region. The city of Fort Walton Beach is located to the west at the inlet of Santa Rosa Sound into Choctawhatchee Bay. North of Destin, across the bay is Niceville, with the Mid-Bay Bridge linking the two by road. U.S. Route 98 is the main route through the city, running from west to east. U.S. Route 98 leads east 56 mi (90 km) to Panama City and west 48 mi (77 km) to Pensacola. At the western tip of the peninsula is East Pass (also known as Destin Pass), separating it from Santa Rosa Island to the west. East Pass is the only outlet of Choctawhatchee Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, Many sources claim that the current pass was dug by hand with an inrush of water widening it within hours. The early pass appears (at the East end of Destin Harbor) in early maps and surveys from Spanish, French, and English surveyors, such as Thomas Jefferys's 1775 map The Coast of West Florida and Louisiana. Frequent dredging is required to keep East Pass navigable. \\"Crab Island,\\" was actually two islands made from sand that the Army Corps of Engineers dredged up from the East Pass. These islands were large enough to inhabit sea grass, small shrubs and nesting seabirds. It has been reduced to a significant sandbar, which appears only when the tide is out. It has become a popular anchorage in the area. The entrance to Destin Harbor, a lagoon between the beaches and the main body of the western portion of the peninsula, is located just north of the East Pass jetty. The lagoon is formed by a sand spit named Holiday Isle; many condominiums have been built along the harbor since the 1970s. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (7.95%) is water.

Arts and culture =Tourism= An image of a Destin beach, showing the emerald green waters typical of the Emerald Coast The white beaches and emerald waters of the Destin area draw many tourists. Florida's Department of Environmental Protection estimates that more than 80 percent of the Emerald Coast's 4.5 million yearly visitors travel to the region to visit Destin. Visitors can charter fishing vessels from the harbor, and there are 12 beach access points in the city. Among the access points is Henderson Beach State Recreation Area. A portion of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, the Okaloosa Day Use Area, is just across East Pass on Santa Rosa Island. Beach in Destin showing Marshes The sand on Destin's beaches is some of the whitest in the world. The sand comes from the Appalachian Mountains, and is made of finely ground quartz crystal giving the appearance of sugar. Residue flows down the Apalachicola River and is deposited into the Gulf of Mexico. Because of the currents the sand drifts west along the Gulf Coast and settles from east of Panama City to the Alabama coast. Several events also take place throughout the year as well. For the month of October, the annual Destin Fishing Rodeo draws anglers to Destin each year since 1948. Also in the month of October is the Destin Seafood Festival, where fresh seafood and local artists gather for one weekend every October. In addition to an assortment of hotels and motels, many high-rise condominiums are located in Destin. The first condominiums in Destin were built in the 1970s, and construction continues today. Visitors play a large part in Destin's economy – the city's population of around 12,000 balloons to 40,000 during the tourist season.

Lake Lorraine was originally a fresh- water body, but at some point in the 1990s the narrow sandbar that separated it from the Choctawhatchee Bay was breached and the former drainage channel to the tip of Black's Point became blocked by silt. The residential neighborhood originally developed along circumferential Country Club Road, surrounding a golf course, in the 1970s. The recession of 1976 left a number of properties in the interior of the golf course U in an unfinished and abandoned state. These parcels were later reconstructed. Further growth took place in the 1990s and 2000s, when the formerly wooded Black's Point area was developed with streets bearing the names of famous golfers. A \\"backdoor\\" gate onto Eglin Air Force Base, adjacent to base housing, accessed by Davis Court off of the northeast corner of Country Club Road, was closed amidst tightened base security and concerns about traffic routing through residential neighborhoods in the mid-1970s. During World War II, adjacent Eglin Field anchored a battleship-size target float in the Choctawhatchee Bay, just south of Black's Point, the southernmost point of the Lake Lorraine area, an area designated during the war as Eglin water range 60.

History and other features The area which is now Laurel Hill was one of the first post American annexation English-speaking settlements in Florida. There had been settlements by English-speaking loyalists in Florida during the American Revolution. Settlers were documented establishing a community, originally known as Almirante, soon after Florida's acquisition by the United States in 1821. In the 1880s, railroad access to north-west Florida opened up a booming lumber industry, with the Yellow River Railroad reaching the Almirante (Laurel Hill) area by 1892. In 1895 Almirante, then just a small logging and farming community, was platted and renamed Laurel Hill, the name purportedly inspired by a large laurel tree which grew in the center of the community. Growing rapidly, the community was incorporated by the Florida Legislature in 1905. Although in 1915 Laurel Hill was the largest community in newly created Okaloosa County, the town lost out becoming the Okaloosa county seat to the more centrally located town of Crestview. Laurel Hill's economic fortunes went into a decline after World War I, a waning intensified by the Florida land speculation collapse of the 1920s which resulted in the closing of Laurel Hill's only bank. In order to install infrastructure improvements and to re- stimulate the community, Laurel Hill was reincorporated in 1953. Once served by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, which purchased the Yellow River Railroad in 1906, the line was abandoned and lifted in the 1980s. * First held in 1992, the Laurel Hill Hobo Festival is an annual event scheduled for the first Saturday in October. * The team name for the Laurel Hill School is the Hoboes, allegedly the only school in the US with this team name. =Churches= * South Ebenezer Baptist Church * Ebenezer Baptist Church * Laurel Hill Presbyterian Church * Laurel Hill First Baptist Church * Mt Zion Baptist Church =Schools= * Okaloosa Comprehensive Head Start * Laurel Hill School Image:Laurel Hill School (FL) Hobos sign.JPGLaurel Hill (FL) School sign References External links * Laurel Hill Community website * Laurel Hill Hobo Festival * Northwest Florida Daily News Category:Cities in Okaloosa County, Florida Category:Populated places established in 1895 Category:Cities in Florida Category:1895 establishments in Florida ","title":"Laurel Hill, Florida"},{"id":"109512","text":"Mary Esther is a city in Okaloosa County, Florida, United States.

Incorporated in June 1947, Clifford Meigs served as its first mayor. The incorporation was directly related to state law that prohibited clubs in unincorporated areas from staying open from midnight Saturday until Monday morning, which would negatively impact the gambling operations at the casino of the Shalimar Club, the opening of which \\"was the social event of 1947.\\"Dobson, Henry Allen, \\"A History of Okaloosa County, Florida\\", A Thesis Presented to the Graduate Faculty of Southeastern Louisiana University, June 1974. \\"The Fort Walton Beach [sic - Fort Walton did not become Fort Walton Beach until June 1953] places were doing a booming business on the weekends while there were rumors that the sheriff might enforce the law in Shalimar and close the place there,\\" Meigs told the Playground News in 1959. \\"The owner came to me and suggested incorporation, and while I didn't think I had much to gain then, I agreed. With only about three other freeholders in the area, it was a simple matter to get incorporated.\\"Holland, Elizabeth E., staff writer, \\"Our Town\\", Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Monday 25 June 1990. The reprieve on gambling would be temporary, however. \\"The collapse of Okaloosa gambling was brought about by the glare of outside publicity, reform zeal from within and the direct intervention of Gov. Fuller Warren. The first wind of adversity was blown by the Tampa Tribune's exposé of gambling in Fort Walton.\\" The 1949 article led to the governor suspending Okaloosa County Sheriff Isle Enzor and two constables in 1950 for failure to enforce the state gambling laws. The popular Enzor was reelected in 1952 but gambling was on the way out. \\"Back on the job and converted to the cause, Sheriff Enzor began cracking down, and soon even the Shalimar Club was turning to more 'legitimate' forms of entertainment. But without gambling, it was just another nightspot. The Shalimar closed for good in 1956.\\"Jackson, Harvey H., \\"The Rise and Decline of the Redneck Riviera: An Inside History of the Florida-Alabama Coast\\", University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia, 2012, Library of Congress control number 2011040110, , Chapter Three, \\"Bring 'em Down, Keep 'em Happy, And Keep 'em Spending\\", pages 46-47. In 1948, the town features included the Shalimar Store, the Shalimar Service Station, and lumberman and Shalimar resident Roger Clary's Shalimar Club. The 160 residences were rented through Shalimar Homes and Meigs Homes corporations. In 1950, the 280-car capacity Florida Drive-In Theatre, erected at a cost of ~$40,000, at the junction of Ferry Road and State Road 85, later Eglin Parkway, the main road between the air force base and Fort Walton, Florida, opened on Thursday, June 15, with an Esther Williams picture, \\"On an Island with You\\".Fort Walton, Florida, \\"New Florida Drive-In Sets Formal Opening\\", Playground News, Thursday 15 June 1950, Volume 5, Number 20, pages 1, 8. Operated by the James K. Tringas family, that also built the Tringas Theatre in Fort Walton in 1940 (which is, ironically, still in business and being refurbished to its former glory in 2019), the drive-in would close in the fall of 1973. This property is now occupied by the Shalimar United Methodist Church family life center and a furniture store, which property is also owned by the church. The Louis Woodham Concrete Company, which would provide construction materials for the growing Shalimar area, was established at Dixie Point at the end of Ferry Road by 1956,Display advert, The Okaloosa News-Journal, Crestview, Florida, Thursday 4 October 1956, Volume 42, Number 40, page 8. and would survive into the late 1970s before being replaced by condominiums. It was regularly supplied by towboats with barges of raw materials which transited across the Choctawhatchee Bay from the Intracoastal Waterway on the south edge of the bay. A Coast Guard tripod navigation marker in the bay just offshore of Meig's Beach, Port Dixie, was removed after merchant commerce ceased to Ferry Point. The end of water deliveries to Ferry Point marked the last gasp of \\"Port Dixie\\" as once envisioned. Clifford Meigs served as mayor until his death in 1960, and was succeeded by his brother Clyde Meigs in November, who had served as a councilman.Fort Walton Beach, Florida, \\"Clyde Meigs Named Mayor of Shalimar\\", Playground News, 15 November 1960, Volume 15, Number \\"43\\" (actually 44), page 1. The first elected mayor was James P. Tras, in 1965, followed by Sarah Tras for a two to three-year term. She had been married to Clifford Meigs at the time of his death, and is the wife of Jim Tras, . Residential Meigs Drive, parallelling the Choctawhatchee Bay, Clifford Drive and Sara Drive are all named for the town's founding family. Carl Brandt Drive and Gardner Drive are named for former Eglin AFB commanders. During World War II, Eglin water range 60 was located in the bay immediately south of Port Dixie, with a battleship-size target float anchored off of Black’s Point. The Lake Lorraine area at Black's Point to the east of the incorporated Shalimar community was developed in the 1970s, but carries a Shalimar postal address. The Poquito Bayou area north of the incorporated Shalimar also carries a Shalimar postal address. The mostly residential area of Okaloosa County between Shalimar and Lake Lorraine continues to be referred to as Port Dixie. Commerce Shalimar has one commercial artery, Eglin Parkway, and most business enterprises are located within a block of State Road 85. A mix of office parks (many occupied by military contractors), restaurants, convenience stores with fuel islands, a furniture store, a Fairfield Inn by Marriott hotel, and other assorted small firms comprise the short business corridor. For a time in the 1960s-1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency had \\"front\\" offices in Shalimar. This office may have been involved as a test project office for the Lockheed U-2, with which Fort Walton Beach resident, World War II exile Polish pilot, and CIA officer, Ksawery Wyrożemski was involved, but which was a cover for CIA flight operations out of Duke Field.\\"Holm, Richard L., \\"A Plane Crash, Rescue, and Recovery - A Close Call in Africa\\", Center for the Study of Intelligence, Historical Perspectives, Washington, D.C., Winter 1999-2000, footnote 2. https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi- publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art2.html Okaloosa County Sheriff's offices are located in Shalimar. An Okaloosa County courthouse annex, erected in 1975 on land made available by the Meigs family, was razed in the last week of June 2014, after standing vacant for several years. Ground was broken on 29 September 2014 for a new $12 million 64,000 square foot 3-story Okaloosa County Administration Building on the former courthouse annex site. The new facility, under construction by Lord and Son, will house a variety of services, including a large space for County Commission meetings, Supervisor of Elections events, a gross management department, information systems, as well as facilities for the tax collector and supervisor of elections.Freeman, Danielle, \\"Breaking Ground On County Administration Building In Shalimar\\", WUWF Public Media, Pensacola, Florida, Tuesday 30 September 2014.http://wuwf.org/post/breaking-ground-county-administration- building-shalimar Education Some of the land that Clifford Meigs owned was donated to Okaloosa County for the establishment of a school. When it was finished it was named Choctawhatchee (Choctaw for short) High School, opening September 22, 1952. In 1969 the area needed a middle school, so Okaloosa School District built a new high school in Fort Walton Beach. The previous school was renamed to Clifford Meigs Junior High School, later Clifford Meigs Middle School (Meigs Middle School for short). The football field is known as Meigs Stadium (which is now named in honor of a passed coach). Meigs Middle School, Shalimar Elementary School and Longwood Elementary School are currently (2009) A Schools according to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test.

It is part of the Fort Walton Beach-Crestview-Destin Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Valparaiso was named after Valparaiso, Indiana (not Valparaiso, Chile) and is a twin city also with its neighboring city, Niceville. Chicago businessman James E. Plew, who relocated to the Panhandle of Northwest Florida in 1922, became \\"one of Northwest Florida's pioneer developers,\\"Okaloosa News-Journal, Crestview, Florida, \\"Jas.

He also founded the Valparaiso Novelty Company, helped to establish a knitting mill in the community and was interested in a number of other enterprises to which he made investments to help their development.\\" Plew thought that a military payroll would boost the depression-stricken economy of the region. He leased from the City of Valparaiso the Valparaiso Airport, an arrowhead-shaped parcel of cleared in 1933 as an airdrome.Angell, Joseph W., \\"History of the Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command – Part One – Historical Outline 1933–1944\\", The Historical Branch, Army Air Forces Proving Ground Command, Eglin Field, Florida, 1944, reprint by Office of History, Munitions Systems Division, Eglin AFB, Florida, 1989, page 46D. In 1934, Plew offered the U.S. government contiguous land for a bombing and gunnery base. This leasehold became the headquarters for the Valparaiso Bombing and Gunnery Base activated on June 14, 1935, under the command of Captain Arnold H. Rich.

The population was 47 at the 2010 census. It is named after a lake that lies east of the Magic Kingdom. All four of the Walt Disney World Resort theme parks, and one of Walt Disney World's two water parks, are in Bay Lake, though all Disney parks in the region have mailing addresses in nearby Lake Buena Vista. Bay Lake is one of two Florida municipalities controlled by The Walt Disney Company, the other being Lake Buena Vista. The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Chapter 67-1104 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the city of Bay Lake, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, or RCID) and 67-1965 (incorporating the City of Reedy Creek). It was and still is located fully inside the RCID, and all its duties have been taken care of by the RCID. As fully described in Reedy Creek Improvement District, the city has always been controlled by the Walt Disney Company and has allowed them powers that other area attractions have not had. Chapter 69-836 of the Laws of Florida, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries to exclude the easternmost part. Chapter 69–1527, which became a law the same day, completely moved the city of Reedy Creek, with the land given up by Bay Lake included in the new city. Since then, Bay Lake has expanded to fill the original RCID west of Bonnet Creek, but the Reedy Creek Improvement District has expanded to include new land not in the city. The RCID had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities were incorporated inside of it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \\"community of the future\\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park. The later Celebration, Florida was deannexed from the city and the RCID in 1994 so the Walt Disney Company would not lose control of the district. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a community on the north shore of Bay Lake (on Bay Court). The only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, rights-of-way for state and county roads, and five five-acre (20,000 m²) lots owned by senior Disney employees to give them voting power in the Reedy Creek Improvement District. Geography Bay Lake is located at (28.391502, -81.566659). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.86%) is water. The principal border that divides the cities of Lake Buena Vista to the east and Bay Lake to the west is the canal called Bonnet Creek, adjacent to Bonnet Creek Parkway. Most of the attractions associated with the Walt Disney World Resort are actually located within the City of Bay Lake, including all four theme parks. The only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Bay Court, a street which, in 1987, was a dirt road. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs. Demographics U.S. Census Bureau map showing city limits As of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the city. The population density was 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.4/km). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 0.5 per square mile (0.2/km). The racial makeup of the city was twenty-two whites and one African American. None of the people in Bay Lake were Asian, Native American or Hispanics or Latinos. There were nine households in Bay Lake, out of which three had children under the age of 18 living with them, five had married couples living together, one had a female householder with no husband present, and three of the households were non-families. Three households were made up of individuals, and one consisted of someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.00. The median income for a household in the city was $86,288, and the median income for a family was $86,288. Males had a median income of $76,284 versus $21,667 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,731. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line. Because of Bay Lake statistics, legislators have to be careful not to use the words \\"maximum\\" and \\"average\\" in the computations used for the State of Florida's 2007 property tax reform debate. For example, in 2006 the “per capita levy” of property tax in Bay Lake was $176,230. Since the statewide average that year was $475, legislators have had to be careful to distinguish the phrase \\"average savings\\" from the phrase \\"savings by the average taxpayer.\\" In 2010 Bay Lake had a population of 47. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 72.3% white, 6.4% Asian, 4.3% of two or more races and 17.0% Hispanic or Latino.2010 census report for Bay Lake Points of interest *Walt Disney World: **Magic Kingdom **Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground **Magnolia and Palm Golf Courses **Disney's BoardWalk Resort **Epcot **Disney's Animal Kingdom **Disney's Blizzard Beach **Disney's Hollywood Studios **ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex Government and infrastructure Reedy Creek Improvement District Fire Department Emergency Services fire station The Reedy Creek Improvement District has its Fire Department Emergency Services station in Bay Lake (it has a Lake Buena Vista postal address).\\"Executive Board .\\" Florida Fire Marshalls and Fire Inspectors Association.

It is mostly known for being the mailing address for Walt Disney World—although almost all of the resort facilities, including all four theme parks, are physically located in the adjacent city of Bay Lake. It is one of two Florida municipalities controlled by The Walt Disney Company, the other being Bay Lake. The permanent residential population of Lake Buena Vista was 10 at the 2010 census. Lake Buena Vista is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Chapter 67-1965 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the City of Reedy Creek, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District) and 67-1104 (incorporating the city of Bay Lake). It was located fully inside the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The city was controlled by Walt Disney Productions and allowed it powers that other area attractions had not had. Chapter 69-1527, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries. The city was completely moved, taking over some land that had been part of the City of Bay Lake (and was given up by Chapter 69-836, which became a law the same day) and including some other land that had formerly been unincorporated. Soon after, the City of Reedy Creek was renamed to the City of Lake Buena Vista to better reflect its new location, through which Reedy Creek did not flow. \\"Buena Vista\\" comes from the name of the street in Burbank, California, where The Walt Disney Company is headquartered. The Reedy Creek Improvement District had all the powers of the city and more, raising the questions of why cities needed to be incorporated inside it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \\"community of the future\\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park and later Celebration, Florida. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a small community on Royal Oak Court, north of Disney Springs. The only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of Disney, and rights-of-way for state and county roads. Geography Lake Buena Vista is located at (28.377362, -81.521728). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.02%) is water. The only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Little Lake Bryan, which, in 1987, had nine mobile homes. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs. =Climate= =The lake= Lake Buena Vista is a small body of water located east of the Buena Vista Golf Course, west of the crossing of State Road 535 and Interstate 4. The lake, which was called \\"Blake Lake\\" before its acquisition by Disney, was named for Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California, where Disney's corporate headquarters are located. Several Walt Disney Company business entities had names containing \\"Buena Vista\\", a Spanish phrase that means \\"good view\\". In 2015, guide maps for the Disney Springs shopping, dining, and entertainment district started promoting Village Lake, which the district and Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa borders, as \\"Lake Buena Vista\\". The actual lake and the promoted lake are connected via a stream, which is crossed by a bridge linking Disney Springs' Marketplace area with Saratoga Springs Resort.

The area was previously inhabited by Timucuan Native Americans. The town was originally named for a nearby Lake, which honored Captain William Seton Maitland, who fought in the Second Seminole Indian War, and was slain in the battle of Wahoo Swamp. A small military outpost was built in 1838 on the western shore of Lake Fumecheliga (later Lake Maitland) during the Second Seminole War. After the Civil War, new residents arrived in the area. Christopher Columbus Beasley, perhaps the first permanent settler, arrived at Lake Maitland in 1871. A post office opened on January 2 of the next year and operated in his home. Around this post office, a small town grew. In the closing decades of the nineteenth century the area was put into extensive citrus production. Lake Maitland was incorporated as a town in 1885, the third such town in Orange County to do so. In its infancy, Lake Maitland was often characterized as a rural village, with streets lined with large oak trees planted by early town aldermen. However, the old town began to rapidly modernize as Orlando's suburban sprawl reached the town in the mid 1920s. A Street Corner in Lake Maitland, ca.1926 During this period the town grew rapidly as new houses and roads were built. In 1959, Maitland was incorporated as a city. Maitland is a suburb of Orlando.

During a time of great growth in the region during the 1880s, Oakland emerged as the center of commerce in west Orange County, and it appeared that the village would blossom into city, with the town incorporating in 1887. Unfortunately, however, a fire in the business district and a subsequent period of freezes in rapid succession throughout the 1890s, along with the growth of nearby Winter Garden seemed to ensure that Oakland would remain as little more than a sleepy village.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 35,579. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. History =Founding and early history= In the mid-1850s, Dr. J.D. Starke, stricken with malaria, led a group of slaves, similarly stricken, to the north side of an open pine wooded lake that provided clear and clean water to avoid further malaria outbreaks. The camp built by the group provided a base of operations from which to commute during the day to work the fields near Lake Apopka and rest at night. As the camp grew into a village, it took the name Starke Lake, a name the lake upon which the group settled bears to this day. The city's population increased further after the American Civil War as Confederate soldiers and their families settled into the area, including Captain Bluford Sims and General William Temple Withers who wintered at the location. Captain Sims received a land grant for a 74-acre parcel to the west of Starke Lake in what is now the downtown portion of Ocoee on October 5, 1883. In 1886, Captain Sims, along with a group of original settlers, led an effort to have the town platted and changed the name to Ocoee, after a river he grew up near in Tennessee. Ocoee is a Cherokee Indian word anglicized from uwagahi, meaning \\"apricot vine place\\"\\"City of Ocoee\\" at Florida League of Cities municipal directory. Retrieved 15 September 2016. and this inspired the choice of the city's flower.\\"City History\\" at City of Ocoee official website. Retrieved September 15, 2016. Bluford Sims began groundbreaking work in budding wild orange trees while in Ocoee. His commercial citrus nursery was the first in the United States in Ocoee, supplying many other groves in Florida with their first trees as well as shipping young citrus trees to California. The construction of the Florida Midland Railroad in the 1880s spurred growth in the area and many more settlers moved in. =Ocoee massacre= On November 2, 1920, after July Perry and Moses Norman, two black men, attempted to vote and encouraged other blacks to vote, the entire black population of the town was violently attacked. On the night of the massacre, white World War I veterans from throughout Orange County participated. At least 24 black homes were burned, the institutions constituting the black community were destroyed and Perry was lynched. Before the massacre, Ocoee's black population numbered approximately five hundred; after the massacre, however, the black population was nearly eliminated. For more than 40 years, Ocoee remained an all-white sundown town.Edward Ericson Jr. \\"Dead Wrong.\\" Orlando Weekly. October 1, 1998.

Highway construction was the impetus for Ocoee's growth in the 20th century. State Road 50 (SR 50) was constructed south of downtown Ocoee in 1959 and provided a direct east- west connection between the City and a growing Orlando. The development of what would become Florida State Road 50 made the town more accessible to housing developers. Florida's Turnpike was opened just south of downtown Ocoee in 1964. In late 1990, Ocoee was connected to Orlando by a western extension of Florida State Road 408 (the East-West Expressway) which then joined the Florida's Turnpike south of SR 50.

Shortly thereafter, the name is changed to the Congregational Church of Christ and a church building is constructed. In the 1940s, the church is named Tangerine Community Church.  April 3, 1909  The Tangerine Improvement Society (TIS) is founded by local Tangerine women. Men are later admitted in 1920.  1911  Mr. and Mrs. William H. and Addie G.

April 18, 1977  A new TIS building at 7101 Wright Ave. is dedicated as Johnson Hall in honor of Cecil “CeCe” Johnson for his dedication and service to Tangerine. When the original TIS building burned in 1972, Mr. Johnson led the drive for funds to erect the new building.Mount Dora Topic. April 28, 1972. \\\\----  Notable Residents  Tangerine was the adopted home of novelist, journalist and government consultant Harry Hart Frank (born Chicago, Illinois, 1908; died Jacksonville, Florida, 1964). Under the pen name Pat Frank, his classic 1959 post-apocalyptic novel Alas, Babylon is set in the fictional Central Florida small town (stated pop. 3,500) of \\"Fort Repose\\". Fort Repose, although fictional, is a clearly drawn composite, representative of many small isolated native-settler Florida communities of the period. The actual town of Mount Dora, north of Tangerine, has been stated as a specific inspiration for Fort Repose, with Frank's fictional shantytown \\"Pistolville\\" said to have been named for Mt. Dora's area of the same name.  References to Tangerine  The setting for the popular young adult novel Tangerine by Edward Bloor is a fictional book based in Tangerine, Florida, located in the Orlando area and having no relation to the actual Tangerine, Florida.

The town of Windermere will not be within the attendance boundaries of Windermere High School, a Lake Butler high school scheduled to open in 2017. The Windermere town council opposed the naming on the grounds that area residents may mistakenly confuse the school with Windermere Preparatory. Some OCPS board members also argued the school should not be named for a community it will not be located in; they stated that not very many students from the town of Windermere will go to Windermere High. Transportation Signs on Apopka-Vineland Road, east of downtown, warn heavy vehicles to stay out of Windermere. Through traffic is banned from using this street to bypass congestion during rush hours. Windermere is located on an isthmus between several lakes in the Lake Butler chain. As such, it is on the shortest road route between the east and west sides of the chain. In fact, the next crossing to the south is distant at Lake Buena Vista, where County Road 535 (CR 535) and Apopka-Vineland Road meet. The next crossing to the north is at Gotha, the north end of the chain of lakes, away. 2003 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), much of which is commuters passing through, is 17,197 vehicles per day for Sixth Avenue (the east entrance), 18,362 on Main Street north of Sixth Avenue, and 9,484 on Main Street south of Sixth Avenue. Windermere regulates traffic and encourages traffic to use alternate routes. In 2004, two roundabouts were installed downtown with the largest public works project in the town's history. This has greatly improved traffic flow and relieved cut through traffic. A third roundabout was completed in August 2010 at the intersection of Park Avenue and Maguire Road. This is at the Windermere Elementary School intersection. All roads in the downtown area (laid out in a grid) are dirt roads except for a few through roads: *Main Street from the northern boundary (as Maguire Road, which heads north to Ocoee) south to 12th Street; the pavement turns west at 12th Street onto Chase Road, which connects to CR 535 *Sixth Avenue east from Main Street to the town line, where it becomes Conroy-Windermere Road *Second Avenue west from Main Street (serves a peninsula) *\\"Dirt Main Street\\", just west of Main Street (opposite where the railroad used to run), from Third Avenue to Seventh Avenue *Several other paved roads exist in the outskirts, in areas that have been annexed since the original town was formed. These signs appear on light poles at borders of the business district at the center of downtown. Until the 1980s, Main Street north of Sixth Avenue and Sixth Avenue east of Main Street were maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as part of State Road 439. This was given to Orange County as County Road 439 (CR 439), and Orange County eventually removed all signs and gave the part inside Windermere to the town. Signs put up by FDOT still mark the north end of CR 439 at SR 50, but no other signs exist, in part because Orange County has a general policy of not signing county roads. The Florida Midland Railroad, part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, used to run just west of Main Street; there is now a large grassy area between Main Street and the dirt road (often called Dirt Main Street) that ran just west of the railroad. Windermere had a station on the railroad.

One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from May until October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is a cooler season (November through March) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the Gulf Stream.

The open-air shopping center, located along Daniels Road just north of SR 429, is anchored by a Super Target, a Best Buy, Sprint and a Lowe's. Downtown Winter Garden hosts a farmer's market every weekend from 9:00am–2:00pm. Many vendors sell fresh produce, plants and flowers, herbs, baked goods, artisan crafts, and local food and beverages. Live music is also a key feature at the market. Infrastructure =Transportation= State Road 50 (W. Colonial Dr) bisects the city into northern and southern sections. The portion south of State Road 50, formerly occupied by orange groves and farmland, has recently been the site of the development of numerous large-scale communities, including Johns Lake Pointe, Stoneybrook West, Stonecrest, Westfield, and Wintermere Pointe. A disparity exists between these new affluent residents, many of whom have moved from South Florida, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Pennsylvania and the New York metropolitan area, and longtime residents, many of whom are much less well-off. The toll road Western Beltway (SR 429) was completed in late 2006 and links I-4 near mile marker 58 in Osceola County with Florida's Turnpike at Winter Garden. Other major roads through Winter Garden include County Road 535 and County Road 545. CR 535 (also called Winter Garden - Vineland Road) begins at SR 50 and bisects the southern half of the city, proceeding south to Windermere, Lake Buena Vista and Walt Disney World Resort, where it becomes State Road 535. CR 545 (also called Avalon Road) begins at SR 50 and proceeds south along the western edge of Winter Garden and along the border between Orange and Lake counties. This area remains mostly rural but is quickly developing because of the nearby toll road. CR 545 currently ends at US 192 in Kissimmee at the border to Osceola County.

It is on the southern shore of East Lake Tohopekaliga in Central Florida, about southeast of Orlando. The population was 35,183 in the 2010 census, and 54,579 in the 2019 census estimate. The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford metropolitan area. St. Cloud was founded as a retirement community for Civil War union veterans, and gained the nickname \\"The Friendly Soldier City\\".  History  St. Cloud Hotel c. 1922 St. Cloud Hotel, 2011 During the 1870s, Hamilton Disston of Philadelphia took an interest in developing the region while on fishing trips with Henry Shelton Sanford, founder of the city of Sanford. Disston contracted with the Florida Internal Improvement Fund, then in receivership, to pay $1 million to offset its Civil War and Reconstruction debt. In exchange, Disston was awarded half the land he drained from the state's swamps. He dug canals and, in 1886–87, established St. Cloud sugarcane plantation, named after St. Cloud, Minnesota, although many longtime locals claim the town was named after Saint-Cloud, France.Berman Law Group Disston opened the Sugar Belt Railway to the South Florida Railroad in 1888 to carry his product to market. But the Panic of 1893 dropped land values, and the Great Freeze of 1894-95 ruined the plantation. Disston returned to Philadelphia, where he died in 1896. The Sugar Belt Railway merged into the South Florida Railroad. An attempt to cultivate rice in the area failed, and for several years the land remained fallow. Then in 1909, the Seminole Land & Investment Company acquired as the site for a Grand Army of the Republic veterans' colony. St. Cloud was selected because of its \\"health, climate and productiveness of soil.\\" It was first permanently settled in 1909 by William G. King, a real estate manager from Alachua County who had been given the responsibility \\"to plan, locate and develop a town.\\" On April 16, 1909, the Kissimmee Valley Gazette announced the \\"New Town of St. Cloud\\", a \\"Soldiers Colony\\" near Kissimmee. The newspaper called the Seminole Land and Investment Company's purchase \\"one of the most important real estate deals ever made in the State of Florida.\\" It was reported that the company had searched all over Florida for the perfect site for a veterans' colony, particularly one suited for \\"health, climate, and productiveness of the soil\\". It is believed that many of the streets were named for states from which the Civil War veterans had served, but the street names were already assigned to the platted land before settlement occurred.http://www.stcloudmainstreetflorida.org/history.html On June 1, 1915, the Florida Legislature incorporated St. Cloud as a city. Its downtown features landmark buildings by the Orlando architectural firm Ryan & Roberts, a partnership consisting of two women. The buildings by Ryan and Roberts and others downtown are predominantly Spanish Revival.Dalles, John, \\"The Pathbreaking Legacy of Ryan and Roberts\\", in \\"Reflections\\", the journal of the Historical Society of Central Florida, Summer 2009; pages 8 and 9. St. Cloud has tried to separate itself from neighboring cities, and particularly the theme parks, by promoting an image of small-town life, and by attempting to make itself economically less dependent on Kissimmee. On March 6, 2006, St. Cloud introduced CyberSpot, a program that gives residents free high-speed wireless Internet access. The city then ended Cyberspot, claiming it was too costly. The city is served by the Osceola Library System.  Geography  St. Cloud is located at (28.246590, -81.287540).

The area was confused with Buenaventura Lakes CDP in the 2000 census, and the correct data for the area was not recorded.ERRATA FOR THE CENSUS 2000 TIGER/LINE(R) FILES, United States Census Bureau, October 2001. Accessed 2018-01-31. Yeehaw Junction is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Destiny development is planned nearby.  Geography  Yeehaw Junction is located at (27.7, -80.90444), at the intersection of US 441/SR 15, SR 60 and Florida's Turnpike (SR 91), approximately west of Vero Beach and 30 miles north of Lake Okeechobee. The location was named after the Yeehaw station on the Florida East Coast Railway's Kissimmee Valley Line, which passed through Yeehaw Junction from 1915 to 1947.FEC Kissimmee Valley Extension Map Kissimmee Valley Line Map History Some say the community's name comes from the fact locals would yell \\"Yeehaw!\\", while others believe the name is derived from the Creek language word meaning \\"wolf\\". According to town historians and several original newspaper articles that are displayed at the Desert Inn and Restaurant, the town was originally named \\"Jackass Junction\\" or \\"Jackass Crossing\\". This name was given to the four-corner site back in the early 1930s, when local ranchers rode on burros to visit the Desert Inn (then the local brothel). As the 1950s approached, the Florida legislature felt that a name change was due in light of the construction of Florida's Turnpike through the center of the community in 1957, resulting in renaming the town to its present-day name. =Biological warfare experiment= In late 1968 the Deseret Test Center conducted a biological warfare experiment at Yeehaw Junction. The experiment was part of Project 112 and was labelled DTC Test 69-75. Stem rust, referred to as \\"Agent TX\\", was tested to determine its effectiveness against a wheat crop in time of war. The tests were conducted over a period of one month from October 31 to December 1, 1968. Live agent was sprayed by a U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom fighter jet on seven occasions and dead agent, consisting of spores that were killed by a gaseous mixture of ethylene oxide, was sprayed on four occasions. The stated objective of Deseret Test Center (DTC) Test 69-75 was to investigate the effectiveness of the F-4/A/B and 45Y-2/TX weapon systems to reduce Soviet wheat crop yields in selected geographic areas. The objective was subdivided into other tasks: determine the downwind travel of Agent TX released from the A/B 45Y-2 spray tank, estimate the yield reduction and loss of wheat crops attacked by the weapon system, study the effectiveness of killed TX as a simulant for Agent TX, and evaluate the adequacy to predict downwind dosages of Agent TX.69-75 Fact Sheet Oct - Dec 1968 Yeehaw Junction, FL; Released October 9, 2002 The tests were unknown to local residents and officials until October 2002 when Senator Bill Nelson demanded details of the tests from the U.S. Department of Defense after knowledge of the test was eventually revealed during a larger congressional inquiry of potential effects on participating veterans of chemical and biological testing. Eglin Air Force Base, Avon Park Air Force Range, Panama City, Belle Glade, and Fort Pierce, were additional sites in Florida of biological agent production and testing.Secret Testing May Have Hit Civilian Sites Gwyneth K.

It was once known as a major stopping point for tourists to purchase conditional discount tickets for various tourist attractions in the Orlando area, but Yeehaw Junction's ticket booth has since closed down. The Turnpike exit links with State Road 60, an important traffic route going from Vero Beach on the Atlantic to Tampa and St. Petersburg on the Gulf Coast. The Turnpike exit is the southern end of the longest stretch of limited-access highway without an exit in the United States (the next interchange to the north being 48.9 miles away at Kissimmee/St. Cloud) and the northern end of the second-longest such stretch (the next exit to the south being 40.5 miles away at Fort Pierce).

Canal Point is located along the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, to the northeast of Pahokee and to the northwest of Bryant. The unincorporated community was originally inhabited by the Calusa tribe until almost 400 years ago. Whites began occupying the area in the 1900s decade, establishing an agrarian community. The completion of the West Palm Beach Canal in 1917 allowed crops to be shipped by boat to West Palm Beach and then to other areas of the country, while construction of Conners Highway in 1924 resulted in crops being transported by motor vehicle. Today, the community still relies heavily on agriculture, especially sugar. The town is very small with very little infrastructure. Canal Point has a small population, with 367 people counted in the 2010 census, down from 525 in the 2000 census. Geography Canal Point is located at (26.862060, -80.630543). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. History Archaeological evidence from Big Mound City, located roughly of Canal Point, suggests that the Calusa tribe inhabited the area between about 500 BCE and 1650 CE. In 1909, Canal Point became the first White settlement on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The Southern States Land and Timber Company began planting sugarcane in the area in 1917. Around that time, the West Palm Beach Canal was completed. The canal connected Lake Okeechobee at Canal Point to West Palm Beach, allowing farms to sell crops to West Palm Beach or elsewhere in the United States via the Florida East Coast Railway. Transportation of crops by motor vehicle from the area to other destinations began in 1924 with the completion of Conners Highway, which mostly followed the path of the West Palm Beach Canal. Unlike other communities along the southeastern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, Canal Point was relatively unscathed by the 1928 hurricane. The community was likely inundated with of water and one death occurred. However, the local economy suffered greatly and never recovered after construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike limited boat traffic in the 1930s. Residents saved the historic Canal Point School from demolition and hoped to convert it into an agricultural museum, but the building was destroyed by a fire in 2008. About three years earlier, Hurricane Wilma wrecked several other historic buildings in the community.

Etymology  The origin of the name \\"Hypoluxo\\" is disputed. One theory analyzed the name as composed of the Greek root \\"hypo-\\" (under, below average) and the Latin \\"lux\\" (light). Hannibel Pierce settled on Hypoluxo Island with his family in 1873. His son, Charlie W. Pierce reported that a Seminole woman told his mother that the Seminole name for Lake Worth was Hypoluxo, which he thought meant 'island', or as he put it using his marginal command of the English language: \\"water all around, no get out\\". The name that the Pierces wrote as \\"Hypoluxo\\" was given as \\"Opoloccha\\" in a history posted by the Town of Hypluxo. J. Clarence Simpson, citing William A. Read, states that the name is from the Creek-Seminole Hapo, meaning \\"mound\\" and Plotski, meaning \\"round\\", thus \\"round mound\\". The name \\"Hypoluxo\\" appears on an 1841 War Department map.

Boynton toured the area in 1894, and established the Boynton Beach Hotel in 1897. The town of Boynton was incorporated in 1920. Due to disputes over beach area property taxes and the Town of Boynton's rising debt load, twelve homes created the Town of Boynton Beach in 1931. But in 1937, the Town Commission called a special emergency meeting over changing Boynton Beach's name, because mail was being missent to Daytona Beach due to the similarities in name. Marion White Bird, the daughter of then Mayor Michael White, suggested the name \\"Ocean Ridge\\" and won a contest for choosing a new name. The name was officially changed to \\"Ocean Ridge\\" in 1939. Two years later, the Town of Boynton itself changed its name, to \\"Boynton Beach\\".

Pahokee is a city located on the shore of Lake Okeechobee in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The population was 5,649 in the 2010 census. Pahokee's residents, according to the 2010 Census, are 56% African-American; almost all the rest are Mestizo or American Indian, primarily Mexicans or descendants of Mexicans. In 2018, the Mayor, Kenneth W. Babb, and the other four members of the City Commission are all African-American. History Pahokee was incorporated in 1922. The name \\"Pahokee\\" means \\"grassy waters\\" in the Creek language. Local residents refer to Pahokee as \\"The Muck\\", which signifies the mineral-rich dark soil in which sugar cane, citrus fruits, and corn are grown by agribusinesses. In the 1930s, it was known as the \\"Winter Vegetable Capital of the World\\". The city was severely affected, as were the other communities to the south of the lake, by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Hurricane Wilma, in 2005, destroyed a newly built marina. Economy Pahokee was founded on the produce grown in the muck, the fertile bottom of the Everglades after part of it was drained in the early 20th century. In 1939, the Federal Writers' Project guide said of Pahokee: \\"From Christmas until April, Pahokee is a 24-hour town; long trains of refrigerated cars roll out for northern markets day and night.\\" \\"The streets are noisy and crowded; bars, restaurants and gambling places are never closed.\\" In 1963, with access to Cuban sugar restricted, a sugar plant was built, and agriculture shifted to the mechanized crop of sugar cane. The plant closed in 2009. As a result, it is one of two Palm Beach County cities—the other is South Bay—on a list of 13 Florida municipalities in \\"a state of financial emergency.\\" Records suggest it has been on the list continually since 1994. Unemployment exceeds 25%. Taxable property values dropped from about $99 million in 2007 to $66 million in 2014. A fifth of the population has migrated in the past 15 years. Dissolution of the city has been proposed.

It is located about 3 miles east of Pahokee, on Muck City Road, in a former migrant worker facility, surrounded by sugar cane fields. This helps the offenders better integrate into society and not be a burden or commit further crimes in order to survive after serving their time mandated by the state and being released with little or no assistance from the department of corrections.  Pahokee in the media  On December 18, 2009, Damien Cave, Miami Bureau Chief of the New York Times, wrote an article describing Pahokee's economic plight and the town's hopes that a new marina project might help rejuvenate business. There has been a significant move towards regeneration with the re-opening of the Pahokee Marina Tiki Bar and Restaurant now known as 'Pahokee Mo's' and new Dollar General store. Governor Rick Scott also pledged $1.3 million towards the restoration of Pahokee's infrastructure in late 2014. This is in addition to $200,000 pledged by Senator Abruzzo in 2014.

The emerging rabbits are killed with clubs, gutted, skinned, cooked, and eaten, or sold to others as meat. Rabbits are a food source for a very poor community; the atmosphere has been called \\"primitive\\". \\"In the Florida Everglades rabbit hunting is a rite of passage for young men, practiced since the early 1900s.

Located on an island in east-central Palm Beach County, the town is separated from several nearby cities including West Palm Beach and Lake Worth Beach by the Intracoastal Waterway to its west, though Palm Beach borders a small section of the latter and South Palm Beach at its southern boundaries. As of 2010 census, Palm Beach had a year-round population of 8,348 and an estimated population of 8,816 in 2019, with an increase to approximately 25,000 people between November and April. Settlers began arriving in modern- day Palm Beach as early as 1872 and opened a post office about five years later. Elisha Newton \\"Cap\\" Dimick, later the town's first mayor, established Palm Beach's first hotel, the Cocoanut Grove House, in 1880. However, it was Standard Oil tycoon Henry Flagler who became instrumental in transforming the island of jungles and swamps into a winter resort for the wealthy. Flagler and his workers constructed the Royal Poinciana Hotel in 1894, The Breakers in 1896, and Whitehall in 1902; extended the Florida East Coast Railway southward to the area by 1894; and developed a separate city to house hotel workers, which later became West Palm Beach. The town of Palm Beach officially incorporated on April 17, 1911. Addison Mizner also contributed significantly to the town's history, designing 67 structures, including El Mirasol, the Everglades Club, La Querida, the William Gray Warden House, and Via Mizner, which is a section of Worth Avenue. Forbes reported in 2017 that Palm Beach had at least 30 billionaires, with the town ranking as the 27th-wealthiest place in the United States in 2016 according to Bloomberg News. Many famous and wealthy individuals have resided in the town, including United States presidents John F. Kennedy and Donald Trump. Palm Beach is also noted for upscale shopping districts such as Worth Avenue, Royal Poinciana Plaza, and the Royal Poinciana Way Historic District.  History  Settlers began arriving in modern-day Palm Beach by 1872. Hiram F. Hammon made the first homestead claim in 1873 along Lake Worth. At the time, the lake area had a population of less than 12 people. By 1877, the Tustenegee Post Office was established in modern-day Palm Beach, becoming the lake area's first post office. Along the coast of Palm Beach, the Providencia wrecked in 1878 with a cargo of 20,000 coconuts, which were quickly planted. In 1880, Elisha Newton \\"Cap\\" Dimick converted his private residence to a hotel known as the Cocoanut Grove House. At the time of its opening, the Cocoanut Grove House was the only hotel along Florida's east coast between Titusville and Key West. The hotel would be destroyed by a fire in October 1893. The Star Route, also known as the Barefoot mailman route, began serving the area in 1885. Carriers would deliver mail by foot or boat from Palm Beach and other nearby communities to as far south as Miami, a round trip distance of . The first schoolhouse in southeast Florida (also known as the Little Red Schoolhouse) opened in Palm Beach in 1886. Henry Flagler, a Standard Oil tycoon, made his first visit to Palm Beach in 1893 and described the area as a \\"veritable paradise.\\" That same year, Flagler hired George W. Potter to plot 48-blocks for West Palm Beach - a city to house workers at his hotels - and construction began on the Royal Poinciana Hotel. The Royal Poinciana Hotel opened for business on February 11, 1894. Flagler, also owner of the Florida East Coast Railway, extended the railroad southward to West Palm Beach by the following month. In 1896, Flagler opened a second hotel originally known as Wayside Inn, before being renamed Palm Beach Inn, and later becoming The Breakers. Fires would later burn down the hotel in 1903 and 1925, but it would be rebuilt twice. The Palm Beach Daily News began publication in 1897 originally under the name Daily Lake Worth News. The first pedestrian bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway opened near the modern-day Flagler Bridge in 1901, replacing the original railroad spur. Flagler's house lots were bought by the beneficiaries of the Gilded Age, and in 1902 Flagler himself built a Beaux-Arts mansion, Whitehall, designed by the New York-based firm Carrère and Hastings and helped establish the Palm Beach \\"winter season\\". Telephone service was established in Palm Beach in 1908, with 18 customers initially. Prior to the 1910s, many African Americans in the area lived in a segregated section of Palm Beach called the \\"Styx\\", with an estimated population of 2,000 at its peak. However, between 1910 and 1912, African Americans were evicted from the Styx. Most of the displaced residents relocated to the northern West Palm Beach neighborhoods of Freshwater, Northwest, and Pleasant City. Palm Beach, 1916 In January 1911, it became known that West Palm Beach intended to annex the island of Palm Beach in the upcoming Florida Legislative session. Residents objected and hired an attorney from Miami to officially become incorporated. Dimick, Louis Semple Clarke, and 31 other male property owners congregated at Clarke's house and signed a charter to officially incorporate the town of Palm Beach on April 17, 1911. Dimick became the first mayor, John McKenna became town clerk, and Joseph Borman became town marshal, while J. B. Donnelly, William Fremd, John Doe, Enoch Root, and J.J. Ryman served as the first council members. Also in 1911, Dimick built the Royal Park Bridge, with its first incarnation being a wooden structure. Passage from West Palm Beach to Palm Beach on the bridge originally required a toll - 25 cents per vehicle and 5 cents per pedestrian. Between 1919 and 1924, American resort architect Addison Mizner designed 67 structures in Palm Beach. Some of Mizner's clients included Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr., Paul Moore Sr., Gurnee Munn, John Shaffer Phipps, Edward Shearson, Eva Stotesbury. Rodman Wanamaker, and Barclay Harding Warburton II. His designed works included the Costa Bella, El Mirasol, Everglades Club (in collaboration with Paris Singer), El Solano, La Bellucia, La Querida, Via Mizner, Villa Flora, and William Gray Warden House. Via Mizner was the first shopping complex along Worth Avenue, which was then a mostly residential street. In February 1924, the town council allotted $100,000 toward construction of a new municipal building. Harvey and Clarke architectural firm designed the building, while Newlon and Stephens constructed the structure after bidding $160,200 for the contract. The Palm Beach Town Hall opened on December 18, 1925, and is still used for town council meetings. Prior to its completion, the council meetings were held in one story wooden building on Royal Poinciana Way. Also in 1925, citywide construction revenue reached $14 million, attributed to Florida land boom. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane made landfall in the town of Palm Beach with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h). High winds and storm surge caused damage to 610 businesses, 60 homes, and 10 hotels, as well as to the Public Service Corporation and Ocean Boulevard. Damage in 1928 USD totaled $10 million in Palm Beach. The Biltmore Hotel (now the Palm Beach Biltmore Condominiums), which was converted into a U.S. Naval Special Hospital during World War II The population of Palm Beach grew from 1,707 in 1930 to 3,747 in 1940, a 119.5 percent increase. The Royal Poinciana Hotel, damaged heavily in the 1928 hurricane, also suffered greatly during the Great Depression, and was demolished in 1935. Around 4,000 people purchased the salvageable remains of the hotel. The Palm Beach-Post Times estimated that some 500 homes could be built from the scraps of the hotel. Residents of Palm Beach established the Society of the Four Arts on January 14, 1936, with Hugh Dillman becoming the first president. The 1930s decade also saw the construction of the Flagler Memorial Bridge, the northernmost bridge linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach, completed on July 1, 1938. Palm Beach mayor James M. Owens acted as master of ceremonies for the bridge's opening, while then-U.S. senator Charles O. Andrews and former U.S. senator Scott Loftin gave speeches during the event. Early in World War II, the United States Army established a Ranger camp at the northern tip of the island, which could accommodate 200 men. The Palm Beach Civilian Defense Council ordered blackouts in Palm Beach beginning on April 11, 1942. Throughout the war, German U-boats sank twenty-four ships offshore Florida, with eight capsized offshore Palm Beach County between February and May 1942. The Army converted The Breakers into the Ream General Army Hospital, while the Navy converted the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel into a U.S. Naval Special Hospital. On September 15, 1950, the Southern Boulevard Bridge opened, the third and southernmost bridge linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. Residents of Palm Beach elected Claude Dimick Reese (son of former mayor T.T. Reese and grandson of Dimick) as mayor in 1953. He became the only native-born mayor of Palm Beach in its history. In the 1950s, the town's population grew approximately 55.8%, from 3,866 in 1950 to 6,055 in 1960. Winter White House of President John F. Kennedy John F. Kennedy was elected President of the United States in 1960 and selected La Querida as his Winter White House, which his father bought in 1933. In December 1960, police in Palm Beach averted a retired postal worker's attempt to assassinate then president-elect Kennedy. The president would also spend the last weekend of his life in Palm Beach, several days before his assassination in November 1963. Yvelyne \\"Deedy\\" Marix became the first woman elected to the town council in February 1970 and later became the first woman elected mayor of Palm Beach in 1983. Between 1971 and 1977, Earl E.T. Smith served as mayor of Palm Beach. He was previously an Ambassador of the United States to Cuba. Preservationist Barbara Hoffstot published a book titled \\"Landmark Architecture in Palm Beach\\" in 1974. She personally photographed and summarized many older buildings in the town. The book also called for more awareness of and improvements to a system for protecting historic landmarks. The town council responded in 1979 by approving an ordinance establishing the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which identifies and works to protect historic structures. General Foods and Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post bequeathed Mar-a-Lago to the United States upon her death in 1973, hoping it would be used as a Winter White House. The residence would be returned to the Post family in 1981, before being purchased by then- businessman Donald Trump in 1985 for approximately $10 million. He would convert the estate into a club by 1995 and has used Mar-a-Lago as a Winter White House since the beginning of his presidency in 2017. A nor'easter in November 1984 caused the MV Mercedes I to crash into the seawall of Mollie Wilmot's estate. Wilmot's staff served the 10 sailors sandwiches and freshly brewed coffee in her gazebo and offered martinis to journalists reporting on the incident. On October 31, 1991, the Perfect Storm produced waves in height in Palm Beach. About of seawall at Worth Avenue was destroyed, while some parts of the town experienced coastal flooding, especially along Ocean Boulevard. By that afternoon, police allowed only residents to enter the town. The trial of William Kennedy Smith, a member of the Kennedy family, drew international media attention in 1991. Smith had been accused of committing rape at La Querida, but a trial at the Palm Beach County Court resulted in his acquittal on December 11, 1991. Another notable mayor, Paul Ilyinsky, son of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia and heiress Audrey Emery, was elected to the office in February 1993. The town's population peaked at 10,468 people in the 2000 census. In March 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department - under the guidance of Police Chief Michael Reiter - began the first inquiry into the crimes committed by infamous sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, leading to his arrest and indictment in July 2006. Despite an FBI investigation discovering at least 40 victims, the State Attorney of Palm Beach County would only charge Epstein with soliciting a prostitute and soliciting a minor for prostitution in June 2008. He plead guilty on both counts and received a controversial plea deal. The town had a population of 8,348 people in 2010, a decrease of 20.3 percent from the previous census. Palm Beach celebrated its centennial on April 17, 2011. Approximately 1,200 people attended a parade, with the parade route beginning at the Flagler Museum (Whitehall). Between February and December 2015, the Town Square, which includes the Addison Mizner Memorial Fountain and the town hall, underwent a $5.7 million restoration. The fountain's restoration would be named \\"project of the year\\" by the American Public Works Association's Florida chapter. =Name= The January 1878 wreck of the Providencia is credited with giving Palm Beach its name. The Providencia was traveling from Havana to Cádiz, Spain, with a cargo of coconuts harvested in the Crown Colony of Trinidad and Tobago in the British West Indies, when the ship wrecked near Palm Beach. Many of the coconut naturalized or were planted along the Palm Beach coast. A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what would later be named Palm Beach.  Geography  Palm Beach is one of the easternmost towns in Florida, though the state's easternmost point is located in Palm Beach Shores, just north of Lake Worth Inlet. The town is located on an long barrier island between the Intracoastal Waterway (locally known as the Lake Worth Lagoon) on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. At no point is the island wider than three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km), and in places it is only 500 feet (150 m) wide. The northern boundary of Palm Beach is the Lake Worth Inlet, though it adjoined with Singer Island until the permanent dredging of the inlet in 1918. To the south, a section of Lake Worth Beach occupies the island in the vicinity of State Road 802, though an exclave of Palm Beach extends farther southward until the northern limits of South Palm Beach. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of approximately , with land accounting for approximately and water covering the remaining . The average elevation of the town is ; the highest point is above sea level on the golf course at the Palm Beach Country Club. Geologically, the island is a sand-covered ridge of coquina rock. In the pre-settlement period, the island was environmentally characterized with a pronounced coastal ridge bordering the Atlantic Ocean. The Intracoastal Waterway coast was primarily low-lying and swampy; marshly sloughs generally lay between the two features, though an oolitic limestone ridge stood along some parts of the island's westward side. Since 1883, the environment has been significantly altered by developing land, the filling of the sloughs, and a receding coastline due to erosion. However, the Atlantic ridge is still the dominating topographical feature of the island and acts as a seaward barrier. The former slough areas are flood prone. The town and entire barrier island are located within Evacuation Zone B and evacuations are often ordered if a hurricane is forecast to impact the area, mostly recently in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Palm Beach town officials may deploy law enforcement officers to strategically place roadblocks to limit access to the island during unsafe conditions. As of 2016, land use of the town is 60% residential, 13% rights-of-way, 10% private group uses, 3% recreational, 3% commercial, 2% public uses, 1% hotels (not including The Breakers), and less than 1% conservation, while The Breakers is a planned unit development accounting for 6% of land use. The remaining 2% of land was vacant. Palm Beach does not have any land dedicated to agricultural or industrial purposes. The town is essentially built-out and cannot extend its boundaries. Conservation is mainly confined to Bingham Island, Fishermen's Island, and Hunter's Island. Functioning as bird sanctuaries and rookeries, the islands are leased by the National Audubon Society, though State Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund and the Blossom Estate holds the titles to the islands. A part of Blossom Estate Subdivision just south of Southern Boulevard is also designated a conservation area. = Climate = According to the Köppen climate classification, Palm Beach has a tropical savanna climate with hot, humid summers and warm, dry winters. The annual average precipitation is , most of which occurs during the summer season from May through October. In the wet summer season, short-lived heavy afternoon thunderstorms are common. Palm Beach reports more than 2,900 hours of sunshine annually. Although tropical cyclones can impact Palm Beach, strikes are rare, with the last direct hit in 1928.

High temperatures occasionally drop below , while at other times highs occasionally reach in mid-winter. The highest recorded temperature, , occurred on July 21, 1941, while the lowest observed temperature, , occurred on December 29, 1894. In some years, the dry season can become quite dry, and water restrictions are imposed.

Everglades Club has nearly 1,000 members. The club, which is very exclusive, does not have a website and prohibits cellphones. Mar-a-Lago is 126-room, 62,500-square-foot (5,810 m2) mansion that features many hotel-style amenities. Built between 1924 to 1927, General Foods and Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post originally owned the estate, but willed it to the United States government prior to her death in 1973 in hopes that the residence would be used as a Winter White House. Mar-a-Lago was returned to the Post family in 1981, before being sold to future United States president Donald Trump in 1985 for approximately $10 million.

The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks including WPTV-TV/5 (NBC), WPEC/12 (CBS), WPBF/25 (ABC), WFLX/29 (FOX), WTVX/34 (CW), WXEL-TV/42 (PBS), WTCN-CD/43 (MYTV), WWHB-CD/48 (Azteca), WHDT/59 (Court TV), WFGC/61 (CTN), WPXP-TV/67 (ION), as well as local channel WBWP-LD/57 (Ind.). Since 2017, the Palm Beach Civic Association has produced weekly video newscasts, known as Palm Beach TV, which have a weekly viewership of approximately 12,000. Many radio stations are located within range of the town. Radio stations WRMF (97.9 FM) and WPBV-LP (98.3 FM) are both based in the town of Palm Beach. Historic preservation The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), established by an ordinance approved by the town council in 1979, studies and protects historic structures in Palm Beach. Currently, the LPC has a list of 328 properties, sites, and vistas it works to protect under the 1979 ordinance. Similarly, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach is \\"dedicated to preserving the architectural and cultural heritage and the unique scenic quality of the Town of Palm Beach\\", according to its mission statement. The town of Palm Beach also conducts historic sites surveys in collaboration with preservation organizations, historians, and local officials, with the most recent survey completed in 2010, though a new survey began in November 2019. The 2010 survey identified 50 structures that had been demolished since the previous survey in 2004 and others that had been altered significantly. Federally, thirteen structures and one historic district have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, two of the designated buildings have since been destroyed. A fire and subsequent burglaries at the Bingham-Blossom House likely contributed to the owner's decision to have it demolished in 1974, while construction crews razed the Brelsford House in 1975 after trustees at the Royal Poinciana Chapel (the property where the building was located at) believed that \\"the aging structure was more of a liability than an asset\\" and also cited its high costs of renovation for public use, according to The Palm Beach Post. Infrastructure = Transportation = Lake Trail along the Intracoastal Waterway Three bridges traverse the Intracoastal Waterway, linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach by roadway. The northernmost bridge, the Flagler Memorial Bridge, is located along State Road A1A, which is locally known as Royal Poinciana Way in Palm Beach and Quadrille Boulevard in West Palm Beach. First opening in 1938, the bridge underwent a 5-year reconstruction and renovation between 2012 and 2017 at a cost of $106 million. State Road 704, also known as Royal Palm Way in Palm Beach and Lakeview Avenue and Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach is the location of the middle bridge. Named the Royal Park Bridge, it first opened in 1911 and was most recently replaced in 2005. The Southern Boulevard Bridge at the conjunction of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 80 (locally known as Southern Boulevard) is the southernmost bridge. First completed in 1950, the bridge is currently undergoing a $93 million replacement project, scheduled for completion in the summer of 2021. State Road A1A also runs northward through much of Palm Beach, beginning at the southern limits of the town as South Ocean Boulevard until being redirected onto South County Road, which later becomes North County Road. At Royal Poinciana Way, A1A turns westward onto that road and across the Flagler Memorial Bridge. State Roads 80 and 704 and U.S. Route 98 all terminate shortly after entering the town after intersecting with A1A. The town has no interstate highways, though Interstate 95 passes through the nearby city of West Palm Beach. Private vehicles and taxis are the predominant means of transport in Palm Beach. Incidents of profiling of lower-cost cars and minorities have occurred, sometimes resulting in tense relations between visitors and the town. The nearby city of West Palm Beach has two train stations. Tri-Rail and Amtrak serve the Tamarind Avenue station, while the higher speed Brightline serves the Evernia Street station. Palm Beach is located about east of the Palm Beach International Airport. The northern and central portions of Palm Beach are served by Palm Tran Route 41, which travels to places in the town such as the Lake Worth Inlet, North County Road and Wells Road, Publix (Bradley Place and Sunrise Avenue), Royal Palm Way (State Road 704) and South County Road (State Road A1A), and various points between. The route returns to the Intermodal Transit Center in West Palm Beach, which connects to several other bus routes and is adjacent to the train station on Tamarind Avenue. =Police= The town has its own police department, established on October 17, 1922. Prior to then, town marshal Joseph Borman served in the capacity of chief law enforcer as outlined in the 1911 charter. The department employed 61 officers in 2018. With a population of 8,295 people in 2018 according to the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research, this translated to 7.35 officers per 1,000 people, compared to the Florida average of 2.49 officers per 1,000 people. In the same year, the department made 2,039 arrests - equal to about 24,581 arrests per 100,000 people, the highest arrest rate in Florida and over sevenfold the state average. However, many arrests were in relation to non-violent crimes, such as those involving auto theft, criminal traffic citations, fraud, and scams. The police department reported no rapes or homicides in Palm Beach in 2018. =Firefighting= In its early days, the town of Palm Beach depended heavily on the city of West Palm Beach for firefighting efforts. The Flagler Alerts, a volunteer firefighting group which later became the West Palm Beach Fire Department, responded to fires in Palm Beach by traversing the Intracoastal Waterway via ferry or railroad. Delayed response times and high insurance rates eventually led Palm Beach to establish its own fire rescue department in December 1921. Today, the Palm Beach Fire Rescue has three stations, retains 82 employees - 75 full-time and 7 part-time, and annually responds to approximately 2,600 calls. =Utilities= Florida Power & Light (FPL) provides electricity to the town of Palm Beach, along with much of the state's east coast. As of December 31, 2019, FPL serves 5 million customers statewide, which is approximately 10 million people. Much of the electricity supplied by FPL is sourced from natural gas, followed by nuclear energy. The nearest FPL power plant is located in Riviera Beach, while the closest nuclear power station is the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant, situated on Hutchinson Island. Palm Beach officials have considered undergrounding at least since commissioning a 2006 study on the burial of electrical lines. In the subsequent years, undergrounding projects were initially performed by neighborhood on a \\"as requested\\" basis. However, following a 2014 town council meeting with FPL workers and a related voter-approved ballot question in 2016, it was decided that a town-wide undergrounding project would be undertaken at a cost of approximately $90 million. The project is ongoing as of March 2020. The town government provides and oversees sewage systems and wastewater treatment. Sewage is collected via of mainline pipes at the more than 40 pumping stations, which are capable of transporting over of water each minute. The sewage is then pumped into a regional wastewater treatment facility in West Palm Beach. Tap water has been supplied by the city of West Palm Beach since 1955, when the city purchased Palm Beach's water system, then owned by the Flagler Water Company. West Palm Beach provided tap water services to the town at no cost until the beginning of 1995. Recycling and garbage collection services are also provided by the town of Palm Beach. The former is taken to a transfer station, where the Palm Beach County Solid Waste Authority transports the garbage to a landfill in West Palm Beach. Vegetative yard trash is taken to two different sites in West Palm Beach.  Notable people  Mar-a-Lago, the Winter White House of President Trump The town of Palm Beach is also known for its many famous part-time and full-time residents. Prior to the arrival of Henry Flagler in the 1890s, a few wealthy or otherwise notable people already resided in Palm Beach, including businessman and Autocar Company founder Louis Semple Clarke and scientist Thomas Adams, a pioneer of the chewing gum industry. Earl E. T. Smith and Paul Ilyinsky, both of whom formerly held the office of Mayor of Palm Beach, were notable for other reasons. Smith previously served as an Ambassador of the United States to Cuba, while Ilyinsky was the son of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia and heiress Audrey Emery. Two United States Presidents have been part-time residents, John F. Kennedy and Donald Trump, with both designating their respective Palm Beach properties as a Winter White House. Kennedy's Winter White House, La Querida, was built by Addison Mizner in 1923 and previously owned by department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker of Philadelphia before Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. purchased the property in 1933. Trump has owned Mar-a-Lago since 1985, purchasing the property from the family of the late Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress of Post cereal. In October 2019, Trump and first lady Melania Trump filed to switch their primary domicile from New York City to Mar-a-Lago, officially establishing residency in Palm Beach. Additionally, former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney has been a resident of Palm Beach at least since 2003.

Shore stabilization The beach in South Palm Beach before Hurricane Wilma in 2005 From 2003 to 2016, there have been six shoreline and dune restoration projects for the town's beach. Since 2007, Palm Beach County has completed several engineering studies to evaluate long-term erosion control alternatives, including doing nothing. The Town of Palm Beach had completed its beach nourishment projects in 2016 pronouncing its \\"coastline is in pretty good shape.\\" No shore stabilization work was performed in South Palm Beach. Plans called for a $5.6 million \\"Southern Palm Beach Island Comprehensive Shore Stabilization Project\\" during 2019 and 2020 that was designed to rebuild about 0.67 miles of the town's shoreline. In early 2019, the County determined that the project was \\"cost prohibitive\\" and officially withdrew a request for the needed permits from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. With assistance from the Town of Palm Beach, a smaller beach nourishment option by trucking sand to feed the eroding town's beachfront may be possible in early 2010. Economy =Business= Palm Beach Oceanfront Inn (2009). The inn was demolished April 2016. Originally built in 1964, the Polynesian inspired, 58-room Palm Beach Oceanfront Inn and its ocean-front restaurant Tides Bar and Grille, located at 3550 South Ocean Boulevard, made up the only commercial business establishment within the town of South Palm Beach. It was described as \\"one of the last vestiges of old Florida along A1A.\\" Kosova Realty bought the inn for $3.3 million in 2002 and named it as Palm Beach Oceanfront Inn. Known to locals by its former name, the Hawaiian Inn, the two-story motel lost most of its beach during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and was not being maintained. A proposal by the Paloka family owned-and-operated realty company to replace the inn with a luxury resort- style 12-story condominium-hotel built over two stories of parking was unanimously rejected by the South Palm Beach Town Council in October 2007. The established comprehensive plan limits new buildings to six-stories over one- level of parking. On September 18, 2009, the Treasure Coast Regional Planning Council meeting expressed concerns about the redevelopment and recommended that the Town of Palm Beach should respond to negative opinions by its citizens prior to adoption of the amendments, as well as ensure that development approval conditions address problems with the use, height limits, and negative impacts on the beaches. The Paloka family tried to change the town codes to allow a bigger building such as a 14-story condominium and \\"were willing to build the town a public safety building and new town hall to sweeten the deal.\\" They increased business at the property during 2011 and were planning capital improvements, but foreclosure proceedings began. Kosova Realty filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2012. In November 2012, the operation was purchased by Paragon Acquisition Group of Boca Raton, a distressed property development company, with plans to improve and revive the facility, as well as \\"possibility of a development project in the future.\\" DDG then partnered with investor Gary Cohen of Paragon on the development. According to the CEO of developer DDG, Joseph A. McMillan, Jr., in 2012 a DDG affiliate paid $8.25 million for the site. Although the property has received minor renovations and is being managed as a hotel and restaurant, the long- term prospects for it are for condominiums according to the CEO of Paragon. The current zoning for oceanfront property in the town allows 33 units per acre, while a more dense project would require a referendum. Plans by DDG were announced for 30 residential units to be built above a one-story parking garage. The old motel and restaurant on the site were demolished in April 2016. Marketing for the new 30-unit building featured amenities such as concierge service, a dog park, and private jet service. In June 2018, the building \\"officially topped out, reaching its full height of seven stories.\\" September 2019 marked the completion of the building.

The Druid Hills-Druid Oaks area of western Dade City is served by a low power AM radio station operating under Part 15 of FCC Rules. The station known as Druid Hills Radio features Old Time Radio shows and news of interest to the Druid Hills neighborhood. It can be heard on 1710 kHz. In addition to Druid Hills Radio, Dade City is served by a community FM station operated by Saint Leo University. WLSL-LP can be found at 92.7 of the FM dial. History An earlier community known as Fort Dade existed nearby in the 1870s and 1880s, but with the arrival of the railroad, the businesses chose to relocate a few miles to the east to be near the railroad. The newer town became known as Dade City. The name became official when the Hatton post office was changed to Dade City on December 18, 1884. Dade City was initially incorporated in 1884 or 1885. That incorporation seems to have been forgotten subsequently, and the city was reincorporated in 1889. When Pasco County was formed from the southern section of Hernando County in 1887, Dade City became the county seat of the new county, first temporarily and later permanently, by a popular vote. The Pioneer Florida Museum, which opened on Labor Day, 1975, showcases the life of pioneers in Central Florida. Its artifacts and exhibits include a 1913 locomotive, a Methodist church, a house built before the American Civil War, an old school, and an old train depot from Trilby, Florida. The Hugh Embry Library, currently located on 4th Street, was started in 1904 when its namesake, then 25, was recovering from an illness. Embry had a strong desire to read, but at that time there was no public library in Dade City. He filled this need by soliciting donations from local households, leading to the development of a small library in the Embry home (now the site of the U.S. Post Office on Church St.). His efforts helped generate enthusiasm in the community for a more extensive library, culminating in the development of the Pasco County Library Association in 1905. After Embry's death at the age of 28 due to tuberculosis, the library initially faltered but was kept alive due to the efforts of active community members and civic organizations such as the Dade City Woman's Club. The library was relocated several times over the next five decades, finally ending up at the current location in 1963. The library underwent a complete renovation in the late 1980s, with the current building opening in 1991. The Crescent Theatre was Dade City's main theater from its opening in 1926 until it closed in 1950. It was located on the northeast corner of South 5th Street and Florida Avenue and the front facade/entry to the original building is still in place. Renovations have subsequently been made and the addition of a metal structure was completed in the 1990s. It is today used as a non-profit Senior's Services center. The Pasco Theater, on South 7th Street, operated from 1948 until 1999. The Pasco theater has since been demolished. Lawrence Puckett (1906-1985), mayor of Dade City from 1981-1983 and a member of the Dade City Commission from 1976 until his death in 1985, had his recollections published by the Pasco County Centennial Committee. They date from when he came to Dade City in 1925. Puckett describes Dade City before and after the Florida land boom as \\"a typical southern agriculture area, where the few well-to-do controlled the economy and the poor white folks and Negroes did the work for minimal pay. In other words, folks here were either quite well-to-do or very damn poor\\". Puckett's recollections also reconstruct Dade City as it existed during the Florida boom, with its various shops, streets, and buildings, most of which had changed significantly by the time he was writing. The Florida land boom meant that people were streaming into Florida, usually sticking to the Eastern Coast, but the economic effect was to drive up property prices all across the state. For Dade City, Puckett estimated that the top money making ventures were either real estate, business related to real estate, or the production of moonshine. The movement of people and capital into Dade City had a profound effect on its culture: > Country clubs and golf courses were being constructed with country folks > playing golf and dancing the Charleston. Wood lands and grazing lands were > developed into subdivisions with side walk &: streets built 9 miles in the > woods, which in most cases was about all that happened. During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was situated in Dade City. The prisoners were German soldiers who were in Rommel's Afrika Korps and were captured in North Africa. They made limestone bricks, built warehouses, and made boxes. The POW camp operated from approximately 1942 to the spring of 1946. The site is now the Pyracantha Park Civic Center.Horgan, James J., Alice F. Hall, and Edward J.

History In 1878, Isaac Hudson moved his family to the uninhabited brush of coastal Pasco County and allowed a post officehttp://www.hudsonfla.com/history2.htm to be established in his home. The town grew in the early twentieth century when the Fivay Company began cutting lumber and shipping it by rail to Tampa. Hudson stagnated when the Fivay Company went out of business in 1912 and people turned to the sea or moved away; shrimping and fishing employed about half of the working men in the 1930s to 1950s. W.L. Hendry came with his sons from Tampa and began digging inlets from the coast around Hudson Springs, using the fill to create a higher ground to put a few houses on in 1950.http://www.hudsonfla.com/history5.htm This was to become the Port of Hudson neighborhood. In the 1980s, people began building larger homes (most of which were mobile homes) along the canals. Now, while its older waterfront is reviving, large residential developments are spreading inland. Recreation Robert J. Strickland Memorial Park (Hudson Beach) was built in the 1960s and is the main beach for the Hudson community. Several restaurants in the area offer water views of the gulf or adjacent canals. Veterans Memorial Park and Arthur F. Engle Memorial Park are the main indoor and outdoor sports and recreation centers, with indoor gymnasiums, outdoor fields and an outdoor pool (at Veterans Memorial Park). There are also three semiprivate golf courses: Beacon Woods Golf Club, Meadow Oaks Golf & Country Club, and Heritage Pines Country Club. Hudson once proclaimed itself the \\"Gopher Racing Capital of the World\\". In 1977, William Trippett raced his Gopher Tortoise, ST. Pete Flash, to victories in the 8-10 year old division and also in the overall division. It was the 2nd year in a row that St. Pete Flash had swept the races in Hudson during their July 4 celebration. He won the women's division and overall title for Donna Trippett in 1976. Hudson also is host to a number of vacation resorts, including a \\"clothing optional\\" AANR resort. They provide camping and RV, including rentals. Lodging & Dining Inside of Robert J. Stickland Memorial is the Inn on the Gulf. The Inn on the Gulf is Pasco County's only beachfront restaurant, bar and motel. Also inside of the park is Sam's Hudson Beach Bar.

Dunne who previously had been chief justice of the Arizona territory.http://www.fivay.org/san_antonio.html Dunne was a legal counsel involved in the Disston Land Purchase, and as his commission, received 100,000 choice acres (400 km2) of land out of the 4,000,000 acre (16,000 km) purchase. The following year on February 15, while surveying the Disston Purchase with his cousin, Captain Hugh Dunne, he came upon a previously unsurveyed lake with crystal clear water. Seeing in a prayer book that it was the feast day of St. Jovita, he named the lake after the early Christian martyr.Horgan, James J. (1990). Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory. Saint Leo, FL. Saint Leo College Press. Judge Dunne selected the city's location on Jovita's western shore and began settling it in earnest. He established the city as the center of a Catholic colony in Florida. Dunne planned several other villages for the surrounding area including St. Thomas, Villa Maria, Carmel and San Felipe, but only the rural community of St. Joseph survives today. In 1889 the Benedictines established the monastery of St. Leo and St. Leo College on Dunne's former homestead and farm land, later incorporating the area as part of a separate town, St. Leo, Florida. At about the same time, five Benedictine sisters established Holy Name Convent in the center of San Antonio. The nuns had come to teach at two local schools (St. Anthony School and St. Joseph School), as well as to establish Holy Name Academy. The sisters had the convent and the academy physically moved by oxen to a 40-acre parcel in St. Leo overlooking the southwestern shore of Lake Jovita in 1911. The nuns remained at St. Anthony School until the end of the 2009–10 academic year. At the time of its founding San Antonio was located in the southern third of Hernando County, as Pasco County was not created until 1887. The Orange Belt Railway first began service to San Antonio in November 1887.A short history of San Antonio For a short time beginning in 1927, the city officially changed its name to the town of Lake Jovita, only to revert to San Antonio in 1933.

City officials speculated that the population that year was probably closer to 900, which would be more consistent with the growth reflected in data collected in other cities throughout the county, as well as Pasco County as a whole. The 2010 census count of 1,138 residents was considered to be much more accurate. Education St. Anthony Catholic School, est. 1884 San Antonio is home to two schools. Saint Anthony Catholic School (grades Kindergarten – 8) traces its roots to the Fall of 1883 when local widow Cecilia Morse began teaching colony children in her home. By April 1884 it was officially established as a Catholic school and is by far the oldest school of any kind in Pasco County. In fact it actually predates the county by several years. San Antonio Elementary (grades Kindergarten – 5) was founded 98 years later in 1981 and though its campus lies entirely within San Antonio's city limits, its mailing address is actually Dade City, Florida.http://www.fivay.org/saint_joseph.html Holy Name Academy (grades 1 – 12) was established in 1889 as an \\"all-girls\\" boarding school by the Benedictine Sisters of Florida, but moved to the neighboring town of St. Leo in 1911.

To the west of Clearwater lies the Gulf of Mexico and to the southeast lies Tampa Bay. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 107,685. Clearwater is the county seat of Pinellas County and is the smallest of the three principal cities in the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater metropolitan area, most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area. Cleveland Street is one of the city's historic avenues, and the city includes Spectrum Field and Coachman Park. The city is separated by the Intracoastal Waterway from Clearwater Beach. Clearwater is the home of Clearwater Marine Aquarium, where bottlenose dolphins Winter and Hope live. The global headquarters of the Church of Scientology is located in Clearwater. History Clearwater at daybreak, as seen from Clearwater Beach Present-day Clearwater was originally the home of the Tocobaga people. Around 1835, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after William Henry Harrison, as an outpost during the Seminole Wars. The fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clearwater Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development called Harbor Oaks. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1962 after Mark Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while planting a tree in his yard. The area's population grew after the Federal Armed Occupation Act of 1842 offered to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Early settlers included the Stevens, Stevenson, Sever and McMullen families, who claimed and farmed large tracts of land. Prior to 1906, the area was known as Clear Water Harbor. The name \\"Clear Water\\" is thought to have come from a fresh water spring flowing from near where the City Hall building is located today. There were many other freshwater springs that dotted the bluff, many in the bay or harbor itself. View north from Sand Key toward Clearwater Beach Originally part of Hillsborough County, the first road joining Clearwater and Tampa was built in 1849, which dramatically reduced the prior day-long commute between the cities. During the American Civil War, Union gunboats repeatedly raided the community's supplies, as most of the able-bodied men were away fighting for the Confederate Army. The town began developing in the late nineteenth century, prompted by Peter Demens' completion of the first passenger railroad line into the city in 1888. Clearwater was incorporated in 1891, with James E. Crane becoming the first mayor. The area's popularity as a vacation destination grew after railroad magnate Henry B. Plant built a sprawling Victorian resort hotel named Belleview Biltmore just south of Clearwater in 1897. Pinellas County Courthouse in Clearwater By the early 1900s, Clearwater's population had grown to around 400, ballooning to nearly 1,000 in the winter. Clearwater's oldest existing newspaper, the Clearwater Sun, was first published on March 14, 1914. Clearwater was reincorporated, this time as a city, on May 27, 1915, and was designated the county seat for Pinellas County, which broke from Hillsborough County in 1912. In 1915, a bridge was built across Clearwater Harbor, joining the city with Clearwater Beach to the west. Clearwater Beach, although located on a separate barrier island, belongs to the city of Clearwater and fronts the Gulf of Mexico. A new, much higher bridge now arcs over the bay, replacing the former drawbridge; the connecting road is part of State Road 60 and is called Clearwater Memorial Causeway. During World War II, Clearwater became a major training base for US troops destined for Europe and the Pacific. Virtually every hotel in the area, including the Belleview Biltmore and the Fort Harrison Hotel, was used as a barracks for new recruits. Vehicle traffic was regularly stopped for companies of soldiers marching through downtown, and nighttime blackouts to confuse potential enemy bombers were common practice. The remote and isolated Dan's Island, now the highrise-dominated Sand Key, was used as a target by U.S. Army Air Corps fighter-bombers for strafing and bombing practice. =Timeline= * 1888 ** Settlement of Clear Water Harbor founded. ** \\"Narrow-gauge railroad\\" begins operating. * 1891 ** Town of Clear Water Harbor incorporated. ** James E.

The theater's architect was Lester Avery and the contractor was John D. Phillipoff.New Capitol Theatre Finished and Opened, The Cleawater News, March 24, 1921 Avery is known for his architecture in Miami. Philipoff also built the Coachman Building (1916), the Donald Roebling Estate in Belleair (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979), the old Pinellas County Courthouse (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992), other historical homes which have been saved, and did work at the Belleview Hotel.Personals. The Evening Independent. December 26, 1923 Groundbreaking was December 6, 1920. The \\"New Capitol Theatre\\" was damaged in a storm on October 26, 1921 (so it had been completed). A theatre organ was installed in 1922, to accompany silent films with music. The organ was made and installed by the Robert Morton Organ Company. Donald Roebling was a frequent patron, having his own double seat installed at the theatre.\\"Old Days: Movie Houses Were King\\", St. Petersburg Times. April 8, 1981. The theatre was managed by various movie companies (EJ Sparks, Paramount, ABC-Southeastern Theatres, and Plitt Southern) and played the most recent movies of the day. The theatre also offered vaudeville on Friday nights in the 1930s. Headliners included Sally Rand, Fred Stone and his daughter, and Lum and Abner (of radio). The theatre was renovated in 1962. The Morton theatre organ was most likely removed during this renovation. When Plitt Southern did not renew their contract in 1979, Bill Neville and Jerry Strain tried to save the theatre with film classics and reduced prices. However, the theatre closed its doors on October 28, 1980. Royalty Theater Company signed leases with the Taylor family in February 1981 when it then became known as the Royalty Theater (Clearwater, Florida). The building was renovated with Ron Winter of Winter Associates as the contractor\\"Royalty Can Start Renovating New Home Now That Papers Are Signed\\", St. Petersburg Times. September 30, 1981. and Scott Musheff as the architect.\\"Royalty Theatre Off To Good Start At Capitol With Oliver\\", St. Petersburg Times, December 3, 1981. During the renovations, Bill Neville's murdered body was found in the balcony. The theatre remained in the Taylor family estate until it was sold in 1996. In July 2008 the building went into foreclosure.\\"Clearwater negotiating to buy old Royalty Theatre building\\" , St. Petersburg Times, October 5, 2008. In January 2009, the City of Clearwater and Ruth Eckerd Hall joined forces to purchase the theater (renamed Capitol Theater) as well as the neighboring Pat Lokey building. They plan to renovate and revitalize the historic Capitol Theater. Clearwater Public Library System In 1911, the city of Clearwater witnessed a vast population increase as well as acquiring telephones, electricity, paved streets, and an ice factory. It is during this time that the Clearwater Library Association opened a subscription library on the second floor of the local People's Bank. Its popularity and support led to the request of $10,000 from the Carnegie Foundation to build a public library. The building was designed by Tampa architect F.J. Kennard. In its first year, the library had over 1,277 visitors and 2,792 books borrowed. As a vacation town, the library provided free access to materials for all residents and winter visitors. During the Depression, the Clearwater Public Library faced many of the same threats seen at other libraries seen throughout the United States. This includes increased patron usage and dwindling budget. In the 1940s, the Clearwater library increased its staff from three assistants to five assistants. The library's collection also grew from 18,047 to over 100,000. To account for this increase, the Librarian and Board President Traver Bayly made an appeal to the City Commission for additional space. As a result of segregation, the Clearwater Public Library was for white patrons only from its founding in 1911 to the mid-twentieth century. In 1950, the City Commission agreed to the building of the North Greenwood library. Designed by Architect Eugene Beach, the new library access to many information sources to the city's African Americans population. This library was renovated in 1984. The new Main library was rebuilt beginning in 2000. It opened in May 2004. As the population continued to increase throughout the late twentieth century, the library system continued to grow. The Clearwater Public Library System now includes five libraries: Clearwater Main, Countryside, North Greenwood, Beach, and East. In recent years, the Clearwater Public Library System has become increasingly digital, providing patrons with access to computers, online databases, and an online library catalog. This was made possible by the Greater Clearwater Public Library Foundation, Inc. which formed in 1984. As a part of the library's Centennial Celebration, a project is commencing to add makerspaces to the libraries. The Main library's makerspace is the \\"Studio's at Main\\" and targets creative arts making. The Clearwater Public Library System is a contributor to the Pinellas Memory Project. This system of libraries is part of the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative which seeks to provide patrons with access to information and programs to benefit the community.  Clearwater Marine Aquarium  The Clearwater Marine Aquarium is a small non-profit organization and aquarium. Opening in 1972 on Clearwater Beach, the aquarium is most famous for Winter, one of their resident dolphins. Winter was rescued as a calf in 2005 and is one of the first dolphins to have been fitted with a prosthetic tail. Winter lost her tail soon after being rescued due to severe injuries as a result of entanglement in a crab trap. The CMA has two other resident dolphins; Hope and Nicholas. Hope and Nicholas were both also rescued as calves, though approximately eight years apart from each other. All three dolphins are permanent residents and are unable to be released due to concerns of how they would fare, lacking major survival skills usually taught by a calf's mother. The aquarium is also home to otters, pelicans, nurse sharks, and turtles among several species of fish and other marine life. CMA also assists in animal strandings and other emergencies regarding sea life. Animals that have stranded are rehabilitated, and if possible, released back into the wild once they have made a full recovery. It has been featured as the main setting of the American family movie series Dolphin Tale. Sports Spectrum Field in Clearwater is the spring training home of Major League Baseball's Philadelphia Phillies, as well as their High-A affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers. Parks and recreation Moccasin Lake Nature Park is a 51-acre nature preserve with a 5-acre lake that is owned and operated by the city. The preserve also features the Moccasin Lake Environmental Education Center, which offers environmental education classes, programs and camps. The Center features live rehabilitated birds of prey, reptiles, amphibians and aquatic wildlife. It opened in 1982. The City of Clearwater contains five pools: Ross Norton, North Greenwood, Morningside, the Long Center, and Clearwater Beach. Swim lessons are offered throughout the year to patrons, and the pools have both a recreation summer pool league and the Clearwater Aquatics Team. These pools have participated in the World's Largest Swim Lesson.

The operations were exposed in a Pulitzer Prize winning series of articles in the Clearwater Sun. Gabe Cazares, who was the mayor of Clearwater at the time, went so far as to call it \\"the occupation of Clearwater\\" and later characterized it as a \\"paramilitary operation by a terrorist group\\". The Church of Scientology targeted Cazares, attempting to entrap him in a sex scandal. Scientology also staged a phony hit-and-run accident with Cazares in an attempt to discredit him. Cazares and his wife sued the Church of Scientology for $1.5 million. The church settled with Cazares in 1986. The Church of Scientology's headquarters are located in downtown Clearwater. The Church refers to Clearwater as their \\"Flag Land Base\\".

The settlement was originally named Jonesboro by George Jones, the owner of the area mercantile. Two Scotsmen, J.O. Douglas and James Somerville, later named the settlement Dunedin after applying for the first post office in northern Pinellas County. The name is taken from Scottish Gaelic Dùn Èideann, the Scottish Gaelic for Edinburgh. With a dock built to accommodate larger sailing vessels, Dunedin became an important trading center and at one time it had the largest fleet of sailing vessels in the state. Dunedin became incorporated as a town in 1899 in part as a response to numerous complaints about pigs running rampant in the settlement, leading to a still-standing ban on livestock within city limits. By 1913, the town had a population of only 350.http://www.dunedingov.com/index.aspx?page=392 It became incorporated as the City of Dunedin in 1925. = Dunedin and the Roebling Alligator = During and shortly before World War II the Food Machinery Corporation factory in Dunedin (now demolished) was the primary site for the production of the Landing Vehicle Tracked developed by FMC Dunedin's Engineers and Donald Roebling of Clearwater from Roebling's own Alligator.William L.

The city of Dunedin contains a Parks & Recreation Department, which provides low-cost recreation programming to the city's residents. The city operates four recreation facilities, each one designed to provide resources for a specific age group. In 2007, Dunedin opened its newest and largest recreation facility, the Dunedin Community Center at a cost of just over $10 million. The project was mostly paid for by the \\"Penny for Pinellas\\" tax. The St. Petersburg Times wrote that Marston \\"figured that since the county needs recreation programs of its own and the city needs a new community center, why not ask the county to pay for the project in exchange for access to the new facility.\\" Marston's proposal marked a turning point for the city as it saved Dunedin taxpayers millions, and allowed Dunedin officials to replenish vital strategic reserves. The center features classrooms / multi-purpose rooms, dance and exercise rooms, fitness center, gymnasium, kids area, gaming room, library, playground, rental facility, stage.https://www.dunedingov.com/city-departments/parks- recreation/facilities/community-center The Dunedin Fine Art Center (DFAC), opened in 1975 has grown to be one of the most renowned centers for visual art instruction and exhibition in the southeastern United States. At nearly 40,000 sq. ft., DFAC houses 5 galleries, 15 studio classrooms, the Gallery Gift Shop, the Palm Cafe and the DLM Children's ART Museum. Tampa Bay Times writer Lennie Bennett says that DFAC is “the artistic equivalent of a village square,” offering quality experiences to people of all ages. Other recreation facilities includes: * Martin Luther King, Jr. Recreation Center - classrooms, game room, gymnasium, outdoor basketball courts, picnic area, playground, rental space, skate park, teen room * Hale Seniors Activity Center - ballroom event rooms, classrooms, meeting rooms, exercise room, computer room, game room, gift shop, rental roomshttps://www.dunedingov.com/city- departments/parks-recreation/facilities/hale-senior-activity-center * Dunedin Nature Center * Highlander Pool Complex/Kiwanis Spraygrounds - outdoor pool open from April to September * Dunedin Country Club - a semi-private golf course with memberships available and the course is open to the public. The course was deeded to the city of Dunedin for recreational purposes in 1930 by the Contract Investment Company.

The library is considered the oldest library in Pinellas County. In 1895 Christopher B Bouton, a resident from Cleveland, gave the city of Dunedin 200 books for public use. Mr. Bouton’s brother owned the town’s meeting hall but gave ownership of it to the Dunedin Library Association to house the public library and a reading room. The building became known thereafter as Library Hall. In 1935, the City of Dunedin took over the Library when the collection grew to be 7,000 titles. As the population of Dunedin and the usage of the library grew, the facility was in need of more space. Two new libraries were built, one in 1956 on Louden Avenue and another in 1964 on Main Street. In 1976 the Library leased and moved into a vacant space in the Douglas Plaza Shopping Center, which was purchased by the City of Dunedin for the Library in 1986. In 1989, the estate of Franklin Chase Milliken, a retired attorney, was left to the City of Dunedin to benefit the Dunedin Public Library. After years of planning, the City Commission approved funding for a 38,000 square foot building in 1994, costing approximately $3.5 million. Soon after the Library’s centennial in April 1995, the collection was moved into trailers while the old building was torn down and a new one was built in the same location. The new building opened to the public on September 3, 1996. As part of their offerings and services, the Dunedin Public Library offers monthly delivery service to homebound residents of Dunedin. Other offerings include a seed library where patrons can check out seeds for gardening, a knitting and crocheting group, and genealogy assistance. The Dunedin Public Library initiated a Little Free Library movement in Pinellas County. There are currently thirteen Little Free Libraries within Dunedin. The Literacy Council of Upper Pinellas, Inc., which promotes adult literacy in North Pinellas County, serves the Dunedin Public Library.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 13,591. The Oldsmar name dates to April 12, 1916 when automobile pioneer Ransom E. Olds purchased of land by the northern part of Tampa Bay to establish \\"R. E. Olds-on-the-Bay\\". The name was later changed to Oldsmar, then to \\"Tampa Shores\\" in 1927, and finally back to Oldsmar in 1937. Ransom Olds named some of the original streets himself, such as Gim Gong Road for Lue Gim Gong.Oldsmar Historical Society - Brief History of Oldsmar Oldsmar includes several parks along Tampa Bay, historic bungalows, a downtown, and a commercial area along West Hillsborough Avenue. The historical society operates a museum in Oldsmar, and the city erected a new library in 2008. It also includes a thoroughbred racetrack called Tampa Bay Downs. In hopes of returning to the days of \\"Old Florida\\", Oldsmar's downtown is currently undergoing redevelopment efforts. Oldsmar celebrates its history every year with Oldsmar Days and Nights, including parades, car shows (featuring the Oldsmobile), and carnival rides. Notable Oldsmar businesses include the nearby Tampa Bay Downs and the production office of Nielsen Media Research. Geography Oldsmar is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9.83%) is water. History There were only a handful of settlers in the area in 1916 when Ransom Eli Olds decided to purchase on the northern tip of Tampa Bay from Richard Peters. At the age of 52, the inventor of the Oldsmobile and REO cars embarked on a grand undertaking, desiring to turn this untamed land into a bustling community. He paid $400,000 for the property: $200,000 in cash, $75,000 in bonds, and a $125,000 apartment house in Daytona Beach. The town was originally named R. E. Olds-on-the-Bay. The name was later changed to Oldsmar. In 1927 the name was changed again to Tampa Shores before being renamed to Oldsmar in 1937. The early settlers sourced their drinking water from cisterns and individual wells. Cheesecloth was used to sieve out the mosquito larvae. The city built a tower in the 1920s, into which water was pumped every morning; sulfur water flowed from the taps. A faucet with St. Petersburg water was installed by the railroad tracks, becoming a popular source for drinking water. The nearest stores were in Tarpon Springs and Dunedin. Strategically situated between Tampa and St. Petersburg, Oldsmar was ripe for development. The long bridges across the bay had not yet been built and the shortest way from Tampa to St. Petersburg was through Oldsmar. Olds designed a community for working people rather than for the wealthy. He used engineers and surveyors from Boston to design a well-platted community, modeled after Washington, D.C., with tree-lined boulevards leading from the bay to downtown. A power plant that served parts of Safety Harbor, Dunedin, and Clearwater was constructed. The streets were paved with oyster shells obtained nearby. Olds named many of the streets himself. Woodward, Jefferson, and Congress reminded him of Detroit. Olds named Gim Gong Road after a Chinese American horticulturist from DeLand, Florida. Gim Gong was working on developing frost-resistant citrus. The streets of Oldsmar were unusually wide and more than of sidewalk were installed. Over the years much of the sidewalks was buried under a layer of sand. Advertisements glorifying the virtues of Oldsmar were placed in the Detroit papers. He used the slogan \\"Oldsmar for Health, Wealth and Happiness\\" and tried to entice northern companies by offering cheap labor. Olds spent $100,000 drilling the infamous oil well that yielded only water. It has been said that oil was poured into the well each morning to make it look like they had struck black gold. The well is now capped and sits on the grounds of the Tampa Bay Downs Racetrack. (There were three other such wells in Florida, one in Sarasota and two in the Panhandle, but none of them possessed the technology to drill through the Florida aquifer). Special excursion trains ran from Detroit. The first regularly scheduled commercial passenger flight in the United States began operation in 1914 between Tampa and St. Petersburg. A yacht serving liquor from the islands would bring prospective homeowners from St. Petersburg. A 60-room hotel, the Wayside Inn, was constructed in 1921. The first floor housed a grocery store, drug store, and hardware store. The first library in the city was started by the Woman's Club in 1919. In 1977 it was donated to the city and moved to State Street in the City Hall Annex. The first school in the city was located in a church at the intersection of Buckingham and Jefferson Avenues. Another early school had one room for first, second, third, and fourth grades; a second room for sixth, seventh, and eighth grades; and high school was in the hall. The post office was downtown in the middle of an animal park featuring alligators. During the 1921 hurricane, all the alligators escaped. Original city plans included a golf course and a luxurious hotel on the bay, but neither ever materialized. A sawmill and foundry that made cast-iron engines for tractors and grove heaters were though established. The mill produced the sturdy Olds Chair (also called the Oldsmar Chair), made out of either yellow pine or cypress. It was similar to the Adirondack chair and was sold throughout the United States. Olds provided financial backing for the Kardell Tractor and Truck Company to move into town. Renamed Oldsmar Tractor Company, Olds had hoped it would devise a machine to cut through palmetto roots, which had proven impervious to earth-moving technology of the day. Oldsmar had farms of dairy, peppers, tomatoes, corn, gladioli, and grapes. In the early days, it was not uncommon for cattle and hogs to run loose through town. A huge banana plantation was established on the bay, but the winters were too harsh for it to flourish for long. The waters at the northern end of the bay were clean during the 1920s and '30s. Fishing, oystering, and crabbing were popular. Townspeople could take their catch to the Rex Cafe to be cooked; fish fries and dances were weekly events. A casino was constructed by the bay, attracting busloads of people from Tampa and Pinellas County on weekends. The Oldsmar Casino later changed its name to the Two Bits Club. Oldsmar's pier stretched out a thousand feet into Tampa Bay and during Prohibition, boats loaded with coconuts concealing bottles of rum would arrive there. The pier was sturdy and wide enough to accommodate two cars side by side. The city sits on a plateau with an elevation never rising over above sea level. In 1921, the town was hit by a devastating hurricane. Large pine trees were uprooted and most of the town was flooded by water reaching levels above normal. Some of the city's oldest homes remain on Park Boulevard. Many homes still standing after the hurricane were moved by barge to St. Petersburg during the 1920s and 1930s. Olds had over $4.5 million invested in the community by 1923. When he realized Oldsmar was not growing as anticipated, he began liquidating his assets by first selling unplatted parcels of land. The racetrack was nearly completed when he traded it for the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater. The rest of the land was traded for the Belerive Hotel in Kansas. By the time Olds left town, he had suffered a loss of nearly $3 million. While Olds envisioned a city of 100,000, the population was around 200 when he left. Harry A. Prettyman, a St. Louis promoter, and his associates continued to sell lots in town following Olds's departure. Prettyman staged promotional gimmicks like Gold Rushes where pieces of gold were buried on a vacant lot and everyone got to dig for it. In 1927 Prettyman was caught selling underwater lots. To avoid scandal, the town of Oldsmar was renamed Tampa Shores. It wasn't until 1935 that the last of the property owned by Olds was finally sold.

As of the 2016 American Community Survey, the CDP had a population of 60,236. Culture Palm Harbor is located north of downtown St. Petersburg and west of Tampa. It is a largely residential community with several concentrations of commerce. Downtown Palm Harbor, north of Tampa Road between U.S. Highway 19 Alternate and Omaha Street hosts many small shops and eateries along with a handful of historic buildings. U.S. Highway 19, a mile or two east of downtown, offers access to higher concentrations of commerce, with an array of national chain restaurants and retailers. One entrance to Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club, a nationally regarded golf course and home of the PGA's Valspar Championship, is found on U.S. 19 just north of Alderman Road. The historic downtown district of Palm Harbor, at Florida Avenue and Alt. US 19 and CR 1, has numerous festivals and craft fairs. Old Palm Harbor Main Streets, Inc., a 501c3 not-for-profit organization, hosts their signature event the first Friday of every month. \\"Palm Harbor's First Friday Celebrations\\" are a popular community event for youngsters and adults alike. There are rides and games for the children, with opportunities to dine on food from the many local restaurants, enjoy local artists and crafters displaying and selling their wares. Annually, the first Sunday in October marks when the \\"Taste of Palm Harbor\\" festival is held. The event is presented by the Palm Harbor Junior Women's Club with the proceeds benefiting their \\"Making a Difference\\" grants & scholarships program. The Taste of Palm Harbor traditionally offers live music and the tasting of samples from over 20 local restaurants, many of which make seafood their specialty. Government Palm Harbor is an unincorporated part of Pinellas County. HB 183 - Town of Palm Harbor/Pinellas County, from 2009, was the most recent local bill that would have scheduled a referendum allowing Palm Harbor voters the opportunity to decide if they want to incorporate, but the bill died in committee. Pinellas County legislators had voted on January 22, 2009, to support a bill allowing voters in Palm Harbor to decide if they wanted their unincorporated community to become the county's 25th city. It passed over the objections of Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala, who said she was appearing in both her official capacity and as a Palm Harbor resident. The Legislature would have needed to first conduct a feasibility study to make sure cityhood made fiscal sense.Staff Analysis: Military & Local Affairs Policy Committee 3/23/2009 7:03:38 PM In 1985, the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners enacted County Code 85-28, which set into place the Palm Harbor Community Services Agency (PHCSA), a special taxing district to which tax was levied in the form of millage to provide for recreational and library services to the unincorporated community. The PHCSA board is a volunteer panel elected by the voters within the district to oversee the funding of Palm Harbor Library, East Lake Community Library and Palm Harbor Parks & Recreation. Recreation Palm Harbor has various recreational amenities. The area is home to John Chesnut, Sr. Park, located in the East Lake region, as well as H.S. \\"Pop\\" Stansell Park, located to the west of Palm Harbor Boulevard and overlooking St. Joseph's Sound. The Palm Harbor Community Services District also manages several sport complexes in the community: Steve Putnam Park, Palm Field, and Sunderman Recreation Complex. The community activity center is located at 1500 16th Street, managed by the District's parks and recreation department. This facility was originally constructed by Pinellas County in the late 1990s as a senior recreation facility, however lacked the funding to remain open and available to the community. The District received the property in 2004, and started youth, teen and adult programs, youth summer camps and community services. Palm Harbor is also the home to the White Chapel. This historic facility, which was under Pinellas County ownership previously, lacked the funding to keep its doors opened and was given to the Palm Harbor Community Services District in November 2012. Now managed by the District's parks and recreation department, the Chapel was completely restored and is the site for many banquets, weddings and community special events. Harbor Hall, the banquet facility built next to the Chapel, also serves as a banquet and recreational space. Geography Palm Harbor is located at (28.083926, -82.753947). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land, and (34.67%) is water. Palm Harbor has a unique \\"hilly\\" geography which is uncommon in Florida. History Palm Harbor was originally called Sutherland, a shortening of Southern Land and Development Company, the group that originally platted the community as Sutherland, Hillsborough County, in 1888. The name was changed to Palm Harbor in 1925. Palm Harbor was originally settled by area pioneers including the Thompsons ca 1865, the Whitehursts, the Hollands, the Tinneys, the Suttons, the Rivieres, the Bensons, the Roberts, The Billgores, The Severs, The Allens, the Aldermans and the Wilsons. J.C. Craver was the first Northerner to permanently settle in this portion of Hillsborough County. According to Craver's diary, still in the family, he came here in the winter of 1877 upon the advice of his physician. A post office commission under the name of Bay St. Joseph was granted in 1878, this being the earliest written record of the community. The name Bay St. Joseph was used only a short time before Yellow Bluff replaced it. But that name proved relatively short-lived, as a few years later its negative connotation with the yellow fever epidemic gave way to its present name. Palm Harbor was originally called Sutherland after a post office was granted in 1888, the same year the railroad came through. Sutherland boasted two beautiful hotels, the larger one becoming Southern College in 1902. It sat high on the bluff overlooking Sutherland Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. Sutherland was thought to be named after the Duke of Sutherland, who visited these parts after landing at Tarpon Springs in 1887. Local pioneers dismiss this coincidence, pointing out that the name Sutherland is a shortening of Southern Land and Development Company, the group which originally platted the community in 1888.

The population was 49,079 at the 2010 census. Originally home to northern transplants and vacationers, the hundred year old city has grown into the fourth largest city in Pinellas County, the most densely-populated county in Florida. The city and surrounding areas are almost completely urbanized. Pinellas Park contains a substantial portion of the Gateway area of the county, targeted for future infrastructure, residential, and commercial development as it sits roughly in the middle of the Tampa Bay area's over two million people. Though technically land-locked, its borders lie only a few miles from Tampa Bay to the east, and Boca Ciega Bay and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The city is known for its popular equestrian facilities and events, and many residents also participate in fishing and water activities in nearby venues. History The city was founded by Philadelphia publisher F. A. Davis, who purchased of Hamilton Disston's land around 1911. Promotional brochures lured northerners, especially Pennsylvanians, to the town, noting the pleasant climate in the winter and the agreeable agricultural conditions. The Florida Association, a corporation, set up model farms and offered a free lot in the city with the purchase of ten acres of nearby farm land. The primary crop promoted was sugar cane. By 1912, lots in the city were being sold separately. The City of Pinellas Park was formally incorporated on October 14, 1914. Though not on the original Orange Line Railway, Pinellas Park did have a train depot, razed in 1970, on the line between Clearwater and St. Petersburg. The city lay on the vehicle road from St. Petersburg to Tampa. Growth was moderate until after World War II, when the city's population more than tripled. Geography Pinellas Park is located at . Pinellas Park city limits are contiguous with those of St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, Seminole, Kenneth City, and unincorporated areas of Pinellas County. Annexation into the city is voluntary by both the property owner and the City Council. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.14%) is water. Because of the city's relatively low elevation between major bodies of water, and its generally flat topography, it has historically been subject to flooding. Through construction of a network of drainage canals and other measures by the Pinellas Park Water Management District, flooding in the city has been greatly mitigated. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 45,658 people, 19,444 households, and 12,152 families residing in the city. The estimated population in 2016 is just over 50,000.

The most popular of these events is \\"Country in the Park\\", a festival held every year generally on the third Saturday of March, but always after the Florida State Fair and Florida Strawberry Festival.

Library Mrs. Madalya Fagan was the first president of the library association, and through the efforts of this volunteer organization, the Pinellas Park Public Library was established in December 1948. Fifteen years later, the city of Pinellas Park took control over the library. Marjorie Trimble was the very first paid librarian, although it wouldn't be until 1967 when Ms. Harrop would be the first librarian who possessed a Master of Library Science degree to be hired. The first library building was located in Park Station, an old pump house in the middle of Triangle Park. The second library was then built at 5795 Park Boulevard, although that structure no longer stands. The current library was built in 1969, and is located at 7770 52nd St, across the street from City Hall and Pinellas Park Elementary School. The library was last remodeled in 2001 and has underwent several additions that expanded the original 7,000 square feet interior into 30,972 square feet, which includes over 26 adult desktop computers, 11 children desktop computers, a teen lounge, a quiet room, and two meeting rooms for rentals and programs. Barbara S. Ponce Public Library On June 6, 2014 the library was renamed in honor of late director Barbara S. Ponce. Mrs. Ponce was promoted to community activities administrator and library director in 1999. The job placed her over the Pinellas Park Library, parks and recreation, and media/public events.

Early history The area has been inhabited since the Stone Age. In June 2008, a 6,000-year-old spearhead was found at Marshall Street Park.Schulte, Eileen. \\"Ancient artifact found.\\" St. Petersburg Times. July 16, 2008. Online. July 19, 2008. The inhabitants of the area at the time of Spanish exploration were the Tocobaga people, who lived in villages around Tampa Bay. The adaptation of this culture relied on wild resources. Safety Harbor sites have yielded pottery, and artifacts of copper, shell, and stone. The Tocobaga were known for constructing various ceremonial and communal mounds to bury the dead. Most of these mounds were destroyed in the early 1900s due to development. However, one of these ceremonial mounds is still visible in Safety Harbor's Phillippe Park (see photo). Shells found in these mounds were used to pave city streets. In 1528 Spanish explorer Pánfilo de Narváez landed in the area, followed by Hernando de Soto in 1539. Safety Harbor (formerly known as Worth's Harbor and Green's Springs) was first homesteaded by Count Odet Philippe, a French nobleman who is credited with introducing the grapefruit to Florida in 1823. The name Safety Harbor originated from the early 18th century, when pirates were a substantial influence in the area. Once ships reached this area of the bay, all threats from pirates were gone, and it was commonly referred to as a \\"Safe Harbor\\". Springs Safety Harbor is the home of the historic Espiritu Santo Springs, or \\"Springs of the Holy Spirit\\", a natural mineral spring. Its waters were given this name in 1539 by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who was supposedly searching for the mythical \\"Fountain of Youth\\". Prior to the Spanish exploration of Florida, the Tocobaga and Timuquan tribes are believed to have fished and bathed in the spring's waters. In the twentieth century, Espiritu Santo water was bottled and sold commercially, and later a health spa and hotel were built over the springs. The Safety Harbor Resort and Spa, as it is now known, continues to be a prominent visitor attraction in Pinellas County. In 1964, the site was designated a Historical Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior and, in 1997, a Florida Heritage Landmark. Schools Safety Harbor Middle School There are two public schools within the city: Safety Harbor Elementary School for grades 1-5 and Safety Harbor Middle School (Home of the Seahawks) for grades 6-8\\\\.

History The region, with a series of bayous feeding into the Gulf of Mexico, was first settled by white and black farmers and fishermen around 1876. Some of the newly arrived visitors spotted tarpon jumping out of the waters and so named the location Tarpon Springs. In 1882, Hamilton Disston, who in the previous year had purchased the land where the city of Tarpon Springs now stands, ordered the creation of a town plan for the future city. On February 12, 1887, Tarpon Springs became the first incorporated city in what is now Pinellas County. Less than a year later on January 13, 1888, the Orange Belt Railway, the first railroad line to be built in what is now Pinellas County, arrived in the city.Tap Lines – History of the Orange Belt Railway During this time the area was developed as a wintering spot for wealthy northerners. =Sponge industry= Sponge diving mural at the Tarpon Springs Sponge Exchange. In the 1880s, John K. Cheyney founded the first local sponge business. The industry continued to grow in the 1890s. Many people from Key West and the Bahamas settled in Tarpon Springs to hook sponges and then process them. A few Greek immigrants also arrived in this city during the 1890s to work in the sponge industry. In 1905, John Cocoris introduced the technique of sponge diving to Tarpon Springs by recruiting divers and crew members from Greece. The first divers came from the Saronic Gulf islands of Aegina and Hydra, but they were soon outnumbered by those from the Dodecanese islands of Kalymnos, Symi and Halki. The sponge industry soon became one of the leading maritime industries in Florida and the most important business in Tarpon Springs, generating millions of dollars a year. The 1953 film Beneath the 12-Mile Reef, depicting the sponge industry, takes place and was filmed in Tarpon Springs. In 1947, a red tide algae bloom wiped out the sponge fields in the Gulf of Mexico, causing many of the sponge boats and divers to switch to shrimping for their livelihood, while others left the business. Eventually, the sponges recovered, allowing for a smaller but consistent sponge industry today. In the 1980s, the sponge business experienced a boom due to a sponge disease that killed the Mediterranean sponges. Today there is still a small active sponge industry. Visitors can often view sponge fishermen working at the Sponge Docks on Dodecanese Boulevard. In addition, visitors can enjoy shops, restaurants, and museum exhibits that detail Tarpon Springs' Greek heritage. In 2007 and 2008, the City of Tarpon Springs established Sister City relationships with Kalymnos, Halki, Symi, and Larnaca, Cyprus, honoring the close historical link with these Greek-speaking islands. =Historic sites= Old City Hall.

Tarpon Springs is known for elaborate religious ceremonies hosted by the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral, part of the Greek Orthodox Church, including the January 6 Epiphany, celebration that includes youths diving for a cross and the blessing of the waters and the boats. Since the first Greek immigrants depended on the sea and their boats for their livelihood, their attachment to a religious service centered on requesting divine protection for what used to be a highly risky job can be easily explained. The celebration attracts Greek Americans from across the country, and the city's population is known to triple in size for that day. The Metropolitan of Atlanta usually presides over the blessings, sometimes joined by the Archbishop of America. The blessings conclude with the ceremonial throwing of a wooden cross into the city's Spring Bayou, and boys ages 16 to 18 dive in to retrieve it: whoever recovers the cross is said to be blessed for a full year. =Tourism= The Spongeorama museum.

History Tierra Verde 4th of July celebration in 2020 Tierra Verde was once 15 islands covered with mangroves, pines and bush. These islands ranged in size from only a few acres to the largest, Cabbage Key, having over . For centuries, Native Americans used the islands for ceremonial and burial grounds. A marker remains on the east side of Pinellas Bayway, just north of East Shore Drive, where Native American relics were found in a typical shell mound, excavated when the road was built to Fort De Soto Park. The islands were sacred ground to Native nations as far back as 500 years ago, archaeologists suggest, and deadly conflicts occurred when outsiders trespassed. Then the Spanish explorers came. One explorer, Juan Ponce de León, came to the area in 1513, and again in 1521, when he received the wound that he later died from after returning to Cuba. Later, Narvaez and Hernando de Soto explored, and then pirates and buccaneers sailed the area, including José Gaspar, Juan Gomez and Jean Lafitte. A treasure was reputed to have once been buried here. In 1848 Robert E. Lee, then a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. army, recommended that Mullet Key be used for coastal defense in Florida. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, Fort De Soto was built on Mullet Key. Remains of the fort still stand, along with fortifications on Egmont Key. In 1948 the federal government sold Mullet Key to Pinellas County for park and recreation facilities, now Fort De Soto Park. Cabbage Key was documented in 1902 as the location where a particularly large alligator was caught, the specimen being reported as twelve feet long and weighing 431 pounds.\\"An Alligator at the Pass\\", Tampa Bay Times (February 15, 1902), p. 1. Human skeletons were also found on the island at one time, although early searches found no pottery.\\"Finds Skeletons On Pine Key\\", Tampa Bay Times (October 31, 1912), p. 5. A dredging project in 1913 filled in low-lying areas of the island,\\"Houseboat Changed Into Large Dredge\\", Tampa Bay Times (May 18, 1913), p. 1. and in December of that year the island was sold by owner Will Dent to \\"[a] syndicate composed of H.E. Dickens, E. Durant and others\\" for around $50,000.\\"Cabbage Key is Sold\\", The Tampa Tribune (December 20, 1913), p. 17. Early settlers to the area included Baltimore sea captain William Bunce and Silas Dent, who with his brother had a dairy farm. Dent lived on Cabbage Key until he died there in 1952. The Roberts family was among the early settlers of Pass-a-Grille and Tierra Verde. George \\"Florida\\" Roberts was a fishing guide for figures such as land developer Walter Fuller, Cecil B. Detre, and John Wanamaker. The thousands of tarpon caught by Roberts and his clients can be found as far away as Alexandria, Egypt, in the home of Sir Harry Rofe. By 1920, Cabbage Key had \\"a first-class dairy with 36 cows\\", as well as the first wireless tower in Pinellas County.\\"Inspect Dairy Which Supplies Pass-a-Grille\\", Tampa Bay Times (September 10, 1920), p. 1. Although two homes were built on Monte Cristo in 1923, and one in 1946, things were quiet until the mid-1950s when a Dr. Bradley \\"Doc\\" Waldron went to Tallahassee and persuaded the State of Florida to sell him Pine Key, Cabbage Key, Pardee Key and the surrounding bay bottom. This was about the same time construction of the old Skyway Bridge began. Waldron formed a partnership with two builders from Detroit, Hyman and Irving Green, who became majority owners of a group of 36 corporations. They named their island investment \\"Green Land\\". Waldron- Green Associates applied for a dredge-and-fill permit in 1957. Their intent: to pump some of sand and shells from the bottom of the bay and thus enlarge and raise the ground level of the three keys Doc Waldron had purchased from the State and join them to create one large island intersected with canals between the sections. Meanwhile, others sought county and state permission to dredge and pump the bay bottom and build up Bird Key, today's Bayway Isles and Isla Del Sol. Miami developer Leonard Ratner purchased land which became the site of Eckerd College. Hamilton Disston, the largest landowner in the United States, began and lost his Disston City development, later renamed Gulfport. At first, the only way to get here was by boat. A ferry ran from Pass-a-Grille to a dock at the end of Madonna Boulevard. Then the state developed its plans for the Bayway and financed it through a $16.8 million bond issue. The Greens persuaded the Department of Transportation to add a Fort De Soto leg and contributed the land on which it was to be built, thus assuring themselves of land access to their proposed Tierra Verde. The state's final road and bridge plans were approved in early 1960, and the developer's dredging permit was granted in December of that year. The dredging would create about of buildable land. Waldron-Green and their various partners and corporations then sold the islands, with the dredge-and-fill permits, to Louis Berlanti, a contractor from New York City, and his son, Fred. In 1960 Louis and Fred Berlanti arrived on the scene. By June of that year Louis was named president of the Tierra Verde Community Association, Inc.; Doc Waldron and H. D. Sluyter, of Dallas, Texas, were each appointed vice president. There was considerable speculation at the time as to exactly whose money it was that Berlanti represented. He was generally considered to be a \\"nominee\\" for Clint Murchison, Sr., the Texas oil tycoon, since both Murchison and Sluyter had been elected directors of the Association. One or more union pension funds were thought, by some, to be the real source of the new money. On June 30, 1961, the Tierra Verde Community Association Articles of Incorporation were filed with the State of Florida, and the original Declaration of Restrictions and Covenants were recorded in public records in August that same year. By December 1962, there was a road and a bridge to Tierra Verde. In January 1963, Guy Lombardo's Port O' Call Resort had its grand opening, where Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Liberace, Mel Tormé, and many other musical and theatrical stars would later perform. Two episodes of the popular TV show Route 66 were filmed there. The place was hopping with celebrities. Lombardo promoted the resort all across the country when the band did a 10-week national bus tour to more than 20 cities. Every show included several minutes to promote Tierra Verde and \\"his and the Murchisons' Port O' Call Resort.\\" All across the country, their bus had a Tierra Verde banner hung on its sides. Six months later, on August 16, 1963, Louis and Fred Berlanti died. The private airplane he was flying with his son was sabotaged and exploded over Lake Okeechobee, Florida, killing them both. Fragments of their bodies and their exploded airplane were found floating in Lake Okeechobee. Berlanti had suffered sizable real estate losses from Castro government property confiscations and had pledged half a million dollars to unseat the Castro regime. He and his son were members of the \\"United Organizations for the Liberation of Cuba\\". The St. Petersburg Times also alluded to \\"covert\\" local activities. With the death of the Berlantis, Tierra Verde was in the hands of the Murchisons for more than 14 years. Guy Lombardo and his band returned for only one more season, and was quoted as saying he had tried to strike a \\"new deal\\" with the Murchisons but had not succeeded. He never returned. Guy Lombardo died in 1977, the same year that real estate developer Frank E. Mackle III was elected president of a new venture called the Tierra Verde Company, a joint venture between Madonna Corporation (a Murchison interest), and Delverde (Deltona) Corporation. Because of lack of local interest, the Tierra Verde Company worked with a network of international brokers and sold many lots to overseas investors. But growth on Tierra Verde was still slow. However, in 1984 Pinellas Bayway got an exit ramp off Interstate 275, and Tierra Verde property sales increased greatly because of the easier access. In January 1985 Deltona turned the community over to the homeowners. Tierra Verde may have been named perhaps as much for the brothers Green as for its green land. Tierra Verde is a unincorporated portion of Pinellas County. Both St. Petersburg and St. Pete Beach have bid for annexation, but Tierra Verde voted to stay independent. The 15 original islands are now the present six areas of Tierra Verde: Monte Cristo, Entrada, Pinellas Bayway, Sands Point, East Shore (Bayview) and West Shore (Oceanview). In 1980 Tierra Verde real estate was valued at $15 million. By 1991 values had soared to $304 million. In November 1996 the Pinellas County Property Appraiser's Office evaluated Tierra Verde property at $349 million, 1999 values were listed at $478 million and in 2003 values are listed at $632 million. There are now approximately 2,000 single-family and multi-family structures on Tierra Verde, as well as a number of commercial enterprises. An estimated 2,500 families are expected when Tierra Verde is built to completion.

History The area of Treasure Island was originally settled in small communities by the Tocobaga around 300 CE. The Timucua traded with other Native American tribes in the area until the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez in 1528. De Narváez decimated the indigenous people before leaving the area in search of gold. Treasure Island got its name early in the 20th century, after several property owners attempted to boost sales of the properties being developed on the island by first burying and then pretending to discover a couple of wooden chests on the beach around 1915. After claiming the chests were filled with treasure, the news of the discovery quickly spread and people began calling the island Treasure Island.Treasure Island Florida.org accessed December 29, 2010. With an elevation of only three feet, the Great Gale of 1848 carved out John's Pass on the island's north end and split off two smaller islands, called the Isle of Palms and Isle of Capri. Treasure Island saw a surge in residential and hotel construction following World War II through the 1950s. The real estate used in these ventures often consisted of fill from dredged material; that is, artificial extensions of the land were created, which were usually designed for convenient access to navigable waterways. Legendary baseball slugger Babe Ruth had a winter beachfront home on Treasure Island after his retirement. Treasure Island today has a thriving bar and restaurant scene in its downtown. Climate Treasure Island has a humid subtropical climate, closely bordering a tropical climate, resulting in warm, humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and drier winters. Library The community is served by the Gulf Beaches Public Library, located in nearby Madeira Beach. The library is supported by Madeira Beach, Redington Beach, North Redington Beach, Redington Shores, and Treasure Island. These five communities have combined their resources in order to fund the library, which they would not be able to maintain individually.

Founded in 1851 as Fort Blount, the city was renamed in honor of Francis S. Bartow, the first brigade commander of the Confederate Army to die in combat during the American Civil War. According to the 2010 Census, the city had a population of 17,298 and an estimated population of 20,147 in 2019. It is part of the Lakeland−Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 584,383 in 2009. As of 2019, the mayor of Bartow is Billy Simpson.https://www.yoursun.com/haven/bartow-lake-wales-frostproof-pass- rollback-rates/article_c4e32d0a-e531-11e9-8f46-bbbf2b2f8f33.html Located near the source of the Peace River, Bartow is approximately east of Tampa, Florida and southwest of the Greater Orlando area. The city is near the center of \\"Lightning Alley\\" and has frequent afternoon thunderstorms in the summer, but typically has sunny and mild winters. Government, mining, and agriculture are the major sectors of the area's economy. The primary roads in the Bartow area are U.S. Route 17, U.S. Route 98 and State Road 60, which provide access to locations throughout Central Florida. The official city nickname is the \\"City of Oaks and Azaleas\\". Three districts within the city are on the National Register of Historical Places. Other historic landmarks include the Old Polk County Courthouse built in 1909 and Bartow High School, formerly Summerlin Institute, the oldest high school in the county. Summerlin Academy now uses the space and was named for the historic school. Although Bartow has been eclipsed in population, importance and name recognition by other cities in the county, particularly Lakeland and Winter Haven, the city has retained its small city heritage and its distinctive Southern culture. With the annexation of of former phosphate mining land owned by the Clear Springs Land Company, Bartow's population is projected to increase to over 25,000 by 2025 and over 45,000 by 2030. History A Spanish map of the Florida peninsula drawn in 1527 shows a native settlement called Rio de la Paz near present-day Bartow. Little is known about these Native Americans who made their home near present- day Bartow. It is likely that their population suffered high mortality from European diseases, such as smallpox and measles. The remnants of these pre- Columbian peoples probably joined the Creek Indians who migrated from the north to become the Seminole Indian tribe. The first non-Indian settlement in the area was a colony of Black Seminole, free blacks and escaped slaves who established Minatti south of Lake Hancock in the late 1810s. These \\"maroons\\", as they were commonly called, were slaves who escaped from Georgia and the Carolinas. The Black Seminole of Minatti were allies of the Red Stick Creek in Talakchopko, a village that preceded present-day Fort Meade. The Seminole leader Osceola had strong ties to Talakchopko. Many of the events leading up to the Second Seminole War were associated with Osceola and the Minatti war chief Harry. By the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, both Minatti and Talakchopko had been destroyed by US forces. The Benjamin Franklin Holland House located at 590 East Stanford Avenue The Armed Occupation Act of 1842 facilitated European-American settlement of the Florida peninsula in the 1840s, although the act prohibited settlement near the Peace River, as this was considered Seminole land. Enforcement of that part of the act was not strictly enforced; however, and settlers eventually moved into the area. As the settlement grew, the residents began to plant citrus trees and build one- room school houses and churches. In 1851, Fort Blount was established by Redding Blount. Bartow developed east of this site. At some point in the 1850s, Fort Blount was renamed as Peace Creek or Peas Creek, which was a translation of the Spanish Rio de la Paz of early maps. About a month after the secession of Florida in 1861, the state established Polk County from the eastern portion of Hillsborough County. A few months later, the American Civil War began with the Battle of Fort Sumter. Because of the turmoil of secession and the war, the county had no official county seat for its first six years. The state legislature had directed the voters of Polk County to choose a site for the county seat and mandated that the site be named \\"Reidsville.\\" During the war, the area's major contribution to the Confederacy was supplying food, particularly cattle and beef. The Union army and navy had effective control of the west coast of Florida, and many cattlemen retreated inland and formed the \\"Cow Cavalry\\" as a defense against Union troops. One of the wealthiest members of the Cow Cavalry was Jacob Summerlin. After Summerlin purchased the Blount property in 1862, he donated a large parcel of land to build a county courthouse, two churches and a school. Later that year, the town which had been known as Fort Blount, Peace Creek, Peas Creek, and briefly Reidsville, was permanently renamed Bartow in honor of Francis S. Bartow, the first Confederate brigade commander to die during the war. The L.B. Brown House located at 470 South Second Avenue Bartow recovered slowly from the war. The first Polk County Courthouse was built in 1867, which firmly established the city as county seat. Although Florida formally rejoined the union in 1868, the Reconstruction era did not end in Florida until 1877. The 1880s and 90s were a period of growth for the city of Bartow; from 1880 to 1900, the city would grow from 386 residents to 1,983. On July 1, 1882 the town was incorporated as a city. In 1885, the Florida Southern Railroad, a north-south route from North Florida to Southwest Florida opened in Bartow. A year later, the Bartow Branch of the South Florida Railroad, connecting Tampa and Orlando, was completed. The railroads were catalysts for growth of the area; during the Spanish–American War, the Bartow rail yards became a crucial part of the supply line directed at US troops in Cuba. In 1887, Summerlin Institute, the first brick schoolhouse south of Jacksonville, was built. By the turn of the century, Bartow had become the most populous city south of Tampa on the Florida peninsula – larger than Miami or West Palm Beach. The South Florida Military College Building As the city grew, a number of industries moved into the Bartow area. In the first few decades of the 1900s, thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the phosphate industry. Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States. Polk County was the leading citrus county in the United States for much of the 20th century and the city has several large groves. In 1941, the city built an airport northeast of town. The airport was taken over by the federal government during World War II and was the training location for many Army Air Corps pilots during the war. The airport was returned to the city in 1967 and renamed as Bartow Municipal Airport. For most of the 20th century, Bartow's growth was modest, especially in comparison to the rest of the county and state. While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach. Bartow's growth was also limited because most of the land surrounding the city was owned by phosphate mining companies, making residential growth impractical. Although Bartow had been the largest city in Polk county in 1900, by the 1910 U.S. Census, Lakeland had surpassed it in population. Bartow remained the second largest city in the county until sometime in the 1950s, when Winter Haven superseded it. In the late 1990s phosphate operations in the area moved southward, and much of the former phosphate land became available for sale. In 1999, Connecticut financier Stanford Phelps purchased the former Clear Springs phosphate lands east and south of city limits; he announced plans for an 18,000-acre development, the largest project in Polk County history. After nearly a decade of delays, the plan received final approval in 2009. The Clear Springs Development includes plans for more than 11,000 new homes, of commercial space, three schools, and a golf course. According to the Central Florida Regional Planning Council, Bartow's population is projected to grow to over 25,000 people by 2015. When buildout of the Clear Springs Development is completed by 2030, the population of the city is projected to be over 45,000 residents. Geography and climate =Geography= Flooding of the Peace River after a hurricane Bartow is located slightly southwest of the geographical centers of both Polk County and peninsular Florida. The city is approximately east of Tampa and southwest of Orlando. The cities of Bartow, Lakeland, and Winter Haven form a roughly equilateral triangle pointed southward, with Bartow being the south point, Lakeland the west point, and Winter Haven the east point. The city is located near the headwaters of the Peace River at Lake Hancock. Bartow is located within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal plain with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling hills. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2000 the city had a total area of , of which is land and (1.23%) is water. As a result of the annexation of over of undeveloped land, primarily the Clear Springs land, the area of the city has quadrupled to over with more annexation still pending. =Physiography and soils= Bartow is located on the South Central Florida Ridge, as classified by the USDA. Most soils in the Bartow area are sandy; other soils have sandy surface layers and clay subsoils, and the eastern outskirts of town have a clay-rich floodplain through which the Peace River flows. Drainage outside of the floodplain ranges from good to excessive for the most part except for a poorly drained band which cuts across the northern part of town. Much of Bartow is built on the Fort Meade soil series, which is well drained, high in organic matter, and rich in phosphorus, an uncommon combination in Florida, much appreciated by area gardeners. =Climate= Paths of hurricanes Charley (blue), Francis (green) and Jeanne (red) in 2004 Bartow, like most of Florida, is located in the humid subtropical zone, as designated by the (Köppen climate classification: Cfa). The climate of Bartow and other inland cities is slightly different than those cities on the coasts of Florida. Typically, the ocean or gulf tends to moderate the climate of cities on the coast. As Bartow is further from the coast than almost any other city in Florida, it tends to have higher daytime temperatures during the summer and cooler temperatures at night during the winter. Regardless, the climate pattern prevalent throughout central Florida is evident in Bartow: hot, humid summers with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and relatively drier and mild winters. On average, a tropical system brings hurricane-force winds to the Polk County area less than once every ten years, although the 2004 hurricane season in which three hurricanes hit within 44 days was a case study in the law of averages. Until 2004, the most recent storm to bring hurricane- force winds to the Bartow area had been Hurricane Donna in 1960. While Florida's vulnerability to hurricanes is well known, hurricanes are not the most common severe weather threat seen in the Polk County area. The area is in the center of \\"lightning alley\\", the most concentrated lightning strike area in the United States. Lightning is not the only threat from central Florida thunderstorms. The more severe storms bring the threat of tornadoes, although Florida tornadoes very rarely reach the size of those elsewhere in the United States. Even hail is not out of the question; one storm in March 1996 caused a one-foot accumulation of hail in areas of Bartow. Freezes are an occasional occurrence in the Bartow area and can be a problem if temperatures remain below freezing for a sustained period of time. On average, the area can expect freezing temperatures every other winter. Snow is a rare phenomenon in the area, perhaps a few times every century. Demographics As of the 2010 census, there were 17,298 people; 6,254 households; and 4,218 families residing in the city. The population density was 377.1 inhabitants per square mile of land (976.7/km2). There were 7,130 housing units at an average density of 155.4 per square mile of land(402.5/km2). Of those who identified themselves with one race, the population was 67.6% White, 23.7% African American, 0.3% Native American, 1.1% Asian (0.6% Indian, 0.1% Filipino), 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 4.7% from other races; 2.03% were from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.7% of the population, including 9.5% of the population who identified as Mexican. There were 6,254 households, of which 67.4% were families (one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption), 27.4% consisted of individuals, 35.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.2% were heterosexual married couples living together, 18.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 3.12. Among housing units, 87.7% were occupied and 1.4% were for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use; 63.5% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied and 36.5% were occupied by renters. The median age was 36.2 years; 25.8% under the age of 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 26.0% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 14.8% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 males there were 112.6 females. For every 100 males age 18 and over, there were 120.1 females. According to the American Community Survey (2009-2013), the median income for a household in the city was 44,297, and the median income for a family was 56,009. Among full-time, year-round workers, males had a median income of $39,540 versus $32,076 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,994. About 17.2% of families and 22.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.9% of those under age 18 and 13.3% of those age 65 or over. The estimated population on April 1, 2014 was 17,637. =Religion= The historic Homeland Methodist Church just south of town The first two churches built in town, the First Baptist and the First Methodist churches, were constructed on land given by the city founder Jacob Summerlin in 1867. Jacob Summerlin was known as the \\"King of the Crackers\\" and owned much of the land located around Bartow. These churches, although not housed in the original buildings, are still extant today. In 1919, more than 8,000 people came to Bartow to hear former baseball star and traveling evangelist Billy Sunday preach, which was twice as much as the population of Bartow and more than the population of the county's largest city Lakeland at the time. As of 2010, there are more than 70 churches within the Bartow area. Like most of the Bible Belt, Bartow has a high number of people affiliated with evangelical Protestant denominations with over 62% of churchgoers belonging to evangelical denominations. According to data published by the Glenmary Research Center in 2000, the denomination which has the largest number of adherents in Bartow is the Southern Baptist Convention with 27%, followed by the Roman Catholic church with 19%. Pentecostal/Charismatic churches are also prominent making up 17% of Bartow's church attendance. The Pentecostal experience known as the Lakeland revival, which attracted controversy for its claims of supernatural healing, was started up the road at the Carpenter's Home Church in Lakeland. Other churches which have a presence in Bartow include the United Methodist Church at 9%, and the Episcopal and Lutheran churches with 2% apiece. While there are no synagogues in town for Jewish Bartownians, Temple Emanuel is a conservative synagogue only away in Lakeland. There are two Muslim mosques and a Hindu temple in the county. Economy Stuart Building, downtown Bartow The economy of Bartow is driven by four sectors: government, mining, agriculture, and tourism. While Bartow's population is less than 20,000, it is shaped by its proximity to several large centers of population. Within a radius of the center of town, there are close to 8 million people. The dominant force in the economy of Bartow is city, county and state government. As a small city which is the seat of a county with over half a million people, Bartow has an unusually large number of government jobs. In addition to city and county offices, there are also a number of regional, state, and federal offices located within Bartow city limits. Nine of the seventeen largest employers in Bartow are government entities. The largest by far is the Polk County School Board with over 12,000 employees. Other county entities which employ many people in the Bartow area include the county commission, the sheriff's department, the clerk of court, the tax collector, and the property appraiser. The Florida Department of Transportation District One office is located in Bartow and is responsible for southwest Florida's transportation needs. There are several large businesses with headquarters elsewhere which were founded in Bartow. The large international law firm of Holland & Knight was founded in Bartow in 1929. What eventually become the large Burdines and Sons department store chain was founded in Bartow in 1896 as Payne and Burdines. A couple years after opening his store, William M. Burdines opened a store in Miami and relocated his operations there. The current Polk County Courthouse Phosphate mining has been a major player in Bartow's economy since the discovery of phosphate rock in 1881. Polk County is part of the Bone Valley which is the richest source of phosphate rock in the world; 75% of the United States's supply and 25% of the world's supply come from the Bone Valley. The largest employer in the phosphate industry is Mosaic which employs over 3,000 people in the area. In terms of area, Polk County has dedicated to agriculture. According to the US Census of Agriculture, Polk County is the top citrus production county in Florida. Polk County is also ranked second in the state in production of honey and fourth in number of heads of cattle. Since 1997 the new bumper crop in the area is blueberry. From 2000−07 the area has more than doubled its production of blueberries and accounts for more than 35% of the state's production of the fruit. While spring is usually a \\"dead\\" time for every other blueberry growing area in North and South America, Polk County blueberries peak from March to May. Although there are no major tourist attractions in the immediate Bartow area, the city is located less than from both the Walt Disney World Resort and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. The city is also less than from Legoland Florida in Winter Haven and Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales. As a city with many historical sites dating back over 100 years, Bartow is also a point of interest for those interested in historical sites and monuments. Culture The sign at the northwest entrance of Bartow on US 98 =Annual festivals and other events= There are several annual events in the Bartow area which have a long tradition. Many of these are large events which draw people from other communities to the city such as the Cricket Club Halloween Parade and Carnival held each year since 1942 or the annual Fourth of July Celebration held at Mosaic Park. The Bloomin' Arts Festival is an art show held in early March by the Bartow Art Guild. Every February brings the Annual L.B. Brown Festival at the L.B. Brown House on L.B. Brown Avenue (formally Second Avenue). Bartow's discarded natural Christmas trees are piled around a telephone pole for the annual New Year's Eve bonfire, a unique tradition spanning more than seven decades which has sometimes been covered by national media. The Polk County Arts Alliance based in Bartow is designated the official Art Agency by the county commission and is in charge of furthering the performing arts in the county. The Bartow Performing Arts Series sponsors five performances every year.

On the third Friday of every month, Main Street is blocked off for Friday Fest at 6 p.m. for a night of live music and entertainment, informally known as \\"Tow Jam\\" by natives. =Historic buildings and landmarks= The Swearingen HouseThe city's Historic Architecture Review Board is responsible for the preservation, enhancement and promotion of historic buildings, landmarks and districts within the city. Three districts in the city, the Bartow Downtown Commercial District, the Northeast Bartow Residential District, and the South Bartow Residential District have been designated as historic districts. New construction within these districts is regulated by the board and they have the power to veto construction which might alter the character of the neighborhood. While the towering oaks and ever-present azalea bushes which spawned the city's nickname give many of the historic landmarks of the city a distinctive Southern \\"look and feel\\", many styles of architecture are represented in Bartow's historic buildings. The South Bartow and Northeast Bartow historic districts are characterized by masonry vernacular and various revival styles, while downtown is dominated by frame vernacular and classical revival styles. Other buildings on the National Register of Historic Places with distinctive architectural styles include the Thompson and Company Cigar Factory built in a Mission Revival Style and the L.B. Brown House built with distinctive Victorian ornamentation. The L.B. Brown House is notable as perhaps the only house still standing in Florida built by a freedman. The Old Polk County Courthouse, Bartow's most recognizable symbol seen on its city seal, was built in 1909 in a neoclassical style. Florida Senator Spessard L. Holland was born in Bartow. His home is located on South Broadway 2 blocks north of Bartow High School. Senator Holland was a founding member of the Holland and Knight Law Firm. The firm's original office was located on South Central Avenue across the street from the Bartow Post Office. There are several other notable buildings in Bartow which are not on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wonder House at 1075 Mann Road features natural air-conditioning (using rainwater), secluded outdoor bathtubs, and numerous mirrors that let occupants see who is at the door from other parts of the home. The current owners of the Wonder House are restoring it and plan to open a museum. The Thomas Lee Wilson House, also known as the Stanford Inn, at 555 East Stanford Street was the \\"Sultenfuss Funeral Parlor\\" in the movie My Girl. The house at 935 South Oak Avenue known as \\"Windsweep\\" was the residence used in the movie China Moon. Sports and recreation Many of the recreational opportunities in the area are outdoor activities designed to take advantage of the warm subtropical climate. There are eighteen parks in the City of Bartow Department of Parks and Recreation. Mary Holland Park, named after the wife of former Florida governor Spessard Holland, is a park with three lakes, a playground, an overnight camping area, and a skateboard park. The Bartow Civic Center is a complex with meeting rooms, concert facilities and a public pool. Bartow Park is a complex with softball, baseball and soccer fields and a track for remote control cars.

The Tour de Tow is an annual cycling tour held in September. The Fort Fraser Trail is a path leading from Bartow to South Lakeland. The path follows a converted CSX railroad line and is popular with area cyclists, joggers, and in-line skaters. Plans have been made to build a replica of the historic Fort Fraser along the path, as well as adding historical markers. Five picnic areas and six rest shelters are available along the path. Polk County has over 550 lakes. Most of these lakes were formerly strip mines; they are closed to the public, only 88 of the lakes are open to the public via boat ramp access. The area has a national reputation for largemouth bass fishing and there are tournaments held weekly almost year-round. Some of the lakes on the east side of Bartow offer anglers the opportunity to catch 50 largemouth bass a day. Government and politics =Municipal government= Bartow City Hall The City of Bartow has a commission-manager form of government. The city commission consists of five commissioners, each elected for a three-year term. The mayor is a member of the city commission elected annually by the commissioners, although traditionally the position is rotated. As of 2019, the mayor of Bartow is William “Billy” Simpson. Other commissioners are James F. Clements, Leo Longworth, Scott Sjoblom and Trish Pfeiffer. The city executive powers rest with the city manager, as contracted by the city commission. In 2010, the city's budget was $74.2 million. Electricity, waste disposal and water are municipal services provided by the city of Bartow to residents in city limits and nearby areas. Bartow is part of the Southwest Florida Water Management District and in times of drought, the city strictly enforces the restrictions set forth by the district. Although it is a private entity outside of the city limits of Bartow, the Bartow Executive Airport is governed and administrated by the city commission which convenes as the Bartow Airport Authority. As of 2016, the Bartow Police Department has five sergeants, twenty officers, three K-9 officers, two school resource officers, two public safety aides, and one parking enforcement specialist, while the Bartow Fire Department has 18 full-time firemen.

The I-4 corridor is seen by political analysts as the most politically competitive part of the state. Polk is considered the most conservative county in the corridor. Even though the majority of the residents of Bartow are members of the Democratic Party, outnumbering the Republican Party in party affiliation (53.3% to 31.7%), voters tend to support Republicans in most state and federal elections. In 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain's lead over Democrat Barack Obama (53.6% to 46.5) in the city was larger than that of both the county and state. All of Bartow's local representation in the state and federal legislatures are members of the Republican Party. Bartow is represented in the state Florida House of Representatives by Ben Albritton. In the Florida Senate, Bartow is represented by Denise Grimsley.

Main Street Bartow, FL 33830\\" Education The Summerlin Building at Bartow High School The schools in Bartow are operated by the Polk County School Board, although several of them predate the establishment of the school board, and were autonomous at one time. Bartow High School, formerly Summerlin Institute, is the oldest high school in the county and one of the oldest high schools in the state of Florida. In 1923 Union Academy, became the first African-American high school in Polk County. Court-ordered integration began in Bartow during the fall of 1969, and the former black high school Union Academy became a middle school. In 1971, Summerlin Institute officially became Bartow High School, a name it had been known as informally at least since the early 1900s. There are currently seven elementary schools and two middle schools which are feeder schools of Bartow High School. Located at the campus of Bartow High School is the International Baccalaureate School of Polk County which offers an academically challenging environment and the Summerlin Academy which offers a military-oriented education. It is expected that the rapid growth of the Clear Springs development will necessitate the building of at least two elementary schools and a middle school within the next twenty years. As part of this development, a new Polk State College campus called The PSC Advanced Technology Center at Clear Springs is projected to open by 2012. This campus will be located near the intersection of State Road 60 and 80 Foot Road. While there are currently no colleges or universities in Bartow, there are several within a radius of Bartow. The nearest university, University of South Florida Polytechnic is located northwest of city limits in Lakeland on a joint campus with Polk State College.Florida Southern College and Southeastern University are also located in Lakeland.

The dominant daily newspaper is The Ledger out of Lakeland, although the Tampa Tribune, the News Chief out of Winter Haven, Florida and the Orlando Sentinel have some circulation in town. Transportation The street grid of Bartow is a typical four quadrant grid with Main Street as the east-west axis and Broadway Avenue as the north-south axis. Broadway is co-signed with U.S. Route 98 in the northern commercial district and leads southward into the center of town before heading into one of the older residential sections of town. Main Street is the old State Road 60 leading into the historic heart of downtown Bartow. The primary numbered routes going through Bartow are State Road 60 and U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 98. State Road 60 is a major state highway leading to both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and is the major east-west route through town. Originally traveling along Main Street, State Road 60 now follows Van Fleet Drive bypassing the downtown area, and is commonly known as \\"the 60 Bypass\\" by locals. Heading east on State Road 60 leads to Lake Wales and on to Vero Beach, while westbound leads to Mulberry and eventually Tampa. U.S. 17 is the main north-south route on the east side of town. It is a four lane divided highway leading north to Winter Haven and south to Fort Meade. U.S. 98 is cosigned with U.S. 17 until its intersection with SR 60. Briefly cosigned with State Road 60 until its intersection with Broadway Avenue. US 98 then turns northward onto Broadway Avenue heading towards Lakeland. State Road 570, known as the Polk Parkway, is a toll road located (10 km) north of city limits on U.S. 98. The Polk Parkway provides direct freeway access to Tampa and Orlando via Interstate 4. The explosive growth expected in the area in the next few decades has created a need for a reexamination of the area's transportation infrastructure. The Central Polk Parkway is a proposed limited access highway that would connect the Polk Parkway with U.S. 17 and State Road 60. The Northern Bartow Connector, which was expected to be completed by 2015 but was shelved as of 2016, is a partial loop around the north part of town connecting U.S. 98 with State Road 60 east of town. However, the portion connecting U.S. 98 and U.S. 17 was completed in 2013. For aviation needs, Bartow Executive Airport is available.

History The settlement in the area now known as Davenport was established in 1838 when the U.S. military set up Fort Davenport during the Second Seminole War, about 12 miles north of the present site of Davenport. The fort was one of a number built at 20 mile intervals along a trail from Fort Brooke to Fort Mellon. The fort only lasted a few years. The fort was named for Colonel William Davenport, who served as the local U.S. commander in the war. There is no known documentary evidence to support an alternative claim that the city was named for a railroad conductor. The modern city of Davenport had its start in the 1880s when the South Florida Railroad was extended to that point. The settlement was first known as Horse Creek, for the creek first recorded on a U.S. Army survey of 1849 which flows past the site to enter Snell Creek and eventually Lake Hatchineha in the Kissimmee River system. A post office was established at Horse Creek in 1884, and the name of the post office was changed to Davenport in 1886. Davenport was incorporated in 1915. The South Florida Railroad opened a station half a mile north of the present site of the city. In 1926, it was replaced by a new station in the downtown area. It was later closed in the 1970s. From 1958 to 1986 there was a second station, the Vertagreen Railroad Station, opened only for the transportation of fertilizer and not for public use. Geography and climate Davenport is located at .

Fort Meade is home to Fort Meade Middle-Senior High School, several historic buildings, Streamsong resort and Patterson Park. The area is popular with kayakers and canoers. History Fort Meade is the oldest city in Polk County, dating its origins to 1849 when it was established along a new military road from Tampa (Fort Brooke) to Fort Pierce following the Second Seminole War. The town and road were originally sited by then-lieutenant George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, whose commander named it for him. The 1880s business district was located on old Wire Street (now Broadway), which was a casualty of four devastating fires. Today, there are over 150 buildings which are designated as landmarks. In the 1890s the Fort Meade Street Railway operated a horse-drawn service in the town. The earliest known burial is John I. Hooker (1821–1862) located in the town's Evergreen Cemetery. Fort Meade's Christ Church (Episcopal) located at 526 North Oak, was built in 1889. It is a frame vernacular with Gothic Revival elements and was designed by architect J. H. Weddell. Located within the historic district, the church was used for the HBO motion picture Judgment, featuring Blythe Danner, Keith Carradine and Jack Warden (1990). Future Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was stationed at the fort in 1851. The town was burned by Union forces in 1864 and all of the original structures were destroyed, except the second fort which was dismantled in the 1890s.

Library The Fort Meade Public Library is a member of the Polk County Library Cooperative. The library is located at 75 East Broadway Fort Meade, Florida 33841. The library aims to host educational opportunities and encourage literacy in the community of Fort Meade. =History= The Fort Meade Public Library was founded in 1934 by the Fort Meade's Woman Club. Although there was not enough space to house a library at the Woman's Clubhouse, Mr. Ben Johnson, a real estate broker offered a vacant room at 212 West Broadway free of charge for the library. Club members solicited others in the community to donate books and magazines and club members donated their own materials. The library was run by club member volunteers and was open only a few days out of the week. After several years, the library outgrew its space and moved to a room on the second floor of city hall. Mrs. T.K. White managed the library and kept it open 15 hours a week but after a few years, the library once again needed to move. The Woman's Club received permission to use the abandoned Chamber of Commerce building on 75 East Broadway for the public library. After failed efforts to receive state funding for the library Mr. Grady Courtney, city manager called a meeting for the city to take over the responsibility of the library. The vote was unanimous in favor of the public library and on May 1, 1965, Mrs. Codey Shirley took over management of the library, implementing the Dewey Decimal System. The library at this time had 4,000 resources and received a 200 book donation from Bartow Public Library. A new library building was completed in 1976. The Fort Meade Public Library is the first library to become a member of the Polk County Library Cooperative.

The city is located in southern Polk County on the Lake Wales Ridge. The population was 2,992 at the 2010 census. As of 2018, the population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau is 3,273. It is part of the Lakeland-Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The settlement in the area now known as Frostproof was established in 1850. This settlement, like many in central Florida at the time, was set up as a fort and was called Fort Clinch. This settlement was abandoned only months later. By the 1880s, Frostproof began to see its first permanent settlers as homesteaders were attracted to the abundant hunting in the area which included much deer and turkey, as well as ample fishing. The name was a marketing ploy to convince potential landowners that the town has never had, and never would have, a frost that could destroy the large citrus-driven economy. However, only a couple of years later, a frost killed most of the citrus in Frostproof. Prior to being named Frostproof, the town was named Keystone City. However, after being confused regularly with Keystone Heights, a city in North Florida, Frostproof was coined. W.H. Overocker applied for the first post office here in 1892, with a name of Keystone City. Postal authorities disallowed it because there was already a Keystone Heights in Florida. Joseph Washington Carson suggested Frostproof as a substitute, but Overocker instead chose Lakemont. Carson's choice of Frostproof was based on the town's relatively minor damage from the freeze in December 1894 which ruined much of the state's citrus crop. Carson volunteered to deliver the application to the post office in Fort Meade, and on the way changed the name from Lakemont to Frostproof, which was approved. Overocker, to his surprise, was appointed the postmaster of Frostproof. The early post office was located on the corner of Wall St. and Carson Ave. After many delays, Frostproof first received rail service in 1912.

It was housed in the Dees Building on West Haines Blvd. 1000 books were donated by Lake Alfred residents and merchants. The books were also processed by volunteers. Merchant W.R. Dees provided the storefront requiring a low enough rent that the Junior Women's Club could pay. The club also held bake sales, rummage sales, and dances to raise money to provide for material needs such as furniture. The grand opening was October 1962. Within a year a larger storefront opened in the same building and volunteers once again moved the library. Volunteers ran the library causing for unpredictable hours in which the library was open. Sometimes it was only open 3 hours a week. In 1967 the city provided a small house in Lion's Park for the growing library to move to, in 1969 the city hired a part-time professional librarian, and funded new books and supplies. In 1972 the City of Lake Alfred created a library board made up of seven members appointed by the city commission and city manager.

The population was 3,817 at the 2010 census. Mulberry is home to Badcock Home Furniture. It is part of the Lakeland–Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area, with parts of unincorporated Lakeland on its northern boundary. Mulberry is home to the 334 acre Alafia River Reserve. History The first white settlers appeared in the Mulberry area in the 1840s. The first industry in Mulberry was logging the longleaf yellow pine which dominated the area. Eventually the settlement grew to include log homes, stores, and saloons. The nearest sheriff and jail were hours away in Bartow, and the town resembled a scene from the Old West as mob rule prevailed. Everyone carried a gun, and Monday morning was a busy time for the coroner as he dealt with the victims of Saturday night's \\"troublemakers.\\" The town had no official name, but the railroad which came through town stopped at a mulberry tree to let off passengers and drop off the mail. The old mulberry tree became the de facto meeting place in town, and eventually gave the town its name. Several hangings took place from this mulberry tree. In 1886, phosphate rock was discovered in the Peace River, and the dominant logging industry gave way to mining operations. The phosphate industry gave the town stability, leading to Mulberry's incorporation in 1901. In 1910, Mulberry's Masonic lodge was established and remains operational today. =Florida Pebble Strike= By 1919, many miners had joined the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. In April of that year, the union called a strike asking for a minimum wage and an eight-hour work day, after which the mining companies brought in strikebreakers from Georgia. Electricity was cut off from both Mulberry and Fort Meade. On the evening of August 21, 1919, four mine guards for the Prairie Pebble Phosphate Company opened fire upon the town in an apparent attempt to break the strike, claiming that a man had shot at the power house in which they were sheltered. During the indiscriminate shooting, two adults were wounded and a two-year-old child was killed after being shot through the heart. Later that night, another black man was killed when the guards continued firing in Mulberry's black neighborhood. The sheriff's investigation found no evidence of a firearm in the accused man's possession nor at the location from which it was claimed he had fired. After quelling the rage of the townspeople, who wanted to attack the power house and mine guards, the sheriff arrested the four mine guards shortly after midnight.https://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00091504/00921/1x =Lynchings= The Ku Klux Klan maintained a presence in Mulberry, with the last public march occurring in 1979.

Sinkholes On June 15, 1994, a sinkhole appeared in a toxic waste disposal pond near the city of Mulberry. Phosphogypsum, the byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry, is highly toxic and mildly radioactive. The 110 feet wide and 200 feet deep sinkhole dumped this toxin into caves that lead to the Floridan Aquifer. Drinking water for over ten million Florida residents comes from this aquifer. The company mining the phosphate, IMC-Agrico, now a part of The Mosaic Company, started the sinkhole remediation process immediately. It has spent over $6 million trying to repair the damage to the Florida water supply. \\"Mulberry, Florida, Sinkhole,\\" National Geographic, June 2010. Retrieved 29 Sept. 2016.

Another major issue that has Polk City residents fired up is the extremely high sewer fee imposed by Polk City Utilities. They issue multi-level flat rates for the billing that vary depending on water usage. However, there is always the low flat rate, even if you haven't lived in your home for a couple months and didn't use any water or sewer or garbage.

History =Pre-history= The Timucua and the Calusa were the earliest known inhabitants of the land that would become Winter Haven. Both of these groups were deeply impacted by war and disease from the Spanish conquest of Florida in the early 1500s. The Timucua were particularly affected by the expedition of Hernando de Soto. By the 19th century, both these groups no longer existed. During these expeditions the Spanish explorers claimed the entire peninsula of Florida for the Spanish monarchy In the 19th century the Creek and the Seminole were known to live and hunt in this area.\\"The Naming of Lakes in Polk County\\", Joe Spann, Polk County Historical Library, Bartow, 2007, http://www.polk.wateratlas.usf.edu/upload/documents/Naming%20of%20Polk%20Lakes.pdf During the Seminole Wars the Seminole leader, Chipco, and his followers were known to live in the Winter Haven area.

The first American or European settlers in the area were encouraged to settle here by the Armed Occupation Act of 1842. During the 1840s and 1850s, the United States government conducted the first surveys of the area. Henry Washington conducted the first survey of the area in 1843. In 1849, Dr. John Westcott completed an extensive survey of the area, including mapping many of the local lakes. The first maps of the area were published by the United States government in 1854. In 1883, Henry Haines working for Henry Plant and the Plant System, successfully built the first railroad across Polk County, passing just north of Winter Haven. Lake Haines, in Winter Haven, was named after Haines, who served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army. The arrival of the railroad created the first real growth in area. The area was platted in 1884 and would first be known as Harris Corners. This name was in reference to F.A.K. Harris, who opened the first mercantile store in the area around this time. The name Winter Haven was later suggested, in reference to the area's pleasant climate. =Early 20th century= By the end of the century, the population grew to approximately 400 and in 1911, the City of Winter Haven was incorporated. The Chain of Lakes canals were begun in 1915. The first Florida boom took place in the 1920s as towns sprang up all over the peninsula. Florida's potential as a place to live and a place to visit was first realized in the 1920s, but the Great Depression slowed growth until after World War II. Winter Haven Hospital was founded in 1926 and has been in the city ever since. During this period, the population of Winter Haven began to grow substantially. Many beautiful single-family homes were built in Winter Haven at this time in the colonial revival style. Over 50 these homes are on the National Register of Historic Places today. They are noted for their architectural style and grace. Most of these historic homes are located in the Interlaken neighborhood. There are four historic districts in Winter Haven. They are Interlaken, Pope Avenue, Winter Haven Heights, and the downtown area. =Growth and development= In 1930, George W. Jenkins opened the first Publix supermarket in Winter Haven. His second store and the first stand-alone Publix store, was a 27 ft by 65 ft building at 199 West Central Avenue, opened in 1935, which exists today as the Regenerations thrift store. During the 1930s and 1940s, citrus magnate, John A. Snively operated one of the largest fruit packing plants in the world in Winter Haven. Another defining event in Winter Haven was the opening of Cypress Gardens in 1936 by Dick Pope, Sr. and his wife, Julie Pope. They first got the idea for the park from a Good Housekeeping magazine that they were reading. By the 1950s, Cypress Gardens was nationally famous. It featured a beautiful botanical garden, water skiing shows, and a staff of southern belles. Many famous celebrities of that time visited the park, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Betty Grable, and King Hussein of Jordan. In the 1980s, the Anheuser-Busch corporation purchased the park. They continued to operate the park until 1995. After that, the park struggled, finally closing for good in 2009. On January 21, 2010, the site of Cypress Gardens was formally announced as the selected location for the Legoland Florida theme park, which opened on October 15, 2011. Legoland Florida has successfully retained some of the tradition and history of the original site, including part of the original botanical garden and a water ski show. Winter Haven featured many buildings designed by Gene Leedy, one of the founders of the Sarasota School of Architecture. Regency Medical Center, which is Winter Haven Hospital's women's hospital, was built in 1987. The Orange Dome, located near the corner of Cypress Gardens Blvd and US Hwy 17, was built in 1964. For 48 years, it hosted the annual Citrus Festival and other civic affairs. In February 2012, the Orange Dome was demolished to make way for The Landings, a proposed $150 million mixed-use development that was intended to include high- end retail stores, restaurants, hotels, apartments and a new movie theater to be built at the Chain of Lakes Complex. However, after the construction of three fast food chain stores, the project collapsed. Currently, the developer and the city are in negotiations to determine the future of the site. =Pughsville= Pughsville was a neighborhood of Winter Haven where African Americans built a community after the Civil War. A historical marker on Highway 17 at Avenue O commemorates the community. According to the marker, Pughsville was one of Winter Haven's earliest neighborhoods and was settled by African Americans who cleared the land in the southwest section of the city. Pughsville was named for an early black pioneer, Reverend Charles Pugh, who was a founder of one of Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Pughsville was also home to Bethel A.M.E., St. Paul Holiness, and Church of Christ. The community was most active from the 1900s until the 1950s and had an African- American school, social halls, small grocery stores, and restaurants where some residents worked. Others worked in the citrus industry or in state or federal jobs. Pughsville produced Winter Haven's first African-American commissioner and mayor Lemuel Geathers, medical doctor, fire fighter and postal worker. The community declined in the late 1970s as larger commercial establishments began arriving in the area.

With so many lakes, Winter Haven is a location for fresh water fishing. The two sports for which Winter Haven is best known are water skiing and baseball. =Water skiing history= Winter Haven has played a major role in the development and growth of water skiing as a sport. Dick Pope, Sr. used water skiing as a way to promote his Cypress Gardens theme park starting in the 1930s, and water ski shows soon became a staple of entertainment at the park. He was also the first person to complete a jump on water skis, jumping over a wooden ramp in 1928, for a distance of 25 feet. He pioneered a number of other water skiing tricks, including the water ski human pyramid, as part of an effort to develop his shows at Cypress Gardens. His son, Dick Pope, Jr. popularized barefoot water skiing. Winter Haven is connected to 10 members of the Water Ski Hall of Fame, more than any other city in the world. These include Dick Pope, Sr., Dick Pope, Jr., and Ricky McCormick. George A. \\"Banana George\\" Blair, who still holds several water ski world records, was first introduced to the sport while visiting Winter Haven in the 1950s. Winter Haven has many lakes, including its famous chain of lakes, that are perfect for water skiing. Today, several successful ski schools, for both water skiing and barefoot skiing, make their home there. Everyday, all year round, water skiers can be seen practicing their sport on the lakes around town. =Spring training baseball= Winter Haven was a Major League Baseball Spring Training site for many years, first at Denison Field and later at Chain of Lakes Park. Great baseball players who played spring training baseball in Winter Haven included Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Johnny Bench, and Hank Aaron. In 1928, the Philadelphia Phillies were the first Major League Baseball team to call Winter Haven their spring-home. The Phillies played at Denison Field, which featured a large, covered wooden grandstand. The Phillies played spring training games there until 1938. In 1940, the New York Giants did one season there. After baseball left Denison, the field was donated to the city for the benefit of youth athletics. The stadium was rebuilt in 1947 with a larger grandstand and in use today for college and high school football, soccer, track and field, and other events. In 1966, the Boston Red Sox and spring training baseball returned to Winter Haven. The Red Sox played in the newly built Chain of Lakes Park, a state of the art facility at that time. For 26 years, the Red Sox called Winter Haven their spring-home. When the Red Sox left to Fort Myers, Florida in 1992, the city of Winter Haven sought a new Major League Baseball team. Later that year, Hurricane Andrew devastated Homestead, Florida, including the spring training facilities of the Cleveland Indians, and the Indians moved to Winter Haven. In 2008, after failed negotiations with the city to renovate Chain of Lakes Park, the Indians moved into a brand new stadium in Goodyear, Arizona after 16 springs at Chain of Lakes Park. Chain of Lakes Park today hosts Russ Matt collegiate baseball tournament. The stadium was slated for demolition, and re-development into a shopping center, called the Landings, but those plans are currently stalled.

When the Florida Southern Railway came through Interlachen in the 1870s, the area opened up to settlers. The town developed economically as a winter vacation spot and citrus growing area. The town of Interlachen was incorporated in 1888. The Hastings Seed House was organized in 1889, moving to Atlanta, Ga. ten years later. In 1891, the Interlachen Town Hall burned down. Another was built to replace it the following year and it still stands - now housing a museum, and is also used as a place for presentations for certain festivals. When the Great Freeze hit in 1895, the town's tourism and citrus sharply declined. In 1895, Interlachen Academy was built; it is the oldest wooden school house in continuous use in Florida - now serving as the location of the Interlachen High School's JROTC program. In 1926,Interlachen first gained electricity and Route 14, now State Road 20,was constructed through Interlachen. In the 1930s a train came through the town every two hours. But in 1969, with the decline of railroads, the Interlachen Railroad depot was razed. Currently, a caboose sits in the middle of the town as a reminder of the tourist haven the town once was.

The area is renowned for its cultural and environmental amenities, beaches, resorts, and the Sarasota School of Architecture. The city is at the southern end of the Tampa Bay Area, north of Fort Myers and Punta Gorda. Its official limits include Sarasota Bay and several barrier islands between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019 Sarasota had a population of 58,285. In 1986 it became designated as a certified local government. Sarasota is a principal city of the Sarasota metropolitan area, and is the seat of Sarasota County. Long the winter headquarters of the Ringling Brothers Circus, many landmarks in Sarasota are named for the Ringlings. The islands separating Sarasota Bay from the gulf near the city, known as keys, include Lido Key and Siesta Key, which are famous worldwide for the quality of their sandy beaches. The keys that are included in the boundary of Sarasota are Lido Key, St. Armands Key, Otter Key, Casey Key, Coon Key, Bird Key, and portions of Siesta Key. Previously, Siesta Key was named Sarasota Key. At one time, it and all of Longboat Key were considered part of Sarasota and confusing contemporaneous references may be found discussing them. Longboat Key is the largest key separating the bay from the gulf, but it was evenly divided by the new county line of 1921. The portion of the key that parallels the Sarasota city boundary that extends to that new county line along the bay front of the mainland was removed from the city boundaries at the request of John Ringling in the mid-1920s, who sought to avoid city taxation of his planned developments at the southern tip of the key. Although they never were completed in the quickly faltering economy, those development concessions granted by the city never were reversed and the county has retained regulation of those lands. The city limits had expanded significantly with the real estate rush of the early twentieth century, reaching almost . The wild speculation boom began to crash in 1926 and following that, the city limits began to contract, shrinking to less than a quarter of that area.Cummings, Ian, Razing near for city icon, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, page BNV1, June 15, 2014  History  The area known today as Sarasota first appeared on a sheepskin Spanish map from 1763 with the word over present day Sarasota and Bradenton. The municipal government of Sarasota was established when it was incorporated as a town in 1902.  Geography and climate  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Sarasota has a humid subtropical climate closely bordering a tropical savanna climate, with hot, humid summers, and warm, dry winters. There are distinct rainy and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from June to September, and the dry season from October to May. The most recent officially recorded freezes in Sarasota took place on January 18, 2018, when the temperature dropped to at the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport. However, Sarasota averages less than one frost annually.  Demographics  As of the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 57,738 people living in the city. The population density was . There were 29,151 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was White, African American, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, from other races, and from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were of the population. There were 24,416 households, out of which 19.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.3% were married couples living together, 12.3% had a female head of household with no husband present, and 48.5% were non-families. 38.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.12 and the average family size was 2.81. In the city, 14.5% of the population was under the age of 18, 9.2% ranged from 18 to 24, 27.9% from 25 to 44, 22.5% from 45 to 64, and 27.4% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.8 males. The per capita income for residents of the city was $24,416. Females had a median income of $23,510 versus $26,604 for males. The median income for a household in the city was $47,884 and the median income for a family was $40,398. About 12.4% of families and 16.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.5% of those under age 18 and 7.7% of those age 65 or over.  Economy  The Sarasota Ritz-Carlton Tourism contributes significantly to the economy of Sarasota. Companies based in Sarasota include the Boar's Head Provision Company. Major employers include Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Doctors Hospital of Sarasota, APAC Customer Services, L-3 Aviation Recorders, The Zenith. Diversified industrial company Roper Technologies is based in Sarasota.  Government  Sarasota municipal government was last incorporated in 1913, changing from a town type to adopting the city type of local government found in the United States and the title of its government changed to \\"City of Sarasota\\". Sarasota later was designated as the county seat when Sarasota County was carved out of Manatee County in 1921 during the creation of several new counties. In 1945 the commission-manager government form was adopted for the city and it is governed by a five-person commission elected by popular vote, two members of which serve in the ceremonial positions of \\"mayor\\" and \\"vice-mayor\\", as chosen by the commission every April. Two at- large commissioners are elected by all voters and the city is divided into three districts for which the residents of each elect one district representative to the five member commission. Many aspects of the city are overseen by the county government ranging from the schools, the libraries, the bay, major waterways, county designated roads, the airport, fire departments, property and ad valorem taxes, voting, the health department, extension services, storm water control, mosquito control, the courts, and the jail. Therefore, the election of county commissioners is important to city voters. In January 2006, the city of Sarasota made national news when the National Coalition for the Homeless and the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty ranked it number one on the groups' list of twenty \\"meanest cities\\" in America in their published report A Dream Denied: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities. The city's adoption of its \\"no lodging out-of- doors\\" ordinance on August 15, 2005, Ordinance No. 05-4640, made it illegal to sleep outside on public property without permission, as was already the case with private property. In recent years, the City of Sarasota has revolutionized its approach to managing local homelessness focusing on casework, mental health assessments and housing. The city has earned a national, state and regional recognition for its efforts. In June 2019, Florida Department of Environment Secretary Noah Valenstein stated, \\"Sarasota is perhaps the number one environmentally conscious community in Florida.\\" Sarasota is among the communities included in a two-county federally mandated Metropolitan Planning Organization that includes all of Sarasota and Manatee counties and the chairs of the three elements of that organization belong to the eight-county regional planning organization for western central Florida.  Arts and culture  Ca' d'Zan, John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art Sarasota has been a consistent cultural mecca for nearly a century. In 1925, A. B. Edwards built a theater that could be adapted for either vaudeville performances or movie screenings. Renowned stripper Sally Rand did her bubble bath and fan dance here. Tommy Dorsey, Will Rodgers and Elvis Presley each performed at the Edward Theatre. It remains at the intersection of Pineapple Avenue and Second Street, having been restored and used for performances by the Sarasota Opera and others. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the early 1950s, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art purchased a historic Italian theater, the \\"Asolo\\" (now called the Historic Asolo Theater). This theatre was originally built for Queen Caterina of Cyprus’ palace in Asolo, Italy in 1798 but was dismantled in 1931. A. Everett \\"Chick\\" Austin, the museum's first director, arranged the purchase and reassembly of the theater for performances of plays and opera. In the 1960s philanthropists Lewis and Eugenia Van Wezel enabled the city to build a performing arts hall on the bayfront. The auditorium, the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects team under the direction of William Wesley Peters. Wright's widow, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, who participated in the project, selected its purple color. In 1989, Stuart Barger, a local architect, designed and oversaw the construction of another Asolo Theater, housed in the Florida State University Center for the Performing Arts. It is a multi-theater complex, located farther east on the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art property, being placed between Bay Shore Road and Tamiami Trail, and facing south toward Ringling Plaza. It was built around a rococo, historic Scottish theater previously called the Dunfermline Opera House, which had been shipped to Florida. The new complex also provides venues and facilities for students of Florida State University's MFA Acting program, the FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training. This was the administrative home of the Sarasota French Film Festival for several years. FST's Keating Theatre, formerly the Sarasota Woman's Club, is amongst the oldest surviving buildings in Sarasota. Founded in 1903, the Sarasota Woman's Club eventually set out to create a meeting place to house social events, activities, and forums. On January 1, 1915, the cornerstone was laid at the corner of Palm Avenue and Park Street (now Cocoanut). It served as the town's first library and hosted numerous clubs and public committee gatherings. The Woman's Club also maintained a census and birth registration, an area PTA, and a Red Cross Auxiliary. The Sarasota Woman's Club relocated in 1976 and the building became slated for demolition. Marian McKenna, a patron, and supporter of the arts, did not want to see the building and her memories destroyed. She purchased the building and later sold it to Florida Studio Theatre. In 1985, the Sarasota Woman's Club building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After completing more renovations to the historic building in 2003, the theatre was renamed the Keating Theatre in honor of Ed and Elaine Keating, and in 2004, additional lobby space was built in the theatre - the Bea Friedman Room. FST's Keating Theatre now seats 173 and remains a cultural center of Sarasota. In 2003, FST purchased the Gompertz Theatre. The building was originally the Park-Seventh Movie House in the 1920s. Due to the Depression, the movie house shut its doors and became an empty venue. During its predominantly vacant period in the 1940s, the theatre hosted a variety of roadshows and performers, including Tom Mix and his Wonder Horse and the All Girls’ Orchestra. During this time it was known as the Garden Theater, and later the Art Theater, before becoming known as the Palm Tree Playhouse in 1951. The Playhouse closed again in the 1960s. In the mid-1970s, Asolo Theatre purchased the space for production purposes and their Stage Two Theatre program. It was subsequently sold to Anita Katzman and reoccupied by Siesta Key Actors Theatre and Theatre Works in the 1980s. The building was acquired by Florida Studio Theatre and renamed the Gompertz Theatre in honor of Mrs. Leila Gompertz, who made the lead gift enabling the purchase. Other Sarasota cultural attractions include, and many other musical, dance, artistic, and theatrical venues. =Performing Arts= Sarasota has many musical, dance, theatre, circus and other performing arts venues, including the Sarasota Ballet, Sarasota Opera, Asolo Repertory Theatre, Florida Studio Theatre, the Sarasota Players, the Banyan Theater Company, The Westcoast Black Theatre, the Urbanite Theatre, Sarasota Contemporary Dance, Sarasota Orchestra, La Musica, Jazz Club of Sarasota, Sarasota Youth Opera, Circus Arts Conservatory and many others. Theatre Asolo Repertory Theater Theatrical venues include Florida Studio Theatre, Asolo Repertory Theatre, Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, The Players Theatre, Urbanite Theatre, and the Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe. Music Sarasota is the home of the Sarasota Orchestra, which was founded by Ruth Cotton Butler in 1949 and known for years as the Florida West Coast Symphony. It holds a three- week Sarasota Music Festival that is recognized internationally and boasts it attracts renowned teachers and the finest students of chamber music. Sarasota also boasts a symphonic chorus, Key Chorale, and professional vocal ensemble, Choral Artists of Sarasota. The Jazz Club of Sarasota is one of the largest and most active jazz clubs in the United States and has promoted jazz events in Sarasota for 39 years. Elvis Presley, Tommy Dorsey and Gregg Allman each played concerts in Sarasota. Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Brian Johnson of AC/DC, Dickey Betts of the Allman Brothers Band, Donald Dunn of the Blues Brothers and Graeme Edge of the Moody Blues have all settled in Sarasota. =Visual Arts= Sarasota and the Cultural Coast are home to fine art, film-making, and decorative arts. Fine art, fine art galleries, artist collectives, film- making, and many decorative arts are practiced in Sarasota and Cultural Coast. Film on the Cultural Coast In 1952, Cecil B. DeMille filmed and premiered The Greatest Show on Earth (with James Stewart, Charlton Heston, Betty Hutton) in Sarasota. In 1998, two studio films were filmed in Sarasota: Alfonso Cuaron’s Great Expectations, with Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Anne Bancroft and Robert De Niro; and Volker Schlondorff’s Palmetto, starring Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, and Gina Gershon. Out of Time (2003), a crime drama starring Denzel Washington and Eva Mendes used the Casey Key Swing Bridge, Boca Grande and Cortez. In 2013, Taylor Hackford’s action movie Parker, with Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte had scenes filmed at Ca’ d’Zan in Sarasota. Bonnethead sharks seen at the Mote Marine Laboratory In June 2017, director Kevin Smith started shooting his next film, Killroy Was Here, in Sarasota. =Aquarium, Zoos and Botanical Gardens= Marie Selby Botanical Gardens Sarasota is home to Mote Marine Laboratory, a marine rescue, research facility, an aquarium, the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, the Sarasota Jungle Gardens and the Big Cat Habitat & Gulf Coast Sanctuary. Festivals Since 1998, the city has hosted the Sarasota Film Festival annually. The festival attracts independent films from around the world. It claims to be one of Florida's largest film festivals. In 2009 the annual Ringling International Arts Festival, held its premier and held its closing event in the historic Asolo theater, which had been moved and rebuilt again. The historic Venetian theater now is housed in the reception building for the museum where it is used for special events as well as performances, informative purposes, and another seasonal film series hosted by the museum. Florida Studio Theatre produces the annual Sarasota Improv Festival. Founded in 2009 by Rebecca Hopkins, FST's annual Sarasota Improv Festival brings together the best improvisers from across the country and around the world for a whirlwind weekend of spontaneous creativity. The Festival has become a destination event, drawing thousands of people from across the state of Florida and beyond. Past performers have come from as far as Mexico, Canada, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom to perform on Florida's Gulf Coast. In 2010, the Sarasota Chalk Festival that is held yearly in the historic area of Burns Square became the first international street painting festival in the United States of America. Celebrating the sixteenth century performance art of Italian street painting, the festival hosted Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller from Germany, who created the first street painting that changed images from day to night. The festival has a different theme each year and has introduced new techniques in street art. Other applications of street art such as murals and \\"cellograff graffiti\\" have become companion events also produced by Avenida de Colores, Inc. The murals are part of the \\"Going Vertical\\" project and although it sometimes coincides with the chalk festival, it is distinct from it and often continues throughout the year. Except for a few commissioned on public property in the Palm Avenue Parking Garage, the murals are on private property and they are in many sections of Sarasota and in Manatee County as well. the Sarasota Chalk festival has relocated to Venice, FL, a small town just South of Sarasota. The name Sarasota Chalk Festival remains the same. It is also home to the Harvey Milk Festival, an independent music festival in support of civil rights, focusing on the LGBTQ community. It has been celebrated in May annually since 2010 on the weekend closest to Harvey Milk's birthday, and is currently the largest independent music festival in Sarasota, with thousands of attendees throughout the free, public, multi-day event, that also includes gallery showings, film, and other live performances.  Architecture  Italian architecture and culture are quite strong in the area because of the Ringling Museum. An unusually large number of homes and buildings are designed in the Italian style, especially Venetian as influenced by Ringling's Cà d'Zan. Italian inspired statues are also common and Michelangelo's David is used as the symbol of Sarasota. = Sarasota School of Architecture = The Sarasota School of Architecture developed as a variant of mid-century modernist architecture. It incorporates elements of both the Bauhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright's \\"organic\\" architecture. The style developed as an adaptation to the area's sub-tropical climate and used newly emerging materials manufactured or implemented following World War II. = Historic buildings and sites = Sarasota County Courthouse By the end of the twentieth century, many of Sarasota's more modest historical structures were demolished. Recently, two historic buildings, the Crocker Church and the Bidwell-Wood House (the oldest remaining structure in the city),Jennings, David, A Tale of Two Commissions, Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc. Newsletter, February 2005, volume twenty, number two, Box 1754, Sarasota, Florida 34230 – with illustrations of Crocker Church and Bidwell-Wood House by Kafi Benz first restored by Veronica Morgan and members of the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation that she founded, became city property. These structures were relocated to this park, despite protests from residents who objected to the loss of park area. In the late 1970s, Sarasota County purchased the Terrace Hotel that was built by Charles Ringling and renovated it for use as a county government office building.LaHurd, Jeff, Sarasota, A History, The History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, IBSSN 1-59629-119-2 The adjacent courthouse that he donated to the new county in 1921 has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The courthouse complex was designed by Dwight James Baum. In the next decade the landmark hotel built by Owen Burns, the El Vernona, which had been turned into apartments became endangered. By then it was called the John Ringling Towers and was purchased by a phosphate miner, Gardinier, who wanted to turn it into his corporate headquarters. All of the tenants were turned out and plans were made for the restoration of the building. The city commissioners supported the plan initially, but lobbying to undermine the project began and one of the commissioners changed her vote. The project was denied at the final hearing. The enraged miner abandoned the city and subsequent owners, seeking to demolish it, made garish changes to the building to make it unappealing before finally leaving it open for vagrants to invade and pilfer. Remarkable preservation success occurred during the 1990s when the community exhibition hall, the Municipal Auditorium, designed by Thomas Reed Martin and Clarence A. Martin, was listed on the National Register of Historic Paces and meticulously restored to its depression recovery era, 1937 WPA community project, completion status and its architectural glory—both inside and out. The city boasts that 100,000 people use it every year and it is a boon to the community for recreation, lawn sports, as well as being heavily attended for auctions, concerts, conventions, flea markets, galas, graduations, lectures, orchid and flower shows, and a full range of trade shows of interest to the community. Later the Federal Building, designed by George Albee Freeman (the designer of Seagate for industrialist Powell Crosley Jr.) and Louis A. Simon, which initially had served as the post office was restored as well. Most of the luxurious historic residences from the 1920s boom period along the northern shore of Sarasota Bay also have survived. This string of homes, built on large parcels of elevated land along the widest point of the bay, is anchored by the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art at its center. Among them is Cà d'Zan, the home of Mable and John Ringling, which was restored recently. Many significant structures from the comparatively recent \\"Sarasota School of Architecture\\" period of the mid-twentieth century, however, have not survived. Since they do not qualify under the age criteria set for historic preservation nominations their historical aspect often escapes public recognition. Others frequently are threatened by demolition plans for new development without consideration of their cultural and historical importance to the community instead of motivating the implementation of plans to retain the buildings and integrate them into new plans. In 2006, the Sarasota County School Board slated one of Paul Rudolph's largest Sarasota projects, Riverview High School, for demolition. The board arrived at the decision despite protests by many members of the community, including architects, historic preservationists, and urban planners. Others supported the demolition as they believed the structure is no longer functional. The issue was divisive. The World Monuments Fund included the school on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites in the category Main Street Modern. Following a March 2007 charrette led by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a proposal was advanced to renovate and preserve Rudolph's buildings. The school board decided to allow a year to consider implementation of the innovative plan proposed to preserve the buildings, that would include building a parking garage with playing fields above it rather than demolishing the structures. In early June 2008, the school board voted in a 3-2 decision to allow the demolition; School board members Shirley Brown, Caroline Zucker and Frank Kovatch voted against preserving the historic high school. This decision was that school would be demolished and that a parking lot would replace it. One year later, in June 2009, Riverview High School was demolished. In December 2019, a former Sarasota High School facility was transformed into the Sarasota Art Museum of Ringling College. The 93-year-old building was renovated to include 80,000 square feet for the museum's campus with about 15,000 square feet for exhibitions, costing about $30 million according to the president of Ringling College, Larry Thompson. = Other notable cultural features = The Sarasota neighborhood of Pinecraft is home to a relatively liberal Amish community which is unusual compared to other Amish communities as it consists mainly of elderly who moved to Florida because of its mild climate, of Amish people who are on holiday and of Amish who do not fit in easily in other communities.Kraybill, Donald B., Karen M.

Schools =Elementary= * Walker Elementary School Private Schools: * Double R Private School (Pk-8) (Secular) History Chuluota is pronounced \\"Choo-lee-oh-tah\\", meaning \\"Isle of Pines\\", \\"Pine Island\\", or \\"Land of Lakes and Pines\\" or \\"beautiful place\\", depending upon whom you ask. The pronunciation is a derivative of the Creek Indian word \\"Chuluoto\\". Chuluota was first settled soon after the Civil War. Some of the area's first white residents were from North Carolina who came here by ox cart seeking refuge from the war, and undoubtedly encountered Seminole Indians when they arrived. They found an area teeming with fish, deer, and wild hogs. Orange groves, cattle ranches, a sawmill and turpentine production from the forests of pines were developed by settlers. A railroad provided transportation for passengers and goods. Robert A. Mills, one of the early developers of the community, is credited with choosing the lyrical Indian name of Chuluota, which was possibly the name of the original Seminole village. Circa 1892, the name was continued by Henry Flagler, who created the Chuluota Land Company to sell land acquired by his Florida East Coast Railroad. Chuluota was originally laid out by Flagler and his Chuluota Land Company to compete with Orlando as the center of trade in the area. Following Flagler's death, the land plats were mainly unused until the 1950s, when a post-war housing boom began to take place. The houses were generally small, and were used by working class Americans seeking affordable living. The Chuluota School was established in 1898 as a wooden one-room schoolhouse. In 1925, a more modern elementary school was built and was closed in June 1948. This became the volunteer fire station; since 1996, it has served as the home of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10139 and is generally considered the community center. Chuluota's survival was challenged by several events. First, the Great Freeze of 1894-1895 virtually decimated the thriving citrus industry. Next, development was stalled by the bust of the Florida land boom in the 1920s and Flagler's death, and was finally devastated by the Great Depression of the 1930s. Bit by bit, the population of the hamlet dwindled. By the 1960s, new developers made plans to revitalize the community. It is estimated that one thousand new homes have been built in the area since 2003.

Some say he visited the university, while others say he just liked the sound of it, but most agree that he likely pronounced the name correctly rather than the Americanized way of .

History Up through the early 19th century, the area encompassing Oviedo was sparsely populated save for a few Seminoles and African-American Freemen who associated with the Seminole tribe, known as Black Seminoles, in what was then Spanish Florida. The Seminole tribe had larger clusters of population in other areas of Central Florida, such as nearby Lake Jesup. The population remained sparse until after the American Civil War, when people devastated by war starting moving South to begin a new life. One mile to the southeast side of Lake Jesup, a small hamlet of settlers established the \\"Lake Jesup Settlement\\" in 1875. Letters from that era showcased a difficult life for the Florida Cracker settlers: cooking outdoors with wood stoves, sleeping under mosquito nets, and burning rags to keep the insects away. Wildlife was plentiful, however. Initially, this settlement had around 40 families, but quickly evolved into a thriving trading port. The settlement was named \\"Oviedo\\" by Andrew Aulin when the first post office was established to honor the state's Spanish heritage. Several people played a prominent role in establishing Oviedo's history. George Powell was an early settler who ran a large tract of land, referred to as the \\"Powell Settlement\\", which today encompasses most of the northern part of the city—including the downtown area. One of Powell's sons, Lewis Powell, (alias Lewis Payne), became infamous for being John Wilkes Booth's primary accomplice in the plot to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. George Powell's friend, Henry Foster, was instrumental in transforming Oviedo's citrus and celery industry from obscurity to prominence by giving Oviedo reliable transportation to deliver its goods. He paid for a railway link to Oviedo and founded the Lake Jesup Steamboat Company. Agriculture was Oviedo's primary industry all the way through the 1940s. Foster was also responsible for establishing the Lake Charm area as a resort to entice visitors from the North to vacation in the winter. Foster encouraged settlers to begin attending regular church services on a site of the \\"Powell Settlement\\" that would become the First Methodist Church of Oviedo. A citrus-grower named Butler Boston is also credited for helping establish Oviedo's citrus economy by successfully grafting tangerine budwood to grow tangerines, as well as budding the succulent Temple orange from Jamaica to several Oviedo fields. Butler Boston was the son of a doctor, Alexander Atkinson, who had fathered Butler, along with several others with freed black women on his family's plantation.http://www.canterburyretreat.org/atkinson-boston-family-files/ Atkinson moved to Oviedo in 1871 with the 12-year-old Butler to both set up a medical practice and buy a farm. Atkinson gave the land to his son after a freeze when he moved back to Georgia. Boston was so successful that he was hired to bud other Oviedo fields. He became a spokesman for the large black community in the area, and was especially devoted to improving their educational opportunities, and served as a local school trustee. He was also an accomplished bricklayer and oversaw the planning and construction of a new building for the Antioch Baptist Church. His legacy is noted today throughout Oviedo, in sites such as Boston Street, Boston Alley, Boston Cemetery, Boston Hill and Butler Boston Court. His home site is where Canterbury Retreat and Conference Center is located. Its centerpiece is Lake Gem, named by the Boston family for a close family member.http://canterburyretreat.org/about/canterburys-history/ Andrew Duda Sr., a Slovak immigrant, established a farm in nearby Slavia in the early 20th century. He left after failing to produce successful crops, but saved up money and returned in 1926 to try again. The second time, he was extraordinarily successful and his farm survived even through the Great Depression. In fact, in 1939, he was able to build St. Luke's Lutheran Church, which has since expanded into a large Lutheran community. The Duda family started a sod division in the 1970s that has since flourished and continues today. The west entrance of Oviedo cuts straight through the sod farm. Oviedo experienced a major growth spurt during the boom years of the 1920s, and new buildings and banks were built on the main street of downtown, named \\"Broadway\\". Some of these buildings still remain, along with the complex of buildings surrounding the Nelson and Co. packing house, which was the center of Oviedo's agricultural industry for decades. This agricultural complex eventually shut down for good during the 1980s after a series of winter freezes. At that time, commercial development had already replaced agriculture as Oviedo's main industry. Oviedo made the transition from a rural hamlet, to a town, and then, in 1967, became a city through a special referendum. Five miles south of Oviedo, in 1963, residents learned about the impending building of a \\"space university\\" in the Orlando Morning Sentinel. Many faculty and staff members of Florida Technological University (now the University of Central Florida) moved into Oviedo, and new businesses and industry soon followed. The adjacent Central Florida Research Park, originally established in 1978, has since become the largest research park in Florida. This has resulted in an exploding population with many new developments in recent years. As the city has grown, its animals have remained a part of the city's character. Although hogs can no longer be seen walking free, chickens and roosters continue to roam the downtown area and have become an Oviedo attraction. Historic downtown Most of the buildings in the downtown historic area were constructed between the end of the 19th and early 20th century. The Nelson and Company Historic District, the R.W. Estes Celery Company Precooler Historic District, the First Methodist Church of Oviedo, and several houses in Oviedo are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The nearby Oviedo Mall features murals of historic areas along with pictures of early European and African-American settlers in the area. State Road 434, which cuts through downtown Oviedo, is currently being widened and several buildings have been demolished. The Oviedo Preservation Project has been tasked with photographing and documenting the buildings for posterity. An African-American Oviedo pioneer named Mathew Powell established the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in April 1875. Although not located in the downtown area, the historic Lake Charm settlement is nearby. This settlement, established by Henry Foster in the 1860s, became one of the first resorts in Florida. It lasted as a resort until the 1890s. Several winter homes built during that era still stand today. New developments In 2015, the city of Oviedo dedicated a brand new downtown development just south of the current \\"old downtown\\" along Oviedo Boulevard. The new town center, named \\"Oviedo on the Park\\", is a mixed use development with townhouses, apartment homes, restaurants, and retail. It is centered around the new Center Lake Park with a man-made lake, large amphitheater, playground and veterans tribute. A 64-bed hospital called the Oviedo Medical Center opened in January, 2017. A new emergency room (ER) hospital, called Oviedo ER, was completed in 2014. Oviedo ER is a department of Central Florida Regional Hospital. The Oviedo ER is located on the corner of Red Bug Lake Road and West Broadway. The Oviedo Mall, a single-story indoor mall with a movie theater built in 1998, has recently undergone a large-scale renovation by its new owners, 3D Investments. BJ's Restaurant & Brewery opened across from the Oviedo Mall in August 2014. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of the rock group KISS hosted a grand opening celebration for their new Rock & Brews in Oviedo in January 2015. In January 2016, Oviedo's new, expanded Townhouse Restaurant opened a few hundred feet from their old, iconic establishment, which was demolished to make room for the new road project.http://www.wesh.com/article/new-townhouse-restaurant-in-oviedo- open/4446781 Oviedo's new Gym & Aquatic Center features a waterslide, kid's water park, and a large Olympic-sized pool with multiple lanes. Oviedo's Riverside Park also contains a pool, but also in addition has tennis courts and a skate park. Oviedo also has a YMCA, golf course, county library branch, Little League, bowling/pinball center, a boating complex, and a nature nursery. Several large retailers in Oviedo include Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's amongst others. Oviedo is also home to numerous housing developments including Alafaya Woods, Whispering Woods, Aloma Woods, Remington Park, Huntington, Carillon, Little Creek, Sanctuary, Kingsbridge, Riverside, Riverwind Apartments, Twin Rivers, Waverlee Woods and Bear Creek. Newer subdivisions include Oviedo Forest, Oviedo Gardens, Providence, Clayton's Crossing, Stratford Green, the Trails, Live Oak Reserve, and Aulin's Landing of Oviedo—named after one of the city's founding settlers and first postmaster, Andrew Aulin. Attractions Black Hammock Adventures is a complex that offers airboat rides and a display of live gators. Lukas Butterfly Encounter is also located in Oviedo. The Pinball Lounge, located in the Oviedo Bowling Center, has the largest concentration of pinball machines in the state. The \\"Oviedo Lights\\" is a local roadside attraction. A mural dedicated to the phenomenon is painted on the wall of the local Tijuana Flats. \\"The Rising\\" This annual event is held the last Saturday each October and invites the entire town to travel a 5K route that leads past 10 historic sites, then \\"enjoy a homemade pancake breakfast while watching an interactive performance from actors in costume portraying Oviedo's founders, who are back from beyond the grave for one magical weekend.\\" This is a kid-friendly event not designed to be scary, but to educate people on the town's history. =Oviedo chickens= A chicken in Oviedo Part of Oviedo's southern charm is the population of chickens that roam the downtown area. There are so many of them roaming the area that traffic often stops as they cross the roads. The chickens have been featured on Oviedo T-shirts and coffee mugs and a poster commemorating one of Oviedo's yearly festivals, \\"A Taste of Oviedo.\\" An image of a rooster is painted on all welcome signs for roads leading into Oviedo, and many residents have bumper stickers that say, \\"I brake for Oviedo's chickens\\". Contrary to what some believe, there are no specific laws or statutes surrounding the chickens, neither for their protection nor for their removal - the latter being something some residents would like to see due to the danger they pose with traffic in the congested town center. For others, however, the chickens add an element of fun. There are city ordinances that protect birds in the city limits, and the entire city is designated a bird sanctuary. Chickens are afforded the courtesy of protection under the code. The chickens were also the subject of a short documentary that was part of the Florida Film Festival 2009. Local publications The Seminole Voice and The Seminole Chronicle (publication ceased in July 2014) are both print newspapers that cover Seminole County news, with a focus on the Winter Springs, Oviedo, and Chuluota areas of the county. The Oviedo Voice has covered Oviedo since 1993. The Oviedo Citizen is an online publication that has been covering Oviedo news since August 2008. Weather events =2004 hurricane season= In August 2004, the northwestern side of Hurricane Charley passed directly over Oviedo while still a category 2 storm. More than half the city, as well as much of the surrounding unincorporated areas, had no power for five to seven days. School was not in session county-wide for one full school week. The damages ranged from toppled oaks to destroyed homes. The worst damage was in Palm Valley, a mobile home retirement community less than a mile from UCF. Charley's damage in Oviedo is considered to be the worst in Seminole County history. Barely a month later, hurricanes Frances and Jeanne further battered the area resulting in additional damage and power outages, but they did not reach the level of Charley's fury. =Tropical Storm Fay= Tropical Storm Fay was stationary over Oviedo for days during 2008 with high winds, heavy rains, and flooded roads.

The population was 19,860 at the 2000 census. History Long before the first Spanish settlers arrived, there was an Indian village in what is known as Palm Valley today. Several Indian mounds have been uncovered revealing points, pottery and human skeletons. Early Franciscan missionaries constructed a mission in the area called The Nativity of Our Lady of Tolomato. By 1703, Don Diego Espinoza had settled in what is today the Palm Valley area. His vast ranch and the surrounding territory was known as Diego Plains. In the 1730s, the ranch was fortified to protect its inhabitants from Indian attack. By 1739, Great Britain and Spain were at war and trouble was brewing for the Diego Plains settlers. British general James Oglethorpe was commissioned to harass the Spanish settlements south of the colony of Georgia, so the Spanish governor fortified the Diego farmhouse which was already being called Fort San Diego. After Oglethorpe’s failure to capture St. Augustine, the Spanish military abandoned Fort San Diego, but other inhabitants moved into the area, living off the land and the cattle. In 1908, a canal was dug through Diego Plains connecting the San Pablo River to the north with the Tolomato River near St. Augustine to the south. This intracoastal canal made access to the valley much easier for the residents that had settled in this area. In addition to raising cattle, they farmed, logged, and sold palm fronds to religious groups. The many palm trees growing in the region led some of the settlers to decide on the name Palm Valley for their community. Prohibition turned some of the valley residents to another source of income – moonshine. The abundant water supply and deep woods areas in the valley were ideal for the concealment of illegal whiskey distilling. The moonshine industry thrived even after the Volstead Act was repealed in 1933, but the rising price of sugar finally brought the illegal whiskey industry to an end. Palm Valley remained a quiet area of the Beaches, between A1A and U.S. 1. There were many farms where produce and livestock were raised. The development of the Beaches has also affected Palm Valley. Today most farms in the valley have disappeared, opening the land for luxurious residences overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. Geography Palm Valley is located at (30.206580, -81.387256).

Founded in 1565 by Spanish explorers, it is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the United States proper (San Juan, Puerto Rico was settled earlier, in 1521). St. Augustine was founded on September 8, 1565, by Spanish admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Florida's first governor. He named the settlement \\"San Agustín\\", as his ships bearing settlers, troops, and supplies from Spain had first sighted land in Florida eleven days earlier on August 28, the feast day of St. Augustine. The city served as the capital of Spanish Florida for over 200 years. It was designated as the capital of British East Florida when the colony was established in 1763; Great Britain returned Florida to Spain in 1783. Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819, and St. Augustine was designated the capital of the Florida Territory upon ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821. The Florida National Guard made the city its headquarters that same year. The territorial government moved and made Tallahassee the capital of Florida in 1824. The county seat of St. Johns County, St. Augustine is part of Florida's First Coast region and the Jacksonville metropolitan area. Since the late 19th century, St. Augustine's distinct historical character has made the city a tourist attraction.  History  View of St. Augustine in 1891 from the former San Marco Hotel, Spanish St. on left, Huguenot Cemetery lower left corner, Cordova St. on right Replicas of the Medici lions of Florence, Italy at the approach to the Bridge of Lions donated by Andrew Anderson =Founding by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés= Founded in 1565 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the contiguous United States. It is the second-oldest continuously inhabited city of European origin in United States territory after San Juan, Puerto Rico (founded in 1521). In 1560, King Philip II appointed Menéndez as Captain General, and his brother Bartolomé Menéndez as Admiral, of the Fleet of the Indies. Thus Pedro Menéndez commanded the galleons of the great Armada de la Carrera, or Spanish Treasure Fleet, on their voyage from the Caribbean and Mexico to Spain, and determined the routes they followed. In early 1564 he asked permission to go to Florida to search for La Concepcion, the galeon Capitana, or flagship, of the New Spain fleet commanded by his son, Admiral Juan Menéndez. The ship had been lost in September 1563 when a hurricane scattered the fleet as it was returning to Spain, at the latitude of Bermuda off the coast of South Carolina. The crown repeatedly refused his request. In 1565, however, the Spanish decided to destroy the French outpost of Fort Caroline, located in what is now Jacksonville. The crown approached Menéndez to fit out an expedition to FloridaPickett Pickett 2011, p.84 on the condition that he explore and settle the region as King Philip's adelantado, and eliminate the Huguenot French,Lowery 1911, p.100 whom the Catholic Spanish considered to be dangerous heretics.Lowery 1911, p.105 Menéndez was in a race to reach Florida before the French captain Jean Ribault, who was on a mission to secure Fort Caroline. The two fleets met in a brief skirmish off the coast, but it was not decisive. On 28 August 1565, the feast day of St. Augustine of Hippo, Menéndez's crew finally sighted land. Menéndez landed on 8 September and founded the settlement they named San Agustín (Saint Augustine). At the landing spot, Father Francisco López de Mendoza Grajales celebrated the first Catholic mass offered in the colony. The settlement was built in the former Timucua village of Seloy; its location was chosen for its defensibility and proximity to a fresh water artesian spring. A French attack on St. Augustine was thwarted by a violent squall that ravaged the French naval forces. Taking advantage of this, Menéndez marched his troops overland to Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River, about north. The Spanish easily overwhelmed the lightly defended French garrison, which had been left with only a skeleton crew of 20 soldiers and about 100 others, killing most of the men and sparing about 60 women and children. The bodies of the victims were hung in trees with the inscription: \\"Hanged, not as Frenchmen, but as \\"Lutherans\\" (heretics).\\" Menéndez renamed the fort San Mateo and marched back to St. Augustine, where he discovered that the shipwrecked survivors from the French ships had come ashore to the south of the settlement. A Spanish patrol encountered the remnants of the French force, and took them prisoner. Menéndez accepted their surrender, but then executed all of them except a few professing Catholics and some Protestant workers with useful skills, at what is now known as Matanzas Inlet (Matanzas is Spanish for \\"slaughters\\"). The site is very near the national monument Fort Matanzas, built in 1740-1742 by the Spanish. =Invasions by pirates and enemies of Spain= Succeeding governors of the province maintained a peaceful coexistence with the local Native Americans, allowing the isolated outpost of St. Augustine some stability for a few years. On May 28 and 29, 1586, soon after the Anglo-Spanish War began between England and Spain, the English privateer Sir Francis Drake sacked and burned St. Augustine. The approach of his large fleet obliged Governor Pedro Menéndez Márquez and the townspeople to flee for their safety. When the English got ashore, they seized some artillery pieces and a royal strongbox containing gold ducats, the garrison payroll. The killing of their sergeant major by the Spanish rearguard caused Drake to order the town burnt. In 1609 and 1611, expeditions were sent out from St. Augustine against the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia. In the second half of the 17th century, unsettled groups of Indians, forced southward by the expanding English colony in Carolina, made raids into Florida and killed the Franciscan priests who served at the Catholic missions. Requests by successive governors of the province to strengthen the presidio’s garrison and fortifications were ignored by the Spanish Crown which had other priorities in its vast empire. The charter of 1663 for the new Province of Carolina, issued by King Charles II of England, was revised in 1665, claiming lands as far southward as 29 degrees north latitude, about 65 miles south of the existing settlement at St. Augustine. The English buccaneer Robert Searle then sacked St. Augustine in 1668, killing sixty people and pillaging government buildings, churches and houses, after which his pirates ransomed off some of their hostages and sold others into slavery. This raid and the establishment of the English settlement at Charles Town spurred the Spanish monarchy to finally acknowledge the threat represented by the new English colonies to the north and strengthen the city's defenses. In 1669, Queen Regent Mariana ordered the Viceroy of New Spain to disburse funds for the construction of a permanent masonry fortress, which began in 1672. Before the fortress was completed, buccaneers Michel de Grammont and Nicolas Brigaut planned an attack in 1686 which was foiled: their ships were run aground, Grammont and his crew were lost, and Brigaut was captured ashore by Spanish soldiers. The Castillo de San Marcos was completed in 1695, not long before an attack by Governor Moore's forces from Carolina in November, 1702. Failing to take the fort after a siege of 58 days, the British troops burned St. Augustine to the ground as they retreated. In 1740, the town was again besieged, this time by the governor of the British colony of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe, who was also unable to take the fort. =Loyalist haven under British rule= The Treaty of Paris (1763), signed after Great Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War, ceded Florida to Great Britain in exchange for Cuba and the Philippines. The vast majority of Spanish St. Augustinians left Florida for Cuba, Florida became Great Britain's fourteenth and fifteenth North American colonies, and consequently St. Augustine became a Loyalist haven during the American Revolutionary War. After the mass exodus of St. Augustinians, Great Britain sought to populate its new territory. The London Board of Trade advertised 20,000-acre lots to any group that would settle in Florida within ten years, with one resident per 100 acres. White male pioneers were given 100 acres of land and 50 additional acres for each family member they brought. Slavery was permitted in the two new colonies of East and West Florida. Under Governor James Grant, almost 3 million acres of land were granted in East Florida alone. Second stories were added to existing Spanish homes and new houses were built. Cattle ranching and plantation agriculture began to thrive. During this twenty year British period, the British took command of both the Castillo de San Marcos (renamed Fort St. Mark) and of Fort Matanzas. They placed one sergeant, 6–8 privates of infantry, and one private from the Royal Artillery at Fort Matanzas. Once war broke out, loyalist St. Augustine residents burned effigies of Sam Adams and John Hancock in the plaza. Fort St. Mark became a training and supply base, as well a prisoner of war camp where three signers of the Declaration of Independence and South Carolina's lieutenant governor Christopher Gadsden were held. Local militia composed of Florida, Georgia, and Carolina inhabitants formed the East Florida Rangers in 1776 and were reorganized to form the King's Rangers in 1779. Spanish General Bernardo de Gálvez, harassed the British in West Florida and captured Pensacola. Fears that the Spanish would then move to capture St. Augustine, however, went unfounded. The second Treaty of Paris (1783), which recognized the independence of the former British colonies north of Florida, ceded Florida back to Spain and granted the Bahamas to Britain. As a result, some of the town's Spanish citizens returned to St Augustine. Refugees from Dr. Andrew Turnbull's troubled colony in New Smyrna had fled to St. Augustine in 1777, made up the majority of the city's population during British rule, and stayed when the Spanish Crown took control again. This group was, and still is, referred to locally as \\"Menorcans\\", even though it also included settlers from Italy, Corsica and the Greek islands. =Second Spanish period= During the Second Spanish period (1784–1821) of Florida, Spain was dealing with invasions of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleon's armies in the Peninsular War, and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere as revolution swept South America. The royal administration of Florida was neglected, as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the Crown. The United States, however, considered Florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in North America, and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it. The Adams–Onís Treaty, negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821, ceded Florida and St. Augustine, still its capital at the time, to the United States. =Territory of Florida= According to the Adams–Onís Treaty, the United States acquired East Florida and absolved Spain of $5 million of debt. Spain renounced all claims to West Florida and the Oregon Country. Andrew Jackson returned to Florida in 1821, upon ratification of the treaty, and established a new territorial government. Americans from older plantation societies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas began to move to the area. West Florida was quickly consolidated with East and the new capital of Florida became Tallahassee, halfway between the old capitals of St. Augustine and Pensacola, in 1824. Once many Americans had begun to immigrate to the new territory, it became apparent that there would be continued skirmishes with local Creek and Miccosukee peoples and white settlers encroaching on their land. The United States government favored removal policies, but local indigenous groups in Florida refused to leave without fighting. The nineteenth century saw three Seminole Wars. In 1823, territorial governor William Duval and James Gadsden signed the Treaty of Moultrie Creek, forcing Seminoles onto a four million acre reservation in central Florida. The Second Seminole War (1835–1842) was the longest war of Indian removal and resulted when the United States government attempted to move the Seminole people from central Florida to a Creek Reservation west of the Mississippi River. As a result of the Seminole War, Seminole prisoners were held captive in the Castillo de San Marcos, renamed Fort Marion after General Francis Marion, who fought in the American Revolution, in the 1830s. By 1840, the territory's population had reached 54,477 people. Half the population were enslaved African Americans. Steamboats were popular on the Apalachicola and St. Johns River and there were several plans for railroad construction. The territory south of present-day Gainesville was sparsely populated by whites. In 1845 the Florida Territory was admitted into the Union as the State of Florida. = Civil War = Slave Market, St. Augustine, Florida in 1886 Florida joined the Confederacy after the Civil War began in 1861, and Confederate authorities remained in control of St. Augustine for fourteen months, although it was barely defended. The Union conducted a blockade of shipping. In 1862 Union troops gained control of St. Augustine and controlled it through the rest of the war. With the economy already suffering, many residents fled. =Henry Flagler and the railroad= Henry Flagler, a co-founder with John D. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Company, spent the winter of 1883 in St. Augustine and found the city charming, but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate. He had the idea to make St. Augustine a winter resort for wealthy Americans from the north, and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form the Florida East Coast Railway. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development. Flagler finished construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city, the 450-room Hotel Ponce de Leon and the 250-room Hotel Alcazar. The next year, he purchased the Casa Monica Hotel (renaming it the Cordova Hotel) across the street from both the Alcazar and the Ponce de Leon. His chosen architectural firm, Carrère and Hastings, radically altered the appearance of St. Augustine with these hotels, giving it a skyline and beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of the Spanish Renaissance Revival and Moorish Revival styles. With the opening of the Ponce de Leon in 1888, St. Augustine became the winter resort of American high society for a few years. When Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad was extended southward to Palm Beach and then Miami in the early 20th century, the wealth stopped in St. Augustine en route to the southern resorts. Wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in South Florida, where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare. St. Augustine nevertheless still attracted tourists, and eventually became a destination for families traveling in automobiles as new highways were built and Americans took to the road for annual summer vacations. The tourist industry soon became the dominant sector of the local economy. = Civil Rights Movement = In late 1963, nearly a decade after the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation of schools was unconstitutional, African Americans were still trying to get St. Augustine to integrate the public schools in the city. They were also trying to integrate public accommodations, such as lunch counters, and were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence. Local college students held non-violent protests throughout the city, including sit-ins at the local Woolworth's, picket lines, and marches through the downtown. These protests were often met with police violence. Homes of African Americans were firebombed, black leaders were assaulted and threatened with death, and others were fired from their jobs. In the spring of 1964, St. Augustine civil rights leader Robert Hayling asked the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and its leader Martin Luther King Jr. for assistance. From May until July 1964, King and Hayling, along with Andrew Young, organized marches, sit-ins, and other forms of peaceful protest in St. Augustine. Hundreds of black and white civil rights supporters were arrested, and the jails were filled to capacity. At the request of Hayling and King, white civil rights supporters from the North, including students, clergy, and well-known public figures, came to St. Augustine and were arrested together with Southern activists. St. Augustine was the only place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there occurred on June 11, 1964, on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world. The Ku Klux Klan responded to these protests with violent attacks that were widely reported in national and international media. Popular revulsion against the Klan and police violence in St. Augustine generated national sympathy for the black protesters and became a key factor in Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, leading eventually to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which provided federal enforcement of constitutional rights. =Modern St. Augustine= In 1965, St. Augustine celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding, and jointly with the State of Florida, inaugurated a program to restore part of the colonial city. The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was formed to reconstruct more than thirty-six buildings to their historical appearance, which was completed within a few years. When the State of Florida abolished the Board in 1997, the City of St. Augustine assumed control of the reconstructed buildings, as well as other historic properties including the Government House. In 2010, the city transferred control of the historic buildings to UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc., a direct support organization of the University of Florida. In 2015, St. Augustine celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding with a four-day long festival and a visit from Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain. On October 7, 2016 Hurricane Matthew caused widespread flooding in downtown St. Augustine.  Geography and climate  View of St. Augustine from the top of the lighthouse on Anastasia Island St. Augustine is located at (29.8946910, −81.3145170). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (21.99%) is water. Access to the Atlantic Ocean is via the St. Augustine Inlet of the Matanzas River. St. Augustine has a humid subtropical climate or Cfa – typical of the Gulf and South Atlantic states. The low latitude and coastal location give the city a mostly warm and sunny climate. Like much of Florida, St. Augustine enjoys a high number of sunny days, averaging 2,900 hours annually. Unlike much of the contiguous United States, St. Augustine's driest time of year is winter. The hot and wet season extends from May through October, while the cool and dry season extends November through April. In summer, highs are in the 80s to 90s and lows are in the 70s. The Bermuda High pumps in hot and unstable tropical air from the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, which help create the daily thundershowers that are typical in summer months. Intense but very brief downpours are common in summer in the city. Fall and spring are warm and sunny with highs from 73 °F to 86 °F and lows in the 50s to 70s. In winter, St. Augustine has generally mild and sunny weather typical of the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February, with highs from 66 °F to 69 °F and lows from 46 °F to 49 °F. From November through April, St. Augustine often has long periods of rainless weather. April can see near drought conditions with brush fires and water restrictions in place. St. Augustine averages six frosts per year. The record cold of happened in 1835, decades before permanent weather records were established. Hurricanes occasionally impact the region; however, like most areas prone to such storms, St. Augustine rarely suffers a direct hit by a major hurricane. The last direct hit by a major hurricane to the city was Hurricane Dora in 1964. Extensive flooding occurred in the downtown area of St. Augustine when Hurricane Matthew passed east of the city in October 2016.

There are no county high schools located within St. Augustine's current city limits, but St. Augustine High School, Pedro Menendez High School, and St. Johns Technical High School are located in the vicinity. The Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, a state-operated boarding school for deaf and blind students, was founded in the city in 1885. The Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates the St. Joseph Academy, Florida's oldest Catholic high school, to the west of the city. There are several institutions of higher education in and around St. Augustine. Flagler College is a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1968. It is located in the former Ponce de Leon Hotel in downtown St. Augustine. St. Johns River State College, a state college in the Florida College System, has its St. Augustine campus just west of the city. Also in the area are the University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Florida State College at Jacksonville in Jacksonville. The institution now known as Florida Memorial University was located in St. Augustine from 1918 to 1968, when it relocated to its present campus in Miami. Originally known as Florida Baptist Academy, then Florida Normal, and then Florida Memorial College, it was a historically black institution and had a wide impact on St. Augustine while it was located there. During World War II it was chosen as the site for training the first blacks in the U. S. Signal Corps. Among its faculty members was Zora Neale Hurston; a historic marker is placed at the house where she lived while teaching at Florida Memorial (and where she wrote her autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road.)

The population was 41,590 at the 2010 census. As of 2019, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 46,103. It was named after the Fort Pierce Army post which was built nearby in 1838 during the Second Seminole War. The military post had been named for Benjamin Kendrick Pierce, a career United States Army officer and the brother of President Franklin Pierce. Fort Pierce was awarded the 2005 City of Excellence Award by the Florida League of Cities for overall excellence in city government and in 2011, Main Street Fort Pierce, Inc. received the Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in downtown.

Environment =Shore Protection project= According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, The Fort Pierce Beach Shore Protection project includes 1.3 miles of shore line running from immediately south of the Fort Pierce Inlet southward to Surfside Park. The project is on a two-year renourishment cycle due to impacts to the beach from the federal navigation project at Fort Pierce Inlet. This two-year renourishment cycle is a much shorter renourishment interval than what is typical for other projects along the east coast of Florida. The initial construction of the project occurred in 1971 and the ninth nourishment was completed in May 2013. Completion of plans and specifications, advertisement and award for the 10th renourishment contract were completed in FY 2014. The project was scheduled to start mid-February 2015. Sand for the project is dredged from an approved offshore borrow area known as the Capron Shoal and then pumped via a pipeline onto the 1.3 miles of beach south of the Fort Pierce Inlet. The sponsor, St. Lucie County, is preparing a General Reevaluation Report (GRR) for the project at their own expense that will evaluate extending Federal participation for an additional 50 years. Current Federal participation expires in 2020. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates the total cost of the project to be $75.9 million, with an estimated U.S. Federal Government share of $46.4 million. No funding for the project was requested by the U.S. President from the U.S. Congress in Fiscal Year 2016. =Ecology= The Experimental Oculina Research Reserve preserves the Oculina Banks, a reef of ivory bush coral (Oculina varicosa) off the coast of Fort Pierce, Florida. In 1984, a 92 square-nautical-mile (316 km2) portion of these reefs was designated the \\"Oculina Habitat Area of Particular Concern\\". In 1994, the area was closed to all manner of bottom fishing and was redesignated as a research reserve. In 2000, the marine protected area was expanded to 300 square nautical miles (1,030 km2) and prohibited all gears that caused mechanical disruption to the habitat. The city is also known for its large manatee population. =Marina= Due to the devastation caused at the Fort Pierce City Marina by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004, FEMA mandated a plan to ensure that the rebuilt facility would be protected from future such events before FEMA would release funding for the repairs. Starting in 2012, construction began to create 12 artificial barrier islands including oyster beds, lime rock artificial reefs, mangrove fringes and coastal dune. The \\"core\\" of the islands was constructed of TITANTubes, sometimes referred to as geotextile tubes or geotubes, manufactured by Flint Industries and covered by a coastal marine mattress and then armor stone. The project was completed in 2013 after six years of planning, permitting and construction and a cost of $18 million.

Maroons who fought for England joined the black Seminoles after the runaway slaves fled to Florida, a free territory under Spanish rule, to avoid remaining in slavery following the American Revolution. Both black Seminoles and maroons lived with the Seminoles in a feudal-like relationship; the black Seminoles paid the Seminoles with a percentage of their crops in exchange for their freedom. The black Seminoles settled in the Center Hill area in 1813 and named it Peliklakaha. Accompanying them was Seminole chief Micanopy, who made Peliklakaha his residence after the death of Payne. The town had about 100 residents. They came as runaway slaves from Georgia. Others were of African descent, specifically from the Kongo region, and some Seminoles, including one of Micanopy's wives, lived in Peliklakaha. The town's layout was influenced by slave quarters, Seminole villages, and African villages. The residents lived in buildings constructed from daub, thatch, and lumber. Peliklakaha participated in regional trade with the Seminoles, black hunters travelling to South Florida, and white travelers as the village was located at the center of several well-travelled Indian trails. The United States and Florida governments noticed the area's fertility. In 1823, while informing the Seminoles about the meeting at Moultrie Creek, Horatio S. Dexter, an envoy sent by Florida territorial governor William P. Duval, discovered that the black Seminoles grew rice, peanuts, and corn. In 1826, United States Army General George McCall visited Peliklakaha and noticed that their farms were located on what General McCall called \\"the finest land\\". =Second Seminole War= Whites called the town \\"Abraham's Old Town\\", after Abraham, a former slave who had been given his freedom by the British and who served as a recruiter and an interpreter for the Seminoles. After hearing that Dade and his men were to cross through the territory, Abraham anticipated an attack on Peliklakaha and convinced Micanopy to move Seminole soldiers to the Fort King Road. Abraham left the village after Dade's Massacre on December 28, 1835. A short time later in 1836, General Winifred Scott moved General Abraham Eustis' troops to the Peliklakaha area to destroy the Seminoles. General Eustis and his troops burned Peliklakaha; no Seminoles were killed as Peliklakaha's population fled to the Wahoo Swamp before Eustis’ forces arrived. General Eustis would later commission a painting depicting the burning of Peliklakaha, which later was hung in the Library of Congress. On April 19, 1842, Colonel William Worth attacked Halleck Tustenuggee at Peliklakaha. During the battle, Halleck Tustenuggee and his warriors constructed a log barricade. United States Army soldiers attacked the front of the barricade while dragoons attacked from the back. Halleck Tustenuggee and his warriors retreated, and the United States Army burned the camp. The battle left one soldier dead and four wounded on the United States side and one soldier killed and one captured on the Seminole side. A few days later, Halleck Tustenuggee, two of his wives, and two of his children voluntarily surrendered to Worth at Warm Springs. On August 14, 1842, Worth declared the Second Seminole War over. =Settlement by whites= In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the Mobley and Beville families settled in the area. Either the town's postmaster Thomas W. Spicer or Carrie Lovell named the town \\"Center Hill\\". Spicer thought that the town was the hub of activity. Lovell named the town after its location of being on a hill in the center of the county. =Agricultural heyday= According to Broward Mill, the past president of the Sumter County Historical Society, Center Hill was known for its string bean production in the early part of the 20th century. In 1931, Center Hill shipped green beans, green peas, and lima beans to Baltimore, Boston, New York City, Chicago, and Detroit. Beginning in the mid-1930s, Center Hill's soil fertility declined. Local bean farmers blamed a decrease in the water table. They believed that the creation of the Jumper Creek Drainage District, which the local circuit court formed in 1922 to reclaim about 24,600 acres by draining water from Jumper Creek into Jumper Lake and the Withlacoochee River, deprived them of water and forced them to irrigate large fields. By 1975, bean production was virtually nonexistent, and the population decreased from a peak of 1,500 people to 37 in 1970. In 1988, area farmers still sent their bell peppers, cucumbers, squash, tomatoes, and watermelons to Center Hill for packing and shipping. =1990s= In the 1990s, Center Hill gained a reputation of being a speed trap. The town received a Clinton administration community policing grant of $167,000 (USD) in order to hire ten full and part- time police officers. From the receipt of the grant to 1997, residents complained about the officers issuing traffic tickets, especially for speeding. In November 1997, four police officers, including Police Chief Kendall Alsobrook, left the police force, and the department's staff was reduced to one full-time officer. =Peliklakaha's rediscovery= In 1998, archaeologists from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida began the first excavation of a black Seminole village in a pasture about two miles from Center Hill. The researchers hoped to determine the town's social structure and the former residents' lifestyle. The investigators found dozens of artifacts, including iron pieces, stoneware, glass beads, nails, and pottery. Historians believe that over 100 black Seminoles lived in Peliklakaha, the largest known black Seminole village. Historians also believe that Peliklakaha was rebuilt after Abraham was among the first Seminoles and black Seminoles to be transferred to a reservation in the west. =2000s= On July 31, 2001, a 500-pound (227-kilogram) Siberian tiger named \\"Tie\\" fatally attacked Vincent Lowe, a worker at the Savage Kingdom exotic animal park who was attempting to earn state certification to work with the cats, while Lowe was repairing the cage. The tiger burst through his cage and pounced on Lowe before Lowe could fire his pistol at the tiger. Park owner Robert Baudy shot the cat. The incident was the second one in park history. The first was in March 1997 when another Siberian tiger escaped from its cage and mauled a worker before being killed by members of the Sumter County Sheriff's Department. In February 1999, state game officials discovered substandard cage wiring; the ranch corrected the issue by May 1999, the last inspection before the incident. On July 6, 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture ordered that Savage Kingdom's license be revoked permanently. Geography Center Hill is located at .

Industry One of the leading industries in Center Hill is Central Beef Industries. =Central Beef Industries= In 2013, the Seminole Tribe partnered with Central Beef to slaughter and cut beef for the tribe's \\"Seminole Pride\\" brand. Beginning in 1999, Central Beef disposed of 130,000 US gallons (492,103 liters) of wastewater containing high levels of sodium and fecal material per day into neighboring fields. Central Beef owner Marc Chernin offered to buy a neighboring rancher's land, but the rancher refused as he and his brother believed that the offer was too low. The ranchers attempted to informally resolve the issue by discussing it with Central Beef management, but they sued the beef processing plant in May 2006. Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued warning letters in 2001. A 2003 consent order attempted to address the issue of contamination, but the company, citing insufficient funds to line the ponds around Central Beef, failed to stop the pollution. In 2005, plant manager Dick Greene documented his concerns about the pollution. The DEP began an investigation in April 2006. On August 24, 2006, the DEP arrested Chernin on charges of hazardous waste disposal and felony commercial littering. Chernin pleaded no contest to the charges in July 2007, and he was sentenced to one year's probation. The charge of hazardous waste disposal was eventually dropped. After the ranchers' and the DEP's lawsuits, Central Beef began transporting the wastewater off the premises.

The population was 3,551 at the 2010 census. History =Early inhabitants= Boggy Island was an autonomous black Seminole village that was settled by Central African slaves from Kongo. Black Seminoles settled near the Boggy Island area of Lake Panasoffkee around 1813 and named it Sitarkey's Village after Sitarkey, an Alachua Seminole who had settled in the area. Nearby laid the areas of Gum Slough and Indian Mound Springs. The Seminoles used the Lake Panasoffkee area to hold councils and Green Corn Dances. The black Seminoles raised corn, rice, and sugar cane which Dexter gave them in 1822. In addition, residents in Sitarkey's Village raised livestock, including cattle, horses, and hogs. They also possibly planted one of the oldest orange groves in Florida. =Second Seminole War= Generally, the Sitakey's Village area was untouched during the Second Seminole War, allowing black Seminole families used the area as a refuge from the war. The United States Army, however, did search the village twice. Looking for Seminole warriors, the Second and Eighth Infantry divisions, led by Colonel Bennet Riley and Colonel W. J. Worth, traveled from Fort McClure to the Lake Panasoffkee area on June 10, 1840. On the morning of June 11, the troops found an empty village. After the battle of Wahoo Swamp, Osceola, possibly suffering from the effects of malaria that he contracted during the Seminole occupation of Fort Drane moved to the Panasoffkee Swamp to live with the black Seminoles who regarded him with devotion. On January 10, 1837, General Thomas Sidney Jesup, looking for Osceola, raided the village. Osceola and three warriors fled. Jesup captured 16 black Seminoles while the rest of the village escaped. In all, Osceola, 50 warriors, and their families left for the headwaters of the Ocklawaha River. Twelve days later, Jesup led his troops from Fort Armstrong to the Ocklawaha River. =Modern town= According to Broward Mill, the past president of the Sumter County Historical Society, Lake Panasoffkee from the time that Sumter County was settled by whites until damaging freezes which wiped out the area's citrus industry in the 1880s and 1890s. Charles G. King, a Cleveland entrepreneur, bought 2,500 acres (square kilometers) in Lake Panasoffkee and developed 737 acres (square kilometers) into Monarch Grove in 1908. An oak hammock on the property was left undisturbed. King and his employees used the sour oranges planted by the Seminoles for orange stock. In 1926, the grove produced about 40,000 boxes of oranges. Among the evidence was a group of house foundations and chimneys located in places where there were no known white settlers. County officials later believed that the cemetery was a family cemetery as the newer marked graves listed the names of the few people known to be buried there. =Lake Panasoffkee dredging= According to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation commissioners Bob Wattendorf and Marty Hale, Lake Panasoffkee had 15 fish camps and was considered to be one of the state's best places to fish. In 1981, water levels in Lake Panasoffkee dropped to levels that had not been seen since 1962, the year the Wysong Dam was built. Southwest Florida Water Management District officials discussed the construction of a temporary dam to elevate water levels. Lake Panasoffkee residents believed that the Wysong Dam contributed to the destruction of the Withlacoochee River.

She was found with a man's belt around her neck.\\"Little miss Panasoffkee,\\" by Dan Sullivan (The Villages Daily Sun; Saturday, October 7, 2006) The sheriff's department made several attempts to identify the woman. In 1986, the Sumter County Sheriff's Department, under the leadership of Sheriff Jamie Adams and lead investigating officer William O. Farmer, exhumed her body. A forensic anthropologist rendered composite sketches of the woman both at the time of her death and as a child, and the investigator also determined the woman's weight and height. In the early 1990s, the American television series Unsolved Mysteries featured the case in an episode. Each attempt to identify the woman was unsuccessful. In 2012, the Sumter County Sheriff's Department asked the University of South Florida's Tampa Bay Cold Case Project to reexamine the remains of \\"Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee\\". An isotope analysis performed by the project indicated she could have been an immigrant from Greece, possibly hailing from the town of Lavrion (located 60 miles (96 kilometers) southeast of Athens). The victim is believed to have moved to the United States between one and three months prior to her murder.The Doe Network Case File 470 The new information contradicted the Sumter County Sheriff's Department's initial assumption that the Jane Doe was either white or Native American; they had created composite sketches reflecting those ethnicities. Sumter County authorities determined, based on the time of her death, that she was visiting the Tarpon Springs area for the celebration of Epiphany on January 6, 1971. Based on the information from the forensic analysis, the Sumter County Sheriff's Department contacted the Tarpon Springs Police Department and the Greek Orthodox Church about the case and mailed 6,000 flyers to Tarpon Springs businesses and residents. As of 2016, the case is still unsolved. =Long nose gar= On April 14, 1985, Evan Merritt caught a 41-pound long nose gar in Lake Panasoffkee.

History Pietro Lorenzetti, detail of the Deposition of Christ, Fresco in the Lower Basilica at Assisi Duccio may be considered the \\"father of Sienese painting\\". The brothers Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti were \\"responsible for a crucial development in Sienese art, moving from the tradition inherited from Duccio towards a Gothic style, incorporating the innovations in Florence introduced by Giotto and Arnolfo di Cambio\\". \\"Sienese art flourished even when Siena itself had begun to decline economically and politically. And while the artists of 15th-century Siena did not enjoy the widespread patronage and respect that their 14th-century ancestors had received, the paintings and illuminated manuscripts they produced form one of the undervalued treasures in the bounty of Italian art.\\" In the late 15th century, Siena \\"finally succumbed\\" to the Florentine school's teachings on perspective and naturalistic representation, absorbing it's \\"humanist culture\\". In the 16th century the Mannerists Beccafumi and Il Sodoma worked there. While Baldassare Peruzzi was born and trained in Siena, his major works and style reflect his long career in Rome. The economic and political decline of Siena by the 16th century, and its eventual subjugation by Florence, largely checked the development of Sienese painting, although it also meant that a good proportion of Sienese works in churches and public buildings were not discarded or destroyed. Style Unlike Florentine art, Sienese art opted for a more decorative style and rich colors, with \\"thinner, elegant, and courtly figures\\". It also has \\"a mystical streak...characterized by a common focus on miraculous events, with less attention to proportions, distortions of time and place, and often dreamlike coloration\\".

History A post office called Wildwood has been in operation since 1881. The town was so named on account of its remote location in the woods. In April 2015, The Villages petitioned the city of Wildwood with plans to build 785 new homes on County Road 466A, across from Pinellas Plaza. Wildwood leaders rejected the expansion efforts citing concerns of the city losing its identity when it was to become overwhelmed by The Villages. On April 27, 2015, The Villages formally withdrew their plans for expansion, indicating that the City of Wildwood officials made too many requests that would be a “disservice to our residents and business partners.” There are no known plans for further expansion of The Villages into the city of Wildwood at this time. Crossroads of Florida Old railroad station Wildwood is located at the juncture of Interstate 75, Florida's Turnpike, State Road 44, and U.S. Highway 301. For many years Wildwood was the northern control city on Turnpike road signs however this was replaced with Ocala, Florida beginning in 2007. Because of its centralized location and easy access to both coasts, it is often referred to as \\"The Crossroads of Florida\\". Wildwood station operates as a CSX maintenance yard, and until 2004, was served by Amtrak's Palmetto between New York City and Tampa. Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach bus service makes a stop in Wildwood.

The city is the county seat of Suwannee County and is located east of Tallahassee. As of 2010, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 6,850. U.S. Highway 90, U.S. Highway 129 and Interstate 10 are major highways running through Live Oak. Freight service is provided by the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad, which acquired most of the former CSX main line from Pensacola to Jacksonville on June 1, 2019. It is served by the Suwannee County Airport as well as many private airparks scattered throughout the county. There is also a community named Live Oak in Washington County, Florida. History =19th century= Built along the Pensacola & Georgia Railroad in or prior to 1861, Live Oak was named for a southern live oak tree under which railroad workers rested and ate lunch. When a railroad depot was built nearby, the small community that sprung up around it was called “Live Oak Station” (first mentioned in records in 1861). The tree was located where the now-present Pepe's Mexican Grocery on U.S. 90 is located.\\"Live Oak, Florida\\" , See North Florida website Florida Railway engine #3 at the Seaboard yards in Live Oak circa 1915 During the Civil War, the Pensacola & Georgia Railroad served as a vital route for parts of North Florida, and earthworks were built where it crossed the Suwannee River west of Live Oak, to deter Union attacks; these earthworks still exist as part of the Suwannee River State Park, one of Florida's first State parks. In order to ease the supply problem into other parts of the Confederacy, the Confederate government decided to create a north–south railroad link into Georgia through Live Oak. The railroad junction was completed in early 1865, too late to help the Confederacy, but it opened up the interior of the county to settlement after the Civil War. Live Oak became the county seat of Suwannee County in 1868. An election held the following year confirmed Live Oak as the county seat, and it has remained such ever since. Live Oak was incorporated as a town in 1878. In 1903, it became a city and was the largest community in Suwannee County, serving as a minor railroad hub for the region. =20th century= In the 1905 State census, Live Oak was the largest inland, and fifth-largest overall, city in Florida (behind Jacksonville, Pensacola, Tampa, and Key West, in that order). Nearby resorts at Suwannee Springs and Dowling Park (formerly Hudson-upon-the-Suwannee) drew thousands of visitors from around the world to the sulphur springs and related nearby sports, boating, and hunting activities. The health benefits of the springs were touted in magazines and newspapers worldwide, supposedly.curing everything from arthritis to “female problems”. During the first decade of the twentieth century, Live Oak saw a construction boom. Notable buildings such as the Suwannee County Courthouse, Live Oak City Hall, and Suwannee Hotel were completed, and dozens of fine two- and three-story homes were erected along the major streets. By 1913, the main streets were bricked and a sewage system had been built. Suwannee County Courthouse in 1948 Live Oak soon lost status relative to explosive south Florida growth and the realization that the sulphur waters did nothing to combat various illnesses. Devastation of the cotton crop by the boll weevil near the end of the First World War nearly finished off the city and county as an economic powerhouse, and business stagnated with the coming of the Great Depression. Politically, Live Oak and Suwannee County remained powerful for another four decades until redistricting took into account the massive growth of southern Florida. Ruby Strickland, former postmistress of the community of Dowling Park, became mayor of Live Oak in 1924. She was the first female elected as mayor south of the Mason–Dixon line after universal suffrage was enacted in 1919. Strickland served two non- consecutive terms and represented the area at the Democratic National Convention of 1936. In 1940, the men of the local National Guard unit, Company E of the 124th Infantry (historically called the Suwannee Rifles), were mustered into service for one year of training at Camp Blanding, Florida. A week after the December 7, 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the unit was assigned to the 31st Division at Fort Benning, Georgia, to serve as a model infantry training unit. The unit was briefly deactivated in 1944, but reactivated the following month after many of the original men had been dispersed to other units; members served in both the European and Pacific theatres during World War II. Florida National Guard historian Robert Hawk noted that, \\"In the course of the Second World War, no unit of the Florida National Guard had more men killed, wounded in action, or dead from other causes than Company E, 124th Infantry.\\" The Live Oak unit was reorganized several times over the years as infantry, tank, and engineering companies, and now (2019) serves as the 868th Engineer Company. The unit has purportedly been called up to serve more than any other unit in Florida. In 1944, African American Willie James Howard was lynched in Live Oak for having \\"expressed his affections\\" to a white girl. He was subsequently murdered by the girl's father, former state legislator A.P. \\"Phil\\" Goff, who kidnapped Howard, bound him, and forced him to jump off a bridge. A Sewanee County grand jury failed to indict Goff. Media attention in Live Oak in the aftermath of the death of Willie James Howard would increase awareness of lynching in the United States. In 1948, Live Oak and Suwannee County received their first real public hospital, completed under the Hill-Burton Act that provided Federal funding for health care facilities to rural areas. The Suwannee County Hospital served the citizens of the region until being replaced in the early 1990s. In 1952, national attention was drawn to Live Oak and Suwannee County when a wealthy African American, Ruby McCollum, shot and killed Dr. Clifford Leroy Adams, Jr., a prominent, recently-elected state legislator, in his office across from the Suwannee County Courthouse. Originally thought to be a murder based upon an unpaid doctor's bill, it was soon revealed that the married Dr. Adams had fathered a child with McCollum (whose husband Sam oversaw the illegal \\"bolita\\" gaming). McCollum's murder conviction was overturned on a technicality in 1954 and she spent the next twenty years in the Florida State Mental Hospital in Chattahoochee after having been deemed mentally unfit to stand trial a second time. The murder and events surrounding it have become the source of many books and documentaries. Downtown Live Oak, flooded from Hurricane Dora in 1964 In the 1950s, the rest of Suwannee County received electricity and telephone service, something the City of Live Oak had since the late 1800s. In 1957, the Florida Sheriffs Association received property north of Live Oak for use as a Boys’ Ranch. Opening in 1958, this facility has continued to be used to help troubled boys from all of Florida; later, a Girls' Ranch and Youth Villa were constructed in other parts of the state for girls and sibling groups. In September 1964, Hurricane Dora dumped massive amounts of water on Live Oak, flooding major intersections and leaving the downtown area partially submerged. The damage led to the abandonment or tearing down of several historic buildings and the relocation of other businesses to higher ground. In 1983, the Suwannee County Development Authority opened a park north of Live Oak along the banks of the Suwannee River. This park was little developed until being sold to private individuals in the 1990s. Renamed the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, it hosts music festivals for all types of music, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors to Live Oak and Suwannee County annually. =21st century= Tropical Storm Debby (2012) surpassed the amount of rain brought by Hurricane Dora, and despite vastly improved drainage, much of Live Oak once again flooded. Interstates were shut down as portions were underwater, and much of the surrounding area was cut off from the outside world. In addition, dozens of sinkholes, some quite large, opened up all over the city and county, causing further damage. Several downtown buildings that were more than 100 years old were impacted and later torn down, replaced by public parks for community events. Live Oak remains the largest community and only full-fledged city in Suwannee County. Eco-tourism in and around Live Oak brings thousands of people from all over the country to places such as the nearby Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, the Suwannee River State Park, and numerous springs along the famed Suwannee River. In addition, agriculture- related business (including timber, pine straw, and watermelons) is still the dominant industry in Suwannee County, with international companies like Klausner Lumber making their home in and around Live Oak. Geography Geographically, Suwannee County is situated on a limestone bed riddled with underground freshwater streams, which surface in dozens of beautiful springs. This phenomenon of \\"Karst topography\\" gives the area a local supply of renewable fresh water and abundant sources of fishing. The county is known as a world-class cave diving site for SCUBA enthusiasts, and underwater cave explorer Sheck Exley chose to live here in order to have close access to many of the springs. Fishing sites include a number of small lakes about 5 miles east of the town. Suwannee Lake is the most well stocked and notable, but there is also Workman Lake, Dexter Lake, Campground Lake, Little Lake Hull, White Lake, Tiger Lake, Bachelor Lake, and Peacock Lake.Larry Kinder, Flyfisher's Guide to Freshwater Florida, p. 206, Wilderness Adventures Press, 2003 .

UCI was the state's first prison, and was originally called Florida State Prison, the name going with the newer institution when the two were split. Both institutions house inmates in Death Row facilities. FSP conducts all executions, while most death row inmates are housed at UCI. UCI has the most diverse population of any correctional institution in the state, with close management inmates and psych inmates as well as open population inmates. Most of the latter are age fifty and over. FSP houses the violent and criminally insane, all in solitary confinement.

The population was 181 at the 2010 census. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2018 estimates, the town had a population of 380. History The community was named for early settler Sam Worthington, who arrived prior to the first Seminole War of 1814–1819. The mineral spring on the Santa Fe River was alleged to have medicinal benefits, attracting people from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. In the early years, swimming was segregated, with men and women assigned specific time intervals. In 1906, the new owner constructed a 12'×12' concrete box around the spring to divert water into a 90'×50' concrete pool with a wall dividing the bathing area into sections for men and women. The complex included a hotel, recreation hall and bathhouse for the spring pool. Independence Day was always a big celebration at the springs. Thousands of people from surrounding communities would converge on the springs to picnic, swim, politic and converse with friends and fellow Floridians. A special train transported people from Jacksonville for the holiday festivities. An iron and timber bridge was built across the river in 1908, facilitating access to and from the south. It was replaced in 1937 with the present concrete structure. In the mid-twentieth century, the outflow from the spring declined, and then stopped flowing completely. Activity at the resort likewise curtailed, and the facility was abandoned. The area around the Santa Fe river is subject to periodic flooding, just as the flow at the spring varies widely. In 1972, flow was measured at 233,280 gallons per day. Worthington Springs was incorporated in 1963 with a Mayor–council government. Street lights were installed, and a playground was created in the town park. In 1975, a Community Center was built the included government offices for a City Hall.

Frederick DeBary in 1910 Historic DeBary Hall DeBary is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States, on the northern shore of the St. Johns River near Lake Monroe. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 19,320. It is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area, which was home to 590,289 people in 2010. History The Timucuan Indians once lived in the vicinity of Lake Monroe, where the domain of Chief Utina extended to just north of Lake George. They hunted, fished, and gathered plants and berries from the forest. By 1760, however, the Timucua had disappeared and been replaced by the Seminole tribe from Alabama and Georgia. Florida was acquired from Spain in 1821, but the Seminole Wars delayed settlement. In 1866, Elijah Watson of Enterprise sold land to Oliver and Amanda Arnett on the northern shore of the St. Johns River at Lake Monroe, where they built a house. The couple in turn sold in 1871 to (Samuel) Frederick deBary, a wealthy wine merchant from New York City, and that same year, he erected a hunting lodge. Called \\"DeBary Hall\\", the 8,000-sq-ft (700-m²), 20-room Italianate mansion featured a two-tiered veranda, stables, an ice house, and the state's first swimming pool, fed by a spring. Visitors included Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Grover Cleveland. Over time, he acquired an additional , planting orange groves and pecan trees. Some debate remains as to whether this was actually the first pool in Florida, as a St. Augustine pool has also made the same claim. One possibility is that this was the first spring-fed pool in the state, In 1875, deBary bought a small steamboat, the George M. Bird, to transport his horses and dogs along the St. Johns River for hunting expeditions, and also to take fruit to market. He established the DeBary Merchants' Line in 1876, a steamship service contracted to carry mail between Jacksonville and Enterprise. It acquired the sidewheeler Frederick DeBary. In 1883, the firm merged with the Baya Line, owned by Colonel H.T. Baya, to create the DeBary-Baya Merchants' Line, with 13 steamboats and a crew of 3,000 running to Sanford. The DeBary-Baya Merchants' Line sold its business in 1889 to the Clyde Line, which survived until 1928. Frederick deBary died in 1898, and his mansion is today a restored museum, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

It is the county seat of Volusia County. The city sits approximately north of the central business district of Orlando, and approximately west of the central business district of Daytona Beach. According to the City of Deland's website, the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research estimates Deland to have a population of 34,851 as of 2019. It is a part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach metropolitan area, which was home to 590,289 people as of the 2010 census. The city was founded in 1876, and was named for its founder, Henry Addison DeLand. DeLand is home to Stetson University, Florida's oldest private college, as well as the Museum of Art - DeLand. The DeLand Municipal Airport serves as an uncontrolled general aviation reliever airport to commercial operations at Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB), Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) and Orlando International Airport (MCO). History Known as Persimmon Hollow for the wild persimmon trees that grow around the natural springs, the area was originally accessible only by steamboat up the St. Johns River. It was settled in 1874 by Captain John Rich, who built a log cabin. Henry Addison DeLand, a baking soda magnate from Fairport, New York, visited there in 1876, and envisioned building a citrus, agricultural and tourism center. That year he bought land and founded the town, naming it after himself. He sold his northern business and hired people to clear land, lay out streets, erect buildings and recruit settlers, most of whom came from upstate New York. (DeLand never lived in the city year-round.) In 1877 DeLand built a public school for the town. To enhance the community's stature and culture, and to enhance the value of his local real estate holdings, in 1883 DeLand established DeLand Academy, Florida's first private college. However, in 1885, a freeze destroyed the orange crop. One story has it that DeLand had guaranteed settlers' investments as an inducement to relocate, and so was obligated to buy back their ruined groves, though there is no hard evidence that this took place. As for many other would-be real estate magnates in the area at the time, his Florida investments were nearly worthless after the freeze, and he returned to his home in the North. DeLand entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer from Philadelphia and one of the institution's founding trustees. In 1889, it was renamed John B. Stetson University in its patron's honor. In 1900 it founded the first law school in Florida (which relocated to Gulfport in 1954). Its various sports teams are called the Hatters. The City of DeLand was officially incorporated in 1882, and became the county seat of Volusia County in 1887. It was the first city in Florida to have electricity. According to city officials, minutes of the first City Commission meeting in 1882 show the city decided to create a seal with the emblems of \\"Faith, Hope and Charity,\\" namely a cross, an anchor and a heart. The city seal was briefly the object of a controversy in 2013, when the national group Americans United for Separation of Church and State sent the city a letter in which they argued that the seal unconstitutionally promotes Christianity, thus allegedly breaching the First Amendment Establishment Clause. The controversy faded after the city refused to change the seal. During the 1920s Florida Land Boom, fine examples of stucco Mediterranean Revival architecture by native architect Medwin Peek and others were constructed in DeLand. Many of these buildings have been handsomely restored, including the restored Athens Theatre. Since 1992, the city has hosted the DeLand Fall Festival of the Arts, a two-day event held annually in the historic downtown area on the weekend before Thanksgiving. As of 2009, the event has an annual attendance of more than 50,000 during the weekend. Geography =Topography= DeLand is located at , in Western Volusia County.

DeLand is drained by the St. Johns River. = Climate = On February 2, 2007, DeLand and the surrounding area was the site of a major tornado outbreak. One tornado passed through Deland. It reached a peak intensity of EF-3 (160-165 mph), had a track length of 26 miles, and was responsible for the deaths of 13 people. On August, 19, 2020, an EF-2 tornado made landfall in DeLand, and caused an estimated $7.4 million in damages over its 4.6 mile path.

The men's and women's basketball teams play at the J. Ollie Edmunds Center, an on-campus arena which opened in 1974 and seats approximately 5,000 spectators. The Hatters baseball team plays at Melching Field at Conrad Park, a 2,500-seat ballpark located off campus just south of downtown DeLand. Melching Field was built in 1999 and is recognized as one of the finer college baseball venues in the NCAA, having hosted numerous Atlantic Sun Conference championships, the 2018 NCAA Baseball Regionals, and other baseball related tournaments and events. Prior to the opening of Melching Field, the Hatters played at old Conrad Park on the same site, which also hosted spring training games in the 1940s and 1950s and the DeLand Red Hats, a Florida State League minor league franchise. Adjacent to Melching Field is Spec Martin Stadium, a 6,000-seat football stadium. Spec Martin Stadium hosts DeLand High School Bulldog football and soccer games, and serves as home of the Stetson University Hatters football team. Stetson had discontinued its football program in the early 1960s, but reinstated the sport in 2013, when it joined the Pioneer Football League. As part of Stetson's re-entry into college football, Spec Martin Stadium underwent significant renovations, including a new press box, handicapped and premium seating areas, and new locker room facilities. DeLand has been called the \\"skydiving capital of the world\\", with the majority of skydiving industries calling it home. The skydiving industry employs over 500 workers from the DeLand area. This in combination with the tourist end of the industry makes it one of the town's largest supporters and invaluable to the local economy. Central Florida Warriors of the USA Rugby League are based in DeLand. In the movies DeLand has been the filming location for a number of television and movie projects, including the 1999 Adam Sandler comedy The Waterboy. Scenes showing the fictional South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs home football games were shot at Spec Martin Stadium. Classroom and exterior scenes were filmed at Stetson University. Scenes involving Sandler's character's home were actually filmed in neighboring DeBary. Ghost Story, starring Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr and Craig Wasson, was filmed in part at Stetson University and the Holiday House. The HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon filmed several scenes on the campus of Stetson University. The 1999 independent film The First of May, starring Mickey Rooney and Joe DiMaggio, was shot on various locations throughout DeLand. Days of Thunder, starring Tom Cruise, was also partially filmed in DeLand. New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism (2008) was filmed almost entirely in DeLand in 2006 and 2007.\\"Seeing Stars: Reviews are in for Film Festival\\" Review of New Urban Cowboy by Jeff Farance, Daytona News Journal, October 4, 2007, 8E.The New Urban Cowboy: Michael E.

Its population was estimated to be 27,843 in 2019 by the United States Census Bureau. The downtown section of the city is located on the west side of the Indian River and the Indian River Lagoon system.

Visitors participate in water sports of all kinds, including swimming, scuba diving, kitesurfing, and surfing. In July 2009, New Smyrna Beach was ranked number nine on the list of \\"best surf towns\\" in Surfer. It was recognized as \\"one of the world's top 20 surf towns\\" by National Geographic. in 2012. It has also been dubbed \\"The Shark Bite Capital of the World.\\" History Andrew Turnbull The area was first settled by Europeans in 1768, when Scottish physician Dr. Andrew Turnbull, a friend of James Grant, the governor of British East Florida, established the colony of New Smyrna. Dr. Turnbull had married the daughter of a merchant from the Greek city of Smyrna (modern-day İzmir in Turkey) and named the settlement in honor of his wife's birthplace and the homeland of those in his future labor force who were Greek. No one had previously attempted to settle so many people at one time in a town in North America. Turnbull recruited about 1,300 settlers, intending for them to grow hemp, sugarcane, and indigo, as well as to produce rum, at his plantation on the northeastern Atlantic coast of Florida. The majority of the colonists came from Menorca (historically called \\"Minorca\\" in English), one of the Mediterranean Balearic Islands of Spain, and were of Catalan culture and language. Around 500 or so came from Greece. Although the colony produced relatively large amounts of processed indigo in its first few years of operation, it eventually collapsed after suffering major losses due to insect- borne diseases and Indian raids, and growing tensions caused by mistreatment of the colonists on the part of Turnbull and his overseers. The survivors, about 600 in number, marched nearly 70 miles north on the King's Road and relocated to St. Augustine, where their descendants live to this day. In 1783, East and West Florida were returned to the Spanish, and Turnbull abandoned his colony to retire in Charleston, South Carolina.Landers 2000, p. 62Roger Grange, \\"Saving Eighteenth-Century New Smyrna: Public Archaeology in Action.\\" Present Pasts vol 3 #1 (2011). online The St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine on St. George Street in St. Augustine honors the Greeks among the settlers of New Smyrna; they were the first Greek Orthodox followers in North America. The historical exhibit adjoining the chapel tells the story of their plight, with accompanying exhibits, and of their contributions to the city. Central Florida remained sparsely populated by white settlers well into the 19th century, and it was frequently raided by Seminole Indians trying to protect their territory. United States troops fought against them in the Seminole Wars, but they were never completely dislodged. During the Civil War in the 1860s, the \\"Stone Wharf\\" of New Smyrna was shelled by Union gunboats. In 1887, when New Smyrna was incorporated, it had a population of 150. In 1892, Henry Flagler provided service to the town via his Florida East Coast Railway. This led to a rapid increase in the area's population. Its economy grew as tourism was added to its citrus and commercial fishing industries. During Prohibition in the 1920s, the city and its river islands were popular sites for moonshine stills and hideouts for rum runners, who came from the Bahamas through Mosquito Inlet, now Ponce de León Inlet. \\"New Smyrna\\" became \\"New Smyrna Beach\\" in 1947, when the city annexed the seaside community of Coronado Beach. Today, it is a resort town of over 20,000 permanent residents. Like St. Augustine, established by the Spanish, New Smyrna has been under the rule of four \\"flags\\": the British, Spanish, United States (from 1821, with ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty), and the Confederate Jack. After the end of the Civil War in 1865, it returned with Florida to the United States. See also: New Smyrna Beach Historic District Geography New Smyrna Beach's motto is cygnus inter anates, which is Latin for \\"a swan among ducks.\\" The city is located in the so-called \\"Fun Coast\\" region of the state of Florida, a regional term created by the Daytona Beach/Halifax area Chamber of Commerce. This coincides with the local area code, 386, which spells FUN on touchtone phones. According to the United States Census Bureau, it has a total area of ; of it are land, and of it (8.46%) is covered by water. It is bordered by the city of Port Orange to the northwest, unincorporated Volusia County to the north, the census-designated place of Samsula-Spruce Creek to the west, and the cities of Edgewater and Bethune Beach and the Canaveral National Seashore to the south. Bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, New Smyrna Beach is on the Indian River. The city is connected to other parts of the state by Interstate 95, U.S. Route 1, and State Road 44. Climate New Smyrna Beach Like the rest of Florida north of Lake Okeechobee, New Smyrna Beach has a humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa) climate characterized by hot, humid summers and mild, mostly dry winters. The rainy season lasts from May until October, and the dry season, from November to April. New Smyrna averages only about four frosts per year, and many species of subtropical plants and palms are grown in the area. The city has recorded snowfall only three times in its 250-year history. The summers are long and hot, with frequent severe thunderstorms in the afternoon, as central Florida is the lightning capital of North America. Winters are pleasant with frequent sunny skies and dry weather. Weather hazards include hurricanes from June until November, though direct hits are rare. Hurricane Charley exited over New Smyrna Beach on August 13, 2004, after crossing the state in a northeastern direction from its initial landfall in Punta Gorda. The storm caused extensive damage to the beachside portion of the city and toppled many historic oak trees in the downtown area and along historic Flagler Avenue.

Experts from the university have referred to the county as having the \\"dubious distinction as the world's shark-bite capital\\". The trend continued in 2008, when the town broke its own record, with 24 shark bites. An Orlando Sentinel photographer shot a picture of a four-foot spinner shark jumping over a surfer, a reversal of \\"jumping the shark\\".

The population was 1,792 at the 2010 census. History The first inhabitants of what would become Oak Hill were the Timucuan Indians, who lived along the shore from circa 2000 BC to 1500 AD, when European settlers started to arrive. In 1564, the French illustrator, Jacques LeMoyne, made a map showing an Indian village named Surruque el Viejo near el Baradero de Suroc. The name \\"Oak Hill\\" seems to have been first used by seasonal northern loggers circa 1850. Florida became a state in 1845, and British and American permanent settlers started to arrive. They began to displace the various tribes, including the Seminoles, who fought back. One Seminole War raid in 1856 resulted in four deaths. A resident, Arad Shelton, took their bodies north to New Smyrna Beach by wagon. By the Civil War, Oak Hill had a salt works, some part-time stores, and the first orange groves had been planted (by a Mr. Mitchell). Oak Hill also has Civil War veterans buried in the local cemetery: five who fought for the Union, and six who fought for the Confederacy. Hotels, stores, a post office, and a school operated by Rev. Wicks in the Congregational church served a few white students in the morning and several black students in the afternoon. A public school for white students was constructed in the early 1890s, and a prominent black freedman, Bill Williams, provided instruction and space for black students in 1901. A public school for black students was constructed in 1927. In 1924, a grade 1 through 10 school was built on Ridge Road, just to the east of Dixie Highway (now US-1), which was paved the same year. This building was replaced in 1960 by a new structure, which eventually became the W.F. Burns Elementary School. In 2008, the county school board closed the school (citing budget cuts) and slated it for demolition. County work crews stripped the facility of anything of value. The non-profit Oak Hill Community Trust, with the assistance and guidance of local architect Sid Corhern, Tom Gibbs, and many, many other concerned citizens purchased the property from the county school board in late 2009. A charter school operator was contacted and after voluminous paperwork, was approved in January 2011. Beginning in September 2010, hundreds of volunteers gave thousands of hours of their time to refurbish the buildings. They did plumbing, electrical, painting, landscaping and much more, often with donated materials. The school opened in August 2011, with 260 students enrolled. In 2012, Kennedy Space Center donated a surplus 10,000 square foot office building to the school, on condition that it had to be moved from KSC without delay. Again, volunteers stepped forward and the building was delivered (in eight sections) to the site, reassembled, refurbished as classrooms, and is now in use. The school is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) school, and after only two years of operation, has already achieved a \\"B\\" rating. As of 2014, there are 385 students in grades K through 8, many are local, and some come from as far away as Ormond Beach and Orange City. In the past, citrus growing and commercial fishing were the primary income sources for residents of Oak Hill. A series of hard freezes, cold snaps and the advent of citrus canker have greatly reduced the number of citrus groves, and by 1995 the State of Florida's Gill Net Ban eliminated most of the fishing business. There are several fish, clam and oyster farms in operation. There is a significant amount of recreational fishing and eco-tourism, and Oak Hill is one terminus for the Florida \\"River of Lakes\\" scenic highway. Several regional bicycle paths traverse Oak Hill, and seeing groups of dozens of recreational touring cyclists is quite common. East of the town's center, on the edge of Mosquito Lagoon is Seminole Rest National Historic Site, part of Canaveral National Seashore. Oak Hill has been designated as an \\"Enterprise Zone\\" by the State of Florida. There are various tax rebates and incentives available to new businesses locating here and for the expansion of exiting businesses. City government is \\"business friendly\\" with a very low paperwork burden for businesses and minimal license fees. Additionally, business owners over the age of 65 get or renew their city licenses for free. The City of Oak Hill was first chartered in 1927. Local government was based on a Mayor-Commission, with each commissioner functioning as head of a municipal department. The city was disbanded in 1930. The country was in a depression, and the city petitioned the government to inactivate the charter, which was granted. The city later petitioned the government in 1962 to reactivate the charter. Clarence Goodrich was the city's mayor from 1963 to 1989, the longest term any mayor has held in the state of Florida. Bobby Greatrex was mayor from 1989 to 1990, and Bruce Burch served from 1990 to 1994. Toreatha Wood became the city's first female mayor, as well as first African-American female mayor, serving from 1999 to 2000. Darry Evans was the first African American male mayor. Lorna Travis was mayor from 2000 to 2001, Susan Cook was mayor from 2001 to 2002, and Bob Jackson was mayor in 2002. Mayor Darla Lauer resigned for personal reasons, and was replaced by Mary Lee Cook. The current mayor is Douglas Gibson, who was elected in November 2012. On the evening of August 1, 2011, the city commission voted to disband the city's police department due to ongoing acrimony, personality conflicts and policy disagreements between the city commissioners and the police department. All nine employees will received unemployment benefits. The Volusia County Sheriff's Department assumed law enforcement duties for the city.

The population was 38,137 at the 2010 census. Ormond Beach is the northern neighbor of Daytona Beach and is home to Tomoka State Park. It is a principal city of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Village Street c. 1908 Ormond Beach was once within the domain of the Timucuan Indians. Ormond Beach was frequented by Timacuan Indians, but never truly inhabited until 1643 when Quakers blown off course to the New England area ran ashore. They settled in a small encampment along the Atlantic shore. Early relations with neighboring tribes were fruitful, however, in 1704 a local Timacuan chief, Oseanoha, led a raid of the encampment killing most of the population. In 1708 Spaniards inhabited the area and laid claim until British control began. The city is named for James Ormond I, an Anglo-Irish-Scottish sea captain commissioned by King Ferdinand VII of Spain to bring Franciscan settlers to this part of Florida. Ormond had served Britain and Spain in the Napoleonic Wars as a ship captain, and was rewarded for his services to Spain by King Ferdinand VII. Ormond later worked for the Scottish Indian trade company of Panton, Leslie & Company, and his armed brig was called the Somerset. After returning to Spanish control, in 1821, Florida was acquired from Spain by the United States, but hostilities during the Second Seminole War delayed settlement until after 1842. In 1875, the city was founded as New Britain by inhabitants from New Britain, Connecticut, but would be incorporated in 1880 as Ormond for its early plantation owner. With its hard, white beach, Ormond became popular for the wealthy seeking relief from northern winters during the Floridian boom in tourism following the Civil War. The St. Johns & Halifax Railroad arrived in 1886, and the first bridge across the Halifax River was built in 1887. John Anderson and James Downing Price opened the Ormond Hotel on January 1, 1888. Henry Flagler bought the hotel in 1890 and expanded it to accommodate 600 guests. It would be one in a series of Gilded Age hotels catering to passengers aboard his Florida East Coast Railway, which had purchased the St. Johns & Halifax Railroad. Once a well-known landmark which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, the hotel was razed in 1992. On December 5, 1896, the Nathan F. Cobb, a wooden schooner built in 1890, ran aground on a sandbar off Ormond.https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?201164 One of Flagler's guests at the Ormond Hotel was his former business partner at the Standard Oil Company, John D. Rockefeller. He arrived in 1914 and after four seasons at the hotel bought an estate called The Casements, that would be Rockefeller's winter home during the latter part of his life. Sold by his heirs in 1939, it was purchased by the city in 1973 and now serves as a cultural center. It is the community's best-known historical structure. Beginning in 1902, some of the first automobile races were held on the compacted sand from Ormond south to Daytona Beach. Pioneers in the industry, including Ransom Olds and Alexander Winton, tested their inventions. The American Automobile Association brought timing equipment in 1903 and the area acquired the nickname \\"The Birthplace of Speed.\\"http://www.birthplaceofspeed2003.com/beginning.htm birthplaceofspeed2003.com In 1907 Glenn Curtiss set an unofficial world record of 136.36 miles per hour (219.45 km/h), on a 40-horsepower (30 kW) 269 cu in (4,410 cc) Curtiss V-8 motorcycle.

History & Local Landmarks The earliest known inhabitants of the Ormond-by-the-Sea area were the Timucuan Indians, who in the sixteenth century occupied a large village called Nocoroco, located at the site of Tomoka State Park. The Timucuan diet relied heavily on oysters and other shellfish, and their shell middens, or trash heaps, may still be found near the Halifax River in Ormond-by-the-Sea. Among the first Anglo settlers of the area was Chauncey A. Bacon, an architect and Civil War veteran from New Britain, Connecticut, who in 1876 purchased in present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea and named it the Number Nine Plantation. In her book Ormond-On-The-Halifax, Alice Strickland describes the site: \\"The land was covered with a dense, tangled forest of palmettos, scrub oaks, and pine trees which Bacon cleared out with axe and grub hoe. The Bacon's first home was a palmetto cabin, but later Bacon built a small, two story house with a large coquina rock fireplace on top of the Indian shell mound.\\" The Bacons later constructed a larger home, which still stands on John Anderson Drive, from salvaged mahogany logs that washed ashore from the City of Vera Cruz shipwreck. The property was also planted with a large fruit grove featuring oranges, grapefruit, lemons, loquats and guavas, among others. By the turn of the century, the Bacons had a thriving home business selling brandied figs and their best-selling \\"Number 9 Guava Jelly.\\" In 1909, the Bacons sold Number Nine Plantation to M.C. Hillery who operated it for a few years and then sold it in 1911 to a company that had been organized by Ferdinand Nordman, Jr. Nordman constructed a \\"jelly house\\" and enlarged the fruit business, selling fruit preserves via mail order to customers across the country, including New York Governor, Nelson Rockefeller. The business survived until 1968, and the jelly house was demolished to make way for a subdivision in 1984.\\"Landmark Makes Way for Housing Tract\\" Daytona Beach News Journal July 8, 1984. Another early settler was Leonard B. Knox, who developed a citrus plantation known as Mound Grove, located along High Bridge Road near its crossing with Bulow Creek. It was Knox's son Donald who planted the Canary Island date palms which currently line the road. Part of the property also included a waterside building that operated as Uncle Guy's Fish Camp between the 1930s and 1950s. The property was subsequently acquired by Dick Cobb, who operated a bar and restaurant out of the building, which became known as \\"Cobb's Corner.\\" The business closed in the 1970s, although portions of the structure remain.\\"Cobb's Corner\\" Daytona Beach News Journal September 8, 1976. Despite these early settlements, nearly all of present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea remained undeveloped until the 1950s, when the area began to develop in earnest as a retirement community. The \\"by the sea\\" appellation was used to distinguish the area from the adjacent city of Ormond Beach, located immediately to the south. Though unincorporated, it was first represented by the North Peninsula Zoning Commission, created in 1955.\\"Four Candidates Tell Whey They're Running for Commission Posts\\" Daytona Beach News Journal July 28, 1955. For many years, one of Ormond-by-the-Sea's most distinguishing landmarks was the Ormond Pier, a steel structure constructed in 1959 near the intersection of Laurie Drive and A1A.\\"Ormond Pier Construction on Schedule\\" Daytona Beach News Journal June 3, 1959. A large section of the Ormond Pier was torn away by a storm in November 1984, and the remaining portions subsequently demolished for safety reasons in the early 1990s.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os- xpm-1990-11-18-9011161092-story.html Approximately one mile north on A1A, near the intersection of A1A and Spanish Waters Drive, stands a watch tower constructed in 1942 by the Coast Guard Reserve to look out for German U-boats operating off the coast.\\"Lonely Sentry on the North Peninsula\\" Daytona Beach News Journal October 1, 1975. The tower was restored in 2004 and is one of the last remaining examples of a World War II era observation tower on the Florida coast. At the northern end of Ormond-by-the-Sea is the North Peninsula State Park, comprising approximately of undeveloped coastal dunes and marsh lands, which were acquired in the mid-1980s through the Conservation & Recreation Lands Program,\\"Port Panel Takes Role for Acquiring N. Peninsula Tract\\" Daytona Beach News Journal August 25, 1982. later known as the \\"Preservation 2000\\" and \\"Florida Forever\\" programs. Among other species, the park provides crucial habitat for the Florida scrub jay, a threatened federal species of which less than 4,000 breeding pairs are thought to survive. Ecology Though most of Ormond-by-the-Sea is little more than a half-mile wide, it supports no fewer than six distinct ecological zones. The beach, or tidal zone, features distinctive reddish-colored sand created by crushed coquina shells. Here may be found sand fleas and ghost crabs, as well as a variety of coastal birds including plovers, stilts, avocets, terns, and gulls. Just above the tide line, several species of sea turtles are known to lay their eggs, including the leatherback, Atlantic loggerhead, and green turtle. Immediately inland is the Temperate Beach Dune, a \\"pioneer zone\\" of vegetation growing along the primary dunes. Species of note include sea oats, beach morning glory, and beach sunflower. Slightly inland from the primary dunes is the Coastal Strand, a shrubby area dominated by saw palmetto, Spanish bayonet, prickly pear cactus, and greenbrier vines. The Coastal Strand frequently overlaps with nearby sand ridges featuring Florida scrub plant communities, including scrub live oaks, slash pine, and Florida's state tree, the sabal palm (often called a \\"cabbage palm\\"). Species of note include the Florida scrub jay and the endangered gopher tortoise. Close to the Halifax River, the soil is more moist and supports Maritime Hammock species, including live oaks, magnolias, American holly, red cedars and coontie ferns. In many areas, Brazilian pepper trees, an invasive exotic species, may also be seen growing. The river's edge features many plants associated with tidal marshes, including salt marsh cordgrass, needle rush and mangroves. Oysters and blue crabs are common in the shallow waters, as are a variety of wading birds including egrets and herons.

The population was 12,252 at the 2010 census. History South Daytona was once a town called Blake (named after wealthy Boston businessman Alpheus P. Blake), with some forty resident families and as many more non-resident property holders. Many of the early settlers profitably engaged in orange culture and vegetable gardening. According to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., Blake opened its first post office on August 19, 1878. Circa 1886, the first train came as far as Daytona, and ten years later the line was extended to Miami. Soon thereafter, a railroad station was built at Big Tree Crossing. By 1926, the towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach and Seabreeze were consolidated to create the city of Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach then proceeded to annex all the adjacent territories, including the town of Blake. Because of new taxes and appraisals levied, residents of Blake were forced to hire an attorney and eventually, circa 1938, succeeded in breaking away from Daytona Beach to become the incorporated town of South Daytona. Soon after World War II, the town created a Building Department, followed by a Planning and Zoning Board. Builders and developers soon became interested in the area, and South Daytona started to develop. South Daytona was then in a position to request financial assistance from the federal government for expansion of utilities, streets, etc. South Daytona was the second town in the Halifax area, after Daytona Beach, to install a sanitary sewer system. The town continued to prosper and was incorporated as the City of South Daytona in 1951.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km.), all land. History The town's name is a corruption of \\"Lockchoppe\\", derived from the Muskogee lokchapi (lokcha (acorn) / api (stem)), which was the old name of the nearby river. Sopchoppy came into existence in 1894 after the CT&G; Railroad Company built a railway through the area. It platted the town on property it already owned in the area, across the river from Greenough. To encourage people to settle the area, the railroad engaged in an advertising campaign, exaggerating the quality of the soil and climate. The Sopchoppy Depot was built in 1891. Now a museum, it was built for the Carrabelle, Tallahassee & Georgia Railroad (G. F. & A.), and referred to colloquially as the Gopher, Frog & Alligator, Company, which was absorbed by the Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railroad. The line began in 1893 and closed in 1946. It transported lumber, turpentine and related products, honey, farm produce, soldiers, fish and oysters packed in barrels in ice as well as sturgeon caviar from the Sopchoppy River, frog legs, and catfish.http://www.visitwakulla.com/Things-to-Do/Historic-Sopchoppy-Train- Depot Festivals The town is home to the annual Worm Grunting Festival, a town celebration named in honor of a worm grunting — also known as worm charming — a method for driving worms to the surface of the earth. Worm charmers hammer wooden stakes into the ground, then rub them with metal slabs. The resulting vibrations cause worms to surface, whereupon they are typically gathered and used or sold for fishing bait. Part of Tim Dorsey's 2017 novel Clownfish Blues is set in Sopchoppy and worm grunting is a plot element.

On July 10, 2005, the storm surge associated with Hurricane Dennis severely flooded the town, causing major damage to local businesses and homes. History Posey's Bar, in 2010 before it was torn down Originally known as San Marcos de Apalache and centered on a Spanish fort, this town was founded by the Spanish in the 17th century in what was then Spanish Florida. There was a trading post in the late 18th century. A long time has passed since St. Marks last had appreciable importance, but this place on Apalachee Bay in Florida's Big Bend is a very old and historic Gulf port. Fortifications built here by the Spanish in the 17th century, and rebuilt several times, provided the venue for force of arms repeatedly up through the American Civil War. In the best-known incident, Andrew Jackson, in his cavalier incursion into Spanish Florida in 1818, executed British nationals Robert Chrystie Ambrister and Alexander George Arbuthnot at the old fort, as well as Native American leader Francis the Prophet. This nearly embroiled the United States in international strife. San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park interprets the site of the old fort. Today's St. Marks evidently has its roots in American commercial activity that took hold beneath the walls of the fort upon acquisition of Spanish Florida by the U.S. in 1821—before the settlement moved slightly up the St. Marks River to the present position. Various articles in publications like Florida Historical Quarterly relate how the fort site later held a government \\"naval\\" hospital to meet yellow fever emergencies in the merchant marine. And just afterward Confederate batteries were established on the site in the Civil War. Their earthworks remain and are interpreted in the historic state park. But the site also exhibits old Spanish stonework, and not far away (though inaccessible), just down St. Marks River are shallow Spanish quarries where this limestone was evidently obtained in the 1730s. There are brief accounts of a stone tower the Spanish built (now long gone) close by the quarries. The tower apparently would have afforded a sea view. Some scholars have asserted that if the Spanish on any occasion placed torches in this tower, the structure would have been thus functioning as the first lighthouse in the New World. In any case, limestone quarried here by the Spanish did eventually help to make a lighthouse here—the St. Marks Light, constructed about 1830 by the U.S. government. The lighthouse stands, after a couple of reconstructions, at the mouth of the river six miles from town and accessible by road. The lighthouse is, like San Marcos de Apalache, on the National Register of Historic Places. > St. Marks was a seaport for all of Middle Florida and lower Georgia during > this early period. Ellen Call Long, on her way to Tallahassee, described the > port about 1830 as \\"a quaint little village, amphibious-like, consisting of > a few dwelling houses, stores, etc., mostly built on stilts or piles, as if > ready to launch when wind or tide prevailed.\\" A railroad often cited as Florida's first connected the port of St. Marks with the territorial capital, Tallahassee, some 20 miles inland. The line, the Tallahassee Railroad, was constructed about 1836, and until the Civil War it served in the export of Middle Florida's cotton through St. Marks. The capacity of the St. Marks port was limited, and it was surpassed in the 19th century by the larger port of Apalachicola, served by the Thomasville, Tallahassee and Gulf Railroad via Carrabelle, Florida. Today the attraction of St. Marks for boaters, fishermen, and seafood lovers preserves a strong relationship with Tallahassee (as does the location of a generating plant for Tallahassee here). The now-abandoned rail line serves as the popular Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail—a paved bicycle and equestrian trail terminating at the St. Marks waterfront. This section of the coast was damaged by the big storm surge of Hurricane Dennis in 2005. As on other occasions in its history, St. Marks was flooded badly with saltwater. A principal casualty this time was the landmark Posey's Oyster Bar --\\"Home of the Topless Oyster.\\" Attracting people from Tallahassee and elsewhere ever since the 1920s, this quaint establishment overhanging the river (so as to be able to serve alcohol when Wakulla County was \\"dry\\") was one of the oldest businesses in Wakulla County. It enjoyed a measure of regional fame. Irreparably damaged, Posey's now belongs, with Ambrister and Arbuthnot and the Spanish, to the long history of St. Marks.

History L&N; railroad depot, now the Walton County Heritage Museum The town was founded during the late 19th century as a resort development by the officers of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad, a subsidiary of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The P&A; was organized to connect the terminus of the L&N; at Pensacola to the western terminus of a predecessor of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad at River Junction—now Chattahoochee—in the 1880s. The town was named after Frederick R. De Funiak, a vice-president of the L&N.; Like much of Northwest Florida, DeFuniak Springs was settled mainly by Scots from Virginia and the Carolinas. DeFuniak Springs was established as a final-destination resort. The developers enlisted the cooperation and aid of the Chautauqua Movement. The Chautauqua Hall of Brotherhood, an auditorium seating 4,000, was constructed on Lake DeFuniak in the center of town. Seminars, classes, and the like were held in the Hall of Brotherhood building for people on vacation. The auditorium of the building was severely damaged by Hurricane Eloise in 1975 and razed. In 2003, the Chautauqua Hall of Brotherhood Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation, started a capital campaign to restore the historic building. The westerly portion of the building facing Circle Drive was still in use at that time. As part of the intellectual atmosphere of the town, a college and a private high school (named Palmer College and Palmer Academy, respectively), as well as a technical school (Thomas Industrial Institute) and a teacher training school (Florida Normal College) were established in the late 19th century. Florida Normal College was later incorporated into Florida State University. The other schools closed during the Great Depression, which created financial strains. There remains a College Avenue that once led to Palmer College. In 1886, the town held an important meeting that changed the course of public education in Florida. At this meeting, teachers from around the state formed the Florida Education Association. This teachers' union remains the state's predominant voice for educators and is affiliated with the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. The town contains other historically significant landmarks. The Walton County Library is located on Circle Drive, the oldest extant library in the state of Florida.Blazek, R.

For DeFuniak Springs, this movement did not only include the Chautauqua center, McCormick University and Academy, and the State Normal School, but also a community library. In 1887, a group of women formed the Ladies Library Association and their goal was to establish a library that would become the “little sister” to the Chautauqua center, university, and school . The Ladies Library Association chose a plot of land adjacent to the Chautauqua center and signed a lease for ninety-nine years . By the end of 1887, five years after the initial plan of the village, there was a community library. The Ladies Library Association’s main goal of establishing a social library was complete. Initially, the library relied on book donations, but also purchased books from the Ladies Reading Club and a private book owner, J. L. Shearer . The Ladies Library Association persisted and was able to maintain the library, books, and maintenance of the library for quite some time. However, by 1923, the Ladies Library Association was unable to continue to sustain the library and requested city funds, which the city took on gradually. It was not until the 1960s when the subscription fees were finally eliminated and the county and city assumed total responsibility for its maintenance and collection development . Today, the Walton-DeFuniak Library remains in use just as it did when it opened in 1887.

The population was 687 at the 2010 census; according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2018 estimates, the city had a population of 690. The geographical center of Washington County, Florida, Vernon is named for George Washington's Virginia home, Mt. Vernon. The pioneer town was the site of a major Indian settlement. Vernon held the county seat until 1927 when the seat was moved to Chipley. The move was approved by a margin of one vote. Vernon became known as \\"nub city\\" in the 1950s and 1960s for a high number of limb loss insurance claims made in the area. Vernon was featured in the Errol Morris documentary film Vernon, Florida (produced in 1981) highlighting the eccentricities of the people who lived there. The movie angered many residents of the city and surrounding areas who felt the documentary portrayed Vernon in a negative light. Morris had originally intended to document on the \\"Nub City\\" aspect of the town, but re-focused his subject after claiming to receive death threats from residents. The area's history is exhibited at the Vernon Historical Society Museum in Vernon City Hall. History Vernon Family Health Center The city sits on the Holmes Creek where during the 1880s the creek was used as a shipping route to Bonifay and other nearby towns. The creek was also used to ship gopher tortoises due to the high value their shell carried at that time. The town gained infamy in the late 1950s and early 1960s due to the improbably high percentage of residents who put out insurance claims on lost limbs, to the point that many speculated that residents of the town were intentionally dismembering themselves for the insurance money. Although there is no real evidence to support these speculations, these insurance claims from Vernon, with a population of 500–800, accounted for as many as 2/3 of claims nationally.

Much of the original city is contained within the boundaries of the Milledgeville Historic District, which was also added to the NRHP.  History  Milledgeville, named after Georgia governor John Milledge (in office 1802–1806), was founded by European Americans at the start of the 19th century as the new centrally located capital of the state of Georgia. It served as the state capital from 1804 to 1868. In 1803 an act of the Georgia legislature called for the establishment and survey of a town to be named in honor of the current governor, John Milledge. The Treaty of Fort Wilkinson (1802) had recently forced Native American tribes to cede territory immediately west of the Oconee River. The white population of Georgia continued to press west and south in search of new farmland. The town of Milledgeville was developed in an area that had long been occupied by indigenous peoples. In December 1804 the state legislature declared Milledgeville the new capital of Georgia. The new planned town, modeled after Savannah and Washington, D.C., stood on the edge of the frontier at the Atlantic fall line, where the Upper Coastal Plain meets the foothills and plateau of the Piedmont. The area was surveyed, and a town plat of was divided into 84 squares. The survey also included four public squares of each. = Life in the antebellum capital = Georgia's second capitol building, built 1807-1837 (1937 photo, HABS) After 1815 Milledgeville became increasingly prosperous and more respectable. Wealth and power gravitated toward the capital. Much of the surrounding countryside was developed by slave labor for cotton plantations, which was the major commodity crop of the South. Cotton bales regularly were set up to line the roads, waiting to be shipped downriver to Darien. Public-spirited citizens such as Tomlinson Fort (mayor of Milledgeville, 1847–1848) promoted better newspapers, learning academies, and banks. In 1837-1842 the Georgia Lunatic Asylum (later the Central State Hospital) was built here. Oglethorpe University, where the poet Sidney Lanier was later educated, opened its doors in 1838. (The college, forced to close in 1862 during the war, was rechartered in 1913. It moved its campus to Atlanta.) The cotton boom in this upland area significantly increased the demand for slave labor. The town market, where slave auctions took place, was located on Capital Square, next to the Presbyterian church. Skilled black carpenters, masons, and laborers were forced to construct most of the handsome antebellum structures in Milledgeville. Two events epitomized Milledgeville's status as the political and social center of Georgia in this period: * In 1825 the capital was visited by American Revolutionary War hero and aristocrat, the Marquis de Lafayette. The receptions, barbecue, formal dinner, and grand ball for the veteran apostle of liberty seemed to mark Milledgeville's coming of age. *The Governor's Mansion was constructed (1836-38/39); it was one of the most important examples of Greek revival architecture in America. By 1854 Baldwin County had a total population of 8148, of whom 3566 were free (mostly white), and 4602 were African-American slaves. = American Civil War and its aftermath = Burning of the penitentiary at Milledgeville (November 23, 1864) On January 19, 1861, Georgia convention delegates passed the Ordinance of Secession, and on February 4, 1861, the \\"Republic of Georgia\\" joined the Confederate States of America. In the closing months of the war, in November 1864 Union general William T. Sherman and 30,000 Union troops marched into Milledgeville during his March to the Sea. Before leaving a couple of days later, they had poured sorghum and molasses down the pipes of the organ at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. In 1868, during Reconstruction, the state legislature moved the capital to Atlanta—a city emerging as the symbol of the New South as surely as Milledgeville symbolized the Old South. Milledgeville struggled to survive as a city after losing the business of the capital. The energetic efforts of local leaders established the Middle Georgia Military and Agricultural College (later Georgia Military College) in 1879 on Statehouse Square. Where the crumbling remains of the old penitentiary stood, Georgia Normal and Industrial College (later Georgia College & State University) was founded in 1889. In part because of these institutions, as well as Central State Hospital, Milledgeville developed as a less provincial town than many of its neighbors. = Twentieth century to present = In the 1950s the Georgia Power Company completed a dam at Furman Shoals on the Oconee River, about north of town, creating a huge reservoir called Lake Sinclair. The lake community became an increasingly important part of the town's social and economic identity. In the 1980s and 1990s Milledgeville began to capitalize on its heritage by revitalizing the downtown and historic district. It encouraged restoration of historic buildings and an urban design scheme on Main Street to emphasize its character. By 2000 the population of Milledgeville and Baldwin County combined had grown to 44,700. Community leaders have made concerted efforts to create a more diversified economic base, striving to wean the old capital from its dependence on government institutions such as Central State Hospital and state prisons. The state has recently closed some prisons and reduced jobs at Central State, due to tightening state budgets.  Geography  Milledgeville is located at (33.087755, -83.233401) and is above sea level.

Lake Sinclair, a man-made lake, is about northeast of Milledgeville on the border of Baldwin, Putnam and Hancock counties. Milledgeville is composed of two main districts: a heavily commercialized area along the highway known to locals simply as \\"441,\\" extending from a few blocks north of Georgia College & State University to north of Milledgeville, and the \\"Downtown\\" area, encompassing the college, buildings housing city government agencies, various bars and restaurants.

U.S. Route 41 passes through the city, leading north to Calhoun and south to Cartersville. Interstate 75 runs through the eastern part of the city, with access from Exit 306 (State Route 140). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. = Climate = Adairsville's climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, it has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.  History  Adairsville used to be a small Cherokee village named after Chief Walter (John) S. Adair, a Scottish settler who married a Cherokee Indian woman before the removal of the Cherokee in 1838. It was part of the Cherokee territory along with Calhoun and including New Echota. After the removal of the Cherokees, the village became part of Georgia, and the residents kept the name Adairsville. One of the town's developers was William Watts, who had a railroad business interest in the town. He had brought the Western and Atlantic Railroad from Atlanta (still in use). He deeded land to the railroad and surveyed business lots including hotels, mills, and blacksmith shops around town. Watts's plan was successful and brought the town the nickname \\"Granary of the State\\"; it was incorporated in 1854. He lived in Adairsville in a home built on the foundation of an Indian cabin, on a hill overlooking the town. During the Civil War, Adairsville was involved on the side of the Confederate States of America in 1861 against the Union. On April 12, 1862, the steam locomotive The General was pursued from Atlanta and passed through Adairsville as its people the Great Locomotive Chase. After that, Adairians set a three-day street festival in remembrance of the Chase. The Civil War came to the town in full force on May 17, 1864, when the Confederate army failed to defeat Sherman and his Union army during the Atlanta Campaign in the Battle of Adairsville. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Adairsville rebuilt and became a center of the carpet and textile industries, and of farm and transportation services, including its famous railroad. Historic buildings still intact in the town include the original train depot, which was involved in the Great Locomotive Chase. Adairsville is well known for Barnsley Gardens. Now a golf resort, Barnsley Gardens is southwest of the city center. The home was built by Sir Godfrey Barnsley of Derbyshire, England, in the late 1840s for his wife, Julia. She died before the house could be completed, but it is said that her ghost appeared to Sir Godfrey, telling him to complete the work. It was brought about by the visions of Andrew Jackson Downing, the architect who designed the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and White House. The ruins of the great main house remain. Almost lost to time and the elements, the land, including all of the ruins, was bought in 1988 by Prince Hubertus Fugger, who restored the gardens and renovated the grounds into an upscale golf resort.

The population was 637 at the 2010 census. Geography Kingston is located in west-central Bartow County at (34.235749, -84.944648). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Georgia State Route 293 (Kingston Highway) passes through the center of town, leading southeast to Cartersville and west to Rome. U.S. Route 411 is a four-lane highway that passes south of Kingston, connecting the same two larger communities. History Native American tribes once inhabited the area. People of the Mississippian culture were in the vicinity until about 1500 AD. Cherokee removal occurred locally by 1838. White settlers were moved in as early as 1832, after a land lottery. The city was named for John Pendleton King, a United States Senator from Georgia. On April 12, 1862, James J. Andrews with 18 Union soldiers in disguise, and 1 civilian, having seized the locomotive The General at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw) intending to wreck the Western and Atlantic Railroad, were forced to side-track here and wait for the southbound freights to pass.

The patients were moved to Atlanta in May 1864 to avoid capture by the Union, who later used the hospitals. The dead are buried in unmarked graves nearby.marker db m13980marker 008-40 =Atlanta Campaign= Union general William T. Sherman made his headquarters in the Hargis House May 16–19, for reorganization of forces in the campaign that would end at Atlanta. Assuming Johnston's army had moved, from Adairsville, directly on Kingston and the river crossings south, May 18, led Sherman to concentrate his forces here—only to discover that Johnston had gone directly to Cassville where, without making a stand, he continued to Allatoona on May 20. Sherman countered on May 23, by moving due south.Marker db m13965 On May 18, 1864, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's corps marched from Adairsville on the road parallel to the Western and Atlantic Railroad en route to Cass Station. He turned east on this road to join General Polk's and Hood's Confederate corps at Cassville which had moved on the direct Adairsville - Cassville Road. Sherman erred when he assumed that all of Johnston's army had marched from Adairsville, as Hardee had, to Kingston. This resulted in his ordering his forces concentrated here—discovering later that the Confederates were east at Cassville and not at the Etowah River south of Kingston.Marker db m13962 On May 19 Union generals Daniel Butterfield and Joseph Hooker, the new XX Corps, were headquartered at the house of Confederate Colonel Hawkins F. Price, a state senator who had voted for Georgia secession in 1861. Hooker had been ordered from Adairsville to Kingston, on false reports that Johnston had retreated there. South of the Price house Hooker discovered that Johnston had gone to Cassville.Marker db m13497 On May 19, 1864, the IV Corps, followed by the XIV Corps, reached Kingston at 8 a.m. The IVth turned east to Cassville. A division of the XIVth sent to Gillem's bridge over the Etowah River found no retreating Confederates. Johnston's forces were at Cassville, east.

This was the route of Union Major General James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee (XVth and XVIth Corps), the right wing of forces under Sherman moving from Kingston to the Dallas front, May 23 and 24.

The first Decoration Day was observed while Union troops still occupied the town, flowers being placed on both Confederate and Union graves that day.Marker db m13976 In 2014, Bellware and Gardiner dismissed this claim in The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America. They point out that the timing of the observance and locations of General Judah and Wofford during April 1865 make the claim untenable. On May 12, 1865, Confederate Brigadier General William T. Wofford surrendered 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers to Union Brigadier General Henry M. Judah. These were the last significant Confederate regulars to surrender east of the Mississippi. These were mostly Georgians, not paroled in Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere. During final negotiations, Gen. Wofford's headquarters were at the McCravey - Johnson residence on Church Street.

As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 9,053. It is the principal city of the Fitzgerald Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Ben Hill and Irwin counties. History Fitzgerald was developed in 1895 by Philander H. Fitzgerald, an Indianapolis newspaper editor. A former drummer boy in the Union Army during the Civil War, he founded it as a community for war veterans – both from the Union and from the Confederacy. The majority of the first citizens (some 2700) were Union veterans. It was incorporated on December 2, 1896. The town is located less than from the site where Confederate president Jefferson Davis was captured on May 10, 1865. Fitzgerald was an early planned city. It was laid out as a square, with intersecting streets dividing it into four wards. Each of the wards was divided into four blocks and each block had sixteen squares. The first two streets running north–south on the west side of the city were named after Confederate generals Lee and Johnston, whereas the first two on the east side were named after Union generals Grant and Sherman. After about a year, the residents planned a Thanksgiving harvest parade. Separate Union and Confederate parades were planned. But when the band struck up to play, the Confederates joined the Union veterans to march as one under the US flag. This was at a time of increasing reconciliation nationwide between white soldiers of the North and South; historian David Blight notes that outstanding issues of race were pushed aside. In this period southern states had already begun to pass new constitutions that raised barriers to voter registration, following Mississippi's in 1890, and essentially disenfranchised most freedmen and many poor whites. By 1900, Fitzgerald was a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from living there. In recent years, the unofficial, and sometimes controversial, mascot of the city has become the red junglefowl, a wild chicken native to the Indian subcontinent. In the late 1960s, a small number were released into the woods surrounding the city and have thrived to this day.

The team was called the Fitzgerald Pioneers. The club had no affiliation with any major league club during the five seasons of operation in the Georgia State League. After the 1952 season, the Fitzgerald Pioneers relocated to Sandersville and became the Sandersville Wacos, which were affiliated with the Milwaukee Braves for the 1953 season. The team ended their last season in 1956, under different affiliation. Fitzgerald got a replacement team for the Pioneers in 1953 when the Moultrie Giants of the Georgia–Florida League moved to town. The Moultrie club was a charter member of the Georgia–Florida League when it began operations in 1946. After relocating to Fitzgerald and becoming an affiliate of the Cincinnati Redlegs, the new edition of the Fitzgerald Pioneers lasted one season (1954) saw the team name changed to the Fitzgerald Redlegs. After two years in Fitzgerald, the club returned to Moultrie. It ceased operating in 1958 under the name Brunswick Phillies. After the Fitzgerald Redlegs left, the city was without a team for the 1955 season. The next year the Cordele club relocated to Fitzgerald after ten seasons in Cordele. They changed affiliation back to what were now called the Kansas City A's, and the Fitzgerald A's played for the 1956 season. The next year the club changed affiliation again, to the Baltimore Orioles, and the club was known as the Fitzgerald Orioles for the 1957 season. The Fitzgerald club relocated to Dublin, Georgia following the 1957 season and remained a Baltimore Orioles farm team; they played as the Dublin Orioles for the Georgia–Florida League's last year of operation.

Early European settlers were primarily Highland Scots Methodist or Primitive Baptist, representing two socio-economic classes, \\"Jeffersonian yeomen\\" and a \\"squirearchy,\\" two distinct divisions of landed farmers created by the Georgia Land Lottery of 1820. Between 1820 and 1840, agriculture was principally sheep and cattle herding.Malone, p.

The Alapaha Colored School, on the National Register of Historic Places The Alapaha Colored School, one of the historic place listings in Berrien County, was the only school for African American children in the northern part of the county for three decades, starting in 1924. Atypical for rural Georgia, it had four classrooms and two stories, accommodating boys and girls in eleven grades; it closed in 1954 when Berrien County's African American schools were consolidated in Nashville. A tornado on May 11, 1952, led to national headlines. The business area of the town was decimated and the water tower was smashed. The Red Cross set up field operations, bringing in a director from Moody Air Force Base and a mobile kitchen from Fort Benning.\\"Twisters Return, Killing 4 in South,\\" New York Times, May 12, 1952, p. 14. In 1963, the U.S. Department of Labor won a lawsuit, Wirtz v. Alapaha Yellow Pine Products, Inc., against a locally owned sawmill. At issue were Fair Labor Standards Act violations concerning overtime pay. The case became a minor landmark in labor litigation history; the case is frequently cited as a precedent for denying defendants in similar suits to have their cases heard by a jury.Wirtz v. Alapaha Yellow Pine Products, Inc. 217 F.Supp. 465 (1963). On October 3, 1966, Army Master Sgt. James Emory Jones of Alapaha, one of the first members of the elite Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MAC-SOG), a black-operations unit of the Vietnam War, was killed in a secret attempt to wire-tap North Vietnamese communications lines in Laos. The existence of this secret unit was concealed for many years, as well as its operations outside borders of Vietnam. Jones's entire three-man commando unit was lost; evidence suggests that the unit requested U.S. bombers fire upon its coordinates when they knew they could not escape ambush.John L. Plaster, The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1997, p.56-57. Jones's fate and place of death were kept secret for many years, and he was listed as \\"missing in action\\" for over two decades. The 1996 novel The Wonder Book of the Air () by Cynthia Shearer is set in Alapaha and includes much of the town's history.New York Times Book Review, March 12, 1996 Just outside the town is the site where the famous \\"Hogzilla,\\" a \\"wild\\" hog weighing in at about , was shot on June 17, 2004, on a commercial hunting farm. The carcass of the hog was exhumed for a National Geographic special.New York Times, May 8, 2005. =Name= The name \\"Alapaha\\" was included, along with hundreds of Native American words, in mid-19th-century pronunciation guides as both a river and a village.

See also Lippincott's Pronouncing Gazetteer, Philadelphia, J.B. Lippincott & Co., 1856. These guides offer no speculation as to the word's meaning. There were many variant names, pronunciations, and spellings of the Alapaha River operant in the late 19th century. Some ethnologists believe that \\"Alapaha\\" was the Creek word for \\"other side;\\" others believe it was the Timucua language word for \\"bear.\\" At least one ethnolinguist believed that \\"Alapaha\\" is a Creek adaptation of the Timucuan word \\"arapaha\\" which meant \\"bear lodge.\\"William A. Read, \\"Indian Stream Names,\\" International Journal of American Linguistics, University of Chicago, 1949, p. 128. A Timucua town named Arapaha apparently gave its name to the river it was located on. Speakers of one or another of the Muscogean languages, which do not have the sound \\"r\\", may have changed the pronunciation of the name from \\"Arapaha\\" to \\"Alapaha.\\"John H.

The population was 1,278 at the 2010 census. The origin of the name \\"Enigma\\" is obscure; the name is itself an enigma. Enigma has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. History Enigma is a small town in South Georgia located in the northwest tip of Berrien County, east of Tifton, on U.S. Highway 82. The town was founded between 1876-1880 by John A. Ball. It was not initially named \\"Enigma\\". Originally a settlement, it was commonly referred to as \\"Gunn and Weston\\" until Ball decided he wanted a real name for this town. Two names, \\"Lax\\" and \\"Enigma\\", were proposed to state officials for review. Lax was already taken by another nearby settlement, and so \\"Enigma\\" became the official name.Cauthen, Edna Dean, Elon Dean Murphy and Estelle Dean McMillan. The History of Berrien County: Enigma, Berrien County, Georgia 1975. Enigma is an odd name for a town; by definition it means a puzzle or mystery. Ball said, \\"It was a puzzle what to name it anyway.\\" The town was incorporated on August 21, 1906. Enigma, circa 1900 Ball and his family originated in Raleigh, North Carolina, traveling to Georgia on the Brunswick and Western Railroad. He became the town's first postmaster, and not long afterward, Capt J.B. Gunn from Terrell County, Georgia, came as an assistant. Ball and his son Jim started a turpentine business around 1878. Ball returned to Raleigh to bring back a man named Tubb Daughtry and his family to help run the business. He gave them land to live on and permission to worship as they pleased. The turpentine business soon dwindled, and lumber became the main focus. Capt. J. B. Gunn and Capt. S. R. Weston built a sawmill two miles east of Enigma. H. F. Stewart came to work in the sawmill. Other businesses opened in Enigma throughout the years, including a grocery, merchandise, and hardware stores. E.F. Bussey set up a merchandise store in a building owned at one time by Gunn. This building also housed the U.S. Post Office and sold coffins on its second story. It was located on the south side of the railroad. The railroad's closest depot was in Brookfield, away. Enigma had a doctor's office run by G.R. Parker. There have been three banks in Enigma throughout the years. Two banks were started around 1915 to 1917, and the other one was started in 1973. The People's Bank opened in 1915 and closed in 1916, and the Ambrose-Enigma Banking Company opened on June 5, 1917, and closed around 1920. The Bank of Alapaha opened a branch in Enigma on March 1, 1973, and is still in business.

The original Enigma school building was still in use as part of the elementary school when it burned in October 1973. The gymnasium and cafeteria were still standing, and portable classrooms were brought in so the school could continue until it was rebuilt. The school merged with the other schools in the county in the 1980s to form Berrien high, middle, elementary, and primary schools. Northwest Berrien School was closed in 1995 and children were bussed to schools in Nashville. The Northwest Berrien school grounds now serve as the Enigma City Park.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 5,150. The city is the county seat of Bleckley County. Cochran is named for Judge Arthur E. Cochran and was incorporated on March 19, 1869. Judge Cochran was largely instrumental in developing this section of Georgia through his work as president of the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, now the Southern Railway (a component of Norfolk Southern Railway). Once known as Dykesboro, Cochran was settled by B. B. Dykes, who owned the site on which the town is built. The earliest settlers located here to work in the turpentine industry. Cochran is home to Bleckley County High School and Middle Georgia State University. Three properties in Cochran are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Bleckley County Courthouse in Courthouse Square, the Cochran Municipal Building and School at the junction of Dykes and Second streets, and Hillcrest at 706 Beech Street. History Cochran, originally known as Dykesboro, was settled in the 1850s by B. B. Dykes. It was renamed Cochran in 1869 after Arthur Cochran, a railroad official who brought the Macon and Brunswick Railroad to town. In 1912, Cochran was designated seat of the newly formed Bleckley County. Government Cochran operates under a Mayor-Council system of government, with the day-to-day business being handled by a city manager. The city manager is Richard Newburn. The Mayor is Billy Yeomans. The Police Chief is Christopher S. Coley, and the fire chief is Brock Wilcher. In 2016, at a City Council meeting held on October 11, Mayor Michael Stoy resigned from office, alleging that certain City Council members had participated in an illegal meeting. Since there was more than a year remaining in his term, a special election was held to elect another Mayor. In 2013, the city manager decided to terminate the employment of the police and fire chief, and replace them with a public safety director in order to save money, but rescinded his decision days later amidst public disapproval, and announced the appointment of a task force to look at the budget and advise him on choices.

Sion Hall, one of the first settlers, saw an opportunity to use his sawmill and to farm. The area was developed for large cotton plantations, based on enslaved African-American field workers. Circa 1826, Hamilton Sharpe built a store made of logs; he opened a post office in 1828. The community that grew up around the store became known as Sharpe's Store. In the same year a Methodist campground was established named Mount Zion. The post office and community was renamed Morven in 1853.

The population was 9,281 at the 2010 census, up from 6,959 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Savannah Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Richmond Hill is located along the eastern border of Bryan County at (31.938151, -81.313750). The Ogeechee River forms the eastern edge of the city (and the county line); an outlying portion of the city of Savannah is on the opposite side of the river.

History  Richmond Hill has a historical connection to industrialist Henry Ford. Ford used the town, formerly known as Ways Station, as a winter home and philanthropic social experiment, building the complex known as the Ford Farms along the Ogeechee River in the 1930s. After just one visit he chose this area as his winter home. Ford's dwelling was built on the site of Richmond Plantation, which was burned by elements of General William T. Sherman's army at the conclusion of the \\"March to the Sea\\". Ford's holdings eventually totaled of agricultural and timber lands, most of which is now owned by the State of Georgia or ITT Rayonier, a timber company. Ford was also responsible for the construction of a number of public buildings, including a kindergarten, which now houses the museum of the Richmond Hill Historical Society, and a chapel which now houses St. Anne's Catholic Church. Both are located on Georgia S.R. 144, also known as Ford Avenue within the Richmond Hill city limits. The Ford Plantation has now been redeveloped as a luxury resort, with vacation cottages, a clubhouse, tennis, and golf. When it was suggested that the town be renamed \\"Ford\\", he declined, and instead Ways Station was renamed \\"Richmond Hill\\" after the site of Ford's home on the banks of the Ogeechee River. Richmond Hill was incorporated as a city in 1962. The current mayor is Russ Carpenter. The previous mayor, Richard Davis served in that capacity since 1989.

Statesboro is the largest Micropolitan Statistical Area in Georgia. It is the largest city in the Magnolia Midlands Region. The city was chartered in 1803, starting as a small trading community providing basic essentials for surrounding cotton plantations. This drove the economy throughout the 19th century, both before and after the U.S. Civil War. In 1906, Statesboro and area leaders joined together to bid for and win the First District A&M; School, a land grant college that eventually developed into Georgia Southern University.

History Statesboro City Hall, located downtown in the renovated Jaeckel Hotel building In 1801, George Sibbald of Augusta donated a tract for a centrally located county seat for the growing agricultural community of Bulloch County. The area was developed by white planters largely for cotton plantations that were worked by black slave labor. In December 1803, the Georgia legislature created the town of Statesborough. The community most likely was named after the notion of states' rights, an issue central in the 1800 United States presidential election. In 1866 the state legislature granted a permanent charter to the city, changing the spelling of its name to the present \\"Statesboro.\\" During the Civil War and General William T. Sherman's famous March to the Sea through Georgia, a Union officer asked a saloon proprietor for directions to Statesboro. The proprietor replied, \\"You are standing in the middle of town,\\" indicating its small size. The soldiers destroyed the courthouse, a log structure that doubled as a barn when court was not in session. After the Civil War, the small town began to grow, and Statesboro has developed as a major town in southeastern Georgia. Many freedmen stayed in the area, working on plantations as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Following the Reconstruction era, racial violence of whites against blacks increased. In the era from 1880 to 1930, Georgia had the highest rate of lynchings of any state in the nation. Among them were three black men who were lynched and burned to death on August 16, 1904, near Statesboro. A fourth man was lynched later in the month in Bulloch County. After a white farm family was killed, the white community spread unfounded rumors of black clergy urging blacks to violence against whites, and more than twelve black men were arrested in this case.Charlton Moseley and Frederick Brogdon, Review: \\"A Lynching at Statesboro: The Story of Paul Reed and Will Cato\\", The Georgia Historical Quarterly Vol. 65, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 104-118, via JSTOR; accessed 29 July 2016 Paul Reed and Will Cato were convicted of the Hodge family murders by an all-white jury and sentenced to death on August 16, 1904, but they were abducted that day from the courthouse by a lynch mob and brutally burned to death. Handy Bell, another suspect, was lynched and burned by a mob that night. Pittsburg Press, 17 August 1904; accessed 29 July 2016 White violence against blacks did not end; both men and women were physically attacked on the streets. Area newspaper coverage of the trial and lynching had been sensationalized, arousing anger, and two more black men were lynched in August 1904: Sebastian McBride in Portal, another town in Bulloch County, and A.L. Scott in Wilcox County.Ralph Ginzburg, 100 Years of Lynching, Black Classic Press (1967/reprint paperback 1996); W. Fitzhugh Brundage, Lynching in the New South, Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1993 To escape oppression and violence, many African Americans left Statesboro and Bulloch County altogether, causing local businessmen to worry about labor shortages in the cotton and turpentine industries.Jenel Few, \\"Racial strife\\" , Savannah Morning News, 20 August 2000; accessed 29 July 2016 African Americans made a Great Migration from the rural South to northern cities in the first half of the 20th century. Local effects can be seen in the drop in Statesboro population growth from 1910 to 1930 on the census tables below in the \\"Demographics\\" section. Around the turn of the century, new businesses in Statesboro included stores and banks built along North, East, South, and West Main streets. In 1908, Statesboro led the world in sales of long-staple Sea Island Cotton, a specialty of the Low Country. Mechanization of agriculture decreased the need for some farm labor. After the boll weevil destroyed the cotton crop in the 1930s, farmers shifted to tobacco. The insect had invaded the South from the west, disrupting cotton cultivation throughout the region. By 1953, however, more than 20 million pounds of tobacco passed through warehouses in Statesboro, then the largest market of the \\"Bright Tobacco Belt\\" spanning Georgia and Florida. The 1906 First District Agricultural & Mechanical School at Statesboro was developed as a land grant college, initiated by federal legislation to support education.

History Coal Chute in Sardis, Georgia Around the turn of the 20th Century, a small crossroads community called Frog Wallow was developing in southeast Burke County. With the construction of the Savannah & Atlanta Railway, the tiny town lay on the new railroad connecting the two large hubs. In 1912, the town was incorporated as Sardis by the Georgia Legislature, named after the Baptist church that had flourished in the town over the past decades. The church's name, in turn, is a transfer from Sardis, an ancient city in present- day Turkey. Sardis saw several decades of growth including a booming lumber industry. Then, in 1962, the owner of the railroad (Central of Georgia) abandoned the section of tracks between Waynesboro and Sylvania, which negatively affected the local economy. The tracks were subsequently removed in 1964. Sardis still retains its old train station and coal tower. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 999 people living in the city.

The city is the county seat of Butts County. The population was 5,045 in 2010, up from 3,934 at the 2000 census. The community was named after governor James Jackson. History Founded in 1826, Jackson began as a plot purchased for the purpose of starting the town. The plot was divided into squares and each square into lots. The first buyer of a lot in the new town was John D. Swift of Newton County, Georgia. During the Civil War, much of Jackson was razed by the army of General William T. Sherman during his March to the Sea. After the war, Jackson, like much of the South, struggled economically for decades. Jackson remained little more than a small village until the arrival of the railroads in the latter half of the 19th century. On May 5, 1882, the first train arrived in Jackson, heralding a new era in the transportation of people and goods. During the 20th century, Jackson grew and industrial textile mills became the largest employer of local citizens. The arrival of Interstate 75 just a few miles to the southwest of the city gave citizens quick access to Atlanta and Macon. The numerous schools throughout the county consolidated into one central school system located in Jackson, and the schools desegregated in 1968. In the 1970s, Jackson slowly became a bedroom community. City taxes were also abolished in the 1970s. Geography Jackson is located in the center of Butts County at . It is southeast of downtown Atlanta. The center of population of Georgia is located northeast of Jackson near the Butts County/Newton County line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.50%, is water. Government Jackson is governed by an elected city council of five members, each representing a district of the city. The council is presided over by the mayor, who is elected at-large. All officials serve four year terms. The current mayor of Jackson is Kay Pippin, who was elected in 2013. The city government is established by means of the City Charter. Media Jackson is the home of WJGA-FM 92.1. Jackson is a frequent backdrop for a number of television shows. Beginning in 2016, Jackson appeared in Stranger Things, representing the show's setting in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the early 1980s. Exterior filming locations included the downtown (with some buildings freshly painted for filming), a furniture store (standing in for a cinema exterior), and the Butts County Probate court. The popularity of the show has attracted many fans to the town. Other shows which have been filmed in the area include The CW's The Originals.

Early inhabitants Prior to the early 18th century, Bremen and most of Georgia were home to American Indians belonging to a southeastern alliance known as the Creek Confederacy. The present day Creek Nation, also known as the Muskogee, were the major tribe in that alliance. According to Creek traditions, the Creek Confederacy migrated to the southeastern United States from the Southwest. The confederacy was probably formed as a defense against other large groups to the north. The name \\"Creek\\" came from the shortening of \\"Ocheese Creek\\" Indians, a name given by the English to the native people living along the Ocheese Creek (or Ocmulgee River). In time, the name was applied to all groups of the Creek Confederacy. History Railroad tracks along Tallapoosa Street in downtown Bremen The town of Kramer was incorporated on September 5, 1883, and given the name Bremen. It was originally named for a German immigrant who owned a local vineyard but the name was changed at Kramer's request to honor the city of Bremen, Germany. Bremen's economy was given a significant boost when the Chattanooga, Rome and Columbus Railroad was built, intersecting the Georgia Pacific at Bremen. This and other circumstances have helped Bremen to grow from a simple railroad junction settled by German immigrants to the largest town in Haralson County.

It is the county seat of Carroll County, which is included in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. Historically, Carrollton has been a commercial center for several mostly rural counties in both Georgia and Alabama. It is the home of the University of West Georgia and West Georgia Technical College. It is a rural area with a large farming community. The 2019 United States Census estimates placed the city's population at 27,259. Geography Carrollton is located near the center of Carroll County at (33.580912, -85.076704). The Little Tallapoosa River flows through the northwestern part of the city. U.S. Route 27 passes through the city center, leading north to Interstate 20 in Bremen and south to LaGrange. According to the United States Census Bureau, Carrollton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.37%, is water. History Carroll County, of which Carrollton is the county seat, was chartered in 1826, and was governed at the time by the Carroll Inferior Court, which consisted of five elected justices. In 1829, the justices voted to move the county seat from the site it occupied near the present community of Sandhill, to a new site about to the southwest.Bonner, James C. (1970). Georgia's Last Frontier: The Development of Carroll County. The University of Georgia Press. The original intention was to call the new county seat \\"Troupville\\", in honor of former governor George Troup, but Troup was not popular with the state government of the time, so the Georgia General Assembly incorporated the town as Carrollton, in December 1829. The name was in honor of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last living signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1830, the town was surveyed and lots were laid out, with the central feature being the town square, which was later named Adamson Square, for local judge and congressman William C. Adamson. Although it was the county seat and the main market town for most of Carroll County, transportation of both goods and passengers was difficult until the coming of the railroad in 1874, so Carrollton remained largely a frontier town until well after the Civil War. The coming of the railroad brought new prosperity to Carrollton. Farmers were able to bring their crops, mostly cotton, to town for shipment to distant markets, and obtain the fertilizers and agricultural supplies they needed. At the same time, consumer goods were more readily available than ever before. The railroad also encouraged the growth of the fledgling industrial ventures, especially in the textile industry, in and around Carrollton. These early textile mills, mostly water powered, served as the basis for a textile industry that helped ensure the town's prosperity well into the 20th century. At the start of the 20th century, Carrollton boasted running water and had electric lighting and telephone service. The town began paving its streets in 1918. In 1906, Carrollton was chosen as the site of the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School, which became West Georgia College in 1934, and is now a 12,834-student university, the University of West Georgia. In May 1964 Robert F. Kennedy visited Carrollton for the dedication of Kennedy Chapel on the university campus.Bonner, J.C., Myron W. House, James W. Mathews (1998). From A&M; to State University: A History of the State University of West Georgia. State University of West Georgia Foundation. Carrollton remained an agricultural and textile manufacturing center throughout the first half of the 20th century, but as the local production of cotton declined and the population became more urban, other industries began to take on a greater prominence. Most notable is the Southwire Company. Founded in Carrollton in 1950, Southwire is now one of the world's largest manufacturers of wire and cable and is the largest privately owned wire manufacturer, with more than 1,500 local employees and 5,000 employees worldwide.Over 50 Years of Quality and Service. Southwire Company. Retrieved 7/30/07. This diversification of industry has continued into the 21st century, aided in part by Carrollton's ready access to Interstate 20 and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The city's major employers presently include companies in the airline, construction, power distribution, poultry, software, home entertainment, and healthcare industries, among others.Carroll County Location and Land Facts. (PDF) Carroll County Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved 7/31/07. Carrollton also remains an important market town, with a wide variety of national retail chains and restaurants, serving Carroll County and the surrounding region. Carrollton was mentioned in Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and in the 1939 movie of the same name. Carrollton featured in the 1983 TV movie Murder in Coweta County, although the Carrollton scenes were not actually filmed there. Other films shot in the Carrollton area include Conjurer with John Schneider, The Way Home with Dean Cain, and Between Love and a Hard Place with Bern Nadette Stanis. Carrollton was the home of actress Susan Hayward. On August 21, 1995, Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 crashed near Carrollton. Nine of the 29 passengers and crew on board were killed as a result of the accident. The city attracted news media attention amidst allegations of censorship in September 2011 when the mayor overruled the board of the city- owned Carrollton Cultural Arts Center in order to ban as \\"very offensive\\" the live stage musical The Rocky Horror Show that had been scheduled for a run just before Halloween. The theater board had authorized use of the venue and appropriated $2,500 for the show, which was already in rehearsal. News reports attributed the mayor's decision to his being shown by the city manager a video of the rehearsal posted by a cast member to a personal Facebook page. In February 2012, three months later than originally planned, the show was produced and privately funded without city money at the Townsend Center for the Performing Arts at the University of West Georgia, also in Carrollton. The Virginia-based anti-censorship Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression gave one of its national 2012 \\"Muzzle\\" awards to the mayor \\"for appointing himself the arbiter of cultural taste for an entire town, and canceling a pre-approved production of The Rocky Horror Show at a city-owned theater.\\" =Climate= Carrollton has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with mild winters and hot, humid summers. Severe winter conditions are infrequent. The record for snowfall is 10-11\\", which fell on December 8 and 9, 2017. The previous record for biggest snow was in March 1993 during the Blizzard of 1993 with of snow. During the storm thundersnow was reported. On Christmas Day 2010 Carrollton had its first white Christmas in 17 years. Thunderstorms, a few of them severe, can occur during the spring and summer months. The main risk from these storms comes from lightning strikes. Any tornadoes produced by these storms tend to be small and highly localized. An EF3 tornado hit an area about west of Carrollton on February 26, 2008. Some of the same areas hit by the February 2008 tornadoes were also hit by the Mother's Day tornadoes on May 11, 2008. The Mother's Day Tornadoes did extensive damage to many homes and businesses. In April 2017, a tornado hit Carrollton, destroying a fire station and damaging numerous homes and vehicles. The tornado also hit on the campus of the University of West Georgia. Possibly the most significant severe weather risk comes from hurricanes that strike the Florida Panhandle. These storms track northward through Alabama as tropical storms, and some have brought high winds, heavy rainfall, and the occasional tornado to the Carrollton area, resulting in significant property damage. In October 1995 Hurricane Opal slammed the Florida panhandle then moved north into Alabama and then east into Georgia. The Carrollton area was hit with tropical storm force winds killing one person when a tree came down into a mobile home. Some area residents were without electricity for almost two weeks. In 2005 a feeder band from Hurricane Katrina produced a tornado that killed one person just south of Carrollton. Flooding is also a concern for the area. In September 2009, up to a foot of rain fell in some areas, flooding many homes, washing away roads and bridges, and claiming the lives of ten people in Georgia./Billion Dollar US Weather Disasters.

History Isle of Hope is an island surrounded on all sides by water at high tide. Early maps referred to in French as \\"L'Isle Desperance\\" (modern French: L'Île d'Espérance). Legends abound of pirates using the island to hide their booty, and generations of children have gone digging for this treasure. Legend also states that French Huguenots used the island as a place of refuge for fleeing persecution. In 1733, when General James Oglethorpe founded the Georgia colony, a surveyor named Noble Jones was granted a tract on the island that was eventually named Wormsloe, possibly after an English estate but more probably due to the mulberry trees that were grown there, the worms of which, it was hoped, would form the basis for a silk industry. A Colonial-era fortified home made of tabby was built at the Skidaway Narrows (now Jones' Narrows) and today can be visited as part of Wormsloe Historic Site. Jones, along with James Fallowfield and Henry Parker, settled permanently on the island. During nearby Savannah's frequent yellow fever epidemics, the island was host to Savannahians fleeing the miasma of the city's fevers. As greater numbers of people discovered the island, the former plantation lands were subdivided and the lots sold, and it became a fashionable summer retreat. Several homes from the antebellum period remain, including the 1820 former caretaker's cottage of Carsten Hall plantation. Although the plantation itself burned in the early 20th century, the family moved into the caretaker's cottage overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. In the early 20th century, with better transportation options, the summer resort became the year-round home of many, and the terrapin farm at Barbee's Pavilion became world-famous for the export of terrapins for stew, including to the major restaurants of New York City and to the Czar of Russia. It was also the destination of race car drivers from around the world for the International Grand Prix races. The Isle of Hope United Methodist Church is another historic location on the island. Built before the Civil War, the property was used by the Confederates as an encampment and the church building as a hospital. During their recuperation, soldiers carved their initials into the pews, which they used for makeshift beds. When the old church burned down during its 1984 renovation, the pews had been removed and were saved. 33 Confederate soldiers are buried in the churchyard. In 2000, the church finished construction of transepts to the main sanctuary structure. The island's beauty and history has attracted a number of Hollywood film productions, including the Oscar-winning Glory, the original Cape Fear, The Last of the Belles, Forrest Gump, and The Last Song.
