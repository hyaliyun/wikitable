Lorković led the Lorković-Vokić plot, an attempt to establish a coalition government between the Ustaše and the Croatian Peasant Party and align the Independent State of Croatia with the Allies. As a student, he joined the Croatian Party of Rights but, viewed as a dissident in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he fled the country to avoid arrest and eventually settled in Germany where he obtained a doctorate in law at the University of Berlin. In 1934, he joined the Ustaše and became a close associate of Ante Pavelić. Although he was initially commander of all Ustaše in Germany, where he sought support in creating and protecting a Croatian state, he later became leader of all Ustaše outside Italy. Soon after the establishment of the NDH, he was appointed as Foreign Minister and strongly opposed Italian influence on the state. After his cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was executed in 1943 for smuggling gold, Lorković was removed from office but later named Minister of Interior. As Minister of Interior, he negotiated with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) in the hopes of establishing a coalition government. He also held secret negotiations with HSS representatives to propose having the NDH join the Allies against Germany. Although he apparently had the support of Pavelić, he and his cohorts were soon arrested as conspirators against the state and after a period in detention was executed at the end of April 1945 alongside Ante Vokić. Early life Lorković was born in Zagreb on 1 March 1909, the son of prominent politician Ivan Lorković. He attended gymnasium in Zagreb where he became a supporter of the Croatian Party of Rights and later joined the Croatian Youth Movement. He began law studies at the University of Zagreb, but completed them in Innsbruck, Austria, following his escape. He later earned a Ph.D on the subject of the \\"Establishment of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs\\" under Max Hildebert Boehm at the University of Berlin. Lorković and Branimir Jelić spoke about the state of Croatian university students at the International Students Federation congress in Brussels in 1930 for which they were arrested and held at the Palace of Justice before being taken to the German border. During his time in Berlin he met and later married Wally Marquead. He later divorced Marquead, and on 19 August 1944 he remarried to the Countess Nada von Ghyczy. Activities with the Ustaše On 6 January 1929, King Alexander dissolved the government and introduced a royal dictatorship over the newly created Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because he was viewed as a dissident, Lorković was placed under constant police surveillance. On 15 November 1929, a warrant for his arrest was issued, but he succeeded in escaping to Austria and later to Germany. Lorković was a keen advocate for the amalgamation of all Croatian parties into a 'super-party' to secede from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and on 4 October 1934 swore his Ustaše oath. He became commander of all Ustaše units in Germany and later, after the assassination of King Alexander, commander of all Ustaše outside Italy. The assassination of King Alexander led to him being briefly detained in Germany, but was released in mid-1935 after a German court rejected a Yugoslav request for his extradition. In 1937, Lorković was arrested following a hearing conducted by the Gestapo. He subsequently left Germany and moved to Hungary and in 1939 returned to Yugoslavia, where he became an associate editor of the Hrvatski narod (Croatian Folk) journal and the editor of the underground journal Hrvatska pošta (The Croatian Post). Matica hrvatska published his book, The Croatian People and Their Lands, in 1939 in which he stated that all Bosnian Muslims were Croats by nationality. After the Banovina of Croatia proclamation, he was arrested in 1940 and detained at Lepoglava prison and later in Krušćica, near Vitez. Lorković was a signatory to a declaration, made on 31 March 1941 and signed on 5 May 1941, in which the Ustaše requested the declaration of a Croatian state. The document also sought German support, protection and recognition among Axis nations. Independent State of Croatia Lorković was one of the most pro-German members of the pre-war Ustaše movement having cultivated political and academic ties in Germany during his time there. After the establishment of the NDH, Lorković became a member of the temporary government of Slavko Kvaternik known as the Croatian State Leadership. On 16 April 1941, Lorković was named Secretary of the Foreign Ministry in the first government formed by Ante Pavelić, who also served as Foreign Minister. Up to April 1943, he also served as the chief contact between Edmund Glaise von Horstenau, the Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia, and the Pavelić cabinet. Lorković succeeded Pavelić as Foreign Minister on 9 June 1941. Shortly after taking office, he inquired with the French authorities about the fate of three Ustaše implicated in the 1934 assassination of King Alexander in Marseilles and sentenced to life imprisonment. The actual assassin was a Bulgarian mercenary, Vlado Chernozemski, who was killed after the deed by French security forces. Two of the men died in prison, but the third, Milan Rajić, was returned to the NDH in early 1942 through the intervention of the German occupation forces in France, where he was later killed allegedly on Pavelić's orders. On 27 July 1941, in a speech designed to inflame Croats against the Serbs living in the NDH, Lorković lied that Serbs had beaten, mutilated and massacred tens of thousands of Croatian peasants during the inter-war period. In August, he strongly opposed an Italian request to implement civil administration in the demilitarized zone of the NDH. The Italians countered the following spring by accusing Lorković of being a communist to discredit him for his pro-German views. Lorković was cleared of all charges after a police investigation. However, a German police attaché in Zagreb did claim that Lorković had been in contact with some communists in the early 1930s and had helped some Croatian communists in 1941 and 1942. In May 1942, Lorković was appointed honorary member of the German Institute for Border and Foreign Studies. Lorković, along with Vladimir Košak and Stijepo Perić, strongly opposed Italian influence over the Independent State of Croatia and towards the end of 1942, wrote a note (\\"Spomenica\\") in which he described the cooperative efforts of Italy's 2nd Army with the Chetniks. This note was officially submitted on 26 January 1943 to the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. In response, the Italian diplomat Raffaele Casertano tried to have Lorković removed from office. 1941 German Diplomatic visa issued to Dr. Mladen Lorkovic to attend the Anti- Comintern conference in Berlin. Heinrich Himmler, leader of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), wanted to form a Croatian Muslim SS division. He sent Phleps as his representative to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the Croatian government on 18 February 1943. He met with German foreign ministry envoy Siegfried Kasche and Mladen Lorković who represented Pavelić. Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division but the Waffen SS and Croatian government disagreed on how the division would be recruited and controlled. Lorković suggested that it be named \\"SS Ustaša Division\\", a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar regimental titles such as Bosna, Krajina and Una. Pavelić and Kasche were concerned that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word \\"Croatian\\" was included in its official title and some Croatian Catholic officers were recruited. Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit causing grave dissatisfaction among the NDH leadership, particularly regarding its ethnic composition. On 23 April 1943 Lorković was removed from office after Lorković's cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was found guilty of gold smuggling and executed. Following his removal, Lorković was named a Minister in Government's Presidency, where he was responsible for relations with the German Army, and become a close associate of General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. During the summer of 1943, he advocated cooperation with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and represented the Ustaše in negotiations with the vice president of the HSS, August Košutić, about forming a coalition government. Lorković advocated a stronger government and greater independence in its activity. He initiated a new government to be led by himself as a prime minister and not the Poglavnik, but Pavelić named Nikola Mandić as prime minister on 2 September 1942. Lorković and some of his associates submitted their resignations, which were not accepted. Despite this setback, Lorković, along with Mandić, continued negotiations with HSS throughout September finalising them at the end of the month. After the capitulation of Italy on 20 September 1943, Lorković, with Kasche and other high-ranking German officers, discussed the return of territory lost after the Treaty of Rome in April 1941. Ultimately, Hitler gave permission for the Independent State of Croatia to annex the territory by \\"guaranteeing unlimited independence of Croatia, including this Croatian Adriatic coast.\\" On 11 October 1943, Lorković was named Minister of Interior, where he advocated stricter policing, and a second term as Foreign Minister from 29 April until 5 May 1944, after his friend Perić was removed from office. It was agreed that Lorković would remain Foreign Minister and Minister of Interior simultaneously, but was soon replaced by Mehmed Alajbegović as Foreign Minister. After realising that Germany would lose the war and the NDH would cease to exist, he advocated radical changes in state policy. In February 1944, he wrote a detailed memorandum in German which summarized the history, current situation and the fundamental problems of the NDH and its Armed Forces, as well as problems with the German Army. =Lorković-Vokić plot and death= In May 1944, he secretly met with the president of Knin County, David Sinčić, with whom he discussed the poor state of the German war-effort and that the Allies may invade the Balkans via Taranto. That month, he launched an initiative to renew negotiations with the HSS, which he conducted in his apartment. There, he secretly met with Sinčić, August Košutić and Ivanko Farolfi. Lorković also sought foreign contacts and through Switzerland made contact with British and American officials, but was rebuffed. He proposed that the NDH end its relations with Germany and join the Allies, a proposal supported by the Minister of the Armed Forces, Ante Vokić, as well as many high-ranking Croatian Home Guard officers and politicians. Lorković also negotiatied with the HSS about switching sides with Pavelić's knowledge and consent. At a special session of government held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men, Lorković and Vokić were accused of conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, Džafer Kulenović, and many others defended them but to no avail. Lorković was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where it was decided that he would be stripped of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, Ljudevit Tomašić and others, although Košturić later escaped. Lorković was executed at the end of April 1945. Publishing activities Lorković's publications during the time of the NDH were closely tied with his political activity and state obligations. He cooperated with a number of magazines, such as Croatia, which was published by HIBZ in German and French for the Foreign Ministry. In 1939, Matica hrvatska published his book, The Croatian People and Their Lands (Narod i zemlja Hrvata), in which Lorković focused on the issue of Croatian boundaries. In 1942, he participated in the Croatian Parliament (Sabor). Two of his speeches were independently published: The International Political Position of Croatia (Međunarodni politički položaj Hrvatske; 1942) and The Croatian Struggle Against Bolshevism (Hrvatska u borbi protiv boljševizma; 1944). The latter was published in German in 1944.

Description As an adult, Psychropotes longicauda has eighteen short feeding tentacles, each with a leathery terminal disc with retractile processes projecting around the margin. Its body is very flexible and can grow to a length of between . It is approximately cylindrical but broadest and somewhat flattened near the anterior end. At the posterior end there is a dorsal, tail-like appendage up to long, either pointed or with a pair of unequal-length tips. There is a double row of small tube feet along the ventral surface and a single row of larger tube feet on each side of the body. The skin is soft and pliable and the colour is violet in preserved specimens. The larva has ten tentacles and is transparent with a reddish hue at the anterior end. It has an unpaired gelatinous dorsal appendage. Larvae can grow to at least in length excluding the appendage which may be nearly as long as the body. Distribution and habitat Psychropotes longicauda is a cosmopolitan abyssal species of sea cucumber and is found on the seabed throughout the world's deep oceans. Its larva is pelagic and is often found more than above the ocean floor but still in the abyssal zone. Behaviour Adult Psychropotes longicauda are found on soft sediments through which they sift with the aid of their feeding tentacles. The eggs, with a diameter of , are the largest of any echinoderm. The size of the eggs, and the fact that the larvae do not appear to feed, makes it so that the yolk nourishes them for an extended time and that they can therefore disperse widely.

It was engineered, built and tested as the A-NEW MOD3 prototype computer for the Lockheed P-3 Orion. In 1963, the US Navy Dept., Bureau of Weapons, Naval Air Development Center contracted Univac Defense Systems Division of Sperry-Rand to perform a study of the feasibility of a central digital avionics computer for the Navy’s Project A-NEW, the ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) development for the Lockheed P-3 Orion. The idea was to develop and build the first central digital computing system able to coordinate the many sensors, MPD (Multipurpose Display) and tactical air command functions. The study, “Final Report on Avionics Unit Computer Study 10-21-63”, concluded that a miniature, modular, digital avionics computer could be engineered, built and tested using current developing technologies.http://www.p3oriontopsecret.com/ After a meeting in January 1964 with representatives from Univac and the Naval Air Development Center, contracts worth almost $2 million were awarded to Univac Defense Systems Division to engineer, build and test the first digital 30-bit Airborne computer, the CP-823/U (Univac 1830) engineering prototype, for the A-NEW MOD3 test aircraft. This would be Univac’s first computer to use flatpack monolithic integrated circuits, using a diode-transistor logic (DTL) silicon chip. This technology was simultaneously being developed for use in the Univac 1824 for the missile guidance program. It was also their first computer to lay the electronics flat, on a printed circuit card, instead of on-end like the cordwood block electronics modules, (Burndy packs). The CP-823/U Computing System, Serial A1, (Univac 1830), A-NEW MOD3 was delivered to the Naval Air Development Center, Johnsville, Pa in 1965. It consisted of a Control Console (Maintenance Panel), combined Airborne Power Supply, Central Processor, 32,000 30-bit Memory unit, four Airborne I/O units, Ground I/O unit and cables. The Univac 1830, Navy designated CP-823/U, was a digital electronic computing machine which received problems and data and processed answers in numerical form. It used parallel binary arithmetic and logic operations; word length was 30 bits. All of the Central Processor (C.P.) logic and I/O logic control was microelectronic circuitry, constructed of integrated, monolithic semiconductor elements (resistors, diodes and transistors contained within a single chip of silicon). Logic cards that were not microelectronic are the Master Clock cards in the C.P and the Input amplifier and output data driver cards in the I/O units. In the A-NEW integrated system, the CP-823/U airborne digital computer performed many functions aboard the Lockheed P-3 Orion test aircraft. It continuously computed the aircraft’s latitude and longitude, calculated optimum deployment of sonobuoys, kept tabs on their location with respect to the moving aircraft and determined estimated target positions from data supplied by all aircraft sensors. The computer used statistical techniques to derive several possible courses of action, displaying these and the computed probability of success, for final selection by the aircraft commander. Other tasks which were performed by the integrated Anti-Submarine Warfare Prototype CP-823/U computer included: Search and Correlation, Automatic and Extended Tracking, Enemy Submarine Identification, Attack and Post Flight Evaluation.http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD;=AD0694646 The extensive testing (1965–1968) of the CP-823/U (Univac 1830) prototype Computing System integrated with the rest of the A-NEW MOD3 sensor and display system in and out of the P3 Orion test aircraft, eventually resulted in the U.S. Navy, Bureau of Weapons approval.

Biography  After having attended the École nationale professionnelle in Vierzon, Béchereau went to the Arts et Métiers in Angers in 1896, and finished his studies in 1901. Before joining the army he took part in a model-making competition organized by L'Auto, taking first prize for a model subsequently manufactured for sale in Parisian department stores. Demobilised in 1902, Béchereau joined a mechanical construction factory in Bezons where he took part in the development of a prototype car designed by Clément Ader. He took a number of trial flights with the Ader Éole or Avion. In 1903 a nephew of Clément Ader in Levallois created the Société de Construction d'Appareils Aériens. In 1909 a client of the firm, Armand Deperdussin, had ordered the construction of an aeroplane that was exhibited in the windows of the Bon Marché store in Paris. In 1910 Deperdussin founded the Société de Production des Aéroplanes Deperdussin (SPAD) and appointed Béchereau as chief engineer. From the beginning, Béchereau conceived the idea of monocoque fuselages, which would allow hitherto unthinkable levels of performance. His direct collaborators, Louis Janoir, chief pilot, and André Herbemont, were also graduates of the Arts et Métiers. Béchereau's revolutionary concept allowed the Deperdussin firm to win many prizes, including the famous Gordon Bennett Trophy in 1912 with Jules Védrines at the controls (first flight to achieve 100 mph), and again in 1913 with Maurice Prevost at the controls. In 1911, one of his collaborators was Dutch aviation pioneer Frederick Koolhoven. Following a financial scandal involving the company's founder, Louis Blériot took over the company in 1914 and renamed it Société Pour l'Aviation et ses Dérivés, keeping the initials SPAD. Béchereau remained chief designer and developed numerous models, including the SPAD S.XIII. During the First World War, when Georges Guynemer received his first SPAD S.VII equipped with a Hispano-Suiza engine on 27 August 1916, he wrote to Louis Béchereau the next day praising the wonders of this new aeroplane. The air combat ace Guynemer thereafter had a long technical correspondence with Béchereau who he called the \\"ace of constructors\\" (\\"l’as des constructeurs\\"). It was Guynemer who later presented Béchereau with the medal of the Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur on 12 July 1917 in the SPAD works, in the presence of the Minister of War. (Citation: \\"Vous avez donné la suprématie aérienne à votre pays, et vous aurez une grande part dans la victoire. C'est un splendide titre de gloire. C'est avec le sentiment de l'admiration et de la grande reconnaissance que nous vous devons tous, que je vous donne l'accolade.\\") Béchereau left SPAD to create the Société des Avions Bernard (also known as Société des trois B) with Bernard and Marc Birkigt. He also collaborated with the Salmson motor company and, in 1931, joined the carriage-builder Georges Kellner to create the Kellner- Béchereau company. On the eve of the Second World War, he conceived a monoplane, the K.B.E 60, for the French Navy; its development was frustrated by events. The factory was destroyed by bombing in 1942 and the Kellner- Béchereau company was then merged into Morane-Saulnier. Béchereau remained a director until his retirement in 1950.

The band's personnel includes former members of established heavy metal acts; Lee Morris ex Paradise Lost and guest female vocalist Sarah Jezebel Deva ex Cradle of Filth. Creation's Tears frontman Brian Eddie Reynolds was one of the earlier pioneers of the death metal scene in Northern Ireland fronting the band Apathy whose \\"Lack of Emotion\\" EP featured in Downtown Radio presenter Johnny Hero's NI Chart during the early 1990s in Sunday Life (the biggest-selling Northern Ireland-only Sunday newspaper).  Genre  There is much debate as to the genre of the band. British author, radio DJ and journalist Malcolm Dome has classified the band as \\"Brit Goth\\", akin to a fusion of Lacuna Coil and Anathema. Various music publications have also slotted the band into the gothic metal genre. Germany's Legacy Magazine hears elements of thrash metal in the mix. Other publications allude to doom metal influences like My Dying Bride, Opeth, Katatonia and Paradise Lost, while Blistering.com heralds it as being \\"accessibly morose\\". The UK's Terrorizer magazine surmises in their Goth Metal supplement, Dominion Mag, that Methods To End It All is \\"dark rock 'n' roll\\" and long-standing Kerrang! scribe Steve Beebee hails it as \\"Dark Metal.\\" The recurring theme is that Creation's Tears are \\"versatile\\", \\"melodic\\" and \\"metal.\\" Band frontman Reynolds has been documented in rock music press as saying that Methods To End It All is definitely not a gothic album.  Biography  =Formation and early career (2002–2005)= Creation's Tears initially formed in the middle of 2002 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland by Reynolds who quickly recruited former Apathy member Ian Coulter to fill the role of bassist. The name Creation's Tears was the title of an Apathy song from their 1995 album entitled Inertia. Joe Gillespie guitars and Jonny Crozet drums completed the first Creation's Tears line-up. The band played their first live gig in Belfast on the same bill as Vader, Krisiun, Decapitated and Prejudice. The initial Creation's Tears line-up continued to play only a mere handful of gigs thereafter and failed to produce any recorded material at that time. Owing to the relocation of two band members, the band went on hiatus in 2004/2005 until 2009. =Reformation (2009–present)= 200px Methods To End It All era In early 2009, Creation's Tears frontman, Reynolds began to pen new material for what would become the Methods To End It All album. In late 2009, around a dozen songs had been completed by Reynolds but the more pressing issue of finding a suitable drummer within Northern Ireland's small local heavy metal music fraternity was persisting. Having been a fan of the Paradise Lost album Draconian Times, Reynolds decided that the former Paradise Lost drummer Morris who first played with Paradise Lost on Draconian Times would be the obvious choice. Methods To End It All would be the first heavy metal music album to feature Morris since his departure from Paradise Lost in 2004. In a completely unexpected twist and just days before recording commenced, bassist Coulter announced he would be leaving Creation's Tears to concentrate on his new marriage. Coulter did however play bass on the band's Methods To End It All album. Reynolds played all guitar parts (lead, rhythm and acoustic) on the Methods To End It All album. Recording sessions for Methods To End It All commenced in January 2010. Creation's Tears employed three producers for different attributes of the recording. Ex Kill II This member Mark Mynett recorded the drums with Lee Morris in Huddersfield, England. Producers Jens Bogren (Opeth, Katatonia, Soilwork, Amon Amarth) and David Castillo (Inme, Eluveitie, Katatonia) recorded all guitars at the acclaimed Fascination Street Studio in Örebro, Sweden with vocals and bass recorded at Ghost Ward Studios Stockholm, Sweden where Katatonia recorded Night Is the New Day. Sarah Jezabel Deva, ex Cradle Of Filth, made a guest appearance on Methods To End It All track Creation's Tears. A different version of the same track (written by Reynolds) appeared on Apathy's Inertia album (1995) but featured Laura Reynolds in the female vocal role. The original version of the song had only one verse (as opposed to two as on Methods To End It All) and also featured a long instrumental outro. The debut Creation's Tears album Methods To End It All had initially been touted for a Spring 2010 release but following the band's vocalist, Reynolds contracting serious food poisoning during the recording sessions in Stockholm, the release was subsequently postponed. Reynolds would finish a small vocal section at his home studio in Ballymena. The band chronicled the recording process with a series of DIY \\"Making of\\" videos on their YouTube channel. Methods To End It All was eventually released on 4 October 2010 via Cure For Poison Records and distributed through Code 7 / Plastic Head distribution in UK & the Republic of Ireland. Creation's Tears has been on hold since 2011 as Reynolds suffered a Brainstem Stroke which caused Stroke-Induced Epilepsy and permanent damage to his central nervous system.

He was colonial Governor of Macau and India. He was the second son of Miguel António de Sousa Horta Almeida e Vasconcelos, 2nd Baron of Santa Comba Dão and his second wife, Maria da Glória da Costa Brandão e Albuquerque, sister of the 1st Viscount of Ervedal da Beira. He was born in Santa Comba Dão and died in Porto, Foz do Douro. Career Horta e Costa studied at the Escola do Exército and started his military career as an Alferes of engineers on 10 January 1883. He belonged to the general staff of his military branch and was promoted through lieutenant, captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, finally reaching the post of colonel of engineers. At the University of Coimbra he took a bachelor's degree in mathematics. A lieutenant already in 1886, the Minister of the Navy, Manuel Pinheiro Chagas, appointed him director of public works of Macau. Here he distinguished himself, and in 1888 he was elected deputy to the Cortes Gerais for the legislature of 1887-1889 in a supplementary election, taking his seat in 1889 already with the post of captain, in which seat he had interventions on 23 and 30 January, 10 and 21 April, 3 May, 6, 14 and 26 June 1889. He had a seat at the Chamber in diverse legislatures, more specifically in the ones of 1890-1892 and 1893, in which he was part of commissions twice in 1892, thrice in 1893 and thrice in 1894 and had interventions on 7 June, 11, 15 and 21 July and 21 August 1890, 22 June 1891, 3 February and 19 March 1892, 10 January, 22, 23 and 27 May, 20, 22 and 23 June and 1, 5, 6 and 12 July 1893, always representing the circle of Macau, where he returned in 1893 as 69th governor, taking office on 24 March 1894. He resigned on 12 March/May 1897 after a ministerial change and was granted a Letter of Counsel, becoming a Member of His Most Faithful Majesty's Counsel. He was also an envoy and a minister plenipotentiary in China, Japan, and Siam, where he met the Empress Dowager Cixi and Guangxu Emperor at the Forbidden City in Beijing; Emperor Meiji in Tokyo; and Chulalongkorn in Bangkok, who decorated him. In 1900 the Regenerator Party returned to power and the Counsilor Horta e Costa was again appointed on 12 August as the 71st Governor of Macau, where he conducted a military expedition. The mission was difficult and risky, and he received a Portary of Commendation. He then founded the Lyceum and made various improvements. He left office on 17 December 1902. On 14 February 1907, as Chief of Cabinet of the President of the Ministry of João Franco, he was appointed 113th Governor-General of India, an office he bore until the proclamation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910. In the year he took office he instaured an enquiry.http://memoria- africa.ua.pt/Default.aspx?TabId=166&language;=en- US&q;=TI+Estado+da+%C3%8Dndia&p;=9 His government was marked by the promulgation of various measures towards developing commerce in the province. One of the most important improvements achieved in his tenure was the building of metal bridges to improve the communication between cities in the province. Among other achievements, he regularised the water supply in Panaji city by building a special reservoir at Bainguinim with special imported materials from France. He also increased the capacity of the port at Mormugão and he was responsible for Campal Avenue, where he constructed roads with footpaths and planted trees. According to Goan historian Percival Noronha, the fact that he was an engineer by profession made a difference, and the amount of development work carried out by him in the four years of his rule was something \\"never done in hundreds of years\\". He also had other plans which were not fulfilled during his regime. His government was marked by the Revolt of the Ranes, to which the simple arrival of a company of Landins was enough to overcome. With the Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic he ended his term. A public political rally elected Dr. Francisco Manuel Couceiro da Costa as the new governor, as required by the provisional government. Horta e Costa embarked for his homeland without being molested and with the respect of all the population of India. Avenida Horta e Costa, in Macau, is named after him.

Privateer From August 1779 to March 1780, Nicholas Guidelou was her captain.Demerliac (1996), p.184, #1805. On her first cruise, in the space of four months, he captured 28 prizes off the English and Irish coasts. Only three of his prizes were retaken, and he brought into port 543 prisoners and 120 cannon.Linguet (n.d.), p.81. King Louis XVI honoured Guidelou with a sword and a letter of thanks.Cartwright (1911), p.319. On 28 March 1779, Monsieur captured the Scots letter of marque Leveller, off the harbour of Cork.Naval Institute Proceedings, Volume 39, p.1461. Two days later, five leagues off Cape Clear, Monsieur captured the Polly, sailing for Liverpool. After Polly was ransomed for 1250 guineas, the privateer let her continue her journey. The next day, 1 April, another French privateer fired at Polly, but she was able to take refuge in the port of Skibbereen.Williams (1897/2004), p.252.

On 18 August they recaptured the Dutch vessel Verwagting, which an English privateer had captured eight days earlier. She had been carrying brandy and wine from Barcelona to Dunkirk. During the night Monsieurs captain took what he wanted from the prize, and then sent her off to Ostend under his name and with his prize crew. Jones overhauled the prize, put his own prize crew aboard, and sent her off to Lorient under his orders.Brooks (1902), p.14. The next evening Monsieur left Jones's squadron. Granville left either at the same time or soon thereafter. On 22 January 1780, the Lively was sailing from London to Liverpool when she fell victim to the Irish pirate vessel Black Prince. Lively escaped only to fall victim to Monsieur two days later. Monsieur took all the crew out of Lively, except for three boys, and put a 13-man prize crew aboard. On 4 February, the boys recaptured the ship while almost the entire prize crew was asleep. The next day they sailed to Kinsale where the letter of marque Hercules took possession.Williams (1897/2004), p.265. Capture On 12 March 1780 the Third Rate , under the command of Captain Lord Longford, was west of Scilly when she spotted a frigate. Alexander gave chase and after 18 hours got within range, at which time the quarry raised French colours. The two vessels exchanged fire for some two hours, the quarry using stern chasers to answer Alexanders bow chasers. As Alexander pulled alongside the quarry, Alexanders fore-top-mast simply fell over due to rot. Fortunately, , Captain Charles Fielding, had joined the engagement and she took up the chase. Some time and some firing later, the quarry struck. She turned out to be the Monsieur, of Granville, under the command of Jean de Bochet. She was armed with 40 guns, 12-pounders on the gundeck and 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and forecastle, and had a crew of 362 men. She was eight days out of Lorient but had taken no prizes. Longford described her as \\"a very fine frigate, almost new\\". British service The prize was brought into Portsmouth harbour on 19 March, a week after her capture, and the Admiralty decided to take her into service.Winfield (2007), p.220. She was refitted for Royal Naval service at a cost of £8,364 between May and October 1780, and re-armed as a 36-gun frigate. The Royal Navy commissioned her as HMS Monsieur under the command of Captain the Honourable Charles Phipps in July 1780. On 10 December, Monsieur, in company with , , , and captured Comtess de Buzancois. A few days later, on 15 December, Monsieur captured the French cutter Chevreuil.Beatson (1804), Vol. 1, p.144. Chevreuil, of Saint-Malo, was armed with twenty 6-pounder guns, had a crew of 116 men, and had been launched on 1 March 1779.Demerliac (1996), p.88, #580. In 1781, Monsieur, now commanded by Captain the Honourable Seymour Finch, was serving with Vice-Admiral Darby's Channel Fleet. She therefore participated in the relief of Gibraltar, with the fleet sailing from Spithead on 13 March and arriving at Gibraltar on 12 April. At some point, vessels of the Fleet engaged Spanish gunboats off Cadiz, during which Monsieur and had some men badly wounded. Monsieur was among the many ships of Darby's fleet that shared in the prize money for the capture of Duc de Chartres, the Spanish frigate Santa Leocadia, and the French brig Trois Amis.

The next day Minerva and Monsieur captured the American privateer Jason, of 22 guns. captured the privateer Wexford, which was six weeks out of Boston and had captured nothing. All three privateers were taken off Cape Clear Island, Ireland, and taken into Cork.Beatson (1804), Vol. 1, pp.423-4. On 12 December at the Second Battle of Ushant, Admiral Richard Kempenfelt captured 15 French transports. Monsieur was among the many vessels that shared in the prize money for the Emille Sophie de Brest and the Margueritte, and presumably other prizes. In the middle of July 1782, Monsieur was in a squadron of four third rates and three frigates under the command of Captain Reeve, in the recently launched , as commodore. In the Bay of Biscay the squadron captured three prizes: the Pigmy cutter, the Hermione, a victualler with 90 bullocks for the combined fleet, and a brig carrying salt.Navy records Society (1906), Vol. 31, pp.22-23. Fate Following the conclusion of the war, Monsieur was paid off at Deptford in March 1783. She was sold for £820 on 25 September of that year.

Kayaking – use of a kayak for moving across water. It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks.  What type of things are canoeing and kayaking?  Dove Lake, Tasmania * Exercise – bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health or wellness.  Aerobic exercise – physical exercise that intends to improve the oxygen system.Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) Aerobic means \\"with oxygen\\", and refers to the use of oxygen in the body's energy-generating process (the citric acid cycle). * Recreation – activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time.  Outdoor recreation – * Sport – organized, competitive, entertaining, and skillful physical activity requiring commitment, strategy, and fair play, in which a winner can be defined by objective means.  Extreme Sport - Extreme sports is a popular term for certain activities perceived as having a high level of inherent danger. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion, and highly specialized gear. * Transport – movement of people and goods from one location to another.  Boating – travel or transport by boat; or the recreational use of a boat (whether powerboats, sailboats, or man-powered vessels such as rowing and paddle boats) focused on the travel itself or on sports activities, such as fishing. * Watercraft paddling – act of manually propelling and steering a small boat in the water using a blade that is joined to a shaft, known as a paddle. Not to be confused with watercraft rowing.  Travel – movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations for any purpose and any duration, with or without any additional means of transport. * Tourism – travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes.  Canoeing and kayaking disciplines  Some of the many popular uses of canoes and kayaks include: Canoe polo players Playboating * Canoe camping – is a combination of canoeing and camping, similar to backpacking but canoe campers travel by canoes or kayaks * Canoe sprint – competitive form of canoeing and kayaking on more or less flat water * Canoe marathon – paddling a canoe or kayak over a long distance to the finish line. * Canoe polo – competitive ball sport played on water in a defined \\"field\\" between two teams of 5 players, each in a kayak * Canoe sailing – involves fitting a Polynesian outrigger or touring canoe with sails * Canoe slalom – competitive sport where the aim is to navigate a canoe or kayak through a course of hanging gates on rapids in the fastest time * Canoe and kayak diving – a type of recreational diving where the divers paddle to a diving site in a canoe or kayak carrying all their gear to the place they want to dive * Extreme racing – paddling a kayak down a section of hard whitewater requiring excellent boat handling skills. The rivers are typically class V and involve waterfalls and dangerous rapids. Races may involve mass-starts or individual timed runs * Kayak fishing – fishing from a kayak * Outrigger canoeing – sport in which an outrigger canoe (vaʻa, waʻa, and waka ama in Tahitian, Hawaiian, and Māori languages, respectively) is propelled by paddles * Playboating – discipline of whitewater canoeing and kayaking where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot) * Snowkayaking – a winter sport practised by kayaker where the track for the athletes consists of ski tracks in the mountains * Surf kayaking – the sport of surfing ocean waves with kayaks * Squirt boating – a form of whitewater canoeing and kayaking where the boat is designed to be as low in volume as possible * Whitewater canoeing and Whitewater kayaking – sport of paddling respectively a canoe or kayak on a moving body of water, typically river rapids.

A touring canoe is normally used by two people. A canoe is usually open on top, but can be decked over (i.e. covered, similar to a kayak). A canoe is typically human-powered, though it may also be powered by poling, sails, or a small electric or gas motor. Paddles may be single-bladed or double-bladed. * Kayak – slim boat, normally pointed at both ends, and usually propelled by one kayaker who sits in a low seat and uses paddles with a blade at each end. Kayaks usually have a covered deck, with a cockpit covered by a spray deck to keep the inside of the boat (and the paddler's lower body) dry.  Differences between a canoe and a kayak  * Number of blades on the paddle: The easiest way to distinguish between a kayak and a canoe is the number of blades on the paddle. A canoe paddle usually has a single blade on one end, while a kayak paddle is bladed at both ends. * Sitting position: In a canoe the paddler either kneels on the bottom of the boat or sits on a raised seat. In a kayak the paddler sits on a low seat with their legs extended in front of the body. * Scope of the name: In some parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, kayaks are considered a subtype of canoes. Continental European and British canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes and canoes were then called \\"Canadian canoes\\". This explains the naming of the International and National Governing bodies of the sport of Canoeing.  Modern designs  Materials used in modern designs – modern kayaks are usually made from Rotationally Molded Plastic (Rotomold), Fiberglass or Kevlar, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. * Rotomold – very durable and ideal for kayaking over rocks; it is the most widely used material and the cheapest. * Fiberglass – lighter, but requires much more careful handling and is more costly to produce. * Kevlar – lighter and stronger than fiberglass (it is the same material used in bulletproof vests) but more expensive. * Royalex – many whitewater canoes are now made using this composite material which has an outer layer of vinyl and ABS with an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment. Modern canoe/kayak designs – in general, each of the activities mentioned above requires a type of boat specifically designed for that activity. * Concrete canoe – canoe made of concrete, typically created for an engineering competition similar in spirit to that of a cardboard boat race–make the seemingly unfloatable float. * Fishing kayak – kayak equipped with after-market accessories such as anchor trolleys, rod holders, electronic fish-finders and live-bait containers for fishing * Flyak – hydrofoil adaptation to the conventional kayak. It uses twin hydrofoils designed to raise the hull out of the water to increase the speed. Speeds of up to 27.2 km/h (7.6 m·s−1, 16.9 mph) can be achieved on calm water.How the Foilkayak works page detailing speed statistics * Folding kayak – kayak with collapsible frame made of some combination of wood, aluminium and plastic, and a skin made of a tough fabric with a waterproof coating * Inflatable kayak – portable low cost kayak of inflatable polythene * International Canoe – a high performance sailing canoe with a planing hull, mainsail and a jib * Malia (Hawaiian canoe) – a Hawaiian-style wooden racing canoe * Recreational kayak – kayak designed for the casual paddler interested in recreational activities on lakes or flatwater * Sea kayak – a kayak developed for the sport of paddling on open waters of lakes, bays and the ocean * Surf kayak - a boat with a surfboard-shaped hull and tail fins, for riding ocean waves and green, non-breaking river waves. * Sit-on-top kayak – enclosed kayak which is virtually unsinkable, designed for the paddler to sit on top, but which does not keep the paddler warm and dry. * Sprint canoe – special type of canoe designed for the sport of flatwater canoe racing; it is slim, is paddled while kneeling on one knee, and the paddler does not switch sides. Whitewater kayak/canoe - most designs are easily converted from kayak (K-1) to canoe (C-1) by changing the seat. The kayak outfitting is the most common. * Creek Boat - a medium-length, high-volume boat with blunt ends, specialized for steep creeks and waterfalls, for whitewater up to class 6. * River Runner - a longer, faster, high-volume boat, specialized for class 3 rapids and flatwater sections between rapids. * Slalom - the fastest possible low-volume design in a 3.5-meter-length maneuvering race boat. * Freestyle Playboat - the shortest possible, wide, planing-hull (flat-bottomed) boat for surfing and aerial tricks on standing waves and in hydraulic holes. Competitions are scored for difficulty of maneuver. * Squirt boat - a long, extremely low-volume boat designed to sink below the surface in eddy lines. * Wildwater race boat - the longest, fastest boat for downriver whitewater racing, very difficult to maneuver.  Traditional designs  Birch-bark canoe * Traditional design features  Materials used in traditional designs * Wooden frame – traditional kayaks and canoes are usually built from a wooden frame, usually western red cedar. * Cover – the frames of traditional kayaks and canoes are usually covered with specially treated hide or waterproof material. * Traditional canoe/kayak designs – most traditional designs are based on centuries of experience of fishing and seal hunting but can be expensive, as they are often hand built to specific requirements.

Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end and are handled from the middle of the shaft * Paddle float – buoyance aid fitted to paddle used for re-entry into a kayak after a capsize in open water. It may also be used for practice kayak rolling * Paddle leash – used for securing a paddle especially on solo tours where a paddle may drift away through wind or waves and be lost * Sea sock – a large waterproof bag placed inside the kayak and attached tightly all around the rim of the cockpit so that the paddler can sit inside and prevent the kayak filling with water during a capsize * Spray deck – flexible cover for a kayak or a canoe used in whitewater or inclement weather to prevent water from entering the boat while paddling * Tuilik – a traditional Greenland paddling jacket and spray deck integrated into one piece of clothing, sealed at the face, wrists and around the cockpit coaming  Canoeing and kayaking techniques  An intentionally initiated Kayak Roll * Eskimo Rescue – manoeuvre performed to recover from a capsize, while grasping another kayak. * Kayak roll – act of righting a capsized kayak by use of body motion and/or a paddle. * Portage – carrying watercraft or cargo over land to avoid river obstacles, or to get to another body of water.

It was set up by Liam Fox, former Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom. Cabinet ministers Michael Gove, George Osborne and William Hague, and Chris Grayling have previously sat on its advisory panel, as have American senators Jon Kyl, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman. The organisation's principal staff included Catherine Bray (US Executive Director), Adam Werritty (UK Executive Director) and Kara Watt (Operations Director). It was dissolved in September 2011, following a critical report from the Charity Commission the previous year. Alt URL Activities In discussion with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Fox claimed that the think tank was intended to \\"bring people together who have common interests and recognise that...[they] will all be called upon to defend those... interests\\". Its work largely consisted of uniting British and American Conservatives and foreign policy hawks. This included meetings with John Ashcroft and Karl Rove and the presentation of awards to Rudy Giuliani and Henry Kissinger' In 2003, when Fox was Shadow Secretary for Health, he also chaired a conference on \\"scientific research and medical provision\\". Speakers included Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, Timothy Morris of GlaxoSmithKline and Peter Farrow of Pfizer. Funding and partnerships The Atlantic Bridge was briefly a partnership program of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a free-market organisation with extensive links to American State Legislators and corporate and industrial groups. It has hosted events with the Center for Security Policy, the Heritage Foundation and representatives from Lehman Brothers. Patrons of the Atlantic Bridge have included UK Conservative Party donor Michael Hintze, who provided 58% of the charity's voluntary income, Pfizer, and Michael Lewis of the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre. Charity Commission report The Atlantic Bridge gained charitable status in 2003 as an \\"education and research scheme\\". In September 2009, the Charity Commission started a regulatory compliance case after receiving a complaint about the charity. A 2010 report by the Charity Commission ruled that it was \\"not evident that [it] had advanced education\\" and \\"may lead members of the public to call into question its independence from party politics\\". It was ordered to enact a 12-month review to bring it into line with its charitable objectives. On 30 September 2011, The Atlantic Bridge was dissolved by its trustees. Controversy In October 2011, The Guardian newspaper published details of an alleged improper relationship and interactions between Adam Werritty and Liam Fox, culminating in Liam Fox's resignation on 14 October and a continuing official investigation. The controversy surrounded Werritty attending official defence meetings with Fox (notably in Pakistan) despite not being employed in any official capacity by the British government, Werritty's running of Pargav Ltd, and his ties with powerful Tory figures, supporters, and lobbyists through The Atlantic Bridge. Considering the rejected charitable status of The Atlantic Bridge, the question of Fox's independence and the distinction between the government, think-tanks, charities, and private business and corporate interests has been raised. Werritty was investigated by senior civil servants led by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell.BBC News – Liam Fox row 'distracting MoD staff', Tory MP says. BBC. Retrieved on 2011-10-12.

He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1790 to 1800, and in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom until his death.  Career  Scott was born in early 1746 at the family home, Dunninald House in the parish of Craig, Angus to Robert Scott (1705–1780), the laird of Dunninald, and his wife, Ann. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, before seeking his fortune in India. He built up a substantial merchant business in Bombay before moving to London in 1786 to direct the English end of his business. He became a director of the East India Company in 1788. In 1785 Scott helped James Charles Stuart Strange in a maritime fur trade. Strange commanded two ships that sailed from India to the Pacific Northwest Coast, collected sea otter furs, then sail to Guangzhou (Canton), China, to sell the furs for a large profit. Captain Cook's last voyage had demonstrated the potential for such a venture. Although the expedition was a commercial failure it explored and made discoveries in the Pacific Northwest, whose geography was only poorly understood at the time. In particular Strange and his captains explored the northern end of Vancouver Island, and discovered and named Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. They named the northwest extremity of Vancouver Island Cape Scott, in honor of David Scott.  Parliament  At the 1790 general election he was elected unopposed as the MP for Forfarshire, but resigned that seat in early 1796 to contest a by-election in the Perth Burghs, where he was returned unopposed in March 1796.Stooks Smith, page 675 He was re-elected at the general election later in 1796, and held the seat until his death in Cheltenham on 4 October 1805, aged 59, after a long and severe illness. His son David Scott (1782–1851), who inherited Dunninald, had hoped to succeed his father as MP for Perth Burghs. However, by the time the younger Scott left his father's deathbed, Sir David Wedderburn had already secured so much support that even the backing of Lord Melville was unable to prevent defeat. Young David went on to become a director of the East India Company in 1814, and in 1819 he inherited a baronetcy from his uncle James Sibbald Scott.

The Illinois Constitution requiredThis provision has subsequently been removed. citizens to serve in the state militia in time of war, and all lawyers admitted to the bar were required to uphold the state constitution.Sheffer, God Versus Caesar: Belief, Worship, and Proselytizing Under the First Amendment, 1999, p. 159. Petitioner Clyde Summers could not uphold that constitutional requirement due to his religious beliefs, and the Supreme Court upheld the denial of his license of practice.Schultz, West, and MacLean, Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics, 1999, p. 237-238.  Background  Clyde Summers entered the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign at the age of 16, earning a Bachelor of Science in Accounting in 1939 and a Juris Doctor (cum laude) in 1942.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Clyde Summers, Advocate of Labor Union Democracy, Is Dead at 91.\\" New York Times. November 11, 2010.Joseph, Black Mondays: Worst Decisions of the Supreme Court, 1987, p. 47. While an undergraduate and law student, Summers became active in the Methodist Student Movement and a believer in the social gospel.Goldberg, \\"Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law,\\" Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal, 2010, p. 122. The United States entered World War II on December 8, 1941. Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a conscientious objector.Shearer, Home Front Heroes, 2007, p. 790. In 1942, Summers sought admission to the Illinois State Bar Association, a prerequisite to the practice of law in the state of Illinois. The bar association admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but in January 1943 denied him admission due to his conscientious objector status.Konvitz, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, 2003, p. 224-225; In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 564. Article 12 of the Illinois constitution required citizens to serve in the state militia in time of war, and all lawyers admitted to the bar were required to uphold the state constitution. However, Illinois had not drafted citizens into its state militia since 1864, Article 12 prohibited the drafting of conscientious objectors into the militia during peacetime, and the article permitted conscientious objectors to engage in work of significant national importance during war in lieu of military service. Nonetheless, Summers could not uphold the relevant constitutional requirement due to his religious beliefs, the bar association said. With representation by the American Civil Liberties Union,Kutulas, The American Civil Liberties Union and the Making of Modern Liberalism: 1930-1960, 2006, p. 130. Summers sued, alleging that the bar association's actions had infringed his First and Fourteenth amendment rights. The Supreme Court of Illinois held that 1) The courts had no jurisdiction over the issue, and thus no \\"case or controversy\\" existed under Article Three of the Constitution; and 2) The bar association had not discriminated against Summers on the basis of his religion but rather on the basis of his ability to uphold the military service section of the Illinois state constitution.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 564-565. Summers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and which granted certiorari.  Opinion of the Court  = Majority = Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed wrote the decision for the majority, joined by Chief Justice Stone and Associate Justices Frankfurter, Jackson, and Burton. Reed first reviewed the case proceedings.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 562-565. Regarding the \\"case or controversy\\" aspect of the issue, Reed concluded that the admission of a lawyer to the bar was \\"a ministerial act which is performed by virtue of the judicial power, such as the appointment of a clerk or bailiff or the specification of the requirements of eligibility or the course of study for applicants for admission to the bar, rather than a judicial proceeding.\\"In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 565-566. However, under Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), because the judicial power is invoked, this allows a case to arise.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 566-567. But was there a controversy? For a controversy to exist, Reed said, it must follow the rule laid down in Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), which held that there must be actual disagreement and merely a hypothetical or potential disagreement.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 567. The record in In re Summers was incomplete and the response for petition of certiorari from the Illinois Supreme Court was oddly formed, leaving the issue of a controversy muddied. But the majority concluded that since the bar association committee had formed at the request of the Illinois Supreme Court and that court had acted on Summers' petition for relief, a true controversy existed.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 567-568. Without discussion, Reed furthermore asserted that denial of the right to practice law is a controversy, and a denial of that right by a state court triggers federal jurisdiction under Article Three of the U.S. Constitution.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 568-569. In addressing Summers' conscientious objector claim, Reed denigrated Summers as a \\"religionist.\\"In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 570. Reed next asserted that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to federal rights, not to purely state- guaranteed rights such as the right to practice law.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 571. But were Summers' First Amendment rights implicated? The majority concluded they were not. Reed asserted that the Illinois Supreme Court had not discriminated against Summers on the basis of his religion, but rather on his ability to uphold the Illinois Constitution's requirement that he serve in the militia: :It is said that the action of the Supreme Court of Illinois is contrary to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees the free exercise of religion. Of course, under our Constitutional system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, simply because they belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court. Reed reviewed Summers' beliefs, noting that he had been certified a conscientious objector by the federal government, his beliefs were religiously founded, and his beliefs were sincerely held.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 571-572. But the Illinois Supreme Court had held that Summers would not serve in the militia if drafted, a claim which Summers had failed to challenge.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 572. But these pacifist religious beliefs were not protected by the First Amendment, Reed said. Relying on Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California, 293 U.S. 245 (1934), he declared conscientious objection a \\"grace of Congressional recognition\\" and noted that the state of Illinois recognized no such rights. The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court was affirmed.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 573. = Dissent = Associate Justice Hugo Black wrote a dissent, in which he was joined by Associate Justices Douglas, Murphy, and Rutledge. Black bluntly phrased the issue in terms starkly different than the majority's: \\"It has denied him a license on the ground that his present religious beliefs disqualify him for membership in the legal profession.\\" Black reviewed Summers' qualifications for the bar, which were exceptionally high and otherwise undisputed.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 574. He also reviewed the foundation for Summers' deep religious convictions and opposition to the use of force.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 574-575. Black found the majority's distinction between upholding the Illinois Constitution and discriminating against Summers' religious beliefs \\"circuitous\\". The Illinois Constitution, he said, would discriminate against entire religions, and could lead to the inescapable conclusion that the state could bar a conscientious objector from a wide range of constitutional protections merely by refusing to grant these protections to nonresistors. He wrote:In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 575. :I cannot believe that a state statute would be consistent with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And it is obvious that the same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force. Black concluded that the Illinois Constitution's requirement was essentially a \\"test oath,\\" an oath designed to test one's loyalty before any illegal act had actually occurred. But, relying on Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. 277 (1867) and Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. 333 (1866), Black said that test oaths were anathema to the Constitution.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 576. \\"This feeling was made manifest in Article VI of the Constitution, which provides that 'no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.'\\" Illinois has the power to draft its citizens, and to punish them for refusing to serve in its militia, Black said, but it does not have the right to assume beforehand that Summers would take the bar association oath in bad faith and fail to fulfill it at some indeterminate time in the future.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 576-577. This thinking had been rejected by Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in his dissent in United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644 (1929), and by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in his dissent in United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605 (1931), and Black embraced their views. Finally, Black noted that Illinois had not imposed a draft since 1864 and that the majority was engaging in mere speculation about imposing one in the future. There was no violation of the oath, and no actual inability to uphold the state constitution, Black concluded. \\"[T]he probability that Illinois would ever call the petitioner to serve in a war has little more reality than an imaginary quantity in mathematics. I cannot agree that a state can lawfully bar from a semi-public position a well qualified man of good character solely because he entertains a religious belief which might prompt him at some time in the future to violate a law which has not yet been and may never be enacted.\\"In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 577-578. Black would have overturned the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.In re Summers, 325 U.S. at 578.  Subsequent developments  Chief Justice Stone cast the deciding vote in the case. Although his vote contradicted the vast majority of his previous \\"freedom of religion\\" votes and decisions, Stone's reasons for deciding against free exercise in this case are not recorded. =Legacy= The Court's ruling in In re Summers has been sharply criticized. Despite Justice Reed's stated respect for Summers' religious beliefs, Reed denigrated him as a \\"religionist\\" (someone whose beliefs are not thought through and imfirmly held). Reed also imposed his own theology on the Christian Bible, openly criticizing Summers for misinterpreting its tenets and for practicing (rather than merely reading) it. One historian has said that \\"Justice Stanley Reed's majority opinion [is] lacking in anay analysis of the serious constitutional issue involved\\".Kramer, The Price of Rights: The Courts, the Welfare State, and Civil Liberties, 2003, p. 126. A legal scholar has said that Reed's decision is \\"merely\\" that Illinois had the right to interpret its oath however it chose.Konvitz, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, 2003, p. 224. The dissents of Holmes in Schwimmer, Hughes in Macintosh, and Black in In re Summers have since become the majority view of the Supreme Court.Konvitz, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, 2003, p. 225. Schwimmer and Macintosh were overruled in Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61 (1946). But even though the cases which formed the basis of the decision in In re Summers were disavowed, the Court reaffirmed Summers in 1950 in American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382 (1950).Konvitz, Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly, 2003, p. 226. In re Summers became the basis for the Court to uphold a number of loyalty oath cases during the Cold War.Walker, In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU, 1999, p. 153. =Litigant's later activities= Summers later was admitted to the New York State Bar Association and became one of the most respected legal educators in the United States.

Eventually, he built a frame house and two more children were born, Phebe Sophia and Cordelia Marie. As he became more profitable, his wife wanted a house to reflect this. In 1854 he built a brick home. Lewis enrolled in the University of Rochester, but the two girls moved into the family home. Sophia died in the home in 1864. The following year, Lewis also died in the home. Shubal lived there until 1881, when he died on March 2. The daughters inherited the house. Phebe Sophia and her husband, Lucius Adams, bought Cordelia's portion and ran the farm with a series of caretakers. They lived there for several years with their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1895, Dr Charles A. Ring purchased the home. His wife, Hannah Denelia Ripley Farwell, wanted to move out of Buffalo and the two had the dream of farming. In Buffalo, they lived on Fargo Avenue, a few doors up from Hannah's father, Reverend Allen Plumb Ripley and his second wife, Florella Celesta Morse. They became very successful peach farmers, participating in many research projects through Cornell University. In June, 1907, Hannah died in the home. Charles remained in home he named Appleton Hall. In January 1908, he filed a new will naming Elia Estelle Morse (Florella's younger half sister) as the recipient of the home. On February 28, 1908, he died, supposedly of heart disease. Estelle, as she was called, promptly moved into the house with her widowed sister, Florella. Florella died in the home in September, 1908. In 1909, Estelle married John Farmer Whitwill, a widower who had helped farm the property. They lived in the house until 1922, when they moved to West Somerset, NY. Various sales of the home fell through and it went into foreclosure. On July 19, 1933, Mr Calahan from M & T Bank, visited Mother Constantia Driscoll of the Sisters of St. Joseph. The Sisters were at their summer home, St. Mary's, in Olcott. As teachers of the deaf, the Sisters were considering a vocational farm school for the boys in their school in Buffalo. Mother Constantia and a group of sisters looked at the property, just a few miles up the road. On the lake was a cabin that resembled the order's first home in Carondelet, Missouri. They promptly purchased the property to use as a camp for girls, farm school for deaf boys and summer retreat for themselves. They owned it until 1993. Present day David P. Gardner of Gardner Graphics purchased the property for his business and later his residence. Ten years later, in 2003, Margo Sue Bittner bought it to use as a winery. On August 6, 2004, the winery opened with 10 different wines available. The winery produces fruit wines, and also rents out rooms for parties and receptions.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Teramo-Atri. Built in Romanesque-Gothic style, it was consecrated in 1176. History and description The church was begun in 1158, by order of bishop Guido II of Teramo, in order to house the relics of Saint Berardo after the destruction of the former cathedral of Teramo, Santa Maria Aprutensis, by Robert of Loritello in 1155. Plan of the cathedral The edifice was finished in Romanesque style and consecrated in 1176. It had a nave and two aisles and a raised presbytery. Most likely it also had an external narthex. Part of the stone was taken from the nearby Roman theatre and amphitheatre; part of the latter was demolished to house the church. In 1331-1335 bishop Niccolò degli Arcioni had the building extensively modified. The northern part was extended, starting from the three apses, which were removed. The new section was slightly misaligned. The addition was in Gothic style with slender ogival arcades, and is located at the same level as the old presbytery. It has a separate façade with a blind door. A new portal was also added, decorated with Cosmatesque mosaics, dated 1332 and signed by the Roman master Deodato. The portal is flanked by two columns supported by lions; they in turn support two statues, one of the Angel of the Annunciation, the other of the Virgin; both are attributed to Nicola da Guardiagrele. In the middle of the architrave is Niccolò degli Arcioni's coat of arms, between those of Atri and Teramo. The current shape of the new façade, and the Ghibelline merlons, are most likely later additions. In the late 15th century a triangular Gothic tympanum was placed over the portal, housing niches with statues. On the right is the large bell tower. This was built in the 12th-13th (lower section), 14th (middle section) and 15th centuries (the octagonal lantern, designed by Antonio da Lodi, 1493). In the 18th century the church was largely modified to adapt it to Baroque style. The columns and the six Romanesque spans were replaced by two cupolas supported by piers; the aisles were lowered, the interior received a stucco decoration, and two portals were opened at the sides of the main portal. The original medieval appearance of the church was restored in the 1930s. Bell tower Artworks Artworks in the church include the silver antependium of the high altar, a masterwork by Nicola da Guardagriele, who worked on it with his workshop from 1433 to 1448. This antependium replaced a previous one, also of precious quality, which had been stolen in 1416 during the troubles following the death of King Ladislaus of Naples. It is formed by 35 silver sheets in repoussé, placed in four horizontal rows on a wooden base, which are connected at the corners by 22 colorful enamelled tesserae, all within a silver frame added in 1734. The central sheet is double-sized and depicts the Redeemer; it is flanked by the Four Evangelists and the four Doctors of the Church; the last scene represents Saint Francis receiving the stigmata while the others show Jesus' life from the Annunciation to the Pentecost. Also notable is the large polyptych executed in the late 15th century by Jacobello del Fiore. It shows, in the center, Christ crowned by the Virgin; under them is the representation of the city of Teramo as it was at the time. Other artworks include a 14th- century wooden crucifix (discovered during the 2010 restorations) and the Madonna of the Master of Santa Caterina Gualino (14th century).

Biography Frederick Leypoldt was born in 1835 in Stuttgart, Germany, his name at birth being Jakob Friedrich Ferdinand Leupold.Beswick, Jay W. The Work of Frederick Leypoldt, Bibliographer and Publisher. R. R. Bowker, 1942. Leypoldt had an early liking for the drama and books, and when a boy wrote a play, which he offered unsuccessfully to German managers. He left school in 1851, and in 1854, emigrated to the United States, where he simplified his name to Frederick Leypoldt. He entered the service of a bookseller in New York, who, in 1859, helped him to establish himself in business in Philadelphia. There Leypoldt opened a bookstore and reading room, and in 1863 he began to publish, first translations of foreign books, and afterward foreign text-books with English notes. In January, 1866, with Henry Holt, he established the publishing firm of Leypoldt and Holt, permanently moving his residence to New York. The firm of Leypoldt and Holt continued, but in 1868 Leypoldt decided to devote himself personally to bibliographical work. The monthly Literary Bulletin, his first periodical, which he established in 1868, became in 1870 the Trade Circular. In January 1872, the Trade Circular absorbed George W. Childs's Publishers' Circular and was issued weekly, in 1873 becoming the Publishers Weekly. Leypoldt published an American Catalogue for 1869, and in 1876 he began work on the American catalogue proper, which was completed in 1880. His Publishers' Uniform Trade-List Annual was begun in 1873, the Literary News in 1875, the Library Journal in 1876, and the Index Medicus, a monthly medical bibliography, in 1880. Most of these publications were continued by his friend Richard Rogers Bowker after his untimely death in 1883 (Bowker having purchased Publishers Weekly from him in 1878). Leypoldt was among the founders of the American Book-Trade Union in 1875, and of the American Library Association in 1876. Under the anagram of “F. Pylodet” he edited a successful series of French textbooks, and he wrote also some German verse and some translations into German. References Other sources * Further reading * * External links  L.

Vegoia is also known as Vecu, Vecui, Vecuvia,The Etruscan language: an introduction, Giuliano Bonfante, Larissa Bonfante, 2002, 253 pages, p.210, webpage: Books-Google-VW. Vegoe or else Begoe or even Bigois as it sometimes appears. In the Etruscan religious framework The actual Etruscan religious system remains mostly obscure. The Etruscan language is poorly understood, due to the lack of many bilingual documents comparable to the Rosetta stone. Therefore, the ancient Etruscan documents (8th, 7th, 6th centuries BCE) that would reflect their own proper conceptions do not yield much. Moreover, during the later period (5th through 1st centuries BCE) Etruscan civilization heavily incorporated elements of Greek civilization and eventually diluted itself in the Greco-Roman mixture of their powerful Roman neighbours. Lastly, while they formalized their religious concepts and practices in a series of \\"sacred books\\", most are no longer extant and known only through commentaries or quotes by Roman authors of the late 1st century, and hence may be biased. Two mythological figures have been set by the Etruscans as presiding over the production of their sacred books: a female figure, Vegoia, and a monstrous childlike figure gifted with the knowledge and prescience of an ancient sage, Tages. Those books are known from Latin authors under a classification pertaining to their content according to their mythological author (whether delivered through speeches or lectures, such as Tages, or inspiration). The attributes of Vegoia The figure of Vegoia is almost entirely blurred in the mists of the past. Vegoia is mostly known from the traditions of the Etruscan city of Chiusi (Latin: Clusium; Etruscan: Clevsin; Umbrian: Camars) (now in the province of Siena). The revelations of the prophetess Vegoia are designated as the Libri Vegoici, which included the Libri Fulgurales and part of the Libri Rituales, especially the Libri Fatales. She is barely designated as a “nymph”, as the writer of the Libri Fulgurales,Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentarii in Virgilium, Aen, 6,72 \\"libri...Begoes nymphae, quae artem scripserat fulguritarum apud Tuscos\\" which give the keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes sent by the deities (using a cartography of the sky, which, as a sort of property division, was attributed to Vegoia;Jannot, p.25. this assignment of sectors of the horizon to various deities is paralleled in the microcosm that is the liver of a sacrificed animal. The sacred divisions seem also to have a correspondence in the measurement and division of land, which since the very dawn of Etruscan history obeyed religious rulesJannot, p.13.), as teaching the correct methods of measuring space in the Libri Rituales, and as lording over their observation under threat of some dire woe or malediction, thus establishing her as a power presiding over land property and land property rights, laws and contracts (as distinct of commercial contracts laws). She is also indicated as having revealed the laws relative to hydraulic works,Jannot, p.4. thus having a special relationship to \\"tamed\\" water. Such an imposing system of \\"revealing\\" and \\"sacred texts\\" would be expected to have left some imprint on the neighboring italic peoples. Indeed, there is ample evidence of the Etruscan culture having heavily permeated their less-advanced Latin and Sabine neighbours' communities. This is for instance reflected in the Etruscan alphabet, itself derived from the Greek one, being solidly established as having inspired the Latin one. Also, the principles and architecture rules of their decimal numerals system are likewise at the origin of the Roman one, actually a simplified version (see: Etruscan numerals). Plus the symbols of supreme power (see Etruscan civilization), or the structure of the calendar in Rome (“itis” or “itus”, the Etruscan notion for the middle of the lunar month has given the Roman Ides, Kalendae, the Etruscan word for calendar, has given calendae, the first day of the month; the Etruscan Craeci has given the word “Greeks” while those people named themselves Hellenes, etc.\\"Langue étrusque\\" (in French Wikipedia)). While the Roman religion has precious little written bases, they nonetheless had a kind of very abstruse set of texts known as the Sibylline Books, which were under the exclusive control of special 'priests' (duumviri, then decemviri) and were solely resorted to in times of ultimate crisis; the devolution of these 'books' to the Romans was, through some rocambolesque scene, attributed to Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the legendary kings of Rome, himself an Etruscan. Likewise, one may suspect that the legend of Egeria, the nymph that inspired Numa Pompilius (the second legendary king of Rome that succeeded its founder Romulus; Latin \\"numen\\" designates \\"the expressed will of a deity\\"Dumézil, p.47.) the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome, also associated with \\"sacred books\\". Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in \\"sacred books\\" that he caused to be buried with him. When some chance accident brought them back to light some 400 years later, they were deemed by the Senate inappropriate for disclosure to the people and destroyed by their order.Plutarch, The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius. What made them inappropriate was certainly of a \\"political\\" nature but apparently has not been handed down by Valerius Antias, the source that Plutarch was using. They were the same that interpreted for him the abstruse omens of gods (episode of the omen from FaunusDumézil, p.377.), and also associated to beneficial water, would have some link with the figure of Vegoia.

Mosafinn is regarded among the more important fiddlers in Norway in the late 19th century. Ola Sjursson was born in Voss in Hordaland County, Norway. He was the youngest of five children born to Sjurd Brynjulvsson Liland (1792–1866) and Ingebjørg Klausdotter Mosafinn (1790–1852). He was raised on the Mosafinn farm from which he took has last name. After graduation in 1843 he was first employed as a school teacher, but was also on demand at weddings and parties. He later went to Hardanger, where he soon came to thrive. In the summer of 1872, crown prince and future King Oscar II of Sweden, made a trip to the west coast of Norway and Ola Mosafinn was invited to perform. Later that summer, Mosafinn met famed Norwegian violinist and composer Ole Bull, who gave the fiddler praise. During the summer of 1879, Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg visited Voss. Grieg sent for Mosafinn who performed at his birthday celebration. He became well known in Norway and made two tours in the United States. In 1890 and 1891, Mosafinn traveled to the United States after being invited several times. He played in Chicago and later in Minneapolis, in addition to some smaller towns. Memorial to Mosafinn in Voss Only two compositions are known to have been written by Mosafinn, one of which is Gjætarlokketonar frå Voss. In 1887, his portrait was painted by Norwegian artist Lars Osa. In 1921, a memorial to Ola Mosafinn was erected in Voss. The monument is made by Norwegian sculptor Nils Bergslien.

He was adopted as head of the Yonekura clan and on the unexpected death of Yonekura Satonori without any heirs in 1749. He was confirmed as daimyō of Mutsuura Domain in a formal audience with Shōgun Tokugawa Ieshige. As daimyō, he was assigned to several ceremonial postings as guard of various gates to Edo Castle. In January 1776, he became a Sōshaban (Master of Ceremonies) and in April 1777 he rose to the position of wakadoshiyori (Junior Councilor) under Shōgun Tokugawa Ieharu. However, with the assassination of Tanuma Okitomo in April 1784, he rapidly lost favor at Court and attempted to resign his posts, but his request was refused. However, he fell ill later in the year, and died two years later at the age of 58. Yonekura Masaharu was married to the daughter of Yanagisawa Masatsune, the daimyō of Mikkaichi Domain, in Echigo Province, and had a total of eight sons and six daughters.

Only genes in the same chromosomal vicinity can be transformed; the closer together the genes lie, the more frequently they will be cotransformed. By contrast, genes sufficiently far apart that they cannot appear together on a fragment of foreign DNA will almost never be cotransformed, because transformation is so inefficient that recipient cells usually take up only a single DNA.  Example  In one study of natural transformation, investigators isolated B. subtilis bacteria with two mutations—trpC2 and hisB2—that made them Trp- , His- auxotrophs. These double auxotrophs served as the recipient in the study, wild-type cells (Trp+ , His+ ) were the donors. In this study, the numbers of Trp+ and His+ transformants were equal. Further tests showed that 40 of every 100 Trp+ transferred colonies were also His+. Similarly, tests of the His+ transformants showed that roughly 40% are also Trp+ . Thus, in 40% of the analyzed colonies, the trpC+ and hisB+ genes had been cotransformed. = Explanation = Since during transformation, donor DNA replaces only a small percentage of the recipient's chromosome, why are the two B.subtilis genes cotransformed with such high frequency? Because the trpC and hisB genes lie very close together on the chromosome and are thus genetically linked. Although the donor chromosome is fragmented into small pieces of about 20 kb during its extraction for the transformation process, the wild-type trpC+ and hisB+ alleles are so close that they often appear in the same donor DNA molecule. Sequence analysis shows that trpC and hisB genes are only about 7 kb apart.

It also serves as the official seat of the chief rabbi of Paris. History The architect was Alfred-Philibert Aldrophe (1834–1895) who also built the Versailles Synagogue and that of Enghien-les-Bains. Building commenced in 1867 and the Synagogue was inaugurated in 1874, and opened to the general public in 1875, built in the classical style, but embellished with Byzantine frills. The inscription in Hebrew at the entrance is a verse from Genesis 28,17 : \\"This is none other than the House of God, the very gateway to Heaven\\", the same as is found on the entrance to the synagogue of Reims and that of Bar-le-Duc. The interior has a number of religious inscriptions above the doors. In the choir pulpit is written in French the names of the prophets. Above the Torah Ark is engraved with the words \\"ה 'ניסי\\" (\\"The Lord-is-my- banner\\" Ex 17:15) It also includes a series of 12 stained glass windows symbolising the Tribes of Israel. The choir is separated from the assembly by a balustrade and the bimah. Every year, the Sunday before Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year), there takes place a ceremony in remembrance of the Martyrs of the Deportation, which is televised on France 2.  Miscellaneous  On April 21, 1890, Alfred Dreyfus married Lucie Hadamard in the synagogue. The ceremony was officiated by the Chief Rabbi of France, Zadoc Kahn, a future 'Dreyfusard' who advocated for Dreyfus' freedom. In 1955, Meyer Jaïs (also written \\"Meir\\" Jaïs) became the first Sephardic chief rabbi of Paris and thus head of the Grand Synagogue. The French organist Ernest Cahen played the Merklin organ of the synagogue. In November 2013, French baritone David Serero performed a concert there.

Function  Dolichol-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) serves as a donor of mannosyl residues on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Lack of Dol-P-Man results in defective surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, defective N-linked glycosylation and deficient O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan. Dol-P-Man is synthesized from GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate on the cytosolic side of the ER by the enzyme dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase. The protein encoded by this gene is a hydrophobic protein that contains 2 predicted transmembrane domains and a putative ER localization signal near the C-terminus. This protein associates with DPM1 in vivo and is required for the ER localization and stable expression of DPM1 and also enhances the binding of dolichol-phosphate to DPM1.

He came there thirteen years ago, just after the army, without even a glance at the road leading to his native village, where his bride Nastya was waiting for him. The fact is that at the end of the service, Pavel got a letter from his mother, from which he learned that Nastya had cheated on him and is expecting a child whose father is not known. That is why he did not come back home and stayed to work in the North. A letter informing Pavel that his father is seriously ill forces him to visit the parents. It turns out that everything is fine with his father (he just used the letter as a trick to force his son to visit). But Nastya died recently. Pavel learns that his mother was wrong when she sent the unfortunate letter about her. Nastya loved Pavel and it was from him that she gave birth to a girl named Polina. Later, after marrying a drunkard artist, Anastasia gave birth to a son named Pavlik and also adopted Styopka, a child from a maternity hospital. Everyone thinks that Styopka is mute from birth, even though he hears perfectly, understands everything and has no physical defects which prevent him from talking.

Description  From an architectural standpoint, this Ashkenazi synagogue is classical in style with a massive front buttress and is embellished with Byzantine ornamentation. There is a desire to make an imposing, monument, on whose pediment is a large Sefer Torah replacing what were hitherto discreet symbols of identity in the city. The facade of the building is north-facing and never gets the sun, neither do windows to the south which is a facing a wall, this is unusual as synagogues are generally more oriented west-east. Above the portal are carved in Hebrew the following Biblical verses: \\"Blessed are you at your coming and blessed art thou in thy going out\\" (Deuteronomy 28.6) \\"Come in turmoil into the house of God\\" (Psalms 55.15) And on top of the building: \\"Thou shalt love the Lord\\" (Deuteronomy 11:1) \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\\" (Leviticus 19:18) The synagogue is still in operation (the rabbi is Mr. Beldheb) but now follows the Sephardi rite and the present community is mainly from Morocco. The grandfather of the anthropologist and ethnologist Claude Lévi-Strauss was at one-time the rabbi of this synagogue. It is possible to visit during certain occasions such as the National Day of Remembrance for Victims and Heroes of the Deportation, when it is open to the public. To the left of the synagogue is the rabbinic residence. The Jewish cemetery of Versailles The Jewish cemetery in Versailles is in the same area as the synagogue (Versailles Rive Droite). It is arranged in terraces on a slope surrounded by greenery at 3, rue General Pershing, and contains about 400 graves. The cemetery, which was authorized by King Louis XVI in 1788, is one of the few Jewish cemeteries dating from before the French revolution. Most date from the 19th century.

Biography Sons of Rico initially started out as a duo with Alex MacRae and Adam Weston (Tragic Delicate, Birds of Tokyo) in early 2004, under the name, Bus#56. The band subsequently expanded to a four-piece band with the addition of Glenn Sarangapany (Birds of Tokyo, Dyslexic Fish) and then James Trewenack (Split Seconds, Dyslexic Fish), with MacRae the main songwriter. Trewenack was replaced by Rob Stephens (Russian Winters and Simone and Girlfunkle). Their first release was an EP, Orange Skies, released in November 2007. The EP was recorded by MacRae and Weston and then mixed and mastered by Shaun O' Callaghan at Studio Couch. Initially the EP was only available at live performances of the band. In October 2010 they released their debut album, Reactions. The album was recorded and engineered by Dave Parkin (Sugar Army, Snowman, Jebediah) and mastered in New York by Steve Fallone (TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth). 2010 saw the band win 'Best Rock Song' (\\"Miss Adventure\\") at the WAM Song of the Year, win Triple J's Unearthed competition (performing at the One Music Festival in October) and expanding to a five-piece with the addition of keyboardist, Brett Murray. The first single lifted from the album was \\"This Madness\\", which was released in August 2010. The song, according to MacRae, draws inspiration from a true story out of England where a boy posed as a spy on the internet and convinced an older boy to murder him. In 2012 MacRae relocated to Brisbane, Queensland to write and work on pre-production for Sons of Rico's sophomore album In Rico Glaciers. On 2 July MacRae and Weston teamed up with ARIA award winning Australian music producer Magoo (Regurgitator, Powderfinger, Midnight Oil) at Applewood Studio in Fernvale, Queensland to record and engineer the album.

Career He completed internships at the Victoria Hospital, Blackpool and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, Dublin, before becoming an Assistant to his mentor, Professor J W Bigger, in the Department of Bacteriology at Trinity College. Here his work included routine diagnostic bacteriology and serology and studies of phase variation in Salmonella. During WWII he was a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps serving with the Indian Army Medical Corps. Here he began work on penicillin, wrote a book on penicillin therapy and published some of his work on Salmonella infection in the Army in India, which was the beginning of his active interest in bacterial genetics. In 1947, Hayes returned to a Lectureship at Trinity College, Dublin, where he continued his studies with Salmonella, developing his enthusiasm for bacterial genetics, and being awarded the DSc degree. In 1950 he then moved to a senior Lectureship in bacteriology at the University of London Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith and began work on bacterial mating. He developed the concept of a donor–recipient partnership with uni-directional transfer of genetic material. The importance of this discovery was quickly emphasised and widely recognised when he found that only a part of the genetic material was transferred from the donor strain (male) to the recipient. The announcement of these spectacular results at a meeting at Pallanza in 1952 firmly established Hayes internationally as a leader in his field. In March 1964 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1965 delivered their Leeuwenhoek Lecture. He delivered the Bateson Lecture, at the John Innes symposium in 1972 on \\"Molecular genetics in retrospect\\". After a sabbatical year at the California Institute of Technology he became the Director in 1957 of a new Medical Research Council Microbial Genetics Unit in Hammersmith. In 1968 the team moved to the newly formed Department of Molecular Biology at Edinburgh University. In 1973, with the new Department at Edinburgh firmly established, Hayes accepted the Chair of Genetics at the Australian National University, Canberra, and went back to experimental work on Escherichia coli. Later life He retired in 1978 and moved to Sydney, New South Wales, where he died in 1994. He had married Honora Lee in 1941; their son Michael is a medical professional. He worked in an emeritus capacity in the Botany Department of the Australian National University for most of the 1980s, and was still living in Canberra in 1991.

Stover says of science fiction's relationship to anthropology: \\"Anthropological science fiction enjoys the philosophical luxury of providing answers to the question \\"What is man?\\" while anthropology the science is still learning how to frame it\\".Stover, Leon, E. \\"Anthropology and Science Fiction\\", Current Anthropology, Vol. 14, No. 4 (Oct., 1973) The editors of a collection of anthropological SF stories observed: Charles F. Urbanowicz, Professor of Anthropology, California State University, Chico has said of anthropology and SF: The difficulty in describing category boundaries for 'anthropological SF' is illustrated by a reviewer of an anthology of anthropological SF, written for the journal American Anthropologist, which warned against too broad a definition of the subgenre, saying: \\"Just because a story has anthropologists as protagonists or makes vague references to 'culture' does not qualify it as anthropological science fiction, although it may be 'pop' anthropology.\\" The writer concluded the book review with the opinion that only \\"twelve of the twenty-six selections can be considered as examples of anthropological science fiction.\\"Sills, Yole, G. Review Apeman, Spaceman: Anthropological Science Fiction, Leon E. Stover and Harry Harrison (eds.), American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 71, No. 4 (Aug., 1969) This difficulty of categorization explains the exclusions necessary when seeking the origins of the subgenre. Thus: Again, questions of description are not simple as Gary Westfahl observes: Despite being described as a \\"late- twentieth-century phenomenon\\" (above) anthropological SF's roots can be traced further back in history. H. G. Wells (1866–1946) has been called \\"the Shakespeare of SF\\"Aldiss, Brian W. and David Wingrove. Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction, (London: Victor Gollanez, 1986) and his first anthropological story has been identified by anthropologist Leon E. Stover as \\"The Grisly Folk\\".Wells, H. G. \\"The grisly folk,\\" in Selected short stories, (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1968 (1921), pp. 285-98) Stover notes that this story is about Neanderthal Man, and writing in 1973, continues: \\"[the story] opens with the line 'Can these bones live?' Writers are still trying to make them live, the latest being Golding.Golding, William. The inheritors (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1962) Some others in between have been de Camp,De Camp, L.

The series as a whole allows Sawyer to explore questions of evolution and humanity's relationship to the environment.\\"Barbour, Douglas. \\"Canadian Science Fiction\\" in Seed, David (ed.). A Companion to Science Fiction (Malden: Blackwell, 2008) Authors and works =Chad Oliver= Anthropological science fiction is best exemplified by the work of writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Michael Bishop, Joanna Russ, Ian Watson, and Chad Oliver. Of this pantheon, Oliver is alone in being also a professional anthropologist, author of academic tomes such as Ecology and Cultural Continuity as Contributing Factors in the Social Organization of the Plains Indians (1962) and The Discovery of Anthropology (1981) in addition to his anthropologically-inflected science fiction. Although he tried, in a superficial way, to separate these two aspects of his career, signing his anthropology texts with his given name \\"Symmes C. Oliver\\", he nonetheless saw them as productively interrelated. \\"I like to think,\\" he commented in a 1984 interview, \\"that there's a kind of feedback ... that the kind of open-minded perspective in science fiction conceivably has made me a better anthropologist. And on the other side of the coin, the kind of rigor that anthropology has, conceivably has made me a better science fiction writer.\\" Thus \\"Oliver's Unearthly Neighbors (1960) highlights the methods of ethnographic fieldwork by imagining their application to a nonhuman race on another world. His Blood's a Rover (1955 [1952]) spells out the problems of applied anthropology by sending a technical-assistance team to an underdeveloped planet. His Rite of Passage (1966 [1954]) is a lesson in the patterning of culture, how humans everywhere unconsciously work out a blueprint for living. Anthropological wisdom is applied to the conscious design of a new blueprint for American society in his Mother of Necessity (1972 [1955])\\".Stover, Leon E. \\"Anthropology and Science Fiction\\", Current Anthropology, Vol. 14, No. 4 (Oct., 1973), pp. 471-474 Oliver's The Winds of Time is a \\"science fiction novel giving an excellent introduction to the field methods of descriptive linguistics\\".Meyers, Walter E. \\"Linguistics and SF\\" Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (Mar., 1976), pp. 96-97 In 1993 a journal of SF criticism requested from writers and critics of SF a list of their 'most neglected' writers,\\"Unjustly Neglected Works of Science Fiction\\", Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 20, No. 3 (Nov., 1993), pp. 422-432 and Chad Oliver was listed in three replies.

New York: Crown, 1984 One respondent declared that \\"Oliver's anthropological SF is the precursor of more recent novels by Ursula K. Le Guin, Michael Bishop, and others\\"; another that \\"Chad Oliver was developing quiet, superbly crafted anthropological fictions long before anyone had heard of Le Guin; maybe his slight output and unassuming plots (and being out of print) have caused people to overlook the carefully thought-out ideas behind his fiction\\". In the novel Shadows in the Sun the protagonist, Paul Ellery, is an anthropologist doing field work in the town of Jefferson Springs, Texas—a place where he discovers extraterrestrial aliens. It has been remarked that: A reviewer of The Shores of Another Sea finds the book \\"curiously flat despite its exploration of an almost mythical, and often horrific, theme\\".Barbour, Douglas. \\"Review: Crown's Classics of Modern Science Fiction\\" Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 11, No. 2 (Jul., 1984), pp. 200-203 The reviewer's reaction is not surprising because, as Samuel Gerald Collins points out in the 'New Wave Anthropology' section of his comprehensive review of Chad Oliver's work: \\"In many ways, the novel is very much unlike Oliver's previous work; there is little moral resolution, nor is anthropology of much help in determining what motivates the aliens. In striking contrast to the familiar chumminess of the aliens in Shadows in the Sun and The Winds of Time, humans and aliens in Shores of Another Sea systematically misunderstand one another.\\" Collins continues: At the conclusion of his essay, discussing Chad Oliver's legacy Collins says: =Ursula K. Le Guin= It has often been observed that Ursula K.

It aired on NBC. The region 1 DVD was released on August 3, 2004. Knight Rider had a 2-hour premiere on NBC, airing at 8PM on Sunday night. The show was put up against Dallas, and would eventually move NBC out of third place in the network race. No other show had ever survived that time slot. The show eventually aired on Friday nights, and in December 1982 became the second-highest-rated show of its day; MASH was number 1. The show was renewed for a second season during the filming of \\"Short Notice\\". K.I.T.T. A car of K.I.T.T was eventually sent out on tour to various car shows around the country. K.I.T.T. was designed by Michael Scheffe using Pontiac's 1982 Trans Am. Michael Scheffe had worked for Mattel designing toys, and had done some design work on Blade Runner. Scheffe had around 18 days to create his first mock up of K.I.T.T. for the NBC network. Stuntman Jack Gill says the car was dropped about an inch and a half from GM's stock height. The car also had around $2,000,000 worth of modifications. Spare cars were always on hand, and Universal eventually did all of the modifications that were needed. The hero car was the only one of the vehicles on hand that contained the intricate dashboard. A mock up dashboard was used on a sound stage for closeups of the voice box or other buttons. Glen Larson wanted the car to have a heartbeat and asked Scheffe to design a beam of light like the Cylons had in Battlestar Galactica to be used on the front of the vehicle. The Pontiac's nose was eventually extended slightly. Gill claims that they got the cars from Pontiac for $1 apiece. The only car Universal had to pay for was the hero car. Pontiac would call up the studio and ask how many cars were needed. Pontiac often gave the studio vehicles that had already been damaged. William Daniels, the voice of K.I.T.T., would record his parts after the majority of the episode were filmed. Hasselhoff would work with a guy off camera who would read him K.I.T.T.'s lines. If the vehicle was in motion, the lines would be read through the car radio. The vehicle was usually towed during scenes where Hasselhoff appeared to be driving. K.I.T.T. Knight Industries Two Thousand received an overhaul in 1984-1986, receiving a new interior , new updated dashboard to keep up with the times. K.A.R.R Knight Automated Roving Robot in his later return appearance also similarly later received a major significant overhaul as well to fully forever differentiate himself from K.I.T.T. Knight Industries Two Thousand as Previously , K.A.R.R Knight Automated Roving Robot had looked identical to K.I.T.T Knight Industries Two Thousand all black with a red light scanner bar just like K.I.T.T in his first debut appearance with the exception of a Yellow Modulator on his Dashboard as well as the different artificially intelligent talking voice. The studio had a marketing campaign for Knight Rider. Fans could write the network and they would receive a pamphlet detailing some features about K.I.T.T. The first campaign was held in August 1982. The pamphlet received said, \\"The Competition is NO Competition!.\\" K.I.T.T was parked alongside a vehicle that resembled the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard. The General Lee featured a double zero on the door. The pamphlet compared the two vehicles. In the fall of 1985, an ad came out in TV Guide detailing K.I.T.T.'s upgrades.Knight Rider Legacy Season 1 The premiere episode featured Larry Anderson as Michael Long. In the pilot, the character is eventually gravely wounded and forced to undergo plastic surgery, becoming Michael Knight, as played by David Hasselhoff. As a result of Hasselhoff's voice being dubbed in to all of his lines, Anderson elected to remain uncredited in the episode. At the end of Season 1, lead actress Patricia McPherson was unfortunately fired from the show due to a falling out with producer Robert Foster. McPherson would later be replaced by Rebecca Holden. Hasselhoff was reportedly angry about McPherson's firing but was in no position to fight the network or the show's producers for her job. McPherson returned for Seasons 3-4. David Hasselhoff eventually got his girlfriend on the show for an episode titled \\"White Bird\\". Catherine Hickland would play Michael Long's long lost fiancée Stevie Mason. Hickland was brought in to help write the episode. The episode was more mature and dealt with solicitation. At the end of season 1 during the wrap party, Hasselhoff celebrated Hickland's birthday. A cake was presented with a replica of K.I.T.T. sitting on top. Written in icing were the words \\"Look Under the Hood.\\" An engagement ring had been placed under the hood, and Hasselhoff proposed. The couple honeymooned during the shows second season. During the episode \\"Mouth of the Snake\\", Hasselhoff is barely seen, because he was on his honeymoon with Hickland. Hickland returned to the show on \\"Let it Be Me\\". NBC was trying to create a spinoff series during the episode \\"Mouth of the Snake\\". The couple divorced in 1989, and Hickland later married Michael E. Knight. Theme Tune Stu Phillips and Glen Larson composed the theme music for the show. The decision to use synthesizers was largely a network decision. Larson claims that they used five or six synthesizers, drums and a Fender bass. Busta Rhymes sampled the theme song in his 1998 song \\"Turn it Up/Fire it Up\\". Stunts Stuntman Jack Gill worked on the show, and had previously worked on the Dukes of Hazzard. In the episode, \\"Give Me Liberty...Give Me Death\\" K.I.T.T. jumps over a General Lee lookalike. In the book, \\"Knight Rider Legacy\\" Gill remembers one jump that was reused several times throughout the show. In the episode, \\"The Topaz Connection\\" K.I.T.T. jumps a 90-foot ravine. A camera was mounted inside a cage on the right side of the car for a point- of-view shot. The cameras had cables attached to it, but when the vehicle neared the ramp, the cables would be cut loose, and the camera would run for about a minute before shutting down. When the jump was performed, the cable came loose, and the camera tumbled in the vehicle. The cable can be seen in the footage. The footage was used in several episodes, including \\"Nobody Does it Better\\", \\"Lost Knight\\", \\"Junkyard Dog\\", and \\"Knight Flight to Freedom\\". Hasselhoff performed a few stunts on the show. Hasselhoff was often seen doing 180-degree turns in the vehicle. In the book, Knight Rider Legacy, Hasselhoff explains that he achieved this by using the emergency brake while driving around 50 miles per hour. Hasselhoff eventually hit a palm tree, and the studio banned him from performing any more of his own stunts due to the liability. In the episode \\"Return to Cadiz\\", K.I.T.T. appears to glide across water. K.I.T.T. was actually mounted to a submerged platform that had an outboard motor attached. For the scenes in which K.I.T.T. appeared to be driving without a driver, Jack would sit behind the driver's seat. Jack would extend his arms and legs through the seat out of sight. A two-way mirror was created that hid the stuntman during scenes where K.I.T.T. appeared to be driving solo. K.I.T.T. was never seen driving for long periods of time solo due to the difficulty shooting it. Spin Offs Code of Vengeance was a TV show that didn't do very well. The show starred actor L. Charles Taylor who had been featured in the Knight Rider episode, \\"Mouth of the Snake.\\" The network was determined to have a spinoff, a show entitled, The Speed Demons was envisioned. The show was supposed to involve motorcycles that had been modified like K.I.T.T. The show never materialized. Street Hawk aired about a year later on ABC.

Vicente Cuyás was born to a Catalan family in Palma de Mallorca where his family had fled during the Peninsular War. Shortly thereafter, the family returned to Barcelona where Cuyás began studies in medicine, which he soon abandoned. At the age of 17 he began to study music with Ramón Vilanova, one of Barcelona's most prestigious teachers during the early nineteenth century, who in turn had trained in Milan with abbé Isidore Piantanida. Cuyás' early works consist of some operatic music which was premiered widely in private salons, but it was at the Teatre de la Santa Creu where almost all of his works were produced. His First Symphony, written in 1835, although it is actually an extensive opera overture in a single movement — but it gained him some notice when it was dedicated to the actress Matilde Díez. Of his Second Symphony only a fragment remains. By 1835 several arias and duets had been composed for a drama of Antonio Ribot. As far as opera is concerned, Vincenzo Bellini was his prime influence. Work in opera: La fattuchiera Vicenç Cuyàs Cuyás is known almost exclusively for La fattucchiera (The Sorceress or The Fortune-Teller), regarded as \\"perhaps the biggest event in Spanish nineteenth century opera\\",Rita Laurance, \\"Vincenc Cuyás y Borés La Fattucchiera, opera\\" on allmusic.com although it is sung in Italian. In order to finish La fattuchiera \\"in record time\\", he abandoned writing an opera, Ugo conte di Parigi, for which a libretto had been prepared by the well-known Italian librettist, Felice Romani. Another Romani libretto—for El sonámbulo—was never completed. Premiered on 17 June 1838 in Barcelona, La fattuchiera, it was a \\"resounding success\\" and had 20 performances in the first season, then seven in the 1839 season. Cuyàs would probably have become an important composer of operas but had died at 22 of tuberculosis at the time of the final scene of the last performance of the opera in March 1839.Dowling 1998, p. 1034 Cuyàs father had also died of tuberculosis during the rehearsals. The opera is based on a novel by the Viscount of Arlincourt which had already been a success among the sentimental literature of the period. The action takes place in the twelfth century, after the Third Crusade, and in the plot, historical references are combined \\"into a story filled with magic, witchcraft, diabolic powers, and the redemptive power of romantic love.\\" Felice Romani had written a libretto based on the same plot for Saverio Mercadante's opera Ismalia ossia Morte ed amore which was given on 27 October 1832 at La Scala). Ramón Carnicer reused the same libretto for an opera premiered in Madrid.

Hartmann died on Sunday, 16 January 1910. By the following Wednesday, Nielsen had completed the draft of his \\"Andante lamentoso\\".

Biography Yonekura Tadasuke was the sixth son of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, a favorite of shōgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi who served in a number of important posts within the administration of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1710, he was adopted by Yonekura Masateru, the daimyō of Minagawa Domain in Shimotsuke Province, and succeeded to the head of the Yonekura clan and daimyo of Minagawa two years later. On September 1, 1716, he was received in a formal audience by Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. On July 27, 1722, he transferred the seat of the Yonekura clan to Mutsuura Domain in southern Musashi Province, (modern-day Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), where his descendants continued to reside until the Meiji Restoration. Yonelura Tadasuke died of illness at the young age of 30, leaving behind Yonekura Satonori, his two- year-old heir. This resulted in an O-Ie Sōdō, in which some of his retainers misrepresented the young heir's age to the shogunate. Yonekura Tadasuke was married to a daughter of Honda Tadanao, the daimyō of Koriyama Domain in Yamato Province.

His oil paintings were quiet and academic in their style, but display occasional flashes of virtuosity and brilliance in bold, impasto brushstroke and skillful handling of the medium. Early life Ba Nyan was the fourth of six children, born in Pantanaw in 1897. He displayed his talent for painting at an early age, and for four years studied the skills of applying color and painting traditional motifs under Po Maung. He was noticed by the Maubin district officer who persuaded the government to support him in studying at the Norman School in Mawlamyaing under Saya Ba Lwin. He was then appointed assistant drawing master at the Yangon High School. Success The Burma Art Club, founded in 1913, assisted in the development of Burmese artists, and in 1921 helped him go to the Royal College of Art in London. Later he moved to the Yellow Door Fine Arts School, where he received personal instruction from the artist Frank Spenlove-Spenlove (1867-1933). He returned in 1925 full of enthusiasm about western oil painting techniques, and began depicting the Burmese countryside in the style of conservative British landscape artists. In 1928 he went back to London, and on this visit became acquainted with the famous muralist Sir Frank Brangwyn and the head of the Royal Art Academy, Sir William Rothenstein, who helped him to take part in art exhibitions. He also met King George V in person, after he had saved one of the king's relatives from drowning. When he returned to Burma in 1930, his experience in London had earned him a formidable reputation and he was able to mount one-man art exhibitions and received various commissions from the government and wealthy patrons. Back in Burma In 1935 he married Sein Khaing. In 1939 he became principal of the Art School for Myanmar students. In 1944, during the Japanese occupation, Ba Nyan led a group of artists that opened an Institute of Art, becoming the principal of the academy with Ba Kyi and San Win as instructors. During this period, the war-time prime minister of Burma, U Ba Maw, traveled to Japan on official business and presented two of Ba Nyan's paintings to Kuniaki Koiso, the Japanese Prime Minister, and a third painting, a landscape of the Shwedagon Pagoda, entitled Night of the Shwedagon, to Emperor Hirohito. By those who saw the last painting, it was considered one of Ba Nyan's most powerful works. Presumably, it is still in the Collection of the Japanese Imperial Household. Another masterpiece by Ba Nyan is his oil painting U Ba O (1933) of his father, done with heavy use of chiaroscuro and impasto techniques, on permanent display in the National Museum of Myanmar. Legacy Ba Nyan played a key role in introducing western techniques to Myanmar artists. He also had a significant influence on the manner in which teaching was handed down in Burma for he retained the master-apprentice form of instruction, which had always been a feature of the older more Traditional schools of painting in Burma. Ba Nyan taught six pupils full-time who lived with him in his home: Aye Maung, Thein Han, Thein Tan, Myat Kyaw, Ba Kyi, and Aung Khin, in that order, although Myat Kyaw's period of study with Ba Nyan was short. As Myat Kyaw's interest in painting was in the commercial rather than fine-art vein, Ba Nyan sent Myat Kyaw for further study to Ngwe Gaing, whose interest in the early years was in commercial work. Thein Han, Ba Kyi, and Aung Khin became major painters of Burma, and Myat Kyaw, if not a major painter of Burma, became a major figure and force in the Burmese painting community. Ngwe Gaing and Bogalay Kyaw Hlaing studied with Ba Nyan on an ad hoc basis; but there is no question that Ngwe Gaing's three or four years of studying with Ba Nyan on weekends had a large influence on Ngwe Gaing, who became regarded as the leading painter in Burma after Ba Nyan died. Aung Soe also received some exposure to Ba Nyan while both of them were at the Institute of Art during the Japanese occupation period (above), but Aung Soe was very young then, barely 20, and their time together at the Academy was very short. As Aung Soe's path as an intensely modernist (abstract) painter, or as a painter in the Traditional mode, shows no clear influence of Ba Nyan, it is strictly speculation to wonder of the effects Ba Nyan may have had on Aung Soe. His death Ba Nyan died on 12 October 1945, shortly after the end of World War II.

The following units were here at some point: =Prison use= The site was converted to an open prison in 1960 with a capacity of 521. The prison houses convicted adult males and, as a category D institution, specialises in dealing with D non-violent offenders with a low risk of absconding, but does not limit itself exclusively to that category of offender. High-profile prisoners In 1996 Lord ('Charlie') Brocket, aged 44, was transferred to Ford following an incident in which he was stabbed in a semi-secure prison in Bedfordshire. There was a great deal of media interest in Brocket, who had been convicted of insurance fraud but who had epitomised 1980s consumerism, and shortly after his arrival he was photographed visiting a physiotherapist in the local town of Bognor Regis. Following that incident, he was denied the usual freedom that comes with a stay in an open prison. The Board of Visitors at the time had raised concern over the system regarding inmates being able to obtain private medical treatment. Chairpersons Mrs Lillian Holdsworth and subsequently Mrs Alison Munn had discussed this at Area Manager level. The system was changed after this incident and all external medical appointments more thoroughly vetted. Since about 1999 Ford has had a more varied population, and some high-profile prisoners who were expected to be sent to Ford were instead incarcerated in other open prisons. Jonathan Aitken was sent to an Open Prison in Kent, and Jeffrey Archer was sent to North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire. Recent history The prison has been criticised for its lax security – especially after 70 people, including three murderers serving the last three years of their sentences, absconded in 2006 alone. In March 2009, the prison's own Independent Monitoring Board issued a report stating that an outdated CCTV security system and a staffing shortage were contributing to burglars breaking into the jail to steal equipment from workshops. The report also found that drugs, alcohol and mobile phones were being smuggled into the prison for inmates. Two months later, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons found that inmates were leaving the prison complex at night to acquire alcohol. The report also stated that the prison was underperforming in preparing inmates for resettlement on release. In October 2009, an investigation was launched after it emerged that a prisoner at Ford had been able to remove documents from a disused office in the prison complex. Open prisons are operated on trust. Prisoners who break this trust are often sent back to closed conditions or have their freedom curtailed. Staffing levels have often been considered to be too low by the IMB even as far back as 1997 and 1998. The IMB Annual Reports, made to the Home Secretary, are available to the public once they have been vetted for any confidential information. In July 2010, managers of Ford Prison had to apologise after Muslim prisoners at the jail were served burgers containing pork. 20 Muslim inmates were served the non-halal food before they noticed that the packaging for the burgers listed pork as an ingredient. On 1 January 2011, inmates at Ford Prison started a riot after they were ordered to undergo breathalyser tests for contraband alcohol. Approximately 40 prisoners began smashing windows and activating fire alarms; the incident then escalated, resulting in several buildings on the grounds being set ablaze. Eight blocks at the open jail were set on fire. A mail room, gym, snooker room and pool room were destroyed. Prison staff retreated from part of the site while specialist prison officers in riot gear were brought in, along with firefighters and riot police. After the riot was brought under control, the Prison Service announced that it would undertake an enquiry into the incident. In February 2011, a journalist for The Sun successfully broke into the jail and provided details of lax security there. The prison today HMP Ford is a category D Open prison with an emphasis on resettlement of prisoners into the community. Surrounded by a high security fence with a manned security barrier at the main gate, the prisoner's accommodation is never locked and there are no bars on windows. Accommodation at the prison comprises the former NCO's buildings which are brick and now contain single person rooms plus a number of specially redesigned rooms set aside for disabled prisoners. The inmates in these blocks, which are connected by corridors, are usually those offenders serving four years or higher prison sentences. Across the cricket field are a number of wooden 'barracks' style huts, each of which is divided into eight rooms and usually houses two prisoners to a room. These huts usually hold those prisoners serving less than four-year sentences. Also on that side are several newly built blocks, each of which contains thirty single person rooms. Work opportunities for inmates at Ford Open Prison include market gardening work and some vocational work in workshops, as well as opportunities for long term prisoners to work in the community. Education provision includes a range of courses offered by The Manchester College that enable prisoners to gain vocational and academic qualifications. The prison also has a Job Club provided by Tribal plus a Citizen's Advice Bureau, and a prisoner Listener group that provides support to other prisoners. All religions are fully represented at Ford prison. There are full medical, dental and optician facilities available.

Life Lady Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Germain, née Berkeley, was second daughter of Charles Berkeley, 2nd Earl of Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden. In 1738, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough wrote of her that \\"notwithstanding the great pride of the Berkeley family she married an innkeeper's son,\\" and maliciously adds in explanation that \\"she was very ugly, without a portion, and in her youth had an unlucky accident with one of her father's servants.\\" The so-called innkeeper's son was Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet (1650–1718), who was rumored to be the illegitimate son of William II, Prince of Orange and accordingly half-brother of King William III. Lady Betty met Germain at the Hot Wells, Bristol, and they were shortly thereafter married in October 1706. He was a recent widower, having first married Mary Mordaunt, Baroness Mordaunt, only child and heiress of the 2nd Earl of Peterborough, after her first husband, Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk had divorced her in 1700 over her love affair with Germain. Betty was thirty years younger than her husband, but her good sense made their union happy. They had three children, two boys and a girl, all of whom died young, and in acknowledgment of her devotion in nursing them Germain left her the estate of Drayton in Northamptonshire, and the vast property which he had inherited from his first wife, who had died childless. On his deathbed, he expressed the wish that she would marry a young man and have children to succeed to her wealth, but hoped that otherwise her fortune might pass to a younger son of Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, who had married Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-general Walter Philip Colyear, Germain's friend and colleague in the Dutch service. Though almost persuaded in later years to marry Lord Sidney Beauclerk, a handsome and worthless fortune-hunter, she remained a widow for more than fifty years, and fulfilled her husband's wishes by leaving the estate of Drayton, with £20,000 in money and half the residue of her wealth, to the politician Lord George Sackville, the Duke's second son, who in turn assumed the name of Germain. In 1730 she received a threatening anonymous letter left outside her London residence demanding £50 in return for her life. The Duke of Dorset showed the letter to the king, George II who ordered that Lady Betty was to have the protection of a file of musketeers. Lady Betty passed most of her widowhood in her own apartments at Knole, near Sevenoaks in west Kent, the seat of her friends the Duke and Duchess of Dorset, or at her London town house in St. James's Square where she entertained politicians regardless of party or faction. She only occasionally visited Drayton House, which she retained in much the condition her husband left it.Anne Pimlott Baker, \\"Germain, Lady Elizabeth (Betty) (1680–1769)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009; accessed 4 Jan 2011 Originally built in the 14th century and expanded over the centuries, Drayton had been lavishly remodelled in the early 18th century following Baroness Mordaunt's marriage to Germain. After her death, he continued to devote considerable attention to the estate, including his formal Dutch gardens, which Lady Betty maintained as they had been in his lifetime. 'Parishes: Lowick', A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3 (1930), pp. 231-243. Accessed 4 January 2011. She died at her town house on 16 December 1769. Her elder sister married Thomas Chamber of Ilanworth, Middlesex, and had two daughters, who, as their parents died young, were brought up entirely under Lady Betty's guardianship. The elder niece, Mary, married Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere. The younger, Anne, became the wife of Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, a close political associate of his brother-in-law, William Pitt (the Elder), 1st Earl of Chatham. Most of the balance of Lady Betty's estate was left to Lady Vere, and the disposition of her money is set out in a letter from Vere to Temple.Grenville Papers, iv. 490-3 She left £120,000 in the funds. Influence Horace Walpole paid a visit to Drayton in 1763, and found the house \\"covered with portraits, crammed with old china\\". Many of her curiosities were sold after her death, by auction. The cameos and intaglios collected by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, were bequeathed to Germain by his first wife. Lady Betty offered the collection to the British Museum for £10,000, and, as the offer was declined, gave them in 1762 to her great-niece, Lady Mary Beauclerk, who married Lord Charles Spencer, son of the 3rd Duke of Marlborough. These gems were described in two folio volumes entitled Gemmarum antiquarum delectus quse in dactyliothecis Ducis Marlburiensis conservantur, 1781–90; the engravings were chiefly by Bartolozzi, and the Latin text by Jacob Bryant and William Cole (1753–1806). The gems were part of the Marlborough collection sold in 1875 for £36,750. She is acknowledged to have \\"outlived the irregularities of her youth, and she was esteemed for her kindness and liberality.\\" She gave £500 to the Foundling Hospital in 1746. Her politics were indicated by a present of £100 to John Wilkes during his imprisonment. Jonathan Swift was chaplain to her father from 1699 to 1701, while the Earl of Berkeley was lord justice in Ireland, and Lady Betty and Swift continued their friendship during the various times he spent in England. She added a stanza to the dean's ballad on the game of traffic, written at Dublin Castle in 1699, which produced from him in August 1702 a second ballad \\"to the tune of the Cutpurse.\\" Her name is often mentioned in the Journal to Stella, and as a vocal Whig, she often disputed with the dean on political topics. Many letters to and from her are included in Swift's Works and in the Suffolk Correspondence.Letters to and from Henrietta, Countess of Suffolk, and her second husband, the Hon. George Berkeley; from 1712 to 1767, with historical, biographical, and explanatory notes (London: J Murray) 1824, in 2 volumes: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. Accessed 4 January 2011. Her spirited letter to Swift defending her friend Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk (George II's mistress and Betty's future sister- in-law) against Swift's harsh censure is especially singled out as doing her \\"great honour\\". Though their correspondence appears to have ceased in 1737, she retained him in her affections, and a portrait of Swift still hangs in her rooms at Knole. Edward Young dedicated to Lady Betty his sixth satire on women, and according to a correspondent in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes,Vol ii. 11 she was credited with having written a satire on Alexander Pope. The manuscripts at Drayton, which include communications to and from Lady Betty, are described in the Historical Manuscripts Commission's report on the MSS of Mrs Stopford Sackville of Drayton House.Ninth report, Part 3, of the Historical Manuscripts Commission (1884) [MSS of Mrs Stopford Sackville of Drayton House, Northamptonshire], expanded and reprinted in two volumes, Vol. 1 (1904) and Vol. 2 (principally American matters, 1910).

Biography His father, also named Christopher Sower (I), had founded a printing and publishing business and other enterprises in Germantown, Pennsylvania, which the son later continued. Christopher Sower II was liberally educated. His early education was by Christopher Dock, whose work “Eine Einfältige und gründlich abgefasste Schul-Ordnung” he later published. Sower learned the printing and publishing trades from his father. When he was 26 years old, he became a minister, and was associated with Sanders Mack in Germantown and the oldest Dunker church in the United States. Five years later, he was chosen overseer, or bishop, and continued the duties of his office in connection with his inherited secular business until his death. Upon taking charge of the printing and publishing business, he so increased it that for many years it was the largest book manufactory in the country. In 1763, he published a second edition of the great quarto Bible, in 1776 a third, all in German. These editions were issued previous to the publication of the first English Bible in the colonies by Robert Aitken in 1781. Sower did his own type founding, wood engraving, ink making and book binding. In 1773 he constructed a paper mill on the Schuylkill River. He also managed a large business in his father's medical preparations, which he sent to various parts of the country. Before the American Revolutionary War, he was one of the wealthiest men in the Thirteen Colonies. He was one of the founders of the Germantown Academy, to which he largely contributed. He also was an opponent of slavery. In 1774, without legal formality, he turned over his house in Germantown and his printing business to his son Christopher. During the American Revolutionary War, when British troops occupied Germantown, part of the unbound sheets for Sower's Bible edition of 1776 was seized and used for littering horses. Though, along with many other German sectarians (these included Quakers, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, Moravians and his own sect, the Dunkers), Sower was merely a pacifist, his son was an active loyalist, and the Sowers were on the rebels' list of loyalists. When the British troops departed Philadelphia, the son left with them, but the father stayed behind during the rebel occupation. Though Christopher Sower II did not espouse the British cause, and had actively denounced the Stamp Act which doubly taxed foreign publications, he was arrested and imprisoned. On a second arrest for not conforming to an edict, of which he seems to have been ignorant, he was taken from his bed, maltreated in various ways, and led before the provost as a spy. His considerable property was confiscated, but instead of having recourse to the law, he said: “I made them to understand that I should permit everything to happen to me that the Lord should ordain.” Sower's one protest was against being labeled a traitor. The remainder of his old age was spent, except when visiting churches within his jurisdiction, at Methacton, where, assisted by his daughter, he supported himself at binding and selling remnants of his publications. He died in poverty. No one in his denomination has been held in higher veneration, and his benevolence to the poor families of the soldiers earned him the title of the “bread father.” He was also an orator, and his reputation as a writer extended throughout the colonies. Family He married Catharine Sharpnack in 1751. They had nine children. She died in 1777. In 1888, Christopher the younger's great grandson Charles Gilbert Sower incorporated the family firm as the Christopher Sower Company with a charter from Pennsylvania.

He documented his fifty-year sea career in a three volume autobiography: Sail Ho! My Early Years at Sea (1958); Tramps and Ladies – My Early Years in Steamers (1959) and Commodore – War, Peace and Big Ships (1961). In addition, Bisset authored Lifeboat Efficiency (1924) which became the primary text used by the British Merchant Marine until the Second World War for instructing merchant seaman in lifeboat utilization and handling, and Ship Ahoy ! : Nautical Notes for Ocean Travellers (c.1930), a treatise on shipboard operations for the edification of passengers. He served in or commanded Cunard liners including Caronia, Franconia, Mauretania, Aquitania, Berengaria, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth.  Early life  James Bisset was born in Liverpool, UK, on 15 July 1883, the son of Scottish father, James Smith Bisset of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, UK and an English mother, Sarah Ellen Butler of Bolton, Lancashire, UK. The second of six children, James attended St Saviour's Infant School in Liverpool and later the Granby Street Board School. In 1897 at fourteen years of age, he was apprenticed as an office clerk in the Liverpool branch of the London and Provincial Marine Insurance Company. After listening to the sea stories of one of his \\"uncles\\" (a close friend of the Bisset family), James decided to stow away on a windjammer in 1897 but was discovered and returned home. Late in 1897, he was apprenticed as a junior clerk in the Liverpool office of the Anglo-American Oil company.  Career  = Career in sail = Unsatisfied by office work, in the summer of 1898 Bisset became indentured as an ordinary seaman through William Thomas & Co., Ltd. of Liverpool for a four-year apprenticeship. He soon set sail from Liverpool on the barque County of Pembroke for a ten-month voyage. Bisset gained additional practical experience in navigation and seamanship during a subsequent voyage of two years and seven weeks aboard the County of Pembroke. In late 1902, a third voyage aboard the County of Pembroke, completed Bisset's four-year apprenticeship and he earned a posting as able bodied seaman and eventually third mate. In early spring of 1903, Bisset enrolled in the Navigation School of the Mercantile Marine Service Association in Liverpool to prepare for the second mate's examination which he passed in May. He returned to the employ of William Thomas & Co., Ltd. of Liverpool embarking as Second Mate in the barque County of Cardigan on 26 May 1903. After an eighteen-month voyage, Bisset returned to Liverpool, having achieved the required time in service as a Second Mate to be able to sit for the First Mate's exam which he passed in February 1905. He then embarked on a series of voyages in steamships over the next two years to gain practical experience towards sitting for the master's examination which he passed (Master in Sail) in March 1905. Encouraged by his mother, he continued his studies in the navigation school toward the extra master's certificate which he passed on 15 May 1907. = Career in steam = On 17 May 1907, the same day he passed for his extra master's certificate, Bisset made inquiries at the Cunard Steamship Company's office at Huskisson Dock on the Mersey which landed him a posting as fourth officer aboard the Cunard liner Caronia. In July 1907, Bisset was transferred to the older Cunard liner Ultonia, also in the position of fourth officer. In March 1908, he was again transferred to Cunard's Umbria where he served as junior third officer. By November 1908, another transfer had occurred to Cunard's Ivernia, this time as third officer. From January 1909 to May 1911, Bisset served as third officer on a Cunard cargo vessel Brescia under Captains Arthur Rostron, George Melsom, and Charles Morrison between Liverpool and the Mediterranean. He continued in Cunard's Mediterranean service aboard the Phrygia through November 1911. On 1 January 1910, Bisset was confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR). = Titanic rescue = After a short period of naval training in the spring of 1912, Bisset was posted as second officer to Cunard's , again serving under Captain Arthur Rostron. In this position, Bisset would be on duty in the North Atlantic on the evening of 14 April 1912 when Carpathia responded to wireless distress calls from the White Star Liner . Carpathia led rescue operations until 8:30 am on the morning of 15 April when she set sail for New York with 703 Titanic passengers aboard. Bisset details the Carpathia's rescue efforts and records his reminiscences of that night in the second book of his autobiographical trilogy, \\"Tramps and Ladies – My Early Years in Steamers\\" (1959). = Teens and 1920s = After his payoff from Carpathia and following additional naval training, Bisset rejoined Cunard's liner Caronia as first officer. He was promoted to lieutenant in the RNR on 16 May 1914, and would serve aboard Caronia during World War I. He was subsequently transferred to Cunard's famous Mauretania as first officer. Following the War, Bisset was appointed chief officer on Cunard's Carmania for two voyages, and subsequently returned to the Cunard cargo service in August 1919 as first officer of the Verbania, a small Cunard tramp steamer. The following May, he was appointed back to the Mauretania as senior first officer, a post he held through July 1921. In November 1921, Bisset joined Cunard's Canadian service as first officer aboard the new liner Albania. Signature of J.G.P. Bissett (Aug. 1930) Bisset was promoted to lieutenant- commander RNR on 16 May 1922. From October 1922 to July 1923 he served as chief officer aboard a charter to Germany of Cunard's Saxonia, and then served briefly on the transatlantic service as chief officer in Cunard's Caronia and Scythia before being recalled for additional naval training. From May 1924 to May 1925 he returned to the Caronia as chief officer on both the Liverpool/Montreal and Liverpool/New York runs. In June 1925 he was named chief officer on the new Cunard Liner Franconia, serving through the following June, and then again from mid-July 1926 to June 1927. He joined the Cunard liner Berengaria as chief officer for the next four years, serving through May 1931. = 1930s = In mid-May 1931, the Cunard Board of Directors conferred upon Bisset the rank of captain in the company's fleet. Through the end of 1932, Bisset rotated through several positions including captain of the Aurania (May–June 1931), staff captain of the Berengaria (June 1931 – December 1932). In December 1932 he was given command of the Ascania, in the Cunard Canadian service, in which he served through December 1936. He retired from the RNR on 15 July 1933 with the rank of captain. In January 1937 he took command of Cunard's Lancastria and in November that same year was transferred to the command of the Scythia through January 1939, when he assumed command of the Laconia. = WWII and later command years = In June 1939, command of the liner Franconia was turned over to Bisset. He remained with her from the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939 into early 1942 when he was appointed to the command of the Queen Mary on 23 February. Through the end of World War II, Bisset would captain both Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth on a total of sixty-six wartime voyages. Including his war service in the Franconia, Bisset steamed 424,563 nautical miles and delivered 447,777 troops to various theaters of conflict from 1939 to 1946. On 28 August 1944, Bisset was named commodore of the Cunard Line by the company's board of directors. In July 1946, Bisset turned 63 thereby attaining the age for compulsory retirement from the Cunard service. On 16 October 1946, he captained the Queen Elizabeth on her maiden voyage in commercial service to New York. On 10 January 1947, Bisset formally handed over command of the Queen Elizabeth and retired from the Cunard Line.  Retirement  Bisset and his wife retired in 1948 to Sydney, Australia where he was well received by the local community and by his own recollection through personal journals gave more than 1,800 talks about his sea career and war service to more than 200,000 Australians. Bisset died on 28 March 1967, aged 83 years, and was interred at Bournemouth, UK.  Personal life  Bisset was married to May Hodgson in London on 28 June 1913. They had one son, Barry, who died following childbirth from the effects of German Measles.

Born in Clydach Vale in the Rhondda, Norris became the Welsh heavyweight champion in December 1925, losing the title in the rematch to Dick Power some three months later. Boxing career Norris's first recorded professional bout was against Wally Buckley at Liverpool Stadium on 2 September 1920. Norris lost the contest in the third round through a disqualification. There are no recorded fights for Norris until February 1922 when he faced fellow Welshman Gipsy Daniels at the Drill Hall in Cardiff. Daniels, a future British heavyweight champion, stopped Norris with a knockout in the third round. Norris fought at least twice more in 1922 and both recorded bouts ended in losses. His first was by points decision against Seaman Powell at Pill Athletic Ground in Newport, then a failed challenge for the Welsh heavyweight title versus Trevor Llewellyn. Although the contest against Llewellyn was scheduled for twenty three-minute rounds, Norris again only lasted to the third round, this time losing by a technical knockout. On 3 May, he was back at the Drill Hall, this time facing and beating Billy Prestage, knocking him out with a right hook. Norris met Llewellyn again on 30 August 1924, though this time not for the title. On this occasion Norris won, when he was given the decision after the match went the full distance. He followed this up with a win three weeks later in Liverpool, knocking out local fighter Ike Ingleton. In November 1924 he met Seaman Powell again, at the Pavilion Theatre in Newport; this time the result was a draw. On Boxing Day 1925 Norris was given a second challenge at the Welsh heavyweight title, this time against Crumlin's Dick Power. Fought at the Palace Theatre in Power's home town, the fifteen-round contest ended in the eleventh when Norris stopped his opponent via technical knockout, giving Norris the title. Although now the Welsh champion, his reign was short-lived after Power was given a rematch on 5 April the next year. The fight was held at Taff Vale Park in Pontypridd, and a record crowd turned out to see the two fighters challenge for the title and a purse of £150. The twenty-round match went the distance and the referee gave the decision, and with it the Welsh heavyweight title, to Power. Although there is little recorded evidence of Norris's professional career in the years directly after he lost his Welsh title, in 1928 he travelled to the United States to take on local fighters, mainly in the state of Ohio. In February 2009, the Massillon Evening Independent recorded that Norris had begun his campaign in the States three months earlier, recording eight-straight knockout wins, all under three rounds. Other recorded bouts in America included four fights in Akron, Ohio, in which Norris beat Pat Irish, but lost to Jack Roberts, Ray Young and Tiny Powell.

It was formed during World War I. 480 soldiers of the XV Corps, who fought on the Galicia front and died, are buried at the Budapest Turkish Memorial Cemetery within the New Public Cemetery () in Budapest, Hungary. Eleven graves are of unknown soldiers.  World War I  = Eastern Front = The XV Corps fought with distinction in several engagements. Their first combat engagement was on September 2, 1916. On September 16/17 the Russians attacked the XV Corps with emphasis on the 61st Regiment, but were forced back and counterattacked by the Ottomans. Ottoman casualties on these two days were 7,000 while Russian casualties totaled 15,000-20,000, which stabilized the XV Corps' section of the front for the next two weeks. On September 30 the Russians launched another attack, but were repulsed again; Turkish casualties were 5,000 while Russian casualties were unknown but presumably much higher (10,000+). On October 5/6 the Russians renewed their offensive with a 13-regiment attack on the southern part of the Ottoman line; they took Cevatbey Hill after heavy losses, but were soon forced back again. Ottoman casualties on those two days were 3,000 compared to 12,000 Russian casualties.Turkey In The First World War: Galicia.Erickson 2001, p. 139-142 November and December 1916 passed without any serious fighting with the Russians. In early November, the tactical situation on the Turkish sector of the front was so favorable that the Germans withdrew their Ledabor detachments. Large-scale Russian attacks occurred throughout December, but the Turks repulsed them without any loss of ground. Turkish casualties were around 3,000 in November and December. Overall losses for 1916 numbered 18,000: 5,000 killed, 10,000 wounded, and 3,000 captured.Erickson 2001, p. 239 Having suffered heavy casualties in September–December 1916, the XV Corps was replenished with fresh troops from Turkey at the start of 1917. The strength of the XV Army Corps rose to 27,031 men with another 5,668 men training in regimental depots by the end of January. The corps was also significantly reinforced with new units which enhanced its fighting efficiency, such as artillery batteries, intelligence and labor detachments, an aircraft company, a balloon detachment, a field bakery company, transportation units and a veterinary hospital. On January 22 successful Turkish commanders and troops were decorated with the German Iron Cross. On 4 February in a show of solidarity, Brigadier General Cevat Paşa paid a visit to Kaiser Wilhelm himself.Erickson 2001, p. 141 On the morning of March 5, 1917, the Russians preluded a three-division attack on a part of the Turkish sector with heavy artillery bombardment. However, the Russians had launched an attack while the XV Corps occupied the very defensible high ground overlooking Zlotalpia River valley and repulsed the Russians. A similar attack was repulsed in April 1917. May passed without further incident, but near the end of June the Russians renewed the offensive. The fighting continued to intensify and on July 1 the Russians attempted to dislodge the Turks with gas shells. By July 11, the fighting had mostly subsided. Russian losses in the June–July offensive were 30,000, while the Turkish losses were reported as 2,550 from June 29 to July 2, 1916 alone.Erickson 2001, p. 142: \\"the XV Corps lost 6 officers; in addition, two hundred and forty-two soldiers were killed, 15 officers and 1,012 soldiers were wounded, and 1,275 men were missing\\". Russian losses in the March and April attacks are unknown. In early August 1917 the Turkish General Staff decided to withdraw the XV Corps from Galicia and redeploy it to Palestine, and by September 26, 1917 the final units of the XV Corps had been transported to Constantinople. By that time, the XV Army Corps had inflicted well over 72,000 casualties on the opposing Russian forces and held their sector of the line against at least five major attacks, while similarly-sized Austro-Hungarian formations folded to similar attacks around the same time even with German back-up. German General Erich von Falkenhayn claimed in his memoirs that the Turks were \\"an uncommonly valuable asset to the Southern Army\\", and allowed the Germans to marshall troops elsewhere in line with their economy of force mission. However, Liman Von Sanders argued that the experienced and well-equipped troops of the XV Corps could've been better used in the Middle Eastern Theater, as in the same year where the XV Corps scored its successes in Galicia, the Ottomans suffered a series of catastrophic defeats against the Russians and British back in their own territory, losing Erzincan in the Caucasus and Gaza in Palestine.Erickson 2001, p. 142 The Ottoman XV Army Corps sustained overall losses of around 25,000 in Galicia. = Order of Battle, April 1915 = In April 1915, the corps was structured as follows:Edward J.

Gaskell (born 2 May 1950) is the previous principal of Queen Mary University of London. He took up his post in October 2009, having previously been the vice-president of research at the University of Manchester. Early life and career He was born in 1950 and educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and the University of Bristol, where he gained a BSc and PhD in chemistry. Gaskell’s career has spanned a number of leading academic and management posts in the UK and the United States. Following a bachelor's degree and a PhD at the University of Bristol, he took up his first research post in 1974 at the University of Glasgow. He then became Head of the Mass Spectrometry Unit at the University of Wales College of Medicine, during which period he spent a sabbatical year at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, USA. He returned to the USA in 1987 to become Professor of Experimental Medicine in the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston and Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and Chemistry at the University of Houston from 1989. He joined UMIST as Professor of Mass Spectrometry in 1993, before becoming Head of Chemistry in 1999 and, following the merger of the two institutions (with which he was closely involved), Associate Vice President for Research in the University of Manchester in 2004, and Vice President for Research in 2006. He joined Queen Mary University of London as Principal in October 2009. Gaskell is also Chair of the Board of the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), and has been elected to serve as Treasurer for Universities UK, the representative organisation for UK universities, from 1 August 2012. Research interests A Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Simon Gaskell sits on a number of advisory boards and panels, and is also on the editorial board of a range of academic journals. He conducted research at the Michael Barber Centre for Mass Spectrometry at the University of Manchester. His work there involved the development and application of state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, with particular applications in the biomedical sciences. In recent years, international efforts have been made to sequence the genomes of many organisms, including man. These studies of an organism’s entire DNA sequence (known as genomics) have in turn led to the development of a similar field of research, called ‘proteomics’. Proteomics is the study of the structure and function of a cell’s entire set of proteins, which orchestrate the chemical reactions that occur within cells. To understand how a cell works, scientists need to know which proteins are present and in what amounts. Gaskell’s research uses various forms of an analytical technique called mass spectrometry to determine the quantity and longevity of these different proteins. Gaskell has recently used these techniques to study a human parasite called Trypanosoma Brucei. It causes sleeping sickness, which affects around 400,000 people each year, predominantly in the developing world. Controversy One of Queen Mary University of London’s strategic aims is to build upon the institution's global research impact as measured by, among other things, ranking in league tables. In 2012, during a reorganisation in The School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, critics claimed that several staff members were dismissed on grounds of redundancy while similar posts were advertised, and the grounds for dismissal were based on a count of the number of papers published, and on the impact factor of the journal in which the papers appeared. These criteria are widely regarded as being poor indicators of the worth of individual scientists. Articles and letters in The Times,The Times, Thunderer column, 30 July 2012 and in Times Higher Education,Times Higher Education, 9 August 2012 and on blogs discussed the claims.Is Queen Mary University of London trying to commit scientific suicide?

Depending on the way expectations are formed in the private sector of the economy, there may or may not be a transitory income increase. The term may also refer to the practice of a public debt-ridden nation enacting policies which encourage inflation in the medium/long term.  Explanations  The Barro–Gordon model shows how the ability of government to manipulate leads to inflationary bias. In this model, it is assumed that a nation will attempt to keep the unemployment rate below its natural level. This will create an inflation in wages above their natural level, which ultimately results in an overall rate of inflation that is higher than the natural rate of inflation. Thus, the main reason of the inflationary bias would be the time inconsistency. This is what Kydland and Prescott wrote in Rules rather than discretion : The inconsistency of optimal plans, in 1977: «Optimal control theory is an appropriate planning device for situations in which current outcomes and the movement of the system's state depend only upon current and past policy decisions and upon the current state. But, we argue, this is unlikely to be the case for dynamic economic systems. Current decisions of economic agents depend in part upon their expectations of future policy actions. Only if these expectations were invariant to the future policy plan selected would optimal control theory be appropriate way policy will be selected in the future». The meaning behind this quote is the following : In a dynamic model, the economic agents' current decisions generally depend not only on the present situation but also on how they anticipate future political actions. As a result, a series of time-bound discretionary policies (a set of policies that are optimal for each period, taking into account the information available), will not be optimal, because it will not take into account all the data of the problem, in particular the effect of the anticipations of the agents on the current situation. In the case of discretionary monetary policy, this leads to the impossibility for the government to reach the socially optimal rate of inflation for society, unless it makes a commitment to maintain permanently this socially optimal inflation, without seeking to use inflation to revive activity and that this commitment is credible. But because when the inflation rate is low, the marginal cost of an increase in inflation is low, it appears beneficial for governments to conduct an inflationary monetary policy, because they would expect that it would increase production (even though it will likely not, since the economic agents can anticipate this inflation increase). So following these theories and assuming the central bank is always better off a higher level of output, the central bank would always have an incentive to cheat and set a higher inflation rate while committing to set a lower one. So it would not be expectable that a government make the commitment which would maintain the socially optimal inflation. It can be summarized by saying that the bank central expected utility is higher while cheating (acting with discretion while people expect it to commit). Thus, traditional theories suggest that inflationary bias will exist when monetary and fiscal policy is discretionary rather than rule based, because in the hands of a government, a central bank would have an incentive to deviate from the rule by increasing inflation to increase the GDP. Others have suggested that the inflationary bias exists even when policy makers do not have the goal of a lower than natural rate of employment, and their policies are based on rules.  Prevention  Because of the dangers of inflationary bias, several measures have been suggested to prevent it. Kenneth Rogoff proposed that states should have conservative central bankers,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/51_qje85.pdf, whilst others have suggested that states should create inflationary goals, and if this inflation rate is exceeded, there should be some form of punishment for the central banker.. These prevention measures can be seen through the implementation of ruled monetary policies, or through more flexible but credible commitments, possibly achieved by the independence of the central bank. One of the problems underlying the inflationary bias is the political influences when a monetary policy is discretionary. Indeed, the incentive to cheat expresses a political strategy to push up GDP. Thus, a solution to this bias would be to delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank. Theoretically, an independent central bank would have little incentive to cheat, more credibility in its commitment and then would lead to a lower inflation level and act like a guardian of price stability. For example, the European central bank and the Fed are independent central banks. This negative correlation between independence of central bank and inflation has first been proved by the economists Alena and Summers in 1993. Aside from the independence of the central bank, credibility of monetary policies can be achieved through contracts, conservatism and reputation system. Moreover, as an opposition to discretionary policy leading to inflationary bias, rule-based monetary policies are another (less flexible) suggestion to prevent this bias. This is notably advocated by Milton Friedman. His suggestion is to fixe a monetary supply growth target suitable with the natural level of output, in order to guarantee growth stability in the long run: if growth exceeds its structural potential rate, the money supply becomes insufficient and interest rates rise, which curbs growth and prevents inflationary overheating. Conversely, a fall in rates would support activity if growth were below its long-term potential. But a critical to this solution is that it would at the same time take away the possibility of responding to demand shocks. But other variables can also be targeted to face time inconsistency : natural GDP growth, inflation directly... A well-known rule-based monetary policy is the Taylor-rule, correlating the response of the central bank in terms of interest rate to inflation and production variations, following an equation with fixed parameters.  Criticism  Several arguments have been advanced critiquing the concept of inflationary bias on different grounds by economists. For example, Alex Cukierman and Stefan Gerlach argue that inflationary bias is true provided the assumption that central bank policymakers aim for higher employment above its natural level. However, while this may have been true before 1985 when central bank policy sought to increase employment, after many central banks became more independent in the 1990s, Cukierman and Gerlach's results demonstrated that when central banks are more sensitive to policy errors, the view that central banks hold an inflationary bias is less true. Others have suggested that an inflationary bias exists because of factors unrelated to central bank policy or time inconsistency. Helder Ferreira de Mendonça argued that in the developing world, when countries devalue their currencies when running into problems with the balance of payments equilibrium, an inflationary bias is the result. Gustavo Piga attributed inflationary bias due to lobbying pressures of outside constituencies interested in maintaining employment levels. Thus, in the face of supply shocks, these groups lobby for expansive monetary policy to avoid Hysteresis_(economics). As a solution, Piga proposes to enhance atomistic labor markets and decrease trade-unions' capacity to organize, but says this may also generate increased output instability. Inflationary bias has also received criticism from members of the Post-Keynesian school. Jörg Bibow argues, in response for the desire for conservativeness of independent central bankers, that the \\"opposite Post Keynesian concern is that an independent central bank might misuse its powers to effectively condemn the economy to being stuck in a less-than-full employment equilibrium permanently.\\" He cites the central bank independence of the European Central Bank and the Euro area crisis as an example where over-reliance on combating inflation may be both detrimental to efficiency and in conflict with democratic principles. Fernando Cardim De Carvalho revisited the idea of central bank independence touted by Kenneth Rogoff. Since Keynesian monetary theory relies on the non-neutrality of money, \\"once one rejects the natural rate hypothesis, the proposal of independence of the central bank to set its own goals and to pursue them as it feels fit makes no sense.\\" Thus, he argues that the idea of an independent central bank relies on a peculiar set of very restrictive assumptions.

In the English language, inflectional affixes include third person -s, verbal -ed and -ing, plural -s, possessive -s, comparative -er and superlative -est. Derivational affixes include -able, -er, -ish, -less, -ly, -ness, -th, -y, non-, un-, -al, -ation, -ess, -ful, -ism, -ist, -ity, -ize/-ise, -ment, in-. The idea is that a base word and its inflected forms support the same core meaning, and can be considered learned words if a learner knows both the base word and the affix. Bauer and Nation proposed seven levels of affixes based on their frequency in English. It has been shown that word families can assist with deriving related words via affixes, along with decreasing the time needed to derive and recognize such words.  Effects on learning  There are several studies that suggest that knowledge of root words and their derivatives can assist with learning or even deducing the meaning of other members of a word family. A study from Carlisle and Katz (2006) comparing separate English word families varying in size, frequency, and affirmation and negation suggests that “accuracy of reading derived words by 4th and 6th graders is related to measures of familiarity, ... base word frequencies, family size, average family frequency, and word length”. It was found that families that were either larger or more frequent (i.e. word families that had more words or were more common) were more quickly read. Nagy et al. (1989) found that morphologically related families had an increase of reaction time of up to 7 ms compared to those without a morphological relation. Nagy et al. (1993) summarizes how knowledge of the meanings of common English suffixes underwent significant development between fourth grade and high school. = Studies on non-native speakers = There have also been studies on non-native English speakers and learners on their knowledge and understanding of word families. A study of nonnative-English-speaking college students showed that non-native English speakers knew at least some of the four word forms studied (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs). Out of these four, word families derived from nouns and verbs were found to be the most well-known. Results showed that in regards to these word forms, ESL students knew the least, MA- ELT (English Language Teaching) students knew more, and native speakers knew the most. In addition, a study of Japanese students learning English showed poor knowledge of the affixes studied, showing a division between their knowledge of a word's meaning and a derivative form of a separate word (e.g. stimulate versus similar, disclose and far). To conclude their study, Schmitt and Zimmerman have provided the following for those teaching word families as a guideline: * Introduce derivatives along with their roots. * Teach more affixes. * Emphasize adverbs, adjectives, and their derivatives. * Suggest reading that includes these word families.

According to Wooldridge's definition, a deliberative agent is \\"one that possesses an explicitly represented, symbolic model of the world, and in which decisions (for example about what actions to perform) are made via symbolic reasoning\\". Compared to reactive agents, which are able to reach their goal only by reacting reflexively on external stimuli, a deliberative agent's internal processes are more complex. The difference lies in fact, that deliberative agent maintains a symbolic representation of the world it inhabits. In other words, it possesses internal image of the external environment and is thus capable to plan its actions. Most commonly used architecture for implementing such behavior is Belief-Desire-Intention software model (BDI), where an agent's beliefs about the world (its image of a world), desires (goal) and intentions are internally represented and practical reasoning is applied to decide, which action to select. There has been considerable research focused on integrating both reactive and deliberative agent strategies resulting in developing a compound called hybrid agent, which combines extensive manipulation with nontrivial symbolic structures and reflexive reactive responses to the external events.  How do deliberative agents work?  It has already been mentioned, that deliberative agents possess a) inherent image of an outer world and b) goal to achieve and is thus able to produce a list of actions (plan) to reach the goal. In unfavorable conditions, when the plan is no more applicable, agent is usually able to recompute it. The process of plan computing (or recomputing) is as follows: * a sensory input is received by the belief revision function and agent's beliefs are altered * option generation function evaluates altered beliefs and intentions and creates the options available to the agent. Agent's desires are constituted. * filter function then considers current beliefs, desires and intentions and produces new intentions * action selection function then receives intentions filter function and decides what action to perform The deliberative agent requires symbolic representation with compositional semantics (e. g. data tree) in all major functions, for its deliberation is not limited to present facts, but construes hypotheses about possible future states and potentially also holds information about past (i.e. memory). These hypothetic states involve goals, plans, partial solutions, hypothetical states of the agent's beliefs, etc. It is evident, that deliberative process may become considerably complex and hardware killing.  History of a concept  Since the early 1970, the AI planning community has been involved in developing artificial planning agent (a predecessor of a deliberative agent), which would be able to choose a proper plan leading to a specified goal. These early attempts resulted in constructing simple planning system called STRIPS. It soon became obvious that STRIPS concept needed further improvement, for it was unable to effectively solve problems of even moderate complexity. In spite of considerable effort to raise the efficiency (for example by implementing hierarchical and non-linear planning), the system remained somewhat weak while working with any time-constrained system. More successful attempts have been made in late 1980s to design planning agents. For example, the IPEM (Integrated Planning, Execution and Monitoring system) had a sophisticated non-linear planner embedded. Further, Wood's AUTODRIVE simulated a behavior of deliberative agents in a traffic and Cohen's PHOENIX system was construed to simulate a forest fire management. In 1976, Simon and Newell formulated the Physical Symbol System hypothesis, which claims, that both human and artificial intelligence have the same principle - symbol representation and manipulation. According to the hypothesis it follows, that there is no substantial difference between human and machine in intelligence, but just quantitative and structural - machines are much less complex. Such a provocative proposition must have become the object of serious criticism and raised a wide discussion, but the problem itself still remains unsolved in its merit until these days. Further development of classical symbolic AI proved not to be dependent on final verifying the Physical Symbol System hypothesis at all. In 1988, Bratman, Israel and Pollack introduced Intelligent Resource- bounded Machine Architecture (IRMA), the first system implementing the Belief- Desire-Intention software model (BDI). IRMA exemplifies the standard idea of deliberative agent as it is known today: a software agent embedding the symbolic representation and implementing the BDI.  Efficiency of deliberative agents compared to reactive ones Above-mentioned troubles with symbolic AI have led to serious doubts about the viability of such a concept, which resulted in developing a reactive architecture, which is based on wholly different principles. Developers of the new architecture have rejected using symbolic representation and manipulation as a base of any artificial intelligence. Reactive agents achieve their goals simply through reactions on changing environment, which implies reasonable computational modesty. Even though deliberative agents consume much more system resources than their reactive colleagues, their results are significantly better just in few special situations, whereas it is usually possible to replace one deliberative agent with few reactive ones in many cases, without losing a substantial deal of the simulation result's adequacy. It seems that classical deliberative agents may be usable especially where correct action is required, for their ability to produce optimal, domain-independent solution. Deliberative agent often fails in changing environment, for it is unable to re-plan its actions quickly enough.

Color pockets are also available. They protect paper documents from tears, water, food, stains, and fingerprints, and partially prevent such documents from being crumpled. Punched pockets have several holes in the left edge, which allow them to be bound into a file, or a three-ring binder. The holes in the punched pockets dispose of the difficulty of making holes in a paper document. The most commonly used material for punched pockets is polypropylene. However, there are some punched pockets made of polyethylene, cellophane, or other plastics. These may include recycled and biodegradable plastics (as defined by ASTM D5511) as well as plastics with antimicrobial additives. The clarity of the plastic will vary with the thickness of the pocket due to the semicrystalline nature of the polymers and Light scattering by particles. Typically, biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) is used to improve clarity of punched pockets. Using the customary unit of plastic thickness, the mil, punched pockets are produced in various thicknesses for different uses, and may or may not cover both sides of the document completely. The thinnest pockets may be less than 2 mil, while the thickest are over 4 mil.

Depending on the location of the opening, punched pockets may be top-loading or side-loading which dictates how the document is inserted into the pocket. Some pockets may only be sealed on two of the four sides, allowing for more convenient insertion or removal of their contents. Usage An open file which can be used with punched pockets. A punched pocket can contain only a small number of paper sheets. Often there is only one sheet per pocket. Sometimes a punched pocket contains two sheets, each with one-sided text outward.

Biography  Smith studied medicine in his native Dublin and he was apprenticed to Richard Carmichael, and he studied professionally in the RCSI Medical School, Trinity College, the Richmond Hospital Schools, and in the House of Industry Hospitals. Smith received his Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1832. He was awarded his MD from Trinity College, Dublin in 1842, and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1844. He became the first Professor of Surgery at Trinity College in 1847,History of surgery at Trinity College, Dublin and a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1849. He worked as surgeon to the Hospital for the Mentally Ill, Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and he taught surgery and forensic medicine at the Richmond Hospital. He co-founded the Dublin Pathological Society in 1838 with Abraham Colles, Sir Dominic Corrigan and William Stokes. Robert Smith published on a wide variety of subjects, particularly the pathology of surgical diseases, congenital joint dislocations and neuroma. Cameron in his History of the RCSI claims that Smith was one of the most distinguished anatomists and surgeons of his time. In his 1847 book A Treatise on Fractures in the Vicinity of Joints and on Certain Forms of Accidental and Congenital Dislocations he corrected Colles's description of the Colles' fracture, stating that :\\"The situation of the fracture is not so high as Mr. Colles states it to be; I have never seen it more than an inch above the carpal end of the bone; in the majority of cases it is not so much\\". Smith also described his own eponymous fracture in the same chapter. In his Treatise on the Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment of Neuroma he described neurofibromatosis 33 years before von Recklinghausen. Robert William Smith died on 28 October 1873.

Through a Mexican subsidiary company, they also own the Cerro San Pedro gold-silver mine in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, which ceased operation in 2017. While New Gold was founded in 1980 for the purposes of mineral exploration, the company became a mine operator with its merger of Peak Gold and Metallica Resources in 2008. A fourth company, Western Goldfields, joined in 2009. Together they operated the Peak mine in Australia and Mesquite Mine in California but sold both in 2018. Headquartered in Toronto, shares of the company are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE American. Operating mines As of 2020, New Gold operates two mines: *New Afton - The New Afton gold-silver-copper mine is an underground (block cave) mine located within the footprint of the Afton mine, 10 km west of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. That original Afton mine was an open pit mine that was operated by Teck Corporation (later Teck Cominco) between 1977 and 1997. In targeting a specific mineral deposit, New Gold constructed underground tunnels, along with a new concentrator and tailings facility. They achieved commercial production in July 2012 at which time the mine had an expected 12 year life. Between 2013 and 2019 the mine produced between 69,000 and 105,000 ounces of gold each year. *Rainy River - The Rainy River mine is a gold-silver mine located within the Rainy River District in western Ontario, Canada. New Gold acquired mineral rights to the area in 2013 and immediately pursued its development so that it was able to achieve commercial production in late-2017. It is designed to be an open pit mine that would transition to underground tunnels over its 14 year life. It quickly became their best producing mine with 227,000 ounces of gold produced in 2018 and 253,000 ounces in 2019. Corporate history New Gold Inc was the result of a merger in July 2008 of three companies (New Gold, Peak Gold, Metallica Resources) in various stages of developing and operating gold mines in North and South America and in Australia. Individually, the three were junior mining companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange with Peak Gold listed solely on the TSX Venture Exchange, and the other two interlisted on the American Stock Exchange. Combined, they formed a $1.6 billion mid-tier mining company with 3.2 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves. Though it was the smallest of the three, New Gold became the parent company with Metallica Resources and Peak Gold becoming subsidiaries. Shareholders of Metallica Resources were given a 45.7% stake in New Gold with and Peak Gold shareholders being given 37.8% and the remaining 16.5% share going to the old New Gold shareholders. A year later, Western Goldfields Inc was added in an all-stock deal which gave Western Goldfields shareholders a 42% stake of the new company. =Original companies= The original New Gold brought with it its developing New Afton mine near Kamloops, British Columbia. The company had been founded in 1980 as DRC Resources Corporation, headquartered in Vancouver, to investigate previously explored mineral properties in Canada for their exploitation potential. One of these properties, acquired in 1999, was the Afton Mine which had produced gold and copper from 1977 to 1988. In 2005, the company sold its other assets to pursue the Afton project as it had emerged as a viable prospect for profitably developing, and they changed their name to New Gold Inc. Peak Gold Ltd. contributed two operating gold mines to the new company: the Peak Mine in Australia and Amapari Mine in Brazil. Goldcorp had inherited those mines, along with others, when it merged with Wheaton River Minerals in 2005 and used GPJ Ventures Ltd, which was under the administration of Endeavour Financial, to spin off the two underperforming mines. Goldcorp retained a 22% interest in Peak Gold and was paid US$200 million in the April 2007 deal. Metallica Resources entered the merger as it was beginning to operate the Cerro San Pedro mine which had just produced to date 39,000 ounces of gold of its 1,500,000 ounces of proven and probable reserves. Metallica had acquired the property in 1995 for exploration purposes but they had struggled through its development phase in resolving environmental impacts and navigating the Mexican legal system to have its permits enforced. Metallica also added its El Morro project, which was undergoing feasibility studies, in Chile to the new company. =Divestments and further acquisitions= Peak Gold's CEO Bob Gallagher was the first CEO of the new company. They immediately closed the Amapari Mine in Brazil and then sold it, in 2010, to Australian mining company Beadell Resources. Meanwhile, in May 2009, Western Goldfields Ltd merged with New Gold, making its Mesquite Mine New Golds's third operating mine. Similar to the other original companies, Western Goldfields was interlisted on the American and Toronto stock exchanges and was transitioning to become an operating gold producer. The American company, which had moved its headquarters to Toronto in 2006, had acquired the old Mesquite Mine in Imperial County, California in 2003. While mining at Mesquite had ceased in 2001, the company pursued reactivation with an improved mine plan and achieved commercial production in January 2008 and produced a total of 108,325 ounces of gold in that year. New Gold had produced 233,103 ounces of gold in 2008 from the Cerro San Pedro and Peak mines, followed by 301,773 ounces in 2009 as the Mesquite mine was added, then 382,911 ounces in 2010 and 387,155 ounces in 2011. In that same timeframe, New Gold also produced between 1.1 and 2.1 million ounces of silver each year from the Cerro San Pedro mine and between 8 and 15 million pounds of copper annually from the Peak Mine. Throughout 2011 New Gold acquired three TSX Venture Exchange-listed mineral exploration companies: Richfield Ventures Corp., Silver Quest Resources Ltd., and Geo Minerals Ltd. All three had exploration rights in the Blackwater area, west of Quesnel, British Columbia, and New Gold would pursue it as a development project. Likewise, in 2013 New Gold took over TSX-listed Rainy River Resources Ltd., as well as Bayfield Ventures Corp. in 2014, for their rights in the Rainy River area in northwestern Ontario. Meanwhile, New Gold had successfully developed and achieved commercial production, in June 2012, at its New Afton mine. From 2012 to 2016, New Gold operated four mines. They produced 411,892 ounces of gold in 2012, then as the Cerro San Pedro mine passed its peak production and New Afton rose, 397,688 ounces in 2013; 380,135 ounces in 2014; 435,718 ounces in 2015; and 381,663 ounces in 2016. During that same timeframe, New Gold also produced between 1.3 and 1.9 million ounces of silver each year mostly from the Cerro San Pedro mine and between 42 and 102 million pounds of copper annually from the New Afton and Peak mines. Following the retirement of Chief Executive Officer Bob Gallagher in June 2016, President Randall Oliphant also acted as CEO until Vice President Hannes Portmann took over those roles in 2017, followed by Raymond Threlkeld (who was formerly the CEO of both Western Goldfields and then of Rainy River Resources) in 2018. Finally, in September 2018, Renaud Adams was hired to be the permanent President/CEO. In those few years, they sold their 30% stake in the El Morro project in Chile to Goldcorp for $90 million plus 4% of its future gold production,, the Cerro San Pedro deposit had been depleted, the Rainy River achieved commercial production, and they sold the Peak Mine project to Australian mining company Aurelia Metals Limited for $58 million. Under Adams, they completed the sale of Mesquite Mine to Equinox Gold Corp. for $158 million and the sale of a 46% interest in the New Afton mine to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for $300 million cash. While the company produced 430,864 ounces in 2017, plus 1.2 million ounces of silver and 104 million pounds of copper, by 2018 they had been reduced to only two operating mines (Rainy River and New Afton) which combined to produce 315,483 ounces of gold and 85 million pounds of copper, followed by 486,141 ounces gold and 79 million pounds copper in 2019. While the company completed its environmental assessment phase of their Blackwater gold-silver project in central British Columbia, they sold the development project to TSX Venture Exchange-listed Artemis Gold for C$190-million in cash, an 8% stream on future production, and shares in Artemis Gold. In September 2020, New Gold was added to the S&P;/TSX Composite Index. =Past mines= *Cerro San Pedro - Located near the village of Cerro de San Pedro in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí, the Cerro San Pedro gold-silver project was operated by New Gold's Mexican subsidiary Minera San Xavier S.A. de C.V. The mine opened in 2007 with an expected 10 mine life. While it was a locally unpopular project due to impacts on water resources and heritage sites, New Gold continued its operations, having produced between 100,000 and 140,000 ounces of gold annually until it began winding down operations in 2016 and closing completely in 2017. *Peak Mine - New Gold inherited from Peak Gold, the operation of the high-grade Peak gold-copper- lead mine near Cobar, New South Wales, Australia. New Gold produced 95,000 ounces of gold from the mine each year until it was sold in 2018. *Mesquite Mine - Located in Imperial County, California near the Algodones Dunes, the Mesquite gold mine was operated by New Gold through its Western Goldfields subsidiary between 2009 and 2018 when it sold. Despite the low-grade of the mineral deposit, the mine produced between 107,000 and 170,000 ounces of gold each year.

The purpose of the initiative is to improve taxpayer compliance and service by setting professional standards for and providing support to the tax preparation industry. Starting January 1, 2011 and, until the program was suspended in January 2013, the initiative required all paid federal tax return preparers to register with the IRS and to obtain an identification number, called a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). The multi-year phase-in effort called for certain paid tax return preparers to pass a competency test and to take annual continuing education courses. The ethics provisions found in Treasury Department's Circular 230 were extended to all paid tax return preparers. Preparers who have their PTINs, pass the test and complete education credits were to have a new designation: Registered Tax Return Preparer.IRS News Release, IR-2010-1, Jan. 4, 2010, IRS Proposes New Registration, Testing and Continuing Education Requirements for Tax Return Preparers Not Already Subject to Oversight \\"I believe it is one of the most important initiatives and defining actions that the IRS has taken in recent years in improving both compliance and our ability to deliver better service to taxpayers; in this case, helping them to file accurate returns from the get-go and avoid potentially time-consuming problems later on,\\" said IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman.IRS News Release, IR-2010-107, Oct. 26, 2010, Commissioner of Internal Revenue Douglas H. Shulman's Keynote Speech Before the AICPA Fall Tax Meeting In January 2013, however, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was suspending the program because of a ruling on January 18, 2013, by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As a result of a lawsuit, the Court issued an order prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the regulatory requirements for registered tax return preparers. In accordance with this order, tax return preparers covered by this program are not currently required to register with the IRS. The IRS announced that because of the Court's ruling, tax return preparers are not required to complete the competency testing or to secure the continuing education that had been required.IRS Announcement, Jan. 22, 2013, at .

The IRS failed in its effort to obtain a stay of the ruling, which was then affirmed (upheld) in February 2014 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Loving v. IRS (D.C.Cir., 2/11/14) .  Initiative Background  Prior to the IRS Return Preparer Initiative, anyone could enter the tax return business. The lack of training or minimum qualifications for paid federal tax return preparers resulted in concerns that some ill-equipped tax preparers were making numerous errors costly to taxpayers and to the United States Treasury. Income tax laws in the United States are complex and change nearly every year. United States Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson, in her 2002 annual report to Congress, suggested legislation to register and regulate paid tax preparers. In 2006, the GAO testified that the agency secretly visited 19 different paid tax preparers. The agency found that all 19 tax returns were wrong to some degree and that only two preparers correctly calculated the proper refund amount. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) followed up with a review of how Oregon and California, the only states to regulate tax preparers, addressed the issue. On June 4, 2009, Commissioner Douglas Shulman announced that the IRS would conduct a thorough review of the issues related to regulating paid tax return preparers.IRS News Release, IR-2009-57, June 4, 2009, IRS Launches Tax Return Preparer Review; Recommendations to Improve Compliance Expected by Year End  Return preparer review  On January 4, 2010, IRS Commissioner Shulman announced the results of a six-month study that included public hearings with consumer advocates, other government agencies and tax professionals. The Return Preparer Review Final Report (IRS Publication 4832) outlined the increasing importance of the tax preparation industry as tax law becomes more complex and taxpayers seek help in preparing accurate tax returns. As of 2008, eighty percent of taxpayers were seeking third party assistance, either from tax preparers or tax software, to prepare and file their federal tax returns. The report found that the number of paid tax return preparers was difficult to determine, ranging anywhere from 900,000 to 1.2 million people. \\"There is general agreement that tax return preparers and the associated industry play a pivotal role in our system of tax administration and they must be a part of any strategy to strengthen the integrity of the tax system. And, more directly, the American public overwhelmingly supports efforts to increase the oversight of paid tax return preparers,\\" the report concluded. The report recommended a new Return Preparer Initiative related to registration, testing, continuing education and ethics.IRS.gov, Return Preparer Review, Publication 4832 The publication contains a comprehensive overview of the 2009 IRS study and outlines eight categories of recommendations. However, some recommendations are being implemented differently than originally proposed. Official IRS regulations, not the Return Preparer Review, provide the final guidance for implementing the recommendations.  PTIN registration  The first significant step was the registration of all paid tax preparers. Starting January 1, 2011, anyone who for compensation prepares or helps prepare all or substantially all of any federal tax return or claim for refund was required to register with the IRS. He or she was required to obtain and use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) on returns he or she prepared and signed. Previously, use of the PTIN on tax returns was optional. On September 28, 2010, the IRS launched a new PTIN sign-up system that required preparers to create online accounts, complete the PTIN application, pay a $64.25 fee and obtain a PTIN. There also was a new PTIN paper application, Form W-12. The online PTIN account also could be used to schedule a date and time for the competency test and, eventually, to track continuing education credit hours.IRS.gov, www.irs.gov/ptin Preparers were required to renew their PTINs annually. The PTIN was valid for a calendar year, expiring each December 31. The renewal period begins in mid-October each year. The renewal fee is $63. Through the registration process, the IRS also planned to create a searchable data-base that would allow taxpayers to determine whether the preparer is compliant with IRS requirements or to find a compliant preparer within the taxpayer's zip code area. Until the registration process, the IRS did not have reliable data on the number of tax preparers nationwide. In the first year, more than 840,000 preparers registered for a PTIN. For 2012, there were 715,000 preparers with valid PTINs. IRS.gov, New Return Preparer Regulations - Overview  Registered Tax Return Preparer Competency test  Starting November 2011, the IRS launched a new competency test that, until the program was suspended in 2013, certain preparers were required to take and pass. Preparers who are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), attorneys and Enrolled Agents were exempt from this test because they have other exam requirements. Also exempt were supervised preparers - those who do not sign returns, who work for a firm owned by and are supervised by a CPA, attorney or enrolled agent - and preparers who prepare no individual tax returns. This left approximately 340,000 preparers who were required to pass the test and to become Registered Tax Return Preparers. The test was a timed, two and a half hour test that was required to be taken at one of the 260 testing centers operated by test vendor Prometric, Inc. The exam covered the Form 1040 series and its schedules. There were 120 questions. Most were multiple choice. Questions on ethics were in true or false format. The test fee was $116. Preparers were to be notified immediately if they passed the test but were not informed of their test scores. The IRS and Prometric created a Candidate Information Bulletin, a test tutorial, a video about what to expect on test day, and a list of testing center locations, as well as a list of study materials. These study materials were to change each April. Test takers were to have access to some electronic materials, such as Publication 17, while taking the test. The IRS was not to provide test preparation courses. However, for 2012 and 2013, test preparation courses taken from an approved IRS vendor were to count toward continuing education course requirements. The IRS also issued Fact Sheet 2011-12 to explain the test.  Continuing education  Until the program was suspended, preparers with a testing requirement were also to have a requirement to complete 15 hours of continuing education credits each year. The credits were to include 10 hours of general federal tax law topics, 3 hours of federal tax law updates and 2 hours of ethics. CPAs, attorneys and enrolled agents, who are in good standing with their professional organization, were exempt from this provision because of their pre-existing education professional requirements. Supervised preparers and non-1040 preparers were also exempt. Preparers were required to take courses from only those providers approved by the IRS. Preparers were required to review the offerings to determine what courses suit their situations. Providers were to issue certificates of completion to preparers and to report completions to the IRS based on the preparers' PTINs. Preparers were required to retain details about their course work in their records for at least four years. Eventually, preparers were to be able to use their online PTIN accounts to keep track of their credit hours.  Ethics  Prior to the Return Preparer Initiative, standard ethical guidelines did not apply to some federal return preparers. The initiative extended the ethical provisions set out by Treasury's Circular 230 to all paid federal tax return preparers.  Registered Tax Return Preparers  Preparers who passed the Registered Tax Return Preparer test and who passed an IRS-run tax compliance check were to be given a new title: Registered Tax Return Preparer. After 2013, only Registered Tax Return Preparers, Enrolled Agents, Certified Public Accountants or attorneys were to be able to legally prepare federal tax returns for individuals for compensation.  Electronic filing requirement  In November 2009, Congress adopted a provision that required federal tax return preparers to use IRS e-file to submit returns. Beginning in 2012, if a preparer expected to prepare and file eleven or more individual tax returns, he or she was expected to electronically file the returns.IRS.gov, Many Tax Return Preparers Required to Use IRS e-file Beginning in 2011 In order to e-file, a preparer must become an Authorized IRS e-file Provider. Preparers were to be able to use IRS e-services to submit an application.IRS.gov, Become an Authorized e-file Provider  Return Preparer Office  In October 2010 speech, IRS Commissioner Shulman announced the creation of a Return Preparer Office. The Return Preparer Office was to be responsible for implementing the new requirements and for oversight of the IRS return preparer program. The Office was to work in partnership with the Office of Professional Responsibility, which is responsible for the enforcement of Circular 230 conduct issues.  U.S. Treasury regulations  In order to implement the Return Preparer Initiative, the IRS and the Treasury Department have issued a series of proposed and final regulations and guidance documents. Those items are compiled on a New Return Preparer Regulations page. Suspension of the program In January 2013, the IRS issued the following announcement: ::As of Friday, Jan. 18, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has enjoined the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the regulatory requirements for registered tax return preparers. In accordance with this order, tax return preparers covered by this program are not currently required to register with the IRS, to complete competency testing or secure continuing education. The ruling does not affect the regulatory practice requirements for CPAs, attorneys, enrolled agents, enrolled retirement plan agents or enrolled actuaries. ::The Internal Revenue Service, working with the Department of Justice, continues to have confidence in the scope of its authority to administer this program. On Wednesday, Jan. 24, the IRS and Justice Department asked for the injunction to be lifted. Regardless of the outcome of that request, an appeal is planned within the next 30 days. ::The IRS is continuing to evaluate the scope of the court's order in determining consistent next steps......IRS Statement on Court Ruling Related to Return Preparers, Jan. 2013, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at . The court decision which triggered the suspension of the program was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in February 2014. Loving v. IRS (D.C.Cir. 2/11/14) .

Equally surprising was that the genes were also silenced when the worms ingested the dsRNA. Steven Whyard, working for CSIRO Entomology at that time, then also tried it with insects. To his surprise, this also worked, and they just invented something that had huge implications. They then patented the technology and by 2006, it was used in pesticides. Two articles were then also published that confirmed that the effect was powerful enough to protect plants from pests.  Examples  * Monsanto and Devgen developed a gene silencing pesticide against Diabrotica virgifera * A team, led by Xiao-Ya Chen fed gossypol with dsRNA targeting the gene for cytochrome P450 to bollworm larvae to kill them off * Devgen has developed a gene silencing pesticide against the Colorado beetle  Application  Besides directly killing the pests by poisoning the food of insects with RNAi, there are also other ways on how gene silencing pesticides can kill a pest. For example, a research study by Michael Scharf found that it was possible to eradicate termites by using RNAi which disables the Hex-2-gene; this transforms worker termites into soldier termites. A colony with too many soldier termites (apparently more than about 10%) does not have enough remaining worker termites to adequately feed the colony.

It started initially as a \\"Summer Festival\\", but now its activities are spread from January to May, with a peak in late summer and early autumn. Homepage Festival History  The Festival of Flanders has its roots in Tongeren, Limburg, where Jan Briers organized the Basilica-concerts from 1958 in the basilica of Tongeren. At first there was played religiously inspired choral music, but soon it was extended to other classical music, instrumental music; and other locations. Often, historical sites such as abbeys and castles are used, with an occasional transfer to Maastricht. As in other Flemish cities (classical) summer concerts were held as well, they joined forces in 1972 and created the more comprehensive 'Festival of Flanders'. The organization was actively supported by the newly emancipated Flemish \\"cultural autonomy\\". Especially in Brussels they wanted to exhibit \\"serious\\" Flemish culture.

Scotland, being in the British Isles, is ideal for tree growth, thanks to its mild winters, plentiful rainfall, fertile soil and hill-sheltered topography.. As of 2019 approximately 18.5% of the country was wooded. Although this figure is well below the European Union (EU) average of 43% it represents a significant increase compared to the figure of 100 years previously: in 1919 (at the end of the Great War) Scotland's forest cover was estimated to be only 5% of the country's total land area.Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 7. Approximately 4,700 km2 of Scotland's forests and woodlands are publicly owned by the Scottish Government via Forestry and Land Scotland, and are termed the National Forest Estate.Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 13. As of 2015, forestry contributed almost £1 billion to the Scottish economy, and the industry employed over 25,000 people.Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 9. Historical background Caledonian Forest in Glen Affric. Throughout most of Scottish history, people have most commonly created farmland at the expense of forest. Furthermore, variations in the Holocene climate have led to significant changes in the ranges of many species. This makes it complex to estimate the likely extent of natural forest cover. Prior to human intervention it is likely that Scotland's woodlands consisted chiefly of Scots pine and birch in the north and east, with Atlantic oakwoods in the warmer and wetter areas to the south and west. The Caledonian Forest is the name given to the former (ancient old-growth) temperate rainforest of Scotland. The Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BC. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC, after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) led to a continued reduction in the amount of forest. In the 18th century, during the early stages of the industrial revolution, wood was vital for many industries, in particular the smelting of iron. Oak was especially favoured for this use, being processed into the charcoal used in blast furnaces. To provide the wood required for charcoal woodlands were managed using a technique known as coppicing, which involved repeatedly harvesting branches from trees, each time cutting them down to ground level and allowing new shoots to grow. The preserved Bonawe Iron Furnace provides a particularly prominent example of an 18th century highland iron smelting site, whilst the nearby forest at Glen Nant was one of many woods across Argyll that supplied the oak required: now a national nature reserve, Glen Nant provides a good example of woodland managed by coppicing. The United Kingdom's supply of timber was severely depleted during the Great War, when imports were difficult. The Forestry Commission was established in 1919 year to ensure Britain retained a strategic reserve of timber.Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 5. The Commission's board was initially made up of eight forestry commissioners and was chaired by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat from 1919 to 1927. Lovat had extensive land holdings in Scotland, and it was in the Highlands that he and other Scottish landowners such as Sir John Stirling-Maxwell conceived of the scheme of land-settlement allied to forestry. As first chairman of the Commission Lovat was able to put into practice his ‘long cherished dream’ of repopulating hill country, thanks to his good contacts in government. The scheme accordingly went ahead and created smallholdings in the new forests, of approximately ten acres, let for £15 a year. Originally 150 days work was provided in the forests, but “in practice, of course, these smallholdings attracted the cream of our men whom we were glad to employ on fulltime...”Ryle, George, Forest Service, 1969, p. 188 Existing and often derelict agricultural dwellings were adapted and new ones built to a small number of basic designs. The scheme “was never a directly economic proposition, but in the pre-war days when motor traffic was lacking and it was much more important than today to have a solid caucus of skilled woodmen living in the forests, the indirect benefits were inestimable. The holdings were a great success, and filled a genuine need in the countryside...”Ryle, op. cit. The number of smallholdings built slowed down after the Great Depression, was revived by the Special Areas programme of 1934 onwards, but then was virtually ended by the Second World War, after which the policy shifted to the building of houses without holdings.Annual Reports of the Forestry Commission, HMSO, 1920 onwards, for all figures of tenancies During the Second World War timber was again in great demand, and there was a steep increase in the amount of timber extracted from Scotland's woods. Specialist battalions were recruited to work in the forests, including the Women's Timber Corps, groups of conscientious objectors, and workers from Belize (the British Honduran Forestry Unit). Following the war the Forestry Commission strove to replenish the lost woodland, making increased use of mechanisation to assist in this task. The Forestry Act 1945 rescinded the Forestry Commission's power to acquire and hold land, transferring its Scottish lands to the Scottish Office. The commission was henceforth subject to the directions of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, effectively signalling the start of devolution of forestry policy to Scotland. Following the introduction of political devolution forestry was not a reserved matter, and as such the Forestry Commission had to report to the Scottish Parliament on Scottish forestry, the Welsh Assembly in respect of Wales, and the UK Government in respect of England and certain international issues such as plant health. This was achieved by splitting responsibility for forests by national borders, resulting in the creation of Forestry Commission Scotland, and equivalent bodies for England and Wales in 2003. These bodies existed as sub-departments of the Forestry Commission of Great Britain. On 1 April 2013 Forestry Commission Wales was merged into Natural Resources Wales: from then until April 2019 the Forestry Commission was thus responsible only for English and Scottish forests. In April 2019 two new bodies, Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) () and Scottish Forestry (), were established to take over the responsibilities of Forestry Commission Scotland, which was dissolved. Species and biodiversity Native Scots pine at Glenmuick. Only thirty-one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland, including ten willows, four whitebeams and three birch and cherry. The Scots pine and Common Juniper are the only coniferous trees definitely native to Scotland with Yew a possible contender. In 2002 it was estimated that 81.6% of Scotland's woodland was coniferous, with much of this consisting of plantations of non-native conifers. The most commonly planted tree species was Sitka spruce, which covered almost 48.2% of the all forest land in the country. Other commonly planted non-native trees included lodgepole pine (11.1%), larches (5.9%) and Norway spruce (3.2%). The native Scots pine covered 11.6% of forest land, and the total amount of native woodland was estimated as being 3,980 km2, with around 4,000 ha of new native woodland being created each year. The Native Woodland Survey of Scotland, completed between late 2006 and late 2012, found that of Scotland's native woodland, 29% could be classified as \\"upland birchwoods\\", whilst native pinewoods comprised 28%. Wet woodland comprised 14% of all native woodland, whilst \\"lowland mixed deciduous woodland\\" comprised 8%, and upland oakwoods comprised 6%. Stirling University have recorded the presence of over 1000 species in Scottish forests, many of which are those most closely associated with Scotland such as pine marten, twinflower, crested tit, Scottish crossbill, black grouse, capercaillie and red squirrel.Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 11. Stewardship and management New forestry plantation at Dalavich in Argyll and Bute. Since April 2019 two bodies have been responsible for forestry in Scotland: Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) and Scottish Forestry. Forestry and Land Scotland's key functions are to look after the national forest estate, including unforested land within this portfolio, and to produce and supply timber. Within this they are expected to enhance biodiversity, increase public access to the outdoors, encourage tourism and support the rural economy. Scottish Forestry is responsible for regulation, policy and support to landowners. Both bodies are executive agency of the Scottish Government: FLS operates at arm's length from the Scottish Government, but is regulated by Scottish Forestry. In addition to regulatory functions in Scotland, Scottish Forestry is also responsible for management of the UK Forestry Standard and the Woodland Carbon Code and for provision of economic advice on forestry: it undertakes these activities on behalf of Scotland, England and Wales under cross-border arrangements with the Forestry Commission (England) and Natural Resources Wales. Under these arrangements Wales will co-ordinate the commissioning, co- ordination and programme management of forestry research, with Forest Research remaining a separate executive agency of the Forestry Commissioners, whilst the residual Forestry Commission (now covering only England for most purposes) will continue to be responsible on behalf of the whole of the UK for co- ordinating international forestry policy support and certain plant health functions in respect of trees and forestry. In February 2019 the Scottish Government published a forestry strategy that identified six key priorities for the period 2019-29:Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019–2029. p. 29. *Ensuring forests and woodlands are sustainably managed *Expanding the area of forests and woodlands, recognising wider land-use objectives *Improving efficiency and productivity, and developing markets *Increasing the adaptability and resilience of forests and woodlands *Enhancing the environmental benefits provided by forests and woodlands *Engaging more people, communities and businesses in the creation, management and use of forests and woodlands In line with this strategy much of the National Forest Estate is managed to encourage tourism and recreation, with facilities such as car park, picnic areas, paths and mountain bike trails. Examples include the six forest parks, and the mountain biking venues of the 7stanes. Notable individual trees Dughall Mhòr in Reelig Glen was formerly thought to be the tallest tree in the UK.

Born in Stirling, New Jersey, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Estock graduated from Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1942 and was pitching in a summer league afterward when baseball scouts began to notice him. Soon, the Scranton Red Sox offered him $100 a month and a $100 signing bonus to play ball.Former Major Leaguer Helped Teach School, TCPalm.com, November 10, 2010 Prior to the 1944 season, the parent Boston Red Sox sent him to the Philadelphia Phillies' organization, and in March 1946 Estock was traded to Pittsburgh Pirates to complete an earlier deal. Prior to the 1947 season, the Pirates sent Estock to the Austin Pioneers the Big State League. Three years later, the Braves purchased his contract from Austin. Estock played for several minor league teams, including the Wilmington Blue Rocks, where his 22 wins in the 1945 season is still a club and Interstate League record. After being purchasedby the Braves, Estock was assigned to Triple-A Milwaukee, where he went 16–8 with 3.35 earned-run average. That earned him a shot at the big leagues the following year. In 1951, he reached the majors, playing for the Boston Braves alongside future Hall of Famers Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn, who were among the majors' most successful left-handed pitchers. Estock spent one full season with the Braves, appearing in 37 games, all but one in relief. His only start came in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pirates. He pitched well, giving up three runs in eight innings, but was the loser in what would turn out to be his only big league decision when Cliff Chambers threw a no-hitter against the Braves. Estock finished the year with an 0–1 record and a 4.33 ERA. He managed two hits in seven at-bats for a .286 batting average. Estock spent 1952 with the minor league Milwaukee Brewers, going 6–3 with a 3.10 ERA. He stayed in baseball until 1955, spending time with the Toledo Mud Hens, Jacksonville Braves, Atlanta Crackers and finishing up with the York White Roses of the Piedmont League in 1955. Estock spent 13 seasons in pro baseball before retiring at age 30. At his retirement Estock spoke of his introduction to a future Braves Hall of Famer: \\"I was pitching batting practice to a young kid who was up for a tryout during spring training in 1952. He was hitting me pretty good so I started to put a little extra on the ball, but he just kept it up. He really stood out. I asked him his name, and he answered, 'My name is Hank Aaron.'\\" Word of mouth, Estock shared this story with many family members Estock was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.

Amy is a neuroscientist and Sheldon's love interest in the series. She has a PhD in neurobiology (Bialik herself has a PhD in neuroscience), with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a capuchin monkey addicted to cigarettes or starfish addicted to cocaine. Character biography Raj and Howard found Amy through an online dating site after secretly establishing an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his \\"girlfriend\\". The two initially communicate by computer, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts socializing with the gang in person. Early on, Amy is essentially a female counterpart to Sheldon. She is coldly rational, displays little emotion, and is awkward in social situations ranging from endearing to embarrassing. In season five, after Amy goes out on a date with comic-book store owner Stuart, Sheldon decides to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend with a 31-page \\"Relationship Agreement\\". Later in the season, Amy begins a campaign to increase Sheldon's feelings for her by becoming more involved in his interests, including video games and Star Trek, and treating him as his mother did. During Howard and Bernadette's wedding ceremony Sheldon says that he hopes the two of them are as happy together as he is alone, hurting Amy's feelings, but he spontaneously takes her hand for comfort later as Howard is launched into space. By the beginning of season six, they are regularly holding hands at Amy's insistence, but Sheldon repeatedly resists all of her attempts to engage in further physical intimacy. By mid-season, Sheldon gets some intimate views of Amy when he cares for her while she has the flu, pushing him further toward a traditional relationship with her. She also provides Sheldon with consoling hugs, and receives a slap on the rear by an intoxicated Sheldon who tells everyone that she is a great gal. Amy tries to move into Sheldon's apartment when Leonard temporarily vacates it, but is unsuccessful in her attempt. Sheldon, after being prodded by Barry Kripke about his girlfriend, lies that he is having sex with Amy, though he admits to Penny that he and Amy may actually engage in sex. Sheldon later makes the same admission to Amy, while engaging in Dungeons & Dragons intercourse game play. In the season-seven episode \\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\", Sheldon sarcastically says he will give Amy the romance she wants, then passionately kisses her on the lips for the first time and enjoys it. In \\"The Prom Equivalency\\", Sheldon and Amy admit to being in love with each other. Early in their relationships, Amy was ambivalent and often condescending towards Penny and Bernadette, but she later spends more time with them, even at the expense of her time with Sheldon. As her appearances have progressed, she has shed her strident, aloof personality for a stereotypically feminine and social one, although she retains some social awkwardness. Her feelings for Sheldon have also grown considerably over time, and she considers him to be ideal in almost every way, though she sometimes becomes as annoyed and frustrated by Sheldon's quirks as his other friends do. Amy also intensely wants her relationship with Sheldon to progress to include sexual intimacy, a drastic departure from her early days as a member of the circle of friends. She has come to consider Penny a very close friend, sometimes referring to her as her \\"bestie\\", occasionally admitting her entire social life revolves around Penny. Penny is fond of Amy, but to her dismay, Amy often fails to grasp the concept of \\"girl talk\\", by talking about feminine hygiene and anatomy when in her presence and at times being brutally honest. Amy also often demonstrates an infatuation towards Penny, occasionally bordering on physical attraction, and she has demonstrated a somewhat condescending attitude towards Bernadette, although she still considers her a close friend. In the final episode of season eight, \\"The Commitment Determination\\", Amy decides to take a break from her relationship with Sheldon due to the lack of physical affection. Sheldon had intended to propose to Amy, but she took a break from the relationship before he could ask her. Amy ultimately breaks up with Sheldon after a serious disagreement, but they slowly rekindle their relationship and eventually have sex as a birthday present from Sheldon. When Sheldon's grandmother visits in season nine, she confronts Amy for hurting Sheldon and unintentionally reveals the secret engagement ring in his possession. Although Amy was initially shocked, she became really happy to know that Sheldon loves her enough to have considered taking that step forward in their relationship. Amy later prepares a surprise birthday party for Sheldon, which he has not previously celebrated with the group. After a plumbing accident makes her apartment uninhabitable in season 10, Sheldon and Amy embark on a five-week experiment living together to test their compatibility. Amy later admits she lied about how long the repairs were taking so that she could continue living with Sheldon. They eventually move into Penny's old apartment together, while Penny moves in with Leonard, and later make the arrangement permanent. Amy is later offered a three-month science research project at Princeton University in New Jersey and leaves with Sheldon's encouragement. She becomes angry when she learns of Sheldon spending time with Ramona Nowitzki, who she suspects has romantic feelings for Sheldon (which she does). In the season finale, after Ramona kisses Sheldon, he visits Amy and proposes to her. The episode ends on a cliffhanger awaiting her answer. In the season 11 premiere episode \\"The Proposal Proposal\\", which picks up immediately after Sheldon's proposal, Amy's answer is further delayed by a phone call from Leonard and Penny, after which she finally says yes. She and Sheldon marry in the season 11 finale. Amy objects to Sheldon wanting to provide sperm for Zack Johnson's baby, but does try and get him excited about having their own child. Amy is musically inclined and is shown to play the harp, autoharp and keyboard throughout the series. In the final season, Sheldon and Amy publish their work on super-asymmetric string theory and win the Nobel Prize in Physics together.\\"The Big Bang Theory Finale: EPs Talk Elevator Twist, Sheldon's Speech, Howard and Bernadette's [Spoilers],\\" TV Line (May 16, 2019) https://tvline.com/2019/05/16/big-bang-theory-series-finale- sheldon-amy-nobel-prize/ Reception The fourth season received particular praise for character developments.

The club was located on the premises of the Rangoon Government High School. It afforded a twofold opportunity: first, it was a means to develop the British colonial painters' own talents and second, they were able to teach Western style painting to others in Burma. BAC was founded by amateur British colonial painters. This included Kenneth Martin Ward, Professor of Physics at Rangoon University; Martin Jones, Railways Commissioner who drew for the Rangoon Times, and E.G.N. Kinch, the principal of Saint Methew Teachers Training College. They were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung, his wife Mya May, and young Burmese artists such as Ba Zaw, Ba Nyan, Tha Dun, Tun Hla, Saya Saung and Ba Kyi. History The Burma Art Club participated in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition at the Shwedagon Pagoda =Early years= Ward became BAC's first president with architect Tha Tun acting as Secretary. Hla Aung and Mya May arranged for the teachers and students to stay at their residence. They also allowed Ward to teach art at the Boys Buddhist School, which was owned by them. Daw Mya May became known as \\"the mother of Myanmar artists\\". BAC offered several courses such as still-life and portrait painting, as well as outdoor and indoor paintings on weekends. While the Burmese painters affiliated with the club accepted realistically painted nudes as art, very few of them attempted to paint nudity themselves.Nyunt, (snippet view), p. 88 The club was known to concentrate on system and method, earning it the nickname of \\"Labyrinth of Technique\\" amongst those in the art circle. In 1920, the school expanded its classes, Ward himself taught oil painting, and Ba Nyan, developer of the \\"Rangoon School\\", became an art instructor in basic design. In that decade, club member painters, Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw, were able study in London at the Royal College of Art. Also in the 1920s, the founding members introduced students to British cartoon art. Upon Ba Nyan's return to Burma, he brought back a bold style of oil painting while Ba Zaw returned with a stylized form of transparent watercolor painting.Barron, p. 14 =Later years= Though art instruction continued at the club until World War II, some painters such as Ba Nyan began a new form instruction at their homes, that of master-apprentice training. The school was important in launching the careers of talented young artists such as Ba Nyan. In 1939, Ba Nyan himself became principal of the Art School. In 1944, during the Japanese occupation, Ba Nyan led a group of artists that opened the school's successor, the Burmese Academy of Art, becoming the principal of the academy with Ba Kyi and San Win as instructors. Two years later, an English Army art club and the Burma Art Club participated together in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition (Services Art Exhibition) at the Shwedagon Pagoda. Notable alumni Many young Burmese artists learned to draw and paint from the British artists. Those who went on to become famous national artists include Ba Gyan, Hein Sunn, Saya Mya, Ba Zaw, and Ohn Lwin. Ba Gale (\\"Shwetalay\\"), was the club’s most famous alumnus. His first published cartoon appeared in the Yangon University annual in 1915, while he was a college student there. In the same year, Ba Gale's work was published in the Rangoon Times, becoming the first newspaper to publish a cartoon by a Burmese artist. In March 1917, the very first issue of Thuriya (\\"The Sun\\"), a paper run by young nationalists, carried a Ba Gale cartoon.

It was amalgamated with Wilburton parish in 1933. History The catchwater drain, south of Wentworth Grunty Fen consists of the low-lying land at the centre of the Isle of Ely that separates the villages of Wilburton and Stretham from Witchford and Wentworth; the area lies at under 5 metres above sea-level. Despite the importance of nearby Ely, the land around Grunty Fen was uninhabitable even following the draining of The Fens in the seventeenth century, and was still only used for sheep grazing and turf cutting through the eighteenth century. One of the last parts of The Fens to be drained, a catchwater drain was dug in 1838, though it took another couple of decades for the land to become completely dry. Following enclosure the land was farmed, but the thin peaty soil soon eroded and by the Second World War the area was largely uncultivated once more. There are now several working farms covering the fen. The parish of Grunty Fen was situated in the hundred of South Witchford and covered an area of 1793 acres. At one stage the parish was considered extra-parochial, with the area divided between the parishes of Ely, Witchford, Wentworth, Haddenham, Wilburton, Stretham, and Little Thetford. In 1921 its population was only 97, and in 1933 the parish was merged with that of neighbouring Wilburton.Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire, 1929 The Ely and St Ives Railway crossed the area and was jokingly called the \\"Grunty Fen Express\\". The former railway stations of Wilburton and Stretham that opened in 1866 both fell within the parish, closing to passenger traffic in 1931 and closing completely in July 1964. The area made national headlines when Isle of Ely MP Clement Freud asked the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher whether she had plans to visit Grunty Fen where residents were concerned about the level of wage settlements. Thatcher replied that the 97 residents were a happy, agricultural community with a low rate of unemployment. Clement Freud used to race a horse called Grunty Fen. Popular culture From the late 1980s BBC Radio Cambridgeshire broadcast a weekly slot featuring Dennis of Grunty Fen, \\"Britain's favourite vocal yokel\\", a fictional character who lives in a converted railway carriage with his 92-year-old grandmother. Despite the death of the creator, Pete Sayers, in 2005, the character's popularity continues. An annual race known as the Grunty Fen Half Marathon has been run annually since 1991. The race starts and ends at Witchford Village College. The Grunty Fen Rhubarb Festival is held annually at Burwell Museum.

One of the smallest parishes in the county, it is only 1 kilometre from north to south and at most 500m from east to west. The village is crossed by the New River (formerly known as Monk's Lode), a small river that flows through Wicken Fen and reaches the River Cam at Upware. The village's name probably derives in part from gewaed, an Old English word meaning \\"ford\\". History The area around Landwade was occupied in Roman times, and a villa was situated just to the south of the modern parish. Although it has existed since early medieval times, the parish of Landwade has always been comparatively small. By the late 13th century it consisted of around 300 acres of farmland and around 1400 acres of fen, but boundary changes between 1881 and 1954 reduced it to its present size of only 127 acres. The civil parish was amalgamated with Fordham, Cambridgeshire in 1954, though it is now part of the parish of Exning in Suffolk. Parishes of its size were often absorbed in the Middle Ages, but Landwade survived thanks to the rebuilding of the church by Walter Cotton (d. after 1434), Lord of the Manor, in the 15th century to serve as a burial place for his family. The Manor of Landwade had passed to Sir Thomas Cotton, Knt., of Cotton Hall, Cambs., by virtue of his marriage to Alice, daughter and heiress of John Hastings, Lord of the Manor of Landwade in the 14th century.Clay, John W., F.S.A., editor, The Visitation of Cambridge, 1575 & 1619 by Henry St.George, Richmond Herald, London, 1897, p.21. Landwade Hall, a large house that was partially destroyed by bombs during the Second World War, was the ancestral home of the Cotton family until they moved to Madingley in the 18th century. County Historically in Cambridgeshire, Landwade has only been part of Suffolk since 1994. Neighbouring Exning and the northern part of Newmarket were historically almost an island of Suffolk in east Cambridgeshire. The narrow parish of Newmarket All Saints was transferred from Cambridgeshire to this part of Suffolk in 1895, but the \\"bridge\\" linking it to the rest of the county was still only a few tens of metres wide as late as 1994, when local government reforms that came into effect on 1 April of that year substantially increased its width. In the early 1970s, when major alterations were about to be made to the borders of many English counties, it was proposed that Newmarket and Exning be moved to Cambridgeshire, but this was voted down by residents in a referendum. Although only small parcels of land were transferred when further adjustments to the Suffolk/Cambridgeshire border were made in 1994, some houses changed county nonetheless: two people moved from Suffolk to Cambridgeshire, and ten from Cambridgeshire to Suffolk. All of the houses affected were in the estate of Landwade Hall, and Landwade's church was among the buildings transferred to Suffolk. Church The church of St Nicholas is privately owned and located in the grounds of Landwade Hall. Built in the mid 15th century by Walter Cotton, the church contains fine memorials to members of the Cotton family.

This technique is often used to allow broadcasters to replace real advertising panels (existing on the playfield) with virtual images on the screen when broadcasting the same event in other regions which are not concerned with the local advertising; a Spanish football game will be broadcast in Mexico with Mexican advertising images. The viewer has the impression that the advertising image he/she sees on screen is the one in the reality.  History  Throughout the 1980's and 2000's, advertisement on television and newspapers were a popular form of spreading information. Jeremiah Lynwood, a media and marketing expert, has had many years of experience on advertisement. His book on 'Digital Advertisement', describes his analysis towards the history and progression of advertisement within the US culture. Lynwood stated that \\"Thirty years ago, consumers viewed an average of 560 ads per day\\". [3] This consisted mostly from newspapers, to television shows, to gasoline pumps, and so on. He also stated that, at the time, \\"American consumers may be exposed to 3,000 commercial messages every day\\". Within that time frame, the exposure of daily ads have supported many local and big businesses. Reaching the year 2000's and 2010's, the increase of technological advances have created new opportunities for many businesses to grow. According to digital marketing experts, it is estimated that most Americans are exposed to nearly 4,000 to 10,000 ads each day. [4] The use of cellular phones have created a new portal where broadcasters are able to push their ads on to the consumer, wherever and whenever they want. MLA (Modern Language Assoc.) Lynwood, Jeremiah. Digital Advertising : Issues and Trends in an Online World. Nova Science Publishers, Inc, 2014. APA (American Psychological Assoc.) Lynwood, J. (2014). Digital Advertising : Issues and Trends in an Online World. New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc.  Rights  The advertising in the playfields is property of the club, except in some professional sports where the league or federation owns the advertising rights. However, the advertising rights broadcast on the screen are property of the broadcasters or the TV channel. This means that second right holders can benefit from selling this virtual advertising. The number of TV viewers is also higher than the people in the stadium, generating more visibility to the advertised marks and more income to the broadcasters.  Technology  The technology used in virtual insertions often uses automated processes such as: automatic detection of playfield limits, automatic detection of cuts, recognition of playfield surface, etc. An operator is usually dedicated to the visual control of the effect but new systems allow to use the instant replay operator.One operator for instant replay and virtual insertions  Applications  = Live events = Virtual advertisements can be effectively integrated into live television in real-time. For example, Fox Sports Net places a virtual advertisement on the glass behind the goaltender that can only be seen on television.Fox Sports Australia uses Graphics Systems In Formula One, virtual ads are placed on the grass or as virtual billboards. In baseball, Major League Baseball places virtual advertisements on a back-board behind the batter which can be targeted differently in local markets or countries. During the World Series, MLB international broadcasts of the World Series feature different advertisements on a per market basis, showing a different ad in the US, Canadian, Latin American and Japanese markets. = Virtual product placement = The technology that enabled video tracking for virtual advertising has been used for the past decade to create virtual product placements in television shows hours, days, or years after they have been produced. This presents several benefits including the possibility of preserving an advertisement-free master copy of the show in order to generate revenue as product placements are added in the future. Advertisements can be targeted to regional markets and updated over time to ensure maximum efficiency of advertising money. [5] A good example of how virtual advertising is used in our everyday life is used in sports. Virtual advertising uses the latest technology to place an ad in position to the field of play, regardless of camera motion, and the players' movement over the logos. This does not interfere with the viewers experience and allows a gate for many brands to put their image shared with a large scale of people. [6] Recently, the NHL have virtually inserted sponsors on the glass above the physical boards in NHL stadiums. Big brands will not spend their time or money on hitting a certain region when their main goal is to build global brand awareness. Digital signage opportunities allow these larger brands to purchase signage in a stadium during games that are instead nationally televised. This gets even more expansive thanks to social media outlets like Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon. On the other hand, local businesses sign when there are smaller games going on. The signage is much more affordable and still reaches a vast number of people. Virtual advertising may even make live attendance more attractive to sport fans because the technology allows the playing field and surrounding areas to be cleared of advertisements while television viewers at home are exposed to commercials. [7] For the most part, virtual advertising makes a live attendance more attractive to sports fans, because instead of being at home watching commercials, live fans are able to be clear of advertisements and enjoy the game without having to deal with ads popping up in their face.

The Orthodox priest (papas) of Mesopotam leads the dancing at the festival of St Nicholas 20th May 2018 according to the local tradition. History The monastery is thought to have been built in 1224 or 1225. It was once enclosed by a circular wall which is today only partly preserved. Its double apse makes it unique in its genre, and some researchers have advanced the hypothesis that this was due to the monastery being used by two religious rites (Catholic and Orthodox).Manastiri i Mesopotamit, Një rast unikal në arkitekturën bizantine botërore Reshat Gega 6/12/2010 . The East–West Schism of 1054 appears not to have deterred the Catholic and Orthodox believers in Mesopotam, evidently successful in finding a compromise that enabled them to work together in the construction of the monastery. It is designated as a Cultural Monument of Albania and is a protected heritage site, although the church and temple building is in need of restoration, held against collapse with wooden props and scaffolding. The Orthodox monastery was built on the walls of a much older temple. An Albanian Heritage Foundation team, directed by architect Reshat Gega, conducted research on the monastery, performing excavations and restoration over a period of 20 years. Evidence the team found included Hellenic stones from the 3rd-4th centuries BC, confirming the connection with the capital of the Epirote League at Phoenice (Finik) located 3 km from the monastery. One of the decorative stones bears the inscription \\"Menelau\\", presumed to be a reference to the Spartan King Menelaus whose brother Agamemnon led the assault during the Trojan War. The nearby area includes the ancient site of Buthrotum which the Roman writer Virgil says was founded by Trojan descendants of Priam, who settled in the area after the Trojan War. The original openings in the temple walls have been used as either alcoves or windows by the builders of the monastery. An accompanying photograph shows such an alcove with an icon of the Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of the monastery. Agios Nikolaos, Shen Kollit or Saint Nicholas As is immediately evident to speakers of Greek \\"Agios Nikolaos\\", Serbian \\"Sveti Nikola\\", and the Albanian \\"Shën Kollit\\" are the same saint, anglicised to Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was contemporary with Saint Spyridon, the patron saint of the island of Corfu, that lies 20 km west of Mesopotam. Bishops Nicholas and Spyridon both attended the First Council of Nicaea in the year 325. The bodies of both saints were \\"rescued\\" and sent by ship to Italy during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Corfiots successfully petitioned for the body of Saint Spyridon to be relocated to the capital of Corfu. The remains of Saint Nicholas are revered at Bari's great Basilica di San Nicola Italy, in Venice and at Myra in Turkey. The Dragon Icons The temple walls contain several legendary icons including a lion, a serpent dragon with a knot in its tail, and a serpent dragon with its tail coiled around its neck and back. :The following information may be co-incidental. ::(a) the Iliad refers to Agamemnon as \\"the Lion\\" and numerous Roman and Greek authors write that Laocoön, the priest of Troy and his two sons were strangled by a pair of serpent dragons. ::(b) The site of Butrint (Roman Buthrotum) has a great gate, referred to as the Lion Gate, whose headstone depicts a bull, possibly Paris, being wrestled to the ground by a lion - possibly Agamemnon. ::(c) In 297 BC, the occupants of Butrint and the builders of the temple walls forming Mesopotam Monastery were neighbors. ::(d) According to the Roman writer Virgil, Butrint's legendary founder was the seer Helenus, a son of king Priam of Troy, who moved West after the fall of Troy with Neoptolemus and his concubine Andromache. Access to the Site The monastery site is normally closed with fencing and locked gates, but the Papas of the modern Orthodox church in Mespotam has the keys and visits can be arranged if planned and coordinated in advance. In May each year the community of Mesopotam village hold an \\"open day\\" and \\"festival\\" to celebrate Saint Nicholas's \\"saint's day\\" at the site of the monastery.

It has not yet been obtained in bulk, hence its bulk properties remain unknown. However, molecular mercury(I) hydrides with the formulae HgH and have been isolated in solid gas matrices. The molecular hydrides are very unstable toward thermal decomposition. As such the compound is not well characterised, although many of its properties have been calculated via computational chemistry.  Molecular forms  = History = In 1979 and 1985, Swiss chemical physicists, Egger and Gerber, and Soviet chemical physicists, Kolbycheva and Kolbychev, independently, theoretically determined that it is feasible to develop a mercury(I) hydride molecular laser. = Chemical properties = Mercury(I) hydride is an unstable gas and is the heaviest group 12 monohydride. The composition of mercury(I) hydride is 0.50% hydrogen and 99.50% mercury. In mercury(I) hydride, the formal oxidation states of hydrogen and mercury are −1 and +1, respectively, because of the electronegativity of mercury is lower than that of hydrogen. The stability of metal hydrides with the formula MH (M = Zn-Hg) increases as the atomic number of M increases. The Hg-H bond is very weak and therefore the compound has only been matrix isolated at temperatures up to 6 K. The dihydride, HgH2, has also been detected this way. A related compound is bis(hydridomercury)(Hg—Hg) with the formula , which can be considered to be dimeric mercury(I) hydride. It spontaneously decomposes into the monomeric form.  Radicality  The mercury centre in mercury complexes such as hydridomercury can accept or donate a single electron by association: :HgH + R → HHgR Because of this acceptance or donation of the electron, hydridomercury has radical character.

After the band was created, the first demo, \\"Die Totgeburt Jesu Christi\\", was released. This demo contained five songs and was never officially published. In the early months of 1999, the second Wigrid demo, \\"Ort Der Einsamkeit\\", was recorded. About a year later, the demo \\"Hoffnungstod\\" was completed.

It contains two new and previously unreleased tracks by Wigrid.  Musical style and lyrical themes  Ulfhednir has claimed to be influenced mostly by the solo-project Burzum. He also has stated that his early demos were loosely influenced by Darkthrone and some Graveland albums. However, these influences pertain solely to the musical side of Wigrid. The lyrics are written in German and largely concerned with subjects like misanthropy, despair, nihilism, depression and other psychological considerations on an introspective, personal level.

It stars Dermot Mulroney and Diane Kruger.https://allmovie.com/work/inhale-525606 Plot Paul Stanton (Mulroney) and his wife Diane (Diane Kruger) are a couple whose daughter is dying from a rare degenerative lung condition. The only thing that can save her life is a lung transplant from an organ donor. The movie starts when the donated lung fails to arrive correctly. The movie goes back and forth between the present and the events leading up to it. In the present day, Paul goes to Juarez, Mexico to find a man called Dr. Navarro. After leaving his cell number at many local hospitals, somebody finally contacts Paul. In the past, Dr. Rubin (Rosanna Arquette), who's treating their daughter (Mia Stallard), had given them information regarding Paul's associate, Harrison (Shepard), who somehow managed to get an organ transplant for himself, possibly from the black market. Paul confronted Harrison and finally managed to get Dr. Navarro's name from him. Harrison told him that he was contacted by Navarro and he didn't know how to reach him. Back in the present day, Paul is ambushed by a couple of Navarro's guys that tell him to stay away. After an arduous search, Paul finally finds out that Dr. Navarro is actually Dr. Martinez (Vincent Perez) from a local hospital that he visited previously for his wounds. Paul confronts Martinez and asks him to find a lung donor for his daughter, who only has one week to live. Martinez agrees to help him for a $250,000 cash payment. The next day, Martinez tells Paul that he has found a matching donor for his daughter. Paul tells Diane to go to Juarez and prepare their daughter for the transplant operation. Little does Paul know that the donor is actually a live person; Martinez and his men have planned a hit-and-run accident to get the lung implant from a local street boy. Paul discovers this fact and tells Diane about it. Diane tells him that she does not want to know where the donor comes from. Paul confronts Martinez at the operating table. Martinez tells Paul to make a choice: to go ahead with the operation or disband the operation knowing that they won't be able to find another match in time to save his daughter's life. The next scene shows Paul and Diane at their daughter's funeral. Diane gives Paul an accusing look blaming him for their daughter's death. Meanwhile, elsewhere, the local boy that was supposed to be the organ donor is alive and playing soccer with his friends.

On Partition of India in 1947, the regiment was allotted to Pakistan.Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2010). Battle Honours of the Baloch Regiment. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre. It is the senior-most armoured regiment of Pakistan Army. Formation The two parent regiments of 13th Lancers had a common origin in the old Bombay Squadron of Cavalry, raised for service in the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The squadron was split to form the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Bombay Light Cavalry in 1817. More than a hundred years later, they were reunited to form the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Bombay Lancers in 1923.Cadell, Sir Patrick. (1938). History of the Bombay Army. London: Longmans & Green. 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers The 1st Bombay Light Cavalry served in the First Afghan War in 1839 when they fought in the Battle of Ghazni and took part in the march to Kabul. During the Second Sikh War of 1848-49 the regiment took part in the Siege of Multan, where they remained as the garrison for the remainder of the campaign. At the start of the Great Mutiny of 1857, the regiment was stationed at Nasirabad, where they were the only ones to remain loyal. Artillery and infantrymen urged them to go over to them but the sowars refused and, under their officers, charged in an attempt to take the guns. They failed to do so but successfully disengaged and took part in the campaign of pacification in Central India. Burma was their next overseas posting in 1885, where they fought in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. The Duke of Connaught, then Commander- in-Chief of the Bombay Army, became their Colonel-in-Chief in 1890. He still held the appointment in the 13th DCO Lancers on his death in January 1942. During the Kitchener reorganisation of the Indian Army of 1903, the Bombay cavalry had thirty added to their numbers and, the 1st (Duke of Connaught's Own) Bombay Lancers became the 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers. During the Great War, the 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers remained on the North West Frontier of India. In 1919, they served in the Third Afghan War and then went to perform garrison duties in Palestine.300px * 1804 Native Troop of Cavalry * 1816 1st Native Troop of Cavalry * 1817 1st Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1842 1st Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry (Lancers) * 1861 1st Regiment of Bombay Silladar Light Cavalry * 1861 1st Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1880 1st Bombay Lancers * 1890 1st (Duke of Connaught's Own) Bombay Lancers * 1903 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers 32nd Lancers The 2nd Bombay Light Cavalry were stationed at Neemuch in 1857 and took part in the pacification of Central India. One of its officers, Captain James Blair, won the Victoria Cross during these operations. Under Kitchener's Reforms, the 2nd Bombay Lancers was redesignated as the 32nd Lancers.290px During the Great War, the 32nd went to Mesopotamia late in 1916 and were the first British troops to enter Baghdad. In April 1917, at the Battle of Istabulat, a detachment led by the commanding officer, charged an entrenched Turkish position resulting in all the officers and most of the men becoming casualties. * 1816 2nd Native Troop of Cavalry * 1817 2nd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1861 2nd Regiment of Bombay Silladar Light Cavalry * 1861 2nd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry * 1883 2nd Bombay Lancers * 1903 32nd Lancers 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in the renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. In September 1923, the 31st Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers were amalgamated with the 32nd Lancers to form the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Bombay Lancers. This particular merger was a reunion of two regiments separated more than a hundred years before. The new badge was crossed lances with '13' on the intersection; a crown above and a scroll below, reading 'Duke of Connaught's Own.' Their uniform was blue with scarlet facings, and the new class composition was one squadron each of Pathans, Muslim Rajputs and Sikhs. In 1927, the regiment was redesignated as the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers. The 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers were one of the first two Indian cavalry regiments nominated for mechanisation. One squadron was equipped with the Vickers Medium Mark I tank and two squadrons with armoured cars. They were deployed on frontier duties but in April 1941, left for Iraq with the 10th Indian Division. They saw action against the Vichy French in Syria and also served in Persia and Iraq before joining the British Eighth Army in North Africa. In October 1942, they moved back to Persia and then to India. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the regiment moved to Java in the Dutch East Indies in support of the 5th and 23rd Indian Divisions, who were engaged in suppressing a revolt by the Indonesians. In August 1946 the regiment returned to Secunderabad and on Partition of India in August 1947, the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers were allotted to the Pakistan Army. * 1923 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Bombay Lancers (amalgamation of 31st and 32nd Lancers) * 1927 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers * 1956 13th Lancers In 1956, Pakistan became a Republic and all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped. The regiment was now designated as 13th Lancers. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the regiment spearheaded the advance of the Pakistan Army towards Akhnoor in Kashmir. Fighting with elan, it penetrated 23 miles inside enemy territory. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the 13th Lancers launched a counter-attack against invading Indian forces at Barapind near Zafarwal and suffered heavy casualties. Between 1996 and 1997, the regiment served as part of the UN peacekeeping force of UNTAES in former Yugoslavia.The Sabre & Lance: Journal of the Pakistan Armoured Corps. (1997).

Grootveld's 'happenings' were a forerunner of the Provo movement, which he later joined. Grootveld was born in Amsterdam. From 1964 he staged anti-smoking Happenings at the Het Lieverdje (\\"The Little Darling\\") statue in Amsterdam, after discovering that it had been donated to the city by a tobacco company. Grootveld would appear at midnight on Saturdays, strangely attired, and dance around the statue in a cloud of his own cigarette smoke, as he called all sorts of incantations. \\"Uche, uche, uche\\" and \\"Klaas komt\\" were his best known incantations, the last meaning \\"Klaas is Coming!\\" became familiar graffiti around the city. At the core of Grootveld's philosophy was the belief that the masses had been brainwashed into becoming a herd of addicted consumers.History of the Provos High Times, January 1990 Nozems, a Dutch subculture, were attracted to the street theatre as were some intellectuals inspired by Grootveld's innovative methods of communicating his message. One in particular, Roel van Duijn, observing the potential of street actions as provocations to alter society, began to distribute a magazine called Provo at these events.

Welches Dam is the site of the visitor centre for the RSPB Ouse Washes reserve.Ouse Washes.infoRSPB Ouse Washes The parish of Welches Dam is surrounded by those of Coveney, Manea , Mepal, and Witcham. The civil parish was divided between Chatteris and Manea in 1960. History Welches Dam in 1892 The history of the parish is tied to that of The Fens and the battle to drain it in the first half of the 17th century. The original principal drainage channel for the area, the Old Bedford River, runs through the parish. The parish's name derives from Edward Welsh who built a dam across the Bedford River. Welsh was an employee of the Adventurers, the 17th century entrepreneurs who invested in the results of Vermuyden's efforts to drain the fens. Fortrey's Hall, the 17th century ancestral seat of the Fortrey family lies in the parish. In 1849, the area became infamous after 11 of the 187 residents of the parish died in an outbreak of cholera.

Dawnay was the son of John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe, by his second wife Dorothy, daughter of William Johnson, of Wickham, Lancashire. Dawnay succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for Pontefract in 1690, a seat he held until 1695. In 1695, he also succeeded his father in the viscountcy. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the English House of Lords (although it did entitle him to a seat in the Irish House of Lords). He was consequently eligible for election to the English House of Commons and in 1698 he was elected Member of Parliament for Yorkshire, a seat he held until 1700. He was returned as MP for Yorkshire at a by-election in December 1707 and was re-elected MP for Yorkshire at the 1708 general election. He was elected again in 1710, 1713, and 1715 1722. Lord Downe married Mildred, daughter of William Godfrey, of Thornock, Lincolnshire, in 1685. She died in August 1725. Downe remained a widower until his death in May 1741, aged 76. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his grandson, Henry, his son the Honourable John Dawnay having predeceased him.
