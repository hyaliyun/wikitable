For Patanjali, Pratyahara is the preceding stage to practicing and developing Samyama; the ‚Äúspiritually unevolved‚Äù should spend time understanding Ashtanga yoga. Framework Samyama, as Patanjali's Yoga Sutras states, engenders praj√±ƒÅ. Adi Yoga or Mahasandhi discusses the 'm≈´la praj√±ƒÅ' of \\"listening/studying, investigation/contemplation, realization/meditation\\" which are a transposition of the triune of Samyama. These are activated subconsciously in non-structured form (thus producing fragmented spontaneous Samyama-like effects) by any thinking activity or contemplative absorption (particularly the Catuskoti and Koan) and deep levels of trance. Any kind of intuitive thinking at its various stages of expression is strongly related to Samyama-like phenomena as well. Practice and structure Samyama is practiced consistently by Yogin of certain schools (such as Raja Yoga, Adi Yoga).Ishafoundation.org Described in Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, it comprises the three upper limbs of Raja Yoga. Following Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, a yogin who is victorious in samyama vanquishes all \\"cognitive obscurations\\" (Sanskrit: klesha). The Sutras describe various \\"powers\\", \\"successes\\" or \\"perfections\\" (Sanskrit: siddhi) a yogin may attain through the conduit of Samyama.Patanjali's Yoga Aphorisms: Powers, Ramakrishnavivekananda.info Yoga Sutras Samyama is defined in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali verses 3.1 through 3.6 as follows where the Sanskrit in Devanagari and IAST were sourced from LittleLittle, Alan (n.d.).

Filice was a professor of biology at the University of San Francisco (1947‚Äì1976), founder of United for Life of San Francisco (1968), co-founder of the St. Ignatius Institute (1976), co- founder of Priests for Life (1991), and founder of the Holy Family Oratory of St. Philip Neri. Ancestry Filice's father, the elder Francis Filice, descended, on his father's side, from a tribe of shepherds in what is now the Calabria province of Southern Italy. Filice theorizes that his father's family were Jews who took refuge in Southern Italy after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Filice's grandmothers were Rafaella Fortino and Nicolina Pascuzzi, both of whose families descended from the mountain peoples of Celtic descent in Southern Italy. These tribes descend from the Boii, a Celtic people that specialized in cattle raising and filled up the Apennines in Roman times. The name \\"Filice\\" is theorized to be either a form of the word for \\"fern\\" in the Southern Italian dialect (in which case, the accent should be on the first 'i') or a corruption of the Latin word for \\"happy\\", which is \\"felix\\". Both Filice and Joseph G. Fucilla, in his book Our Italian Surnames, support the latter theory. In later years, Fr. Filice would tell his friends that his name meant, \\"pure Easter joy.\\"8 October 1979 letter to Margaret Szudy Connolly and personal recollection. The Filice Family, into which Fr. Filice would be born, went to the United States from Rogliano, a small town near Cosenza in Calabria. After spending some time in Washington State, they settled in Gilroy and Hollister, agriculturally-oriented cities south of San Francisco, near San Jose. In Gilroy and Hollister, they owned various types of orchards. Early life Filice was born in Hollister, California on August 19, 1922. He was the firstborn son of Francis and Antonia (Antoinette) Filice. The elder Francis Filice died before his son's birth. Filice grew up on Judah Street in San Francisco's inner Sunset District, but he also spent much of his childhood with his cousins in Gilroy and Hollister. When he was a young boy, his widowed mother married Francis Garofalo, a barber in San Francisco. They had one daughter, Gloria Garofalo Pizzinelli. Mrs. Pizzinelli inhabits the family home on Judah Street to this day and has three children of her own, as well as ten grandchildren. Filice graduated from St. Anne of the Sunset Catholic School in 1935. He attended Polytechnic High School, and then the Christian Brothers' Sacred Heart High School, where he distinguished himself academically. Education In 1939, Filice enrolled at the University of San Francisco - San Francisco's Jesuit university - where he took the Bachelor of Science in 1943. In 1945, he earned the Master of Science degree at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1949, he earned the Ph.D, also at Berkeley. He published his doctoral dissertation Studies on the Cytology and Life History of a Giardia From the Laboratory Rat (Berkeley: University of California Press) in 1952. Academic career In 1947, Filice accepted a position as professor of biology at the University of San Francisco, where he would teach for almost 30 years. Among Filice's scholarly work in the field of parasitology was a study based upon his doctoral research to characterize the life cycle of the medically significant parasite causing Giardiasis. *Filice F.P. 1952. Studies on the cytology and life history of a Giardia from the laboratory rat. U.C. Publications in Zoology 57(2):53-146 University of California Press: Berkeley. In the early 1950s, Filice and co-workers investigated levels of amino acids in the body tissues of various marine invertebrates including seastars, sea urchins and spoon worms. They were the first to demonstrate that various marine invertebrates maintain high concentrations of amino acids in their tissues in comparison to vertebrate animals. *Giordano, M.F., H.A. Harper and F.P. Filice. 1950. The amino acids of the blood of Urechis caupo. Wasmann J. Biol. 8(1):1-7. *Giordano, M.F., H.A. Harper and F.P. Filice. 1950. The amino acids of a starfish and a sea urchin (Asteroidea and Echinoidea). Wasmann J. Biol. 8(2):129-132. Later in that decade, Filice embarked on a scientific expedition to Baja California, and he was a leader in the \\"Save The Bay\\" organization and movement in San Francisco, which sought to deter City planners from filling in the San Francisco Bay in order to increase development of the Bay Area. In this respect, he published three significant studies in the field of marine ecology: *Filice, F.P., 1954. An ecological study of the Castro Creek area of San Pablo Bay. Wasmann J. Biol. 12(1):1-24. *Filice, F.P., 1958. Invertebrates from the estuarine portion of San Francisco Bay and some of the factors influencing their distribution. Wasmann J. Biol. 16:159-211. *Filice, F.P., 1959. The effects of wastes on the distribution of bottom invertebrates in San Francisco Bay estuary. Wasmann J. Biol. 17:1-17. Pro-life activism Also central to his work as a professor of biology was the defense of unborn human life. Prior to the late 1960s, abortion was illegal in every state of the United States, except in cases where the pregnancy posed a risk to the mother's life. This changed in 1967 when Colorado became the first state to legalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or when there was a threat of permanent disability to the pregnant women. During this period, when the topic of overpopulation first became widely discussed, Filice recalls that not a month would pass when he did not receive, as a biology professor at USF, a free copy of a textbook which called into question population growth. The first such book was The Population Bomb. Dr. Filice found the arguments made in such books unconvincing and began to speak against them at various meetings. At this time, Filice was invited to participate in a panel discussing concerns over population at a local high school, by a former student of his who was teaching biology. In his observation, the speakers affiliated with Planned Parenthood and the representative of the Human Population Institute of Stanford only talked about how to get an abortion, without addressing the population question at all. This concerned Filice, and, as a result, he called the chancery of the Archdiocese of San Francisco to ask what they were doing to respond. Finding out that they did not have a plan for action, Filice asked if they minded if he tried something. The Chancellor of the Archdiocese told him to go ahead. Filice had a student, John Martin, who had become a Lutheran, and, when Filice expressed his concern about how things were developing, this student told him that his pastor had expressed the same concerns. As a result, he invited his pastor to have lunch with Filice at USF. Pastor Kangas was pastor of the Finnish Lutheran Church of St. Francis on Church Street in San Francisco. Pastor Kangas was from Ohio. Filice found him to be a very spiritual man. Filice also invited to the lunch meeting Eileen Ziomeck (now Dr. Aicardi, a pediatrician in San Francisco), who, in Filice's words, was \\"smartest student I ever had\\". The four people who attended the luncheon decided to start an educational group aimed at countering the claims regarding population growth made in the media. Pastor Kangas knew an Episcopalian minister who was of the same mind. He was Rev. Charles Carroll, chaplain at UCSF and pastor of the church that is now the Catholic chapel of St. John of God.For more on Charles Carroll, see Daniel K. Williams (2016). Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade. Oxford University Press, pp. 97-98. Rev. Carroll had been a Catholic, at one time, but now served under the Episcopalian Bishop of San Francisco. His presence on the committee added a socially upscale quality to the movement. So the four contacted Rev. Carroll and called a meeting. St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital let them use a meeting room. No doctors were at the meeting. Those in attendance at this first meeting were: Filice, Eileen Ziomeck, John Martin, John Galten, Clayton Barbeau (a Catholic author), Rev. Bernie Bush, S.J., Rev. Theodore Taheny, S.J.,24 August 2011 letter to Margaret Szudy Connolly. Rev. Carroll, Pastor Kangas, Bob Augros (a philosophy professor at USF), and others whom Filice cannot remember. He does remember that there were fourteen people present. They decided that the political problem was impractical to address directly, and that what was needed was an educational group to counter the arguments of the pro-choice movement. Filice remembers going around the room and asking each if they wanted to be chairman, but each of them declined. So, by default, Filice became the chairman of this emergent pro-life group in San Francisco. Thus was born United for Life of San Francisco. United for Life met every two weeks for the next seven years. At their first official meeting, Dr. Raymond Dennehy came up from Santa Clara University, where he taught philosophy. Dr. Augros and he took the task of countering the arguments of their opposition, and they developed a pamphlet in question-and-answer form that became the source of arguments against abortion for all the pro-life groups in the United States. This pamphlet was later the basis of a book by Dr. Jack and Barbara Willke from Ohio.Handbook on Abortion; see Daniel K. Williams (2016), Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade. Oxford University Press, pp. 141-2. United for Life developed the first pro-life newsletter in the United States and contacted all the groups in California and the United States. In most densely populated areas, ad hoc groups formed. For example, across the bay in Oakland, \\"Voice of the Unborn\\" was formed by a number of housewives. In Los Angeles, a right-to-life organization was formed by a group of doctors‚Äô wives. There was a network of such groups who brought information to their legislatures and to young people.See Daniel K. Williams (2016), Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade, Oxford University Press, chapter 1-3. In addition, United for Life developed speakers bureaus: lawyers, scientists, students, and women who went to every school in the Bay Area to present the pro-life message.https://archive.org/details/pacifica_radio_archives-BC0523A They purchased films which explored prenatal development. They asked to address every event in the Bay Area where their opposition would be.http://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/subject-tags/szudy-marge United for Life organized the opposition to the bills in the California State Assembly to strike down all the abortion laws, and they \\"defeated it handsomely.\\" Mary Ann Schwab and Alice Austurias, members of United for Life, organized the Catholic Office for Life in the Archdiocese of San Francisco and staffed it for many years. Some of the members of United for Life organized the Political Action organization in California as a separate organization because of the tax laws. The Birthright organization was started in San Francisco by Dr. Filice's second-oldest daughter, Carol Brown. A similar organization with the same name had been started in Toronto, Ontario. Brown and her helpers contacted the Toronto office, and they joined with the international organization. This helped the spread of Birthright offices on the West Coast. Of Roe v. Wade, Filice has stated: \\"A purely fabricated case went to the Supreme Court and Justice Blackmun, without shame, wrote a majority opinion that is a masterpiece of false logic. The Court struck down all the laws protecting the child. In doing so they threw our legal system into a shambles. To this day, the effects are felt in the grossly unjust decisions made by the courts to protect the capacity to kill the child in the womb\\". Filice finds noteworthy that the pro-life effort was the first effort by Catholic lay people in the United States without the help of the clergy; it was an entirely lay movement, the first, in Filice's experience, in the United States where the people acted without the leadership of their pastors. This was important because the Catholic organizers wanted non-Catholics to join in. Their conviction was that abortion is a human problem and not just a religious one. The early pro-life activists felt that they, as citizens, had to educate the voters in the United States. As a result, many Catholic priests felt that it was not their fight. All that has changed by now, Fr. Filice points out: Priests for Life grew out of United for Life. Personal life In 1947, Filice married Barbara Ann Fate, the daughter of Michael and Blanche Fate. Michael Fate was half Italian and half Irish, and Blanche Fate was half Irish and half Swedish. Ms. Fate had earned a baccalaureate degree at Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. Filice had six children. The Filice Family would settle on 24th Avenue in San Francisco's Richmond District, attending St. Monica's parish and school. Filice's daughters attended Presentation High School, while his sons attended St. Ignatius, San Francisco's Jesuit high school. In the early 1960s, Filice participated in one of the first cursillo retreats given in San Francisco, and he became a Third Order Carmelite. In 1964, he took his family on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. From the early 1960s to the middle 1970s, Filice was involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the pro-life movement. Mrs. Filice died from complications related to kidney failure on February 11, 1976. Soon after, Dr. Filice retired from his professorship at the University of San Francisco and was accepted by Archbishop Joseph Thomas McGucken as a seminarian of the Archdiocese of San Francisco. From 1977 to 1979, he was engaged in formation for the priesthood at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, CA. He was ordained a priest of Jesus Christ on May 19, 1979ordination announcement in file of Margaret Szudy Connolly. at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. The ordaining prelate was Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco. Filice served as a parochial vicar in various parishes of the Archdiocese of San Francisco until 1986, when, with the permission of Archbishop Quinn, he established the Holy Family Oratory of St. Philip Neri in the Archdiocese of San Francisco.newsletter in file of Margaret Szudy Connolly. The impetus for the foundation of the Oratory was an awareness of the attacks on the family in the West, which had taken deep root in the culture. Fr. Filice sought to combat these evils by engaging in a sustained and organized apostolic service to the family in the context of the Oratorian life. In addition, he saw the common life of the Oratory as a healthy form of community life for secular priests engaged in pastoral ministry. The Oratory had pastoral care of the students of San Francisco State University until 1991, when it transferred its operations to the parish of San Jose de la Mesa in Tijuana, Mexico.newsletter in file of Margaret Szudy Connolly. Fr. Filice served there until 1996, when Archbishop William Levada called him home to the Archdiocese of San Francisco.letter in file of Margaret Szudy Connolly. Fr. Filice was assigned to be chaplain of the Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco. He served in that capacity until his retirement in the early 2000s. Filice then resided in San Francisco as senior priest in residence at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in the outer Richmond District. He also served as full-time chaplain to the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration at 771 Ashbury Street in San Francisco. He was also part-time chaplain at the San Francisco County Jail, the Richmond Jail, and the San Bruno Jail, and at the Novitiate of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta's Missionaries of Charity, at St. Paul's on Church Street in the Noe Valley neighborhood of the Mission District. Filice died on July 17, 2015, at Nazareth House in San Rafael surrounded by many of his family members. He was 92 years of age and until recent months had remained quite active in his ministry since his ordination in 1979.

Robinson specialized in the 800 metres with his personal best time being 1:43.68 minutes, which he achieved in August 2006 in Rieti. He is a four-time US champion, both outdoors and indoors. He has competed at seven consecutive editions of the World Championships in Athletics, from 1999 to 2011. Robinson also represented the United States at the 2004 Athens Olympics and also the 2012 London Olympics.  Biography  Robinson was born in Dallas, Texas and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. Robinson was raised by his Mother and his stepfather on the south side of Fort Worth. In an effort to harness his energy, his parents encouraged him to try out for all sports. Robinson played almost every sport as a child but he was particularly drawn to football. His love for football was intense, yet after breaking his wrist his Junior year, he started to focus on Track and Field. Robinson states that he only ran track and field because of the girls and to help him prepare for football. Robinson quickly found himself falling into the patterns of the environment he lived in and his Junior year was a challenge. With the help from his grandmother and his Biological father, Robinson was able to avoid some of the pitfalls and started to excel in football and track his senior year of high school. The turning point came after the death of his stepfather as this ignited his focus and he was determined to graduate and attend college. Running career =Collegiate= Robinson was a multiple NCAA National Champion where he ran for Texas Christian University and earned his undergraduate degree in Social Work. While at TCU, Robinson was very active on campus. Robinson was the Vice President of NASW (National Association of Social Work) TCU, a leader in the House of Reps, a member of Intercom ( Leadership rout on campus) and Vice President of BSC ( Black Student Caucus). While at TCU, Robinson was a multiple Conference Champion in the 800 meters and the 4x400 meter relay. During Robinson's senior campaign, he became the NCAA Champion in the 800 meters while becoming the TCU Male Athlete of the Year. Robinson later earned his master's degree in Public Administration from California State University, Los Angeles in 2004.  Post-collegiate  Robinson kickstarted his professional career in 1999 by winning the 1999 USA Indoor and Outdoor 800 Meter Championship. He eventually won the historical Prefontaine Classic. After 1999 Robinson had a string of new misses. He placed 4th in 2000 barely missing an Olympic berth. In 2001, 2003 and 2004 Robinson placed 2nd at the USA National Championships outdoors. Finally after 5 years, Robinson returned to the top of the USA 800 field by becoming the 2005, 2006 and 2007 National Champion in the 800 meters. His times steadily improved throughout those years. Robinson broke a 21-year-old Modesto Relays 800 meter record in 2005 with a time of 1:45.35 minutes.IAAF Robinson also broke the Mt. Sac record that had stood for over 2 decades. Robinson ran for the Santa Monica Track Club for his post collegiate career, coached by former teammate Johnny Gray. Robinson has adopted Gray's hard front-running style, frequently taking races out hard into the \\"Gray Zone.\\" Robinson helped the USA 4√ó800 m relay team break the 24-year-old world record and 20-year-old American record with a registered time of 7:02.82 minutes at the Memorial Van Damme meet in Brussels on August 25, 2006. Robinson ran the fastest leg of all competing teams in the relay with a time of 1:43.8. He finished fifth at the 2006 World Athletics Final and sixth at the 2006 World Cup. He won the 800 m at the 2008 USA Indoor Track & Field Championships on February 23, 2008. At the USA Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, Khadevis finished fourth in the 800m race, being passed by Christian Smith performing a dive across the finish line to complete what has been called the \\"Oregon Sweep\\" missing, by one spot, a berth in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. After the 2008 Olympic Trials Robinson became frustrated and considered retirement; however he decided to persevere over the course of the next four years. As a 35-year-old, he took one more shot at making the Olympics. On June 25, 2012 he ran in the 2012 United States Olympic Trials final. Unlike his typical races, Robinson stayed off the pace as Charles Jock and Duane Solomon took the race out under 50 seconds for the first lap. Robinson even trailed notable kicker Nicholas Symmonds through the race. But when it was time to move, Solomon broke away from the field with Symmonds and then Robinson chasing. Symmonds passed Solomon on the home stretch. Robinson was the strongest of the rest of the field chasing Solomon, catching him at the line and securing his return to the United States Olympic Team. Coaching career Robinson started his coaching career by coaching at Louisville High School. Louisville is an all female Catholic Prep school in Woodland Hills, California. Robinson also coached open and professional athletes starting in 2006. In 2010 Robinson became the Head Cross Country and Distance coach for UNLV (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). After having incredible success there while simultaneously training for the 2012 Olympics, Robinson moved form the sunny and warm weather of Las Vegas to coach in the cold weather in Columbus, Ohio becoming the Head Women's Cross Country/Distance coach for The Oho State University. Robinson was able to guide the buckeyes to some top finishes and some school records in a very short time. After only one year, Robinson's impact did not go unnoticed and he was offered an opportunity to coach at one of the premier track and field programs in the nation, LSU ( Louisiana State University). He subsequently left LSU in summer of 2017 to return to The Ohio State University as both the men's and women's distance track and cross country coach.  Speaking career  After being well known as a Professional track and field athlete, Robinson has continued to motivate and inspire others through his speaking and mentoring abilities. Robinson has used the lessons he learned from being and Olympian and shares it with businesses and organizations through Motivational Speeches, camps and clinics. His message speaks to the Inner Olympian in all of us. Robinson feels that everyone has an Olympic size goal that awaits to be ignited. From his failures and successes, Robinson shares lessons that not only motivates but it inspires others to reconnect with childhood dreams.  Personal  Robinson co-founded the YTRC ( Youth Track and Running Club) in Santa Monica, which is a 501 c3 non profit organization serving youth in Santa Monica, Malibu, and Beverly Hills. Robinson was also awarded the Doherty Fellowship to do research. Robinson is also an active member of Athletes for Hope. Robinson was past president of the TFAA (Track and Field Athletes Association). Robinson is an active member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

Professor of the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius and pioneer of oncology research and treatment, he was murdered in the Ponary massacre.  Biography  Kazimierz Pelczar was born on 2 August 1894 in Truskawiec. His father, Z. Pelczar, was a physician himself, owner of a sanatorium and author of about 20 articles. In the years 1912‚Äì1914 he studied medicine at Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. During the First World War he was conscripted by the Austro-Hungarian Army, he was taken prisoner of war by the Imperial Russian Army in 1915 and soon joined the Red Cross. After the First World War he joined Polish Army and served as a physician for the Siberian Division (1918‚Äì1920). In 1920 he returned to the newly independent Poland, finishing studies at the Jagiellonian University where in 1925 he got his PhD. During the following years he worked in Collegium Medicum in Krak√≥w, as well as in Germany and France. In 1929 he got his habilitation, and in 1930 he was invited to the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, Wilno Voivodship in Poland, to head the Department of General and Experimental Pathology of Faculty of Medicine (from 1930 to 1939). He also was the head of the Department of Bacteriology (1935‚Äì1937), the dean (school year 1937-1938), and vice-dean in the following year. Under his leadership the Vilnius Department of Medicine flourished, with many important publications, and with students who would go to become notable academics and physicians themselves (like professor J. Olszewski of Toronto, member of the Moscow Academy of Sciences M. Beklemishev, and J. Sztachelski, Poland's Minister of Health). In 1936 he organized the international 4th Congress Against Cancer in Vilnius. In May 1931 noting the lack of oncology-related health care in the Vilnius region he established the Institute of Oncology and Clinic, which constantly grew under his supervision. He was personally engaged in treatment of many patients, in addition to his duties as a lecturer and researcher. He was a member of several Polish and international oncological organizations. With the coming signs of war, he was offered positions by many other universities - from Warsaw, Rome, Paris, London and New York City - but refused. After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland in 1939, Vilnius was occupied by the Soviet Union. Professor Pelczar helped the Polish Red Cross provided care for thousands of refugees. In 1941 after German invasion of the Soviet Union, he continued to help various refugees, among them, Jews hiding from the Nazis, and working with medical services of Polish resistance organization Armia Krajowa. At night, from 16 to 17 September 1943, he was arrested by the Lithuanian Security Police ('Sauguma') in a standard retaliatory actions against the Armia Krajowa, whose members on 15 September assassinated a Lithuanian Gestapo collaborator, member of Lithuanian security police, Marianas Padabas. Out of 100 arrested members of Polish intelligentsia, 10 were randomly selected and executed on the morning of September 17, becoming ones of the 100 000 victims who died in Ponary. Professor Pelczar was among them, along with fellow professor of the Stefan Batory university, Mieczys≈Çaw Gutkowski, 2 Polish army officers, 3 officials, a lawyer and 2 engineers. A day later an order from Germany ordered his release - but it was too late.  Works  The main fields of medicine in which he worked and published many publications were oncology, arthrology, cardiology, hematology and halth- resort science. In total, he published about 85 large scientific works in Polish, French and German and many popular articles in everyday press.

In 1920, he founded his own company, but facing little success at home, went to Switzerland where his Dewoitine D.27 fighter was accepted for operational service. In 1931, Dewoitine went back to France and founded Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique Fran√ßaise - Avions Dewoitine. During the 1930s, several noteworthy aircraft rolled out of the Toulouse-based Dewoitine factories including the Dewoitine D.500, the French Air Force's first fully metallic, monoplane fighter, as well as the Dewoitine D.338 airliner. In 1936, part of the French aviation industry was nationalized and Dewoitine's factories were absorbed by the state-owned SNCAM. During the Battle of France in 1940, the Dewoitine D.520 turned out to be France's best fighter aircraft. World War II After the successful invasion of France by Germany in 1940 culminated in an armistice with Germany and the creation of the Vichy government, Dewoitine briefly tried to start a business in the United States. This caused him to be tried for treason under the Vichy government. Dewoitine went back to work with SIPA which, after an agreement between the Vichy government and German authorities, was manufacturing trainer aircraft intended for the Luftwaffe, including a derivative of the Arado Ar 96, which would later be known as the SIPA S.10. Postwar exile Facing charges of collaborationism after the liberation of France, Dewoitine moved to Spain, where he developed a derivative of the D.520 with Hispano Aviaci√≥n.

The Health Care Justice Campaign (a project of Campaign for Better Health Care) won passage of the act in 2004. The act encouraged Illinois to create a health care plan that would provide preventive, acute and long-term health care services to all citizens of Illinois. It also suggests the importance of not only ensuring availability for health care, but continuing to maintain and improve the quality of health care services (Illinois Department of Public Health). The act created the Adequate Health Care Task Force (AHCTF), composed of 29 voting members, to submit recommendations for a health care access plan to the General Assembly. The bipartisan AHCTF submitted their consensus plan to the Illinois General Assembly on January 26, 2007. One of the most significant implementations made by HCJA is the establishment of the \\"Adequate Healthcare Task Force (Illinois Department of Public Health). This task force is made up of 29 voting members appointed by the government. Five of the members are appointed by the Governor of Illinois, and six are appointed by each leader of the general assembly. This includes the Speaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, the President of the Senate, and the Senate Minority Leader (Illinois Department of Public Health). Ex officio (by virtue of one's status) members of the Adequate Healthcare Task Force are directors of the Department of Public Health, Healthcare and Family Services & Aging, and the secretary of the Department of Human Services (Illinois Department of Public Health). An overview of the important sections of the bill, as provided by the Illinois General Assembly, would include sections 5, 15, 20, and 25. Section 5 acknowledges that the U.S. census reports that 1.8 million Illinoisans are without healthcare at any given time and that access to affordable quality healthcare is depleting (Illinois General Assembly). Section 5 urges that Illinois should work to provide both accessible and quality health care the all of its residents. Section 15 outlines a plan that Illinois should attempt it implement after the effective date of the bill. This plan includes: access to a full range of preventive, acute, and long-term health care services; maintaining and improving the quality of healthcare in Illinois; coverage regardless of employment status; cost-containment measures; reviewing and implementing multiple approaches to preventive medicine based on new technologies; and promotes affordable coverage for small business market (Illinois General Assembly, Public Act 093-0973). Section 20 of the HCJA outlines the aforementioned establishment of the Adequate Healthcare Task Force. And finally, Section 25 requires that the Adequate Healthcare Task Force will hold public hearings in all Congressional Districts for community input on the issues of the HCJA.

The ideal sheaves on a geometric object are closely connected to its subspaces.  Definition  Let X be a topological space and A a sheaf of rings on X. (In other words, (X, A) is a ringed space.) An ideal sheaf J in A is a subobject of A in the category of sheaves of A-modules, i.e., a subsheaf of A viewed as a sheaf of abelian groups such that : Œì(U, A) ¬∑ Œì(U, J) ‚äÜ Œì(U, J) for all open subsets U of X. In other words, J is a sheaf of A-submodules of A.  General properties  * If f: A ‚Üí B is a homomorphism between two sheaves of rings on the same space X, the kernel of f is an ideal sheaf in A. * Conversely, for any ideal sheaf J in a sheaf of rings A, there is a natural structure of a sheaf of rings on the quotient sheaf A/J. Note that the canonical map :: Œì(U, A)/Œì(U, J) ‚Üí Œì(U, A/J) : for open subsets U is injective, but not surjective in general. (See sheaf cohomology.)  Algebraic geometry  In the context of schemes, the importance of ideal sheaves lies mainly in the correspondence between closed subschemes and quasi-coherent ideal sheaves. Consider a scheme X and a quasi-coherent ideal sheaf J in OX. Then, the support Z of OX/J is a closed subspace of X, and (Z, OX/J) is a scheme (both assertions can be checked locally). It is called the closed subscheme of X defined by J. Conversely, let i: Z ‚Üí X be a closed immersion, i.e., a morphism which is a homeomorphism onto a closed subspace such that the associated map : i#: OX ‚Üí i‚ãÜOZ is surjective on the stalks. Then, the kernel J of i# is a quasi-coherent ideal sheaf, and i induces an isomorphism from Z onto the closed subscheme defined by J.EGA I, 4.2.2 b) A particular case of this correspondence is the unique reduced subscheme Xred of X having the same underlying space, which is defined by the nilradical of OX (defined stalk-wise, or on open affine charts).EGA I, 5.1 For a morphism f: X ‚Üí Y and a closed subscheme Y‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ Y defined by an ideal sheaf J, the preimage Y‚Ä≤ √óY X is defined by the ideal sheafEGA I, 4.4.5 : f‚ãÜ(J)OX = im(f‚ãÜJ ‚Üí OX). The pull-back of an ideal sheaf J to the subscheme Z defined by J contains important information, it is called the conormal bundle of Z. For example, the sheaf of K√§hler differentials may be defined as the pull-back of the ideal sheaf defining the diagonal X ‚Üí X √ó X to X. (Assume for simplicity that X is separated so that the diagonal is a closed immersion.)EGA IV, 16.1.2 and 16.3.1  Analytic geometry  In the theory of complex-analytic spaces, the Oka-Cartan theorem states that a closed subset A of a complex space is analytic if and only if the ideal sheaf of functions vanishing on A is coherent. This ideal sheaf also gives A the structure of a reduced closed complex subspace.  References  * √âl√©ments de g√©om√©trie alg√©brique * H. Grauert, R. Remmert: Coherent Analytic Sheaves.

Demography and religion The population of Deir el Ahmar is approximately 23,000. The main religion is Christianity, most of them are Maronites. There are eight historical churches, including: Saint Joseph Church, which was completed on September 15, 1914; Our Lady of the Tower Church, which was built on the ruins of the temple of Jupiter; Saint Georges; Saint Nohra; Saint Michel, old and new; Saint Elie; Our Lady of Cultivation. The town serves as the center of the archbishopric of Baalbek‚ÄìDeir El-Ahmar.Destination Lebanon Geography Deir el Ahmar's climate is mild during spring and autumn, dry and warm in summer, and cold during winter. The town has an altitude that ranges between 950 m and 1,150 m above sea level and receives heavy snow during the winter. For this reason some roads leading to the town may be temporarily closed during this period. Deir el Ahmar has an area of approximately . History =Roman period= Deir el Ahmar, like the rest of Lebanon, was part of the Roman Empire. During the third century A.D., the Roman emperor Caracalla built a temple for the God Jupiter in the vicinity of the village. The Temple of Jupiter would later become the center of the Jacobite Christians. =Byzantine period= During the Byzantine period the Saydet el Borj (Our Lady of the Tower) church was built on the ruins of the temple of Jupiter. Qasr el Benet (The castle of the King's daughter) was built near Chlifa during this time. =7th‚Äì16th century= From the 7th‚Äì16th centuries the Syriac Orthodox Christians (known as Jacobites) and Arab people inhabited the area. The temple of Jupiter became the center for the Syriac-Jacobite Christians, who were ruled by the Muslim Arabs. There were two notable earthquakes in the area during this period, one in 1157 and the other in 1202. =16th‚Äì19th century period= During the period from the 16th‚Äì19th centuries, Maronite shepherds from Niha, Becharre and Aakoura established in the region around Deir el Ahmar, where better grazing was available.Deir El Ahmar In 1838, Eli Smith noted Deir Al-Ahmar's population as being predominantly Maronite.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 144 In the 19th century other maronite families from Becharre, Aakoura, Byblos and Batroun established and formed the village of Deir el Ahmar. Deir el Ahmar has eight historic churches. The courtyard of Our Lady of the Tower has Greek inscriptions on its stone walls. Ruins of a cellar that reportedly dates to the Roman era are nearby the church. Our Lady of the Tower Church (Saydet el Borj) was built on the ruins of the temple of Jupiter during the Byzantine era. The Castle of the King's Daughter (Qasr el Benet) near Chlifa was also built during this period. Origin of the name Historians believe that the name of the village originated from the Aramaic, \\"Deir Ohmor‚Äô\\" which means \\"Monastery of the Lord's Brother.\\" Since the word deir means monastery and the Arabic word for the color red is ahmar, some historians believe that the origin of Deir el Ahmar's name can be attributed to the large monastery in the area that was built with red stones, thus the name of the town can be literary translated to \\"Red Monastery.\\". While the people who have lived in that period tell a different story which state that after the baptism of the pagan tribes living in the village the monks built a monastery on Jupiter's Temple (a present historical ruin in the village) which the pagans used for the worship of their gods, so villagers used to come every morning to the Mass before going to their work. The villagers got surprised one morning because they did not hear the Church bell toll and hurried to the monastery. They found the monks slaughtered like sheep, by the pagan tribes that fled away and came back to avenge their gods. The people were terrified to see blood all around the place, so they run back shouting: \\"The monastery is red....\\" in Arabic: \\" Al Deir Ahmar \\" the \\"Al\\" was cancelled and the village as called \\"Deir El Ahmar\\". Society and traditions =Traditions= The people of Deir el Ahmar are known for keeping the rural Lebanese traditions including cooking traditional food such as Mezzeh, Tabbouleh and Kebbeh. Wedding ceremonies including traditional songs, dances, poems (zaffeh) and religious ceremonies. Traditional clothes are worn for folkloric occasions, men wear \\"sherwal\\", the \\"Ghombaz\\" and \\"tarboush\\" or \\"Kafiat and Ighal\\" on their heads, and women wear \\"abbaya\\". =The WADA organization = The Women's Association of Deir El Ahmar (WADA) is a Lebanese non-profit, Non-Governmental Organization established in 1994. Their aim is to promote women's role in rural development and welfare of society in the region around Deir el Ahmar. The organization was founded by volunteers from Deir el Ahmar, including current president Dunia Baroud El Khoury, Yvonne El Khoury Lichaa and Ren√© Chouah Mhanna. WADA's geographical focus is a wide area of , including 33 municipalities around Deir el Ahmar, Baalbeck and Hermel, in the north of the Bekaa valley in Lebanon.

The town produces jam, jelly, marmalade, and dairy products as well as handcrafts, such as pottery, crochet, and lace.Products Deir el Ahmar, like the rest of the Beqaa Valley, has good potential for tourism due to the mild climate, pristine nature, and the variety of historical and archaeological sites. Ecotourism, especially natural excursions and hiking trips are becoming more popular in the region of Deir el Ahmar. Tourists also visit the local organic farms and participate in farming activities. However, the tourism sector remains mostly underdeveloped in Deir el Ahmar.

He earned a MacArthur Fellowship in 1991. Early life Feld was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on August 20, 1949. He graduated with a BA cum laude at Hofstra University in anthropology in 1971. He first went to the Bosavi territory in 1976, accompanied by anthropologist Edward L. Schieffelin, whose recordings of the Bosavi inspired him to pursue this work.Liner notes to Bosavi: Rainforest Music from Papua New Guinea. Smithsonian Folkways, 2001. Available at http://media.smithsonianfolkways.org/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40487.pdf His work there fulfilled his dissertation (later published as Sound and Sentiment) for his PhD from Indiana University in 1979 (in anthropology/linguistics/ethnomusicology). Career Feld later returned several times in the 1980s and 1990s to Papua New Guinea to research Bosavi song, rainforest ecology, and cultural poetics. He has also made briefer research visits to various locations in Europe. He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, University of California at Santa Cruz, University of Texas at Austin, and University of Pennsylvania. He is currently (since 2003) a professor of anthropology and music at the University of New Mexico. Since 2001, he has also held a visiting appointment at the Grieg Academy, University of Bergen, Norway, as a professor of world music. In 2002, he founded the VoxLox label, \\"documentary sound art advocates for human rights and acoustic ecology.\\" His most recent book Jazz Cosmopolitanism in Accra (2012) is based on five years of research and collaboration in Accra, Ghana. He is also a musician, and he has been active in the New Mexican music scene since the 1970s.Ear to the Earth artist page Some of Feld's recordings are sampled on the track, \\"Kaluli Groove\\" on the 2007 album Global Drum Project by Mickey Hart, Zakir Hussain, Sikiru Adepoju, and Giovanni Hidalgo.  Academic work  = Schizophonic mimesis = Schizophonic mimesis is a term coined by Steven Feld that describes the separation of a sound from its source, and the recontextualizing of that sound into a separate sonic context. The term in and of itself describes how sound recordings, split from their source through the chain of audio production, circulation, and consumption, stimulate and license renegotiations of identity in an ethnomusicological perspective. The term is composed of two parts: schizophonia and mimesis. Firstly, schizophonia, a term coined by Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer, refers to the split between an original sound and the reproduction/transmission of this sound, be it in a recording, a song, etc. For example, any sound recording, radio, and telephone is a machine of schizophonia, in that they all separate the sound from its original source; in the case of radio, the source of a New York radio show is from New York, but a listener in Los Angeles hears the noises from Los Angeles. Secondly, mimesis describes an imitation or representation of that separated sound into another context. For example, mimesis has occurred if one places a recording of a baby's gurgle into a song.  Notable examples  # In 1969, ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp recorded a Solomon Island woman named Afunakwa singing a popular Solomon Islands lullaby called \\"Rorogwela\\". Then, in 1992, on Deep Forest's album Boheme, a song called \\"Sweet Lullaby\\" samples Zemp's field recording of Rorogwela. Furthermore, in 1996, Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek sampled the melody of \\"Rorogwela\\" in his song \\"Pygmy Lullaby\\" on his album Visual World. The field recording is an example of schizophonia, and the placing of this field recording into \\"Sweet Lullaby\\" is an instance of schizophonic mimesis. The sampling of the melody in \\"Pygmy Lullaby\\" demonstrates further schizophonic mimesis. # In 1966, ethnomusicologist Simha Arom recorded a particular style of music from the Ba- Benz√©l√© Pygmies called Hindewhu, which consists of making music with a single- pitch flute and the human voice. Soon after, Herbie Hancock adapted the Hindewhu style by using a beer bottle instead of a flute in his 1973 remake of \\"Watermelon Man\\". Then, Madonna's song \\"Sanctuary\\" from the 1994 album Bedtime Stories sampled Hancock's adaptation of Hindewhu. Again, the field recording is an example of schizophonia, and the use of the Hindewhu style in Hancock's adaptation and \\"Sanctuary\\" are examples of schizophonic mimesis.

It is the only high school in the New Boston Local School District. Their mascot is the Tiger, and their colors are scarlet and gray. History The New Boston School District consisted of three schools until recently. The buildings constructed in the early 1990s included Stanton Elementary, Oak Street Intermediate, and Glenwood Junior-Senior High School. Glenwood housed grades 7-12, yet it was once the only school in the district and housed all grades. In 2008, voters of New Boston approved a 7.61 mil levy to build a new $20 million Pre-K through 12 school building on #1 Glenwood Tiger Trail, which used to be Lakeview Avenue. The former Sun and Funland Pool once sat on the same location. The school purchased the land from the pool for $34,000. The local share of the $20 million school was only $3 million, and the rest is provided by the Ohio School Facilities Commission. The school broke ground in February 2010 and opened in time for the 2012 school year. This is the first new school building built for New Boston since 1906. Academics In 2009, the New Boston School District was identified by the Ohio Department of Education as being among the top 30 districts in the state for students with special needs.

Violent protests immediately broke out following President Mangope's announcement on March 7 that Bophuthatswana would boycott the South African general elections. These escalated into a civil service strike and a mutiny in the local armed forces, which was complicated by the arrival of right-wing Afrikaner extremists ostensibly seeking to preserve the Mangope government. The chaos lasted about four days before the president bowed to pressure and agreed to allow participation in the upcoming elections. However, Mangope once again reversed his decision. The South African Defence Force (SADF) responded by deposing him and restoring order on March 12. The Bophuthatswana Crisis highlighted the deep unpopularity of the Mangope government and the bantustan system among most of its residents. It has been remembered largely for the televised shooting of three Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) militants by a black police officer. This proved to be a public relations disaster for the AWB and demoralised the movement, which was then intent on preserving white minority rule.Forging Democracy From Below: Insurgent Transitions in South Africa and El Salvador by Elizabeth Wood, (Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics) Cambridge University Press 2003 Historical background A product of territorial apartheid, Bophuthatswana - popularly nicknamed \\"Bop\\" by her nationals - accepted nominal independence in 1977 from South Africa's Nationalist administration. The second national unit to reach the status of a bantustan with limited but hypothetically increasing powers of self-rule, Bophuthatswana adopted as her governing document an act drafted by the former Tswana Territorial Authority under South African guidance. South Africa was adamant that elections should take place as early as 1972, but there were no political parties in the new region. This changed rapidly with the ascension of Kgosi Lucas Mangope, who founded the Lekoko la Setshaba sa Bophuthatswana (English: \\"Bophuthatswana National Party\\"). Mangope targeted rural votes and carried an easy majority in the new parliament. Although Bophuthatswana was not recognised as a unique entity by any foreign state, an estimated two million Tswana lost their South African citizenship accordingly. The 1977 Constitution made it a self-governing democracy inside the Republic of South Africa, with an area of jurisdiction spanning six black-populated districts of the designated Tswana area. Excluded were zones earmarked for white persons encompassing much of the capital and industry. = Prelude = Under Mangope's rule, political freedoms in Bophuthatswana deteriorated. Opponents of the state were subject to banishment, arrest, or extrajudicial harassment. The African National Congress was also considered an illegal organisation. Nelson Mandela's release in 1990 and F.W. de Klerk's subsequent negotiations towards ending apartheid opened up the possibility of reincorporating the fragmented bantustans into a unitary South African state. Although all tribal homelands ceased to exist in 1993 under an interim constitution, Mangope remained committed to the principle of Bophuthatswana's \\"independence\\". Tswana voters were appalled; opposition mounted but remained subject to escalating repression. Human rights groups complained that citizens were barred from attending voter education programmes and only Mangope loyalists enjoyed the right to assembly. On January 1, 1994, de Klerk restored South African citizenship to Bophuthatswana residents but balked at the notion of removing its government from power. Mangope agreed to convene with representatives from the Electoral Commission of South Africa yet refused to consider participating in the upcoming non-racial elections. A commission member subsequently warned that \\"...his [Mangope's] intransigence made confrontation inevitable\\". Outbreak = Civil Service strike = In February, the executives of fifty-two Bophuthatswanan ministries formed the so-called \\"Mmabatho/Mafikeng Crisis Committee\\", initially to address their role in the post-election period. When it became apparent that Mangope would continue to oppose territorial integration for the near future the committee went on strike. Since Bophuthatswana was set to be disestablished by the South African government on April 27, they demanded their wages - and civil service pensions - well in advance of that date. Lacking treasury funds, Mangope simply issued no response. This alarmed the Bophuthatswana Police, which joined the strike immediately. Anarchy ensued and troops were deployed to restore order. Despite their efforts mass looting became widespread as appliances or furniture worth hundreds of rand began disappearing overnight. By Wednesday, March 9, authority had imploded. Striking staff seized the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation and took Mangope's son Eddie hostage, students boycotted classes at Mmabatho University, and the civil servants were joined by thousands of others demanding incorporation into South Africa and the right to campaign for the election. When the security forces failed to take action, widespread disorder ensued. Businesses in Mmabatho, including the lucrative Mega City Shopping Centre, were looted or razed. A desperate Mangope made the decision to call on outside forces for assistance in restoring order. On 8 March 1994, the president invited General Constand Viljoen, head of the right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront, to a meeting of his chief ministers in the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, national police, and intelligence services. It was agreed that Viljoen would use the Volksfront's militia to protect key locations in Bophuthatswana if the situation deteriorated. Parliament was empowered call on Viljoen's assistance sooner in the case of a forcible re- integration. Mangope initially made it clear, however, that he would not tolerate the Volksfront's more extremist ally, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, being present because they were a violently racist organisation. Viljoen was regarded as a more moderate white leader, and was respected as the former head of both the South African Army (from 1976‚Äì1980) and the entire South African Defence Force (from 1980‚Äì1985). = AWB involvement = By 10 March, the situation was only worsening and President Mangope was advised to leave Bophuthatswana for his own protection. He promptly left his country via helicopter at two o'clock on Thursday and flew to safety in Motswedi. Later that afternoon, a group of anti-Mangope policemen presented a petition to the South African ambassador, Professor Tjaart van der Walt, calling for Bophuthatswana to be re-integrated into the republic against their president's wishes. By late afternoon virtually all law enforcement authority had broken down and the military was left with the responsibility of maintaining order. Following more protests and increasing rumors of ANC supporters massing on Bophuthatswana's established borders, Mangope asked Viljoen and the Volksfront to immediately assist in keeping the peace. The Afrikaners were hastily rallied and mobilised, under the command of retired South African Defence Force Colonel Jan Breytenbach. Led by one of Breytenbach's lieutenants, Commandant Douw Steyn, a large Volksfront force mustered at the Mmabatho Air Force Base early on 11 March. Meanwhile, the South African Defence Force prepared to intervene, ostensibly to protect South Africa's Bophuthatswanan embassy and the lives of their nationals in the bantustan. Unwelcome AWB paramilitaries called in from Ventersdorp and the Western Transvaal (especially Witbank and Rustenburg) were also advancing. Their largest contingents took up positions near Mafikeng and Rooigrond, respectively. That evening, Colonel Antonie Botse was displeased to see AWB leader Eugene Terre'Blanche and the Volksfront commandant together at the air base, insisting that the former remove his supporters immediately. Jack Turner of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force reiterated Botse's request but Terre'Blanche insisted that Mangope had requested his presence. Turner was concerned that his troops and the local black civilians would panic when they saw AWB personnel, due to Terre'Blanche's established reputation as an extremist. Terre'Blanche finally agreed to leave Bophuthatswana, and his men ordered to remove all AWB insignia from their uniforms. During the evening of negotiations several civilians were injured by AWB forces, who fired upon looters and passersby alike. Greg Marinovich, journalist and member of the Bang-Bang Club, stated that one AWB member present had remarked in Afrikaans, \\"Ons is op 'n kafferskiet piekniek\\" ('We are on a kaffir-shooting picnic'). In response, the predominantly black Bophuthatswana Defence Force, agitated by their superiors' inability to control the white gunmen, threatened to attack Afrikaner militias. The AWB pulled out of the Mmabatho Air Force Base via column, leaving their Volksfront compatriots behind. Many of the personnel refused to remove their insignia and serve under Commandant Steyn as agreed. Driving recklessly through Mafikeng and downtown Mmabatho, some AWB fighters continued to shoot black citizens in the street, killing at least two. Crowds of angry Bophuthatswana residents, some white, mostly black, eventually moved to block the convoy's way, chanting defiant slogans. An Afrikaner with an automatic weapon fired several rounds over their heads to disperse the human roadblock. The Volksfront Commando withdrew in a much more orderly fashion later that afternoon, accompanied by a military escort to avoid the general public. = Killing of Wolfaardt, Uys, and Fourie = Alwyn Wolfaardt pleads for his life. The single most publicised event of the conflict was the killing of three wounded AWB members who were shot dead at point-blank range in front of journalists by a Bophuthatswana police constable, Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatsoe. AWB Colonel Alwyn Wolfaardt, AWB General Nicolaas Fourie and Veldkornet (Field Cornet) Jacobus Stephanus Uys were driving a blue Mercedes- Benz W108 at the end of convoy of AWB vehicles that had been firing into roadside houses. Members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force returned fire and hit the driver of the car, Fourie, in the neck; another gunman, Wolfaardt, in the arm; and the remaining passenger, Uys, in the leg. Wolfaardt stumbled out of the car and brandished a handgun but was advised by the onlookers not to start shooting. A Bophuthatswana police officer relieved him of the weapon. Ontlametse Menyatsoe approached and spoke to Wolfaardt, asking if he was a member of the AWB. Wolfaardt confirmed this, reporting that they had been dispatched from Naboomspruit. He then pleaded for the lives of his two injured fellows. In response, Menyatsoe shot the three wounded men dead at point blank range with an R4, shouting angrily, \\"Who do you think you are? What are you doing in my country?\\" The killing was captured by the nearby journalists and broadcast worldwide. Amnesty hearing Menyatsoe was not charged with murder. He applied for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), on the grounds that the killings were politically motivated. The application was opposed by the Wolfaardt, Uys and Fourie families. At the hearing in August 1999, Manyatsoe was cross-examined by AWB leader Eugene Terre'Blanche. Menyatsoe stated that his emotions were raised by his seeing a wounded mother, who had been hit when the AWB had fired from their vehicles into a nearby crowd. According to other journalists dozens of paramilitaries had been firing into traditional houses along the road out of Bophuthatswana. Terre'Blanche pointed out that the three soldiers were wounded by the time Menyatso shot them and that they no longer posed any threat. Menyatso said that he acted on his own initiative because of the absence of a commanding officer. Menyatsoe was granted amnesty by the TRC. Aftermath Whereas many Bantustan leaders and elites had entered their own parties into the first non- racial elections in 1994 or joined the ANC, Mangope and his supporters stayed out. However, in 1999 the United Christian Democratic Party, a continuation of the ruling party in Bophuthatswana, entered elections. The party remained a political force in North West Province, where most of the former homeland lies, until the 2014 elections, when it lost its last national and provincial seats.

It is also the minting authority for the Bhutanese Ngultrum. The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan was established under the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Act of 1982. Subsequently, the Act of 1982 was amended by the Financial Institutions Act of 1992 and replaced in its entirety by the Royal Monetary Authority Act of 2010. History Bhutanese Ngultrum The Royal Monetary Authority was established in 1982. The following year, it took on the responsibilities of issuing Bhutanese currency, managing external reserves, and operating foreign exchanges. In 1988, the Authority assumed the role of government banker, holding the bulk of government deposits and providing financing. With the passage of the Financial Institutions Act of 1992, the substantive framework of the Authority was expanded to include licensure, regulation, and inspection of financial institutions in Bhutan. The Constitution of 2008 specifically authorizes the government to manage public finance and the monetary system, affirming previous law. Public finance is backed by the Consolidated Fund, while the monetary system is the purview of the Central Bank.Constitution: Art. 14, ¬ß¬ß 2, 3, 5 Prior to the establishment of the RMA in 1982, functions relating to central banking were conducted principally by three agencies viz., the Ministry of Finance, State Trading Corporation of Bhutan and Bank of Bhutan. The Ministry of Finance was the currency issuer of Ngultrum (the Bhutanese currency) and had printed and issued the first Ngultrum notes in denomination of Nu 1,Nu 5,Nu 10 and Nu 100 in 1974 coinciding with the coronation of the Fourth Druk Gyalpo, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck. The Ministry also functioned as the custodian of foreign exchange balances received, essentially, as aid, which were kept with correspondent banks abroad in the name of the Ministry. The State Trading Corporation of Bhutan (which handled exports to countries other than India and ensured the repatriation of foreign exchange receipts) also held foreign exchange in its own name. The Bank of Bhutan which handled all commercial banking business in Bhutan also extended credit to the Government; financed other Government organizations against Government guarantees, and was the conduit through which Ngultrum notes and coins were issued to the public. Implementation of Five Years Plans resulted in robust growth, and accordingly complexity and dynamism of the economy increased. With these rapid developments, the Government, toward the end of the fourth plan, felt the need for an organization, capable of centralizing dispersed central banking functions. With the objective of setting up an institution capable of performing a minimum of central banking functions and one that could generate information adequate for monetary management, the Government requested the IMF for technical assistance on July,1981. Subsequently, Mr. Rechards H. Miller, Advisor, Central Banking Department IMF was appointed to study feasibility and recommend legal frame to set up a Monetary Authority. The Millar Report on the rationale and legal framework for the Monetary Authority was presented to the National Assembly during its 56th Session and on 4 August 1982 the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Act,1982 was enacted. Immediately after the enactment Her Royal Highness HRH Ashi Sonam Chhoden Wangchuck, Representative of His Majesty in the Ministry of Finance was appointed as its first Chairman while the current Minister of Work and Housing Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba became the founder Managing Director of the RMA. However, due to lack of appropriate and adequate manpower, it took about a year for the RMA to finally emerge as an organization. During the initial stages of RMA√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s development, various central banking functions continued to remain with the Ministry of Finance. As organizational capacities developed, particularly after the appointment of Mr Rabenath Mitra, a retired Executive Director of RBI in August 1983 as General Advisor under the IMF Technical Assistance, these responsibilities were gradually shifted to the RMA in a phase manner. On November 1, 1983, the RMA started its actual operation by taking over the liability of notes and coins previously issued by the Ministry of Finance. The RMA also took over from the Government its unissued stock of notes and coins. Thereafter, the Authority took on the responsibility of consolidating, managing and operating foreign exchange reserve. In 1985, the IMF appointed Mr. Klaus Dornseif, Bundes Bank Germany, as an advisor in setting up Research and Statics Department and was instrumental in bringing out the first Annual Report in the same year besides other publications such as Quarterly Economic Indicator in 1986. In 1988, the Authority assumed the role of government banker, holding bulk of government deposits and providing finance through ways and means advance to the Government. The Agreement governing the grant of ways and means advance to the Government by the RMA was executed on 29 February 1988. With the passage of the Financial Institution Act of Bhutan1992, the Royal Monetary Authority Act 1982 was amended to include licensure, regulation and supervision of financial institutions of Bhutan. After Bhutan made the momentous transition to a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy in 2008, the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, Act,1982 was revised in entirety to meet the current needs. Accordingly, the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 was enacted by the Parliament of the Kingdom of Bhutan on June,2010 at its 5th Session of the First Parliament replacing the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Act, 1982. With the historic enactment of the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010, and the appointment of Bhutan's first Central Bank Governor, Dasho Daw Tenzin by the 5th Druk Gyalpo on August 18, 2010, the status of the RMA has been elevated to that of an autonomous Central Bank with greater powers in terms of its mode of functioning and decision making process. It now performs all central bank's functions that are generally performed by the central banks in other countries. Authority administration The Royal Monetary Authority Act of 2010, the latest legislation on the Royal Monetary Authority, streamlined the codification of its functions. The Act of 2010 refines the framework of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee, which comprise the administration of the Authority.Royal Monetary Authority Act (RMAA) (2010): ¬ß¬ß 28‚Äì59 It also establishes an Audit Committee for internal auditing confirmed by external audits by the Royal Audit Authority, and for publication of statistics.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 64, 65, 156‚Äì168 The Board of Directors is a rulemaking authority consisting of seven people: a royally appointed Governor, as chair; two Deputy Governors, one of whom serves as Secretary; and four others appointed by the government including one member of the Ministry of Finance.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 33‚Äì37, 184 The appointed members hold office for five years, may be reappointed once, and are forbidden to hold political affiliations or substantial interests ‚Äì including any shares ‚Äì in financial institutions.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 37‚Äì39 The Deputy Governors are appointed by the Board itself.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 44‚Äì47 The Board, in addition to its rulemaking authority, is also authorized to establish divisions and delegate functions as it sees fit.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 31, 32 The Executive Committee also has seven members: the Governor; the two Deputy Governors; and four others appointed from the among heads of Authority Divisions by the Governor in consultation with the Deputy Governors.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 56‚Äì59 The Governor, as the executive, is responsible to the Board for the implementation of the policy and the management of the Authority.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 60‚Äì63 The Act of 2010 further promulgates a code of professional and personal conduct, integrity and secrecy requirements, duties under conflict of interest, and a law of accountability for those employed in the Authority.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 74‚Äì85 The Act of 2010 also codifies the role of the Authority in currency, exchanges, official practices, and defines related penal offenses.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 87‚Äì107 The Act of 2010 streamlines regulations on external reserves and foreign exchange.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 108‚Äì118 It restates the relationship between the Authority and financial institutions and formally enables the Authority to act as the fiscal agent, adviser, and bank to the government of Bhutan.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 119‚Äì147 Under the law, government credit and solvency are substantively and procedurally regulated, restricting government loans and advising the government on its budget to prevent indebtedness.RMAA (2010): ¬ß¬ß 148‚Äì154 = Chairpersons 1983-2010= *Ashi Sonam Choden Wangchuck, 1983-1990https://www.rma.org.bt/RMA%20Publication/Annual%20Report/annual%20report%202008-2009.pdf *Lyonpo Dorji Tshering, 1991-1998 *Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba, 1998-2002 *Lyonpo Wangdi Norbu, 2003-2007 *Lyonpo Kinzang Dorji, 2007-2008 *Lyonpo Wangdi Norbu, 2008-2010 = Managing directors 1983-2010= *Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba, 1983-1986 *Dasho Bap Kesang, 1987-1991 *Dasho Sonam Wangchuk, 1992-2003 *Dasho Daw Tenzin, 2003-2010 = Governors since 2010= *Dasho Daw Tenzin, 2010-2015, first governor *Dasho Penjore, 2015- Financial Inclusion The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan is also active in promoting financial inclusion policy and a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion.

The two pilots were housed in a tandem cockpit with a perspex hood. The tailplane was attached to the fuselage immediately forward of the single tail fin. The landing gear comprised a single, central, partly recessed landing-wheel below the rear pilot and a tail-skid below the fin. History Although great interest was shown wherever the Nimbus was flown, only one provisional order was received, making it unviable as a commercial proposition. It took part in the SBAC's second air show in 1947 at RadlettBritish Film Institute material available and was placed second in the 1947 British Gliding Association's two-seater design category.

The modern weapons for sport fencing are the foil, √©p√©e, and sabre. Playing area A fencing bout takes place on a strip, or piste, which, according to the current FIE regulations, should be between wide and long. There are two en-garde lines (where the fencers stand at the beginning of the bout) either side of the midpoint. There are also two warning lines two metres from either end of the strip, to let a retreating fencer know that he or she is nearly out of space. Retreating off of the strip scores a touch for the opponent. Fencing strip: (C) center line; (G) guard lines; (D) last 2 meters zone Participants There are at least three people involved: two fencers and a referee, formerly called a \\"director\\" or \\"president of the jury\\". The referee may be assisted by a jury of two or four line-judges. This was common practice prior to the introduction of electronic scoring. Their function is somewhat similar to that of linesmen in soccer. Their primary job used to be to watch for hits scored. Consequently, the arrival of the electronic scoring apparatus has rendered them largely redundant. Under current FIE rules, a fencer may ask for two side-judges (one to watch each fencer) if they think that the referee is failing to notice some infringement of the rules on their opponent's part such as use of the unarmed hand, substitution of the valid target area, breaching the boundary of the piste etc. Protocol and rules The referee stands at the side of the piste. The fencers walk on piste fully dressed, aside from the mask. If necessary, they plug their body wires into the spools connected to the electronic scoring apparatus and test their weapons against each other, to make sure everything is functioning. They then retreat to their en-garde lines. Prior to starting a bout, the fencers must salute each other. Refusal to do so can result in a fencer's suspension or disqualification. Both fencers must salute each other and the referee. They may choose to salute the audience. In non-electric events the four judges should also be saluted. There are many variations of the salute, including some fairly theatrical ones, but the common theme is that the fencer stands upright, mask off, facing whomever he/she/they is saluting and raises his/her sword to a vertical position with the guard either at or just below face level, and then lowers it again. Various apocryphal stories about the origin of the salute circulate, like gladiators saluting each other in the arena, crusaders pointing their sword heavenward in pre- battle prayer, duellists showing each other that their swords are the same length, etc. The most likely source of the modern fencing salute is the \\"Present arms\\" command from military drill, which originated in the 16th century. After the salutes are completed, the referee will call \\"En garde!\\" The fencers put on their masks and adopt the fencing stance with the front foot behind the en-garde line and, in foil, with the blade in the sixte line.Guidance for referees, British Fencing Association, 2003. They are now in the on-guard (en garde) position. The referee then calls \\"Ready?\\" In some countries, the fencers are required to confirm that they are. Finally the referee will call \\"Fence!\\", and the bout will start. Judging is often done in French, in which case the referee will say \\"En garde! Pr√™ts? Allez!\\" or, if both fencers are female, \\"En garde! Pr√™tes? Allez!\\" (In some circles, beginning the bout with the order \\"fence\\" is deemed incorrect, but in others the use of \\"play\\" is discouraged due to the phonetic similarity with the French \\"pr√™ts\\". The use of \\"fence\\" is contrary to the rules in certain countries.) This is the start of a phrase i.e. an any unbroken chain of recognizable offensive and defensive actions, such as lunging or parrying performed by the two fencers. The phrase ends, when a referee has reason to stop the bout, such as corps a corps (the action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts), a hit (on or off-target), or a penalty, or when both fencers return to passivity. To interrupt the bout the referee calls \\"Halt!\\" (if judging in French, the term is \\"Halte!\\", pronounced like \\"Halt!\\" in English), a bout may be interrupted for several reasons: a touch has been made, the rules have been breached, the situation is unsafe, or the action has become so disorganized that the referee can no longer follow it. Once the bout is stopped, the referee will, if necessary, explain his/her reasons for stopping it, analyze what has just happened and award points or give out penalties. If a point has been awarded, then the competitors return to their en-garde lines; if not, they remain approximately where they were when the bout was interrupted. The referee will then restart the bout as before. If the fencers were within lunging distance when the bout was interrupted and they are not required to return to their en-garde lines, the referee will ask both fencers to give sufficient ground to ensure a fair start. A common way of establishing the correct distance is to ask both fencers to straighten their arms and to step back to the point where their blades no longer overlap in the referee's view. If a fencer needs to stop the bout to adjust his/her mask or tie his/her/their shoe, or something else requires the referee's attention, he/she may do so by tapping their back foot and/or waving their back hand and the referee will generally call a halt. Tapping the front foot is called an appel and is actually a tactical move, intended to distract the opposing fencer; thus, the referee may ignore a front-foot tap. This procedure is repeated until either one of the fencers has reached the required number of points (generally, 1, 5, or 15, depending on the format of the bout) or until the time allowed for the bout runs out. Fencing bouts are timed: the clock is started every time the referee calls \\"Fence\\" and stopped every time he/she calls \\"Halt!\\". The bout must stop after three minutes of fencing (or 8 touches in saber). In 15 point bouts, a 1-minute break occurs in between the three-minute intervals. If 9 minutes of fencing time elapse in a 15 touch bout, or 3 in a 5 touch bout, the bout is over and the current scores are taken as final. If the score is tied when time runs out then the director determines priority randomly. After priority is determined the fencers bout for one minute. If a point is scored, then that fencer wins, however if no points are scored then the fencer with priority wins. Note that this concept of priority is not the same as the priority used in foil and sabre to determine right-of-way. Priority (\\"Right of way\\") Foil and sabre are governed by priority rules, according to which fencer first initiated a correctly executed attack, as described in the following paragraphs. When both fencers hit more or less simultaneously, only the fencer who had priority receives the point. If priority cannot be assigned unambiguously, no points are awarded. These rules were adopted in the 18th century as part of teaching practice. Their aim is to encourage \\"sensible\\" fencing and reward initiative and circumspection at the same time, in particular, to reward fencers for properly made attacks, and penalize fencers for attacking into such an attack that lands, an action that could be lethal with sharp blades. The risk of both duellists charging onto one another's swords is kept to a minimum. At least in principle, in a prolonged phrase, the initiative passes smoothly from one fencer to the other, and back again, and so on. In practice, most phrases are broken off quickly if neither fencer lands. Penalties Modern fencing also includes the addition of penalty cards or flags. Each card has a different meaning. A fencer penalized with a yellow card is warned, but no other action is taken. A fencer penalized with a red card is warned, and a touch is awarded to his/her opponent. A fencer penalized with a black card is excluded from the competition, and may be excluded from the tournament, expelled from the venue, or suspended from future tournaments in the case of serious offenses. Black cards are rarely given to a fencer, though. Note that spectators can be (and occasionally are) carded or expelled. Offenses are broken down into four groups, and penalties are assessed based upon the group of the offense. * Group 1 offenses include actions such as making bodily contact with the opposing fencer (in foil or saber), delaying the bout, or removing equipment. The first group 1 offense committed by a fencer in a bout is penalized with a yellow card. Subsequent group 1 offenses committed by that fencer are penalized with a red card. * Group 2 offenses include actions that are vindictive or violent in nature, or the failure to report to the strip with proper inspection marks on equipment. All group 2 offenses are penalized with a red card. * Group 3 offenses include disturbing the order of a bout, or intentionally falsifying inspection marks. The first group 3 offense committed by a fencer is penalized with a red card, while any subsequent group 3 offense is penalized with a black card. * Group 4 offenses include doping, manifest cheating, and other breaches of protocol, such as a refusal to salute. Group 4 offenses are penalized with a black card. There is also a specific penalty for putting one or both feet off the side edge of the piste: halt is called, and the opponent may then advance one meter towards the penalized fencer. The penalized fencer must retreat to 'normal' distance before the bout can restart - that is, the distance where both fencers can stand on-guard, with their arms and swords extended directly at their opponent, and their blades do not cross. If this puts the fencer beyond the back edge of the piste, the fencer's opponent receives a point. Scoring =Electronic scoring= Electronic scoring is used in all major national and international, and most local, competitions. At Olympic level, it was first introduced to √©p√©e in 1936, to foil in 1956, and to sabre in 1988. There are, however, still traditionalists within the fencing community who have fundamental objections to the practice (discussed later on in this section). The central component of the scoring system is commonly known as \\"the box\\". In the simplest version both fencers' weapons are connected to the box via long retractable cables. The box normally carries a set of lights to signal when a touch has been made. (Larger peripheral lights are also often used.) In foil and sabre, because of the need to distinguish on-target hits from off-target ones, special conductive clothing and wires must be worn. This includes a lam√©, (a jacket of conducting cloth) for both weapons, a body cord to connect the weapon to the system, a reel of retractable cable that connects to the scoring box and in the case of sabre, a conducting mask and cuff (manchette) as the head and arms are valid target areas. Recently, reel-less gear has been adopted for all weapons at top competitions. In this system, which eliminates the spool (by using the fencer's own body as a grounding point), the lights and detectors are mounted directly on the fencers' masks. For the sake of the audience, clearly visible peripheral lights triggered by wireless transmission may be used. However, the mask lights must remain as the official indicators because FIE regulations prohibit the use of wireless transmitters in official scoring equipment in order to prevent cheating. The development of reel-less scoring apparatus in √©p√©e and foil has been much slower due to technical complications. The first international competitions to use the reel-less versions of these weapons were held in 2006. FIE information letter, 08-02-2007 In the case of foil and √©p√©e, hits are registered by depressing a small push-button on the end of the blade. In foil, the hit must land on the opponent's lame to be considered on-target. (On-target hits set off coloured lights; off-target hits set off white lights.) At high level foil and √©p√©e competitions, grounded conductive pistes are normally laid down to ensure that bouts are not disrupted by accidental hits on the floor. In sabre, an on-target hit is registered whenever a fencer's blade comes into contact with the opponent's lam√© jacket, cuff or mask. Off-target hits are not registered at all in sabre. It has been proposed that a similar arrangement (non-registration of off-target hits) be adopted for foil. This proposal is due to be reviewed at the 2007 FIE Congress. In √©p√©e the entire body is on- target, so the subject of off-target hits does not arise (unless one counts the hits which miss the opponent entirely and land on an ungrounded section of the floor - needless to say doing so on purpose is considered cheating). Finally the competitors' weapons are always grounded so hits against an opponent's blade or coquille do not register. In foil and sabre, despite the presence of all the gadgetry, it is still the referee's job to analyze the phrase and, in the case of simultaneous hits, to determine which fencer had the right of way. =Criticism of electronic scoring= \\"Electric\\" fencing has not been without its problems. One of the most talked about has been the registration of glancing hits in foil. Traditionally, a valid, \\"palpable\\" hit could only be scored, if the point were fixed on the target in such a manner, as would be likely to pierce the skin, had the weapon been sharp. However, the electric foil point (the push-button on the end of the blade) lacks directionality, so hits which arrive at a very high angle of incidence can still register. Flicking In the 1980s, this led to a growing popularity of hits delivered with a whip-like action (commonly known as \\"the flick\\"), bending the blade around the opponent's parry. Many saw this as an unacceptable deviation from tradition. In fact, the disputes over the flick grew so bitter that a number of traditionalists advocated (and still continue to advocate) complete abandonment of electronic scoring as something detrimental to fencing as an art. 2004-2005 Season timing changes In 2004-2005 the FIE brought in rule changes to address such concerns. The dwell time (the length of time the point has to remain depressed in order to register a hit) was increased from 1 millisecond to 15 milliseconds. This change has been rather controversial. While it has not eliminated the flick altogether, it has made it technically trickier thereby denting its popularity. However, there have been some serious problems with apparently \\"palpable\\" hits not registering. Moreover, the imperative to make clear \\"square-on\\" hits has led to a number of unforeseen results, which, it has been argued, have made foil less rather than more classical. The following have been reported: *Unwillingness to attack, leading to long periods of inactivity and loss of certain visually striking (but risky) maneuvers; *Loss of popularity of the more sophisticated and technically demanding compound actions; *A rise in the number of renewed offensive actions (at the expense of counter-ripostes) *A rise in the number of counterattacks with avoidance (at the expense of ripostes); *Increased popularity of unorthodox \\"cowering\\" on- guard positions among young fencers; *Bouncing from direct hits on certain protective gear. Having said that, every one of the above claims is a subject of dispute. In sabre, the inadequacy of existing sensors has made it necessary to dispense with the requirement that a cut must be delivered with either the leading or the reverse edge of the blade and that, once again, it must arrive with sufficient force to have caused an injury had the blade been sharp (but not so forcefully as to injure one's opponent with a blunt weapon.) At present, any contact between the blade and the opponent's target is counted as a valid hit. Some argue that this has reduced sabre to a two-man game of tag; others argue that this has made the game more sophisticated. The other serious problem in sabre (universally acknowledged as a problem) is that of \\"whip- over.\\" The flexibility of the blades is such that the momentum of a cut can often \\"whip\\" the end of the blade around the defender's parry. The low success rate of parries (compared to other weapons) is seen by many as impoverishing the tactical repertory of the weapon. In 2000 the FIE brought in rule changes requiring stiffer blades. This has improved matters but not eradicated the problem altogether. There has been talk of making the sabre guard smaller, in order to make attacks on preparation and counterattacks easier and thus slow down the momentum of the attack, giving the defender more of a chance. Finally, the cut-out times deserve a mention. The cutout time is the maximum time allowed by the box between two hits registering as simultaneous (if this time is exceeded, only one light will appear). In √©p√©e this time is very short: 40 milliseconds. This means that, so far as human perception is concerned, the hits really do need to arrive at the same instant. In foil and sabre, where priority rules apply, the cutout times are considerably longer (hundreds of milliseconds). This was a source of two problems: *Double lights are a frequent occurrence, making refereeing difficult. Too many decisions are disputed. *Once again, the attacker gains an unreasonable advantage. It is possible to execute a long marching attack with only a hint of an arm extension, clearly inviting an attack on preparation, which is then followed by a delayed trompment. For those reasons, in 2004-2005 the FIE slashed the cut-out times for foil and sabre from 750 milliseconds to 350 milliseconds and from 350 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds respectively. While these changes were controversial at first, the fencing community now seems to have accepted them. Some concerns remain at sabre, where immediate renewals frequently \\"time out\\" indirect ripostes. =Non-electronic scoring= Prior to the introduction of electronic scoring equipment, the president of jury was assisted by four judges. Two judges were positioned behind each fencer, one on each side of the strip. The judges watched the fencer opposite to see if he was hit. This system is sometimes called \\"dry\\" fencing (USA) or \\"steam\\" (United Kingdom, Australia) fencing. When any of the judges thinks they saw a hit, that judge raises their hand. The president (referee or director) then stops the bout and reviews the relevant phases of the action, polling the judges at each stage to determine whether there was a touch, and (in foil and sabre) whether the touch was valid or invalid. The judges answer \\"Yes\\", \\"Yes, but off-target\\" (in foil and sabre), \\"No\\", or \\"Abstain\\". Each judge has one vote, and the president has one and a half votes. Thus, two judges could overrule the president; but if the judges disagreed, or if one judge abstained, the president's opinion rules. √âp√©e fencing was later conducted with red dye on the tip, easily seen on the white uniform. As a bout went on, if a touch was seen, a red mark would appear. Between the halts of the director, judges would inspect each fencer for any red marks. Once one was found, it was circled in a dark pencil to show that it had already been counted. The red dye was not easily removed, preventing any cheating. The only way to remove it was through certain acids such as vinegar. Despite the problems mentioned in the section on electronic scoring, the vast majority of fencers consider it a great improvement over non-electric system described here. As described in an article in the London newspaper, The Daily Courier, on June 25, 1896: \\"Every one who has watched a bout with the foils knows that the task of judging the hits is with a pair of amateurs difficult enough, and with a well-matched pair of ma√Ætres d‚Äôescrime well-nigh impossible.\\" In addition there were frequent problems with bias and collusion, leading to the wry expression that a dry jury consisted of \\"4 blind men and a thief\\". Some fencers, particularly in sabre, would hit hard to ensure their touches could not be missed, and dry sabre could be an extremely painful undertaking despite the protective jackets. Even in the best of circumstances, it was very difficult to accurately score hits, and it systematically under-reported valid touches to hard-to-see areas, such as the back or flank under the arm. Consequently, even though there are limitations and controversy over electronic scoring, and despite its rejection by the classical fencers, electronic scoring is by far the dominant method used to determine if touches land. Techniques =Bladework= The nine classical parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry that most fencers learn is quarte, known commonly as \\"parry four\\". Parries are named for the line that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line. Offensive bladework consists of the various means of scoring a touch on an opponent. The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target. As it is easily defended against, fencers often use numerous feints to deceive their opponent into parrying and then disengage around the blade. As a preparation for an attack, fencers may execute a prise de fer, or attack on the blade. This includes the simple beat, a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex bind, in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line. =Footwork= lunge position on the right, showing how much more distance can be obtained over the en garde stance In a fencing bout, a great deal depends on being in the right place at the right time. Fencers are constantly maneuvering in and out of each other's range, accelerating, decelerating, changing directions and so on. All this has to be done with minimum effort and maximum grace, which makes footwork arguably the most important aspect of a fencer's training regimen. In contemporary sport fencing defense by footwork usually takes the shape of moving either directly away from your opponent or directly towards him/her. The most common way of delivering an attack in fencing is the lunge, where the fencer reaches out with his/her front foot and straightens his/her back leg. This maneuver has the advantage of allowing the fencer to maintain balance while covering far more distance than in a single step, yet allowing a return to the defensive stance. Competition Fencing tournaments are varied in their format, and there are both individual and team competitions. A tournament may comprise all three weapons, both individual and team, or it may be very specific, such as an √âp√©e Challenge, with individual √©p√©e only. And, as in many sports, men and women compete separately. =Individual events= Generally, an individual event consists of two parts: the pools, and the direct eliminations. In the pools, fencers are divided into groups, and every fencer in a pool will have the chance to fence every other fencer once. The size and number of the pools is determined by the number of athletes who have registered for the competition. Pool bouts are three minutes long, and are fenced to five points. If no fencer reaches five points, then the one with the most points after three minutes wins. Pool results are recorded on a scoresheet, which must be signed by the fencers after their last match. The referee will write down how many points each fencer scored in the bout, although normally if a fencer won with five points a \\"V\\" (for victoire) is written down instead of a 5. Losing a pool match does not eliminate a fencer from the tournament. In some tournaments, there are two rounds of pools, with the second round following the same format, but with pools of different fencers. After the pools are finished, the direct elimination round starts. Fencers are sorted in a table of some power of 2 (16, 32, 64, etc.) based on how many people are competing. There are rarely exactly the right number of people for this to work out perfectly, so the lowest ranking fencers may be eliminated, or they may be included in the next highest power of 2 with the top fencers receiving a bye. Once the table size has been chosen, fencers are slotted into the table like this: first place vs. last place, second vs. second last, third vs. third last etc. A fencers place is decided by three factors: their victories divided by matches fenced, their indicator score, which is calculated by the numbers of hits for and against during the pool rounds, and finally their hits scored. If there is no way of separating the fencers beyond these three indicators, then they are considered equal and draw random lots for their place in the table. The elimination round matches in foil and √©p√©e are fenced in three periods of three minutes each. In between each period, there is a one-minute break. Sabre matches are so much faster that the three-minute mark is almost never reached. Therefore, in sabre, when one fencer reaches 8 points, there is a one-minute break. In all three weapons, the match goes until 15 points. If no one has reached 15 points, then the fencer with the most points wins. The rules for ties are explained above under Protocol. The winner carries on in the tournament, and loser is eliminated. Fencing is slightly unusual in that no one has to fence for third place. Instead, two bronze medals are given to the losers of the semi-final round. The exception to this is team events at international level, and individual events at the Olympic Games where a 3rd place play-off must be fenced. =Team events= Team competition involves teams of three fencers. A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave again. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens. The modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition. The fencers from opposing teams will each fence each other once, making for a total of nine matches. At the beginning of the team match, each team fills out one side of a score sheet with the order they will fence in. Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice. Matches between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. For example, lets imagine that Fencer A from Team 1 and Fencer X from Team 2 finish their first bout at 5-3. Next, Fencer B and Fencer Y step on the piste. They will be fencing to 10 points, but Fencer B starts at 5, and Fencer Y starts at 3, right where their teammates left them. This means that Fencer Y can still pull ahead, if she scores 7 points before Fencer B scores 5. Imagine, however, things go slowly, and after three minutes the total score is 8-6. Although neither fencer reached the limit of 10 total points for this match, the next pair to fence will still be able to go as high as 15. In other words, the maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match. Since there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. However, the winner is simply the team with the highest score at the end of the ninth match, even if it is less than 45. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an √©p√©e score in the mid to low thirties. If there is a tie at the end of the ninth match, then the usual tie-breaking rules apply, and it is the same two fencers who will do the tie-breaker match. Team tournaments sometimes use pools and elimination rounds, although given the possible length of a team match (often a half-hour each), this is not so common, and they usually begin in a direct elimination format. The seeding of the teams in this case can be random, or based on the performance of the individual members (if it is a tournament with both), or even based on the results of the same team at other tournaments (for example if it is a national team). Unlike individual tournaments, teams must almost always fence for bronze. There is also an older team format, no longer in popular use. Under these rules, the teams were still three members each, and still consisted of nine matches round-robin tournament style. However, scores did not carry over. The team to first win 5 matches (a majority) was declared the winner.

Pataki which took effect January 1, 2007. The law requires that health plans sold in the state provide comparable coverage for mental health ailments as it does for physical ailments. This is often referred to as mental health parity.Text of Bill #S8482 provided by the New York State Psychiatric Association last accessed 2007-02-14. History The law was named after Timothy, a boy from Schenectady, NY who committed suicide at age 12 on March 16, 2001. Timothy had been diagnosed with several behavioral disorders and severe depression but had exhausted the mental health benefits on his family's health plan. As a result, the O'Clairs were forced to relinquish full custody of their child in order to make him eligible for Medicaid which paid for all the services which Timothy needed. However, when Timothy returned home, he once again was bound by the limits of his parents medical insurance benefits. In 2003, Timothy's parents joined other mental health advocates and lent Timothy's name to the parity movement in New York State and petitioned the state government to pass a law that would require health plans to provide coverage for mental health ailments and behavioral disorders comparable with coverage for physical ailments. \\"Timothy's Law\\" was sponsored by Senators Thomas Morahan and Thomas Libous and passed the state senate on September 15, 2006.Senate Passes \\"Timothy's Law\\" to Provide Mental Health Parity New York State Senate Press Release (2006-09-15).

Timothy's Law was sent to the governor on December 13, 2006 who later signed it into law. A condition of Timothy's Law passing the NY State legislature was it have a 2-year sunset clause to provide for an actuarial study on the cost effectiveness (the shortest sunset of any law in NY history). Timothy's Law became effective January 1, 2007. In May, 2009, the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department released the actuarial study on the cost effectiveness of Timothy's Law, and reported that the law had considerably increased mental health parity at a nominal cost to employers. It stated that neither consumers nor brokers viewed the mandates as a significant issue relative to cost or their overall purchasing decision.

The bill's purpose, as taken from the 2009 version, was to The act would have, first, allowed a union to be certified as the official union to bargain with an employer if union officials collect signatures of a majority of workers. The bill would have removed the present right of the employer to demand an additional, separate ballot when more than half of employees have already given their signature supporting the union.See generally, Second, the bill would have required employers and unions to enter binding arbitration to produce a collective agreement at least 120 days after a union is recognized. Third, the bill would have increased penalties on employers who discriminate against workers for union involvement. Outline The Employee Free Choice Act would have amended the National Labor Relations Act in three significant ways. That is: * section 2 would have eliminated the need for an additional ballot to require an employer recognize a union, if a majority of workers have already signed cards expressing their wish to have a union * section 3 would have required that an employer begins negotiating with a union with a view to reaching a collective agreement within 90 days, and if not, the two sides will be referred to compulsory mediation, and if mediation fails, binding arbitration * section 4 increases the penalties on employers who subject workers to detriment for being involved in a union. =Section 2, Streamlining union certification= Section 2(a) of the bill would have allowed the recognition of a union for the purpose of exclusive collective bargaining with an employer if a majority of employees sign cards stating their wish that the union represents them. Currently, the NLRA section 9(c) anticipates that after at least 30% of employees state their wish for union representation, a separate secret ballot will be held to confirm that the majority of employees want union representation.See generally, \\"Neutrality agreements: How Unions Organize new hotels without an employee ballot\\" Entrepreneur Magazine, 2001\\"Employee Free Choice Act: Myth vs. Fact\\" U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor. This only happens when there is \\"a question of employee representation\\", or in other words, the result is contested (for instance, because the employer objects). Undisputed petitions, when all employees and the employer agree, require no further election.National Labor Relations Act, Section 9(c) Hearings on questions affecting commerce; p. 14) However, in practice, the results of the card check usually are not presented to the employer until 50 or 60% of bargaining-unit employees have signed the cards. Moreover, even if every employee has signed cards indicating their preference to be represented by the union, an employer may demand a secret ballot, and refuse to bargain until one is held. The effect of section 2 would have been that if a majority of employees at a workplace have already put their names on cards, there would have been no further requirement to confirm the union can represent them through an additional ballot. It would have meant that an employer could not demand a further secret ballot after a majority of employees had already put their names on cards supporting union representation. The text reads as follows: Section 2(a) went on to allow the National Labor Relations Board to draw up more detailed regulations for oversight of the majority recognition procedure. The process of union decertification would not change under the Employee Free Choice Act, so an employer can voluntarily reject a union when a majority of employees sign decertification cards or otherwise demonstrate that they no longer want to be represented by a union, or when 30 percent of employees sign a petition to hold a secret ballot election and a majority of participants in the election vote to decertify the union.How To Decertify Your Union =Section 3, Facilitating initial collective bargaining agreements= Section 3 of the Bill provided that following a union being certified, the union could require the employer to begin negotiations for a collective agreement within ten days. If the employer and union are unable to reach agreement within 90 days, either side may take the dispute to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which has provided mediation free of charge since 1947. If the FMCS is unable to bring the parties to agreement after providing mediation services for 30 days the dispute will be referred to arbitration. The results of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties for two years. The union and employer may agree to extend any deadlines or time limits. A study by John- Paul Ferguson and Thomas Kochan at the MIT Sloan School of Management found that only 56% of unions that win an election ever negotiate their first contract.Sequential Failures in Workers' Right to Organize The AFL-CIO says in a pro-EFCA paper, citing data by Ferguson and Kochan, that this is because \\"newly formed unions lose their presumption of majority status after one year without reaching a contract. The AFL-CIO asserts that this gives employers the incentive to delay the bargaining process for a year and force the demoralized workers to vote again, often resulting in the union's decertification.\\"Why We Need First-Contract Arbitration They claim that \\"the Employee Free Choice Act eliminates the incentive for employers to bargain in bad faith\\" and it \\"will dramatically reduce the delay, frustration and animosity associated with the current company-dominated system.\\" =Section 4, Strengthening enforcement= Section 4(a) of the Bill would have made the National Labor Relations Board seek injunctions against employers who discriminate against employees who attempt to organize a union. Specifically, the bill allows for an injunction whenever an allegation is proven that an employer threatened to or did discharge or discriminate against an employee who sought representation by a union. An injunction would also have been available if the employer \\"engaged in any other unfair labor practice\\" that would have restrained the rights under NLRA section 7. Currently, such federal court injunctions are required only for violations by unions. No such remedy exists for unlawful acts committed by employers in violation of workers' rights. Section 4(b) of the Bill would have increased penalties for employers violating the law. The amount an employer is required to pay when an employee is illegally discharged or discriminated against during an organizing campaign or first contract drive would have become two times back pay as liquidated damages, in addition to the back pay owed, for a total of three times back pay. Currently, damages are limited to back pay, less any wages earned by an employee if they are hired by another employer. There would have been no provision for compensatory or punitive damages. Finally, the bill would have provided for civil fines of up to $20,000 per violation against employers found to have willfully or repeatedly violated employees' rights during an organizing campaign or first contract drive. Currently there are no civil fines for such violations. =Jurisdictional standards= The Employee Free Choice Act would not have altered the existing jurisdictional standards of the National Labor Relations Board. The jurisdiction of the NLRB remains at the level set in 1959, $500,000 gross revenues for a retail business.NLRB Jurisdiction The NLRB also requires a union to consist of a minimum of two employees who have no supervisory authority, exempting many small businesses from the increased penalties of the Employee Free Choice Act. Legislative history =108th Congress= =109th Congress= =110th Congress= On February 14, 2007, in a full Committee markup session, the House Committee on Education and Labor voted 26-19 to report the bill to the full House. Republican members of the committee voted unanimously against reporting the bill, citing numerous amendments proposed by Republican committee members that were rejected by the Democratic majority on the committee. On March 1, 2007, the House of Representatives passed the bill, 241 to 185. On March 30, 2007, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, introduced the Senate version of the Employee Free Choice Act. On June 26, 2007, the Senate voted 51 to 48 on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the bill, 9 votes short of the 60 needed to invoke cloture and prevent an anticipated Republican filibuster.Senate Roll Call Vote \\"The Employee Free Choice Act: Questions and Answers\\", by Ross Eisenbrey and David Kusnet, Economic Policy Institute, 01-29-09 As a result, the bill failed to pass during the 110th United States Congress. In the 111th United States Congress, as of July 9, 2009, the Senate version of the EFCA, S.560, had 40 cosponsors in addition to its sponsor (Edward M. Kennedy, D, MA). =111th Congress= On March 10, 2009, the bill was introduced in the 111th Congress by Sen. Kennedy (Democrat of Massachusetts) and Rep. George Miller (Democrat of California). Kennedy described the bill as \\"a critical step toward putting our economy back on track,\\" while Miller also put the bill in the context of the 2008 economic crisis, declaring, \\"If we want a fair and sustainable recovery from this economic crisis, we must give workers the ability to stand up for themselves and once again share in the prosperity they help to create.\\" Although only 41 senators were Republicans, Senators Ben Nelson (Democrat of Nebraska) and Arlen Specter (Democrat of Pennsylvania) announced that they did not support the bill in March 2009. In addition, Blanche Lincoln (Democratic senator for Arkansas) and Tom Carper (Democratic senator for Delaware) both stated in April that they would not vote for EFCA in its current form. Dianne Feinstein (Democratic senator for California) has also announced that she would prefer to seek alternative legislation. Sen. Claire McCaskill indicated in a meeting with the Missouri Chamber of Commerce that it is unlikely that EFCA would pass in its current incarnation.Sen Claire McCaskill meets with Chamber of Commerce accessed 1 June 2009 On July 7, 2009, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) chose the bill as the first piece of legislation that he would co-sponsor, joining 40 other Democratic senators.Franken Co- Sponsoring EFCA - Hotline On Call: On July 16, 2009, reports were made that Senate advocates proposed dropping the provisions removing the employer's right to demand an extra ballot.Steven Greenhouse, \\"Democrats Drop Key Part of Bill to Assist Unions\\", The New York Times, July 16, 2009 On July 17, 2009, The New York Times reported that in an effort to secure a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, a group of key Democratic senators are planning to change the proposed legislation to remove the \\"card check\\" provision of the EFCA, which would have allowed unions to be certified solely by majority sign- up. =114th Congress= On April 20, 2016, the bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by Rep. Alan Grayson (Democrat of Florida). Debate =Proponents' views= Pennsylvania labor leader Sam Bianco at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, calling on Arlen Specter to support the EFCA. Proponents of the legislation assert that the change is necessary to protect workers' rights to join unions. Under current law, employers are not required to take as determinative their workers' signed authorization forms designating a union as their representative \\"and may insist that the workers use a secret- ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to establish their union \\"even if 100% of the employees provide the NLRB with signed authorizations designating the union as their bargaining agent.\\" The EFCA would allow workers to have their union certified as their bargaining agent by the NLRB if a majority of them have signed valid authorizations.\\" EFCA proponents state that under current law the union ballots are \\"secret in name only\\" by citing experts such as University of Oregon professor Gordon Lafer, who in testimony before the U.S. Congress stated: A U.S. House Committee on Education & Labor report asserted that the overall purpose of the Employee Free Choice Act is \\"allowing employees to make their own decision about whether they want to bargain together ‚Äî to advocate for fairer wages, benefits and working conditions ‚Äî without the threat or fear of harassment and retribution and fear of losing their livelihood.\\"EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT OF 2007  REPORT page 7 The committee's Democrats quoted the conclusion of the nonpartisan international human rights organization Human Rights Watch: In his remarks accompanying the bill's introduction, Representative George Miller (D-CA), chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, stated: President Barack Obama supported the bill. An original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, Obama urged his Senate colleagues to pass the bill during a 2007 motion to proceed: \\"I will make it the law of the land when I'm President of the United States,\\" he told a labor federation meeting in April 2008. The AFL-CIO states that, in practice, the company-controlled election process actually makes the process less democratic: In another speech to the AFL-CIO in 2010, Obama vowed to keep fighting for the bill. Jeff Madrick, the editor of Challenge: The Magazine of Economic Affairs and a former columnist for Business Week and The New York Times, wrote that \\"good blue-collar jobs are disappearing rapidly as manufacturing industries decline; but many new white-collar jobs pay poorly, provide minimal health care and pension benefits, and offer little job security. There is now no privileged segment of earners in the nation except the upper 10 percent or so.\\" He added that \\"some 50 million non-unionized American workers, according to surveys, now say that they definitely or probably would join one if given the option. One of the reasons this does not happen, according to Madrick, is the failure of the federal government to protect workers trying to organize into unions. \\"The fines levied by the NLRB have long been meager,\\" he notes. \\"Meantime, management actions against unions are supported by the nation's courts.\\" Madrick concludes that \\"much can...be done\\" by \\"seriously enforcing the labor laws and imposing harsher penalties for violating them. The Employee Free Choice Act introduced by [then-] Senator Obama, among others, will be a good test.\\"Jeff Madrick, \\"Time for a New Deal,\\" New York Review of Books, Sept. 25, 2008, pp. 65-70 To find out how effective the current NLRB system actually is ‚Äî in other words, how well it reflects workers' wishes to organize into unions and bargain contracts with management ‚Äî MIT Sloan School of Management professor Thomas A. Kochan and MIT Ph.D. student John Paul Ferguson used federal data to track the progress of more than 22,000 union organizing drives between 1999 and 2005. They found that \\"only one in five cases that filed an [NLRB] election petition ultimately reached a first contract [between workers and management],\\" which they reported in a The Boston Globe article. \\"This is despite all the cases already having shown substantial and likely majority support for representation.\\" They criticized the current system by asking, \\"How can anyone who thinks elections are a bulwark of democracy support a system in which a third of those interested in an election never get to hold one? Why would anyone put faith in a process that offers them a 1-in-5 chance of success?\\" Kochan and Ferguson thus called for passage of the Employee Free Choice Act along with other reforms.Thomas A. Kochan and John Paul Ferguson, \\"Modernizing Labor Law,\\" Boston Globe, June 21, 2007 =Opponents' views= Critics contend that additional use of card check elections will lead to overt coercion on the part of union organizers. Opponents of the Employee Free Choice Act also claim that the measure would not protect employee privacy. Representative John Kline, R-Minn., has stated: The bill's opponents also oppose the mandatory arbitration of disputes involving the terms of a first contract, asserting that such a procedure could constitute an improper intrusion of government into private business affairs and harmful for competitiveness and innovation. Opponents have also suggested that the arbitration mandate could lead to management resorting to offensive lockouts as a means to pressure unions and employees into accepting company proposals before the deadline for arbitration. Letter to Mexican government officials from the sponsor of H.R.800. Source: Office of Congressman George Miller Opponents also point to a 2001 letter to Mexican government officials, signed by 11 Democrats who subsequently voted in favor of HR 800, encouraging the \\"use of secret ballots in all union recognition elections\\" that take place in Mexico. The letter further states, \\"we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose,\\" seeming to contradict the spirit of the legislation passed by the House. Congressman George Miller was the lead signatory of the 2001 letter and the sponsor of H.R.800. However, Miller and the other signatories to the 2001 letter now contend that their demand for a secret ballot election was limited to situations where \\"workers seek to replace one union with another union,\\" although the letter makes no mention of this case and instead states \\"all union recognition elections.\\" The \\"Minority Views\\" section of the U.S. House Committee on Education & Labor report on the bill asserts: \\"H.R. 800, the deceptively-named Employee Free Choice Act, would strip [the right to a secret ballot] from every American worker. Moreover, the bill makes changes to federal labor law's scheme of penalties and remedies that are one-sided, unnecessary, and unprecedented. Finally, H.R. 800, for the first time in labor law's history, imposes a one- size-fits-all scheme of mandatory, binding interest arbitration with respect to initial contracts, on bargaining parties, again stripping American workers of the right to vote on the terms and conditions of their employment.\\" The minority (Republican) views of the committee also quoted multiple federal and Supreme Court decisions: In 2007, 28 Republican Senators supported an opposition bill, the Secret Ballot Protection Act,() which would eliminate the use of the card check procedure. In 1947 a similar proposal to eliminate the use of cards was rejected in conference in the House of Representatives.(H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 41 (1947)) Former Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern released political advertisements in opposition to the bill, saying: \\"It's hard to believe that any politician would agree to a law denying millions of employees the right to a private vote.... Quite simply, this proposed law cannot be justified.\\"McGovern vs. unions - First Read - msnbc.com McGovern first broke with Democratic Party orthodoxy on the EFCA by opposing the proposed bill in an August 2008 editorial in The Wall Street Journal: University of Chicago legal professor Richard Epstein also wrote a The Wall Street Journal editorial opposing the act, saying that it is unconstitutional due to restrictions on free speech. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Randel Johnson declared that the \\"coming fight in Congress over the issue\\" is a \\"firestorm bordering on Armageddon.\\" Other business interests have offered similarly strong characterizations of the proposed bill. Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino owner and real-estate developer, stated: \\"Radical Islam and Employee Free Choice are the 'two fundamental threats to society.\\"Vegas Tycoon Bankrolls Republicans, Wall Street Journal, July 15, 2008. Mark McKinnon, a spokesman for the Workforce Fairness Institute, said businesses were \\"hearing about it, and are ready to riot in the street about it.\\" Forbes magazine national editor Mike Ozanian said: \\"The Employee Free Choice Act should be called the anti-free choice, pro-slavery bill.\\"Forbes on Fox, Fox News Channel. January 31, 2009. ;Business reaction During an October 17, 2008, conference call, Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus spoke against the EFCA, calling it \\"the demise of a civilization\\". He went on to say: \\"If a retailer has not gotten involved with this, if he has not spent money on this election, if he has not sent money to Norm Coleman and these other guys,\\" then those retailers \\"should be shot; should be thrown out of their goddamn jobs.\\"It's Time to Give Voters the Liberalism They Want, Wall Street Journal, November 19, 2008.

These proteins help stabilize the formation of ribosomal preinitiation complexes around the start codon and are an important input for post-transcription gene regulation. Several initiation factors form a complex with the small 40S ribosomal subunit and Met-tRNAiMet called the 43S preinitiation complex (43S PIC). Additional factors of the eIF4F complex (eIF4A, E, and G) recruit the 43S PIC to the five-prime cap structure of the mRNA, from which the 43S particle scans 5'-->3' along the mRNA to reach an AUG start codon. Recognition of the start codon by the Met-tRNAiMet promotes gated phosphate and eIF1 release to form the 48S preinitiation complex (48S PIC), followed by large 60S ribosomal subunit recruitment to form the 80S ribosome. There exist many more eukaryotic initiation factors than prokaryotic initiation factors, reflecting the greater biological complexity of eukaryotic translation. There are at least twelve eukaryotic initiation factors, composed of many more polypeptides, and these are described below.  eIF1 and eIF1A  eIF1 binds to the smaller 40S and eIF1A binds to the larger 60S ribosome subunit-mRNA complex. Together they induce an \\"open\\" conformation of the mRNA binding channel, which is crucial for scanning, tRNA delivery, and start codon recognition. In particular, eIF1 dissociation from the 40S subunit is considered to be a key step in start codon recognition. Since eIF1A is the only initiation factor that binds to the large 60S ribosomal subunit, its role is critical in the peptide bond formation. eIF1 and eIF1A are small proteins (13 and 16 kDa, respectively in humans) and are both components of the 43S PIC. eIF1 binds near the ribosomal P-site, while eIF1A binds near the A-site, in a manner similar to the structurally and functionally related bacterial counterparts IF3 and IF1, respectively.  eIF2  eIF2 is the main protein complex responsible for delivering the initiator tRNA to the P-site of the preinitiation complex, as a ternary complex containing Met-tRNAiMet and GTP (the eIF2-TC). eIF2 has specificity for the methionine-charged initiator tRNA, which is distinct from other methionine-charged tRNAs used for elongation of the polypeptide chain. Following placement of the initiator tRNA on the AUG start codon in the P-site, eIF1 dissociates triggering the hydrolysis of eIF2, effectively switching it to the GDP-bound form via gated phosphate release. This hydrolysis also signals for the dissociation of all other initiation factors including eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A. eiF2 is the only factor that will remain bound to the ribosomal complex as it aids the large subunit in binding. This signals the beginning of elongation. eIF2 has three subunits, eIF2-Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥. The former Œ±-subunit is a target of regulatory phosphorylation and is of particular importance for cells that may need to turn off protein synthesis globally as a response to cell signaling events. When phosphorylated, it sequesters eIF2B (not to be confused with eIF2Œ≤), a GEF. Without this GEF, GDP cannot be exchanged for GTP, and translation is repressed. One example of this is the eIF2Œ±-induced translation repression that occurs in reticulocytes when starved for iron. In the case of viral infection, protein kinase R (PKR) phosphorylates eIF2Œ± when dsRNA is detected in many multicellular organisms, leading to cell death. The proteins eIF2A and eIF2D are both technically named 'eIF2' but neither are part of the eIF2 heterotrimer and they seem to play unique functions in translation. Instead, they appear to be involved in specialized pathways, such as 'eIF2-independent' translation initiation or re- initiation, respectively.  eIF3  eIF3 independently binds the 40S ribosomal subunit, multiple initiation factors, and cellular and viral mRNA. In mammals, eIF3 is the largest initiation factor, made up of 13 subunits (a-m). It has a molecular weight of ~800 kDa and controls the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit on mRNA that have a 5' cap or an IRES. eIF3 may use the eIF4F complex, or alternatively during internal initiation, an IRES, to position the mRNA strand near the exit site of the 40S ribosomal subunit, thus promoting the assembly of a functional pre-initiation complex. In many human cancers, eIF3 subunits are overexpressed (subunits a, b, c, h, i, and m) and underexpressed (subunits e and f). One potential mechanism to explain this disregulation comes from the finding that eIF3 binds a specific set of cell proliferation regulator mRNA transcripts and regulates their translation. eIF3 also mediates cellular signaling through S6K1 and mTOR/Raptor to effect translational regulation.  eIF4F  The eIF4F complex is composed of three subunits: eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. Each subunit has multiple human isoforms and there exist additional eIF4 proteins: eIF4B and eIF4H. eIF4G is a 175.5-kDa scaffolding protein that interacts with eIF3 and the Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as well as the other members of the eIF4F complex. eIF4E recognizes and binds to the 5' cap structure of mRNA, while eIF4G binds PABP, which binds the poly(A) tail, potentially circularizing and activating the bound mRNA. eIF4Aa DEAD box RNA helicaseis important for resolving mRNA secondary structures. eIF4B contains two RNA-binding domainsone non- specifically interacts with mRNA, whereas the second specifically binds the 18S portion of the small ribosomal subunit. It acts as an anchor, as well as a critical co-factor for eIF4A. It is also a substrate of S6K, and when phosphorylated, it promotes the formation of the pre-initiation complex. In vertebrates, eIF4H is an additional initiation factor with similar function to eIF4B.  eIF5, eIF5A and eIF5B  eIF5 is a GTPase-activating protein, which helps the large ribosomal subunit associate with the small subunit. It is required for GTP-hydrolysis by eIF2 and contains the unusual amino acid hypusine. eIF5A is the eukaryotic homolog of EF-P. It helps with elongation and also plays a role in termination. eIF5B is a GTPase, and is involved in assembly of the full ribosome. It is the functional eukaryotic analog of bacterial IF2.  eIF6  eIF6 performs the same inhibition of ribosome assembly as eIF3, but binds with the large subunit.

Some phyla require an additional IF3.  IF1  Bacterial initiation factor 1 associates with the 30S ribosomal subunit in the A site and prevents an aminoacyl-tRNA from entering. It modulates IF2 binding to the ribosome by increasing its affinity. It may also prevent the 50S subunit from binding, stopping the formation of the 70S subunit. It also contains a Œ≤-domain fold common for nucleic acid binding proteins. It is a homolog of eIF1A.  IF2  Bacterial initiation factor 2 binds to an initiator tRNA and controls the entry of that tRNA into the ribosome. IF2, bound to GTP, binds to the 30S P site. After associating with the 30S subunit, fMet-tRNAf binds to the IF2 then IF2 transfers the tRNA into the partial P site. When the 50S subunit joins, it hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and Pi, causing a conformational change in the IF2 that causes IF2 to release and allow the 70S subunit to form. It is a homolog of eIF5B.  IF3  Bacterial initiation factor 3 (infC) is not universally found in all bacterial species but in E. coli it is required for the 30S subunit to bind to the initiation site in mRNA. In addition, it has several other jobs including stabilization of free 30S subunits, facilitation of 30S subunits binding to mRNA and checking for accuracy against the first aminoacyl-tRNA. It also allows for rapid codon- anticodon pairing for the initiator tRNA to bind quickly to. IF3 is required by the small subunit to form initiation complexes, but has to be released to allow the 50S subunit to bind.

He was drafted in the second round (51st overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He played college football at the University of Oklahoma. Early years Kelly attended Longview High School in Longview, Texas. He was a three-time all-district first team selection at wide receiver and was also named First team all-state his final two years in 2003 and 2004. Kelly caught 29 passes for 638 yards and nine touchdowns as a senior, as well as 27 passes for 826 yards and six touchdowns as a junior. Kelly was ranked the sixth best wide receiver in the nation by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, behind Patrick Turner and DeSean Jackson among others. College career Kelly while playing with the Oklahoma Sooners. Playing as a true freshman in the 2005 season, Kelly led the Sooners in receptions and receiving yards. He had a season-high eight receptions at Nebraska, and hauled in five passes for a season-best 118 yards against Texas A&M.; He became the fourth freshman in OU history to lead the team in receiving, the first since 1975. Kelly was named to The Sporting News Freshman All-American Team and All-Big 12 Freshman Team. He also received an All-Big 12 honorable mention (Big 12 Coaches). Kelly ranks No. 4 at Oklahoma for receiving yards by a freshman, No. 5 for receptions by a freshman. In his 19th career game at Oklahoma, Kelly became the fastest player in Sooners history to reach 1,000 career receiving yards. During the 2006 season he led the Sooners in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches. In a game against Texas Tech he tied the school record with 11 receptions. He also went over 100 receiving yards in five games with a best of 164 versus Middle Tennessee. He was named MVP of the Big 12 Championship Game. After only two seasons with the Sooners, Kelly made it to eleventh on the all- time career receiving list with 1,464 yards. He also has the second most receiving yards in a season in OU's history with 993 yards, behind Mark Clayton's 1,425 yards. He also led Oklahoma to the Big 12 championship. He scored ten touchdowns in his junior Campaign. Kelly suffered a knee injury early in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl and missed most of the game. Kelly began the 2007 season with a great game against North Texas, receiving for over 150 yards in a 79‚Äì10 victory. A week later he recorded 102 yards and three touchdowns receiving as the Sooners beat the Miami Hurricanes 51‚Äì13. In his junior season he ranked second on the Sooners, grabbing 49 passes for 821 yards (16.8-yard average) and nine touchdowns. After being injured in the Fiesta Bowl, Kelly did not work out at the NFL Combine. On pro day at Oklahoma on April 9, 2008, Kelly ran a disappointing 4.75 and 4.68 in the 40 yard dash. Afterward, the Oklahoma coaching staff acknowledged a last-minute change in the venue and turf‚Äîplayers must wear appropriate shoes for a given surface.

The song has remained in The Blockheads' set following Dury's death. Essentially a song about being in a job that makes you happy, Dury claimed in a 1984 interview with Penthouse that while not condemning 9-to-5 jobs, he had written the song to make people question their lives, echoing the sentiments of his earlier single \\"Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll\\". The song's verses list a number of things the song's narrator could have been, from a driver, poet, teacher or soldier to an inmate in a long-term institution and the ticket man at Fulham Broadway station before the chorus reveals that instead he chose to 'play the fool in a six-piece band' highlighting some of the pitfalls of this (loneliness specifically), before deciding that 'rock and roll don't mind'. The song was written following the break-up of Kilburn and the Highroads in a lull between the formation of Ian Dury & the Kilburns and was written with Rod Melvin in mid-1975, two years before it was released. Originally a third writing credit was given to Chaz Jankel (Dury's long-term songwriting companion): this third writing credit has gradually been phased out and the 2004 Edsel Records re-issue of Do It Yourself credits the song to Dury/Melvin solely. However, in Ian Dury & The Blockheads: Song By Song, John Turnbull (guitarist with the Blockheads) claims that the middle instrumental section was brought over from one of the songs four of the Blockheads had written while they were in their previous band, Loving Awareness. Dury's first hit, \\"What a Waste / Wake Up and Make Love with Me\\" was released in April 1978 just before the start of a headlining tour, entering the Top 75 on 29 April and spent 12 weeks there. It peaked at number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Stiff Records' biggest selling single to date. A very limited 12\\" pressing was also released. The single has most likely contributed to the confusion over exactly what Ian Dury songs are by 'Ian Dury & The Blockheads' including as it did \\"Wake Up and Make Love with Me\\" on its B-side: this is not a new version of the song re-recorded by the band but the version from New Boots and Panties!! which is not a Blockheads album (although some of the band do play on it). \\"What a Waste\\", however, is a Blockheads track. On their 1998 eponymous album, English indie rock band, theaudience quote the song in the chorus of the track \\"Running Out Of Space\\": 'It's high time for summer and for honesty / when you're drunk you will sing What A Waste', followed by a short phrase on keyboards based on the chorus guitar riff. Reception The song was ranked at No. 3 among the top \\"Tracks of the Year\\" for 1978 by NME. Re-releases and versions =Re-releases= The song was omitted from Do It Yourself in keeping with Dury's then policy of not including singles on albums: the song was not available again until the compilation album Jukebox Dury. The song can be found in abundance today, not only on Dury compilations but on various punk, new wave and rock albums. \\"What a Waste\\" is included as the final track on the Demon Records re-issue of New Boots and Panties!!, and as the first track on the Edsel Records re-issue of Do It Yourself. =Versions= Live versions can be found on both Warts 'n' Audience and Straight from the Desk. Dury re-recorded the song with Curve in 1993 for the Peace Together album. The recording was also included on Curve's 2004 compilation album The Way of Curve. Although the original single omits the exclamation mark, \\"What a Waste\\" is sometimes written with one, including on Live! Warts 'n' Audience.

Una costosa producci√≥n del grupo OCESA que promete, en sus constantes anuncios, entregarnos \\"el bolero como nunca lo hemos escuchado\\". History After successfully presenting ten different Broadway shows in Mexico, OCESA decided to produce their first original musical. A jukebox musical seemed to be the answer, since they were becoming increasingly popular and successful. Timbiriche (a very famous 1980s band in Mexico) was a first choice, but the idea was not appealing enough for older audiences. Another idea was to use Bolero songs from the early 20th century, which are still very popular in Mexico, but again this idea was not good to bring to young audiences, so Federico Gonzalez Compe√°n decided to work with Consuelo Garrido, Lorena Maza and Victor Weinstock to create a musical with two stories, one of two lovers in the 21st century and one with a young couple in the early 1920s. Synopsis The musical is set in two different times and places, the first is Mexico City in 2005 and the other one is Cuba in the 1920s. In 2005 a pianist named Hugo falls in love with Elena, the granddaughter of his neighbor Caridad. Caridad is teaching Elena to sing Boleros for an annual Bolero competition and we learn that when she was younger she was a great singer herself. We go back in time to Cuba where Caridad leaves with her father for Yucat√°n, where she meets Felipe, a young musician. They fall madly in love and decide to run away together, but Caridad's father stops her and they go back to Cuba. Back in 2005 Caridad warns Elena to stay away from Hugo, who reminds her of Felipe. Back in the past Caridad is now a great singer at a nightclub in Mexico City, and one night Felipe, now a very famous musician, goes to the club and finds Caridad. The two are reunited but soon Caridad finds out he is married and runs away heartbroken. Meanwhile, Hugo is trapped in a love triangle between an office colleague and Elena. He decides to break up with his colleague and starts going out with Elena. One day Elena finds Hugo's colleague at his house and is enraged by this. She wins the bolero contest and leaves to Cuba for the finals, leaving Hugo behind. In the 1950s Caridad is back in Cuba at a concert where she finds Felipe who is now divorced. They are together again but suddenly a fight is started at the club and Felipe dies in Caridad's arms. Hugo decides to go to Cuba to find Caridad and in a fight recalling that of Felipe, he is almost killed. The two return to Mexico City with Caridad who gives them her blessing.

Amid the political turmoil of the Glorious Revolution where conspiracy and intrigue are commonplace, fencing master Don Jaime Astarloa tries to live as he always has. Subsisting on meager funds gained through teaching fencing to the sons of the nobility, the anachronistic Don Jaime lives by one universal code: \\"to be honest, or at least honorable--anything, indeed, that has its roots in the word honor.\\" The Fencing Master is presented in the third person with the focus on the protagonist. Historical references The historical context of the novel is similar to what actually occurred in the Glorious Revolution of Spain. Much of the speculation by characters in the novel revolve around General Prim, who did indeed lead the revolution. The events, too, were taken from actual historical record. A concierge, at one point, mentions to Don Jaime that the navy has rebelled in Cadiz, which actually occurred when Admiral Juan Bautista Topete mutinied. Some characters speculated on Serrano, who eventually became regent. Some discussions in the book run contrary to historical fact, such as Carre√±o's guess that Espartero would become regent. Although this did not occur, Espartero was a significant enough man that it would not be out of the question if he did assume the post. Even much of the talk about Queen Isabel II had some basis in fact. Luis de Ayala and Minister Marfori are said to have had intimate relations with the Queen, which is wholly possible due to her alleged nymphomania. Plot summary =Prologue= A minister, later revealed to be Joaquin Vallespin Andreu, uncle of Luis de Ayala, meets with an apparently wealthy blackmailer. Shortly, money and an envelope full of \\"names and addresses\\" changes hands, and the scene ends with a reference to the historical time frame, 1866 during the reign of Queen Isabel. =Chapter 1: The Fencing Bout= Luis de Ayala is a friend of Don Jaime Astarloa, a fencing master, who fences with him every morning. One day after fencing, they talk over glasses of sherry from Andalusia. The subsequent discussion reveals that Luis de Ayala has apparently resolved to abstain from politics despite invitations to resume his post. Luis de Ayala's weakness for love is revealed, as is his propensity for gambling. Later, Luis mentions a Holy Grail, which turns out to be the \\"Treatise on the Art of Fencing,\\" that Don Jaime is working on. The depth of Don Jaime's passion for fencing is revealed by a description of the lengths to which he has gone in search of an \\"unstoppable thrust\\" that is impossible to parry, which he is not sure even exists. Don Jaime spends his time teaching fencing to the sons of the nobility. Since firearms are becoming more prevalent over swords, the fencing master has only a few students left. He repeatedly praises the pupils in front of their parents, often making gross exaggerations about their talent in order to retain his clients. He is serious about teaching his students, reprimanding them when they treat fencing as a sport instead of a combat art. Tired, he takes a break and heads to the Caf√© Progreso to meet with his discussion group. The microcosm of Don Jaime's discussion group, which meets at the Caf√© Progreso, serves as a foil to Don Jaime. C√°rceles the liberal and Don Lucas the conservative quarrel perpetually over politics, which Don Jaime does not care about. Romero, a music teacher, is similar to Don Jaime in that they are both teachers, and both harbour memories of love. However, Don Jaime teaches only males while Romero teaches at a school for girls. Also, Romero lacks the courage to make his love known. Finally, Carre√±o shares none of Don Jaime's honor, flaunting wild political theories as fact in order to gain attention. The first chapter ends with a fencing lesson in which Don Jaime tries to convince his students that swordplay is useful. Rejecting the claim that fencing is just a sport, and denouncing firearms as a weapon of \\"vile highwaymen,\\" he muses about the ethics and mysticism of fencing. When faced with the claim that fencing masters will one day cease to exist, he laments that with them will die \\"all that is noble and honorable about [battle].\\" =Chapter 2: Compound Attack with Two Feints= Don Jaime receives a note to meet a certain Adela de Otero in her home. Upon his arrival, he finds that Adela is not what he expected. He is fascinated with her, paying attention to certain characteristics that he finds odd, such as short fingernails and a small scar near her mouth. She asks him to teach her a secret \\"two hundred Escudo\\" thrust, and he declines with finality, becoming angry when she offers additional money. Later, Adela visits Don Jaime in his own home. At first, he receives her with stiff politeness but she proves herself to be knowledgeable about fencing. After a verbal test, which she passes, Astarloa agrees to teach her the secret thrust. At night, Don Jaime resumes his quest to find the unstoppable thrust. After working on paper, he eventually goes into the fencing gallery to test his theories. As the clock strikes three, Don Jaime begins to doubt the possibility of an unstoppable thrust, hearkening back to the words of his old master. This daydream takes him back to the beginning of his fencing career, in the army. He recalls killing a fellow soldier over a girl, as well as other duels he fought as he learned fencing. In the end of his reflections, he concludes that Adela has come into his life too late. =Chapter 3: Uncertain Time on a False Attack= Adela de Otero arrives at Don Jaime's home for her fencing lesson. She impresses him by requesting that their first bout be fenced without masks. During their bout, he makes a few comments about her excellent technique, though she soon becomes angry when she realizes that he is not fencing to win. After an aggressive barrage of attacks from Adela, Don Jaime disarms her. In their subsequent bouts, Don Jaime is forced to use all his skill to avoid being hit, and is forced to hit his opponent or receive a touch himself. This leads to a rising respect for his opponent, evidenced by his compliments after the bout and the extended exchange they share about his history. De Otero, on the other hand, refuses to divulge anything about her own past. =Chapter 4: The Short Lunge= Don Jaime is with his group of friends at Caf√© Progreso. Don Lucas and C√°rceles, monarchist and republican respectively, argue heatedly while Carre√±o and Romero step in occasionally. C√°rceles blames Queen Isabella and her continual vacillation between liberal and conservative positions for the country's troubles, and warns the others that opposition to her rule is beginning to cross party lines. Don Jaime remains detached from the conversation, until commotion outside forces him to investigate. He returns with the information that several generals have been arrested and taken to a military prison. Later, back in his home, Astarloa teaches Adela de Otero his secret thrust. She learns it quickly, astutely remarking about its simplicity. After asking whether the fencing master had taught it to anyone else, she inquires whether he has ever killed anyone with this thrust. He refuses to answer, silently recalling the image of a man he had killed when he was still a soldier. During his next session with Luis de Ayala, he tells the marquis about Adela. De Ayala takes immediate interest, and seeks to arrange a meeting. Don Jaime glazes over this request, though he denies any interest other than a professional relationship between him and Adela. The conversation takes a turn into politics for a moment, but the focus quickly turns onto Don Jaime himself, when Don Jaime reveals his own personal values with an emphasis on honor. After a few ordinary lessons, Don Jaime finds himself in intimate conversation with Adela. He lets the conversation continue until he feels that he is no longer thinking clearly, at which point he ends the talk and escorts Adela home. While they ride in the carriage together, Adela requests that he let her meet with Luis de Ayala. Reluctantly, he agrees. At the next lesson, the marquis meets with Adela and arranges to meet her, excluding Don Jaime. Soon after, Adela sends a letter thanking him for the lessons and dismissing him from his service. Several evenings later, Don Jaime sees Adela with a mysterious stranger. They leave as soon as Adela sees him. That night, Don Jaime dreams of a doll missing its eyes. One morning, Luis de Ayala uncharacteristically refuses to fence Don Jaime, citing an unsteady hand. He tells Don Jaime that the fencing master is the only man he can trust, and gives him a sealed envelope for safekeeping. =Chapter 5: Glissade= General Prim has begun the revolution and the navy has rebelled. The political atmosphere is in turmoil, evidenced by the newfound vigor with which the group at Caf√© Progreso argues. Don Jaime remains impassive, teaching fencing as usual. Even when there is a small riot outside, he chastises his students for being distracted, lecturing them once again on the importance of tradition. One morning, Luis de Ayala is found dead in his home. When Don Jaime goes to visit for their daily fencing, he is brought in and interrogated. At the crime scene, he noticed with dismay the cause of death: a foil wound in the throat, characteristic of the secret thrust that he had taught Adela. He volunteers little information during the session, eventually suggesting that the police visit Adela de Otero. Campillo, the investigator, informs him that Adela has disappeared. =Chapter 6: An Attack on the Blade= Feeling betrayed that his own thrust would be put to murderous use, Don Jaime tries to analyze the crime. He concludes that de Ayala must have been killed for the papers that he had given earlier in a sealed envelope to Don Jaime. He goes home and begins reading the letters, finding nothing but lists of names and a strange reference to silver mines. Unable to deduce a motive for killing de Ayala, Don Jaime decides to obtain the help of someone well versed in Spanish politics. He finds C√°rceles at Caf√© Progreso and persuades him to help. While C√°rceles is in the middle of a discovery, Campillo knocks on the door. Informed that he must go with the police, Astarloa leaves C√°rceles temporarily with the documents. He is taken to the morgue, where he is shown the mutilated body of what seems to be Adela de Otero. The corpse is wearing Adela's ring, and looks similar to Adela, leading Don Jaime to believe that it is the body of his former student. =Chapter 7: The Appel= Again, Don Jaime is interrogated, but volunteers little information. He learns that he is under surveillance, due to his having a link to two murders, and that Adela's maid, Lucia, has been dismissed. He leaves, resolving to avenge Adela. Don Jaime returns to his home to find that C√°rceles is missing. He forces entry into C√°rceles' home, only to find his friend strapped into his bed, tortured out of his mind with a mass of razor cuts. In the darkness, he is ambushed by two assassins. Armed with his cane-sword, he deals two stab wounds to one and breaks the nose of the other. The assassins escape the watchmen, leaving Don Jaime again to answer Campillo's questions. Seeing that he has made a mistake in keeping information from the police, Don Jaime tells Campillo everything that he knows. While the policeman is disappointed in Don Jaime's naivety, he is impressed with his courage. C√°rceles dies in the hospital from his wounds, and Don Jaime is allowed to go. Campillo warns him to keep his weapon close, since he is now the last link in the crimes. =Chapter 8: With Bare Blades= Though certain now that his life is in danger, Don Jaime decides not to flee the country. He sits by the door to his home with his gun and cane-sword, waiting for his inevitable assailant. After several false starts, someone finally arrives. It is Adela de Otero. He discovers the secret letter, which was dropped when he initially opened the envelope. The secret of a man named Cazorla Longo, who presumably engineered the murders, is revealed. Adela tries to no avail to get the letter, eventually attempting to seduce Don Jaime and then stab him with a hairpin. After the attempt fails, Adela de Otero picks up the cane sword and attacks. Pursued into the gallery, Don Jaime searches futilely for a weapon. Eventually, he settles for a blunted practice foil. The ensuing duel leaves Don Jaime wounded in his side. Finally, Don Jaime employs a redoublement, cutting over Adela's arm for a lethal thrust through her eye into her brain. The end of the novel finds Don Jaime standing before his mirror, still searching for the perfect, unstoppable thrust.

The La Sal Mountains sit on the arid Colorado Plateau, near such famous desert landmarks as Canyonlands National Park and Arches National Park. However, due to their height, the La Sals are heavily forested and usually snow-capped until early summer (there is one snowfield on the north side that usually lasts year round).Michael R.

Mount Peale can be accessed from various directions, but is most commonly climbed from the area of La Sal Pass, , about to the southwest of the peak. La Sal Pass is accessed from the southeast via a graded gravel road. From the pass the summit is obtained by a short but steep off-trail hike of about with about of elevation gain.

Headquartered in Helena, Montana, the organization holds 897 easements on 1,137,062 acres of private property across the state. It is the largest land trust in the State of Montana, the largest state-based land trust in the United States, and is accredited by the Land Trust Alliance.  Mission and History  The Montana Land Reliance was founded in 1978. Its mission is to partner \\"with private landowners to permanently protect agricultural lands, fish and wildlife habitat, and open space.\\" In 1981, when the organization penned its original mission, the Board and organization's leaders determined that ‚ÄúThe immediate accomplishments of MLR‚Äôs conservation work are measured in miles of streambanks and acres of land and habitat protected. The lasting benefits of MLR‚Äôs work are the perpetuation of a lifestyle and an economy that rely on responsibly managed private land and increasingly valuable Montana open spaces that will continue to nourish the spirit of future generations.\\" Although MLR has traditionally worked with agricultural producers to protect the environmental and economic integrity of Montana in the face of increased development, it has more recently found conservation allies in recreational landowners. Each of the organization‚Äôs easements contributes to the preservation of wildlife habitat and ecosystems, open space, and the economic and recreational land uses unique to the State of Montana. 400x400px  Conservation Easements  A conservation easement is a voluntary legal agreement between a landowner and a land trust that limits the uses of the land in order to protect its conservation values. The landowner ‚Äì the conservation easement donor ‚Äì retains title to the property. Regardless of changes in ownership, however, the conservation easement runs with the title, thereby protecting the land in perpetuity, for example from inappropriate development. Total acreage under easement: 1,137,062 Total acreage by resource * Range/Forests: 950,018 * Elk habitat: 584,423 * Wetlands: 68,955 Miles of stream frontage protected: 1,829 none  Ecosystem Services  Ecosystem services are the products of nature that benefit people, and include services such as water and air filtration. Each ecosystem service is quantifiable, which enables one to determine a return on investment in conservation in the value of what an acre of conserved land gives back to people on an annual basis. The Montana Land Reliance has found that its protected acres return over $300,000,000 annually in ecosystem services.  Ruby Habitat Foundation  frameless Ruby Habitat Foundation is a 509(a)(3) support organization for The Montana Land Reliance, founded in 2002. The Foundation manages a 1,100-acre ranch in Sheridan, Montana, through which runs 4 miles of the Ruby River, a man made spring creek, and Clear Creek, a braid of the Ruby River. In addition to managing a fishing and hunting program for visitors from around the country, it is an experimental property on which the Foundation conducts experiments to establish agricultural and recreational best practices.

He was a four-year standout in football and judo in high school, both at Lake Havasu High School in Arizona and at Bishop Gorman High School in Summerlin, Nevada, where he was recognized nationally. High school career Reynolds was a four-year letterman, two years at Lake Havasu High School and two years at Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas. He showed his athleticism and versatility, playing linebacker and defensive back on defense and tight end and fullback on offense. He was also a state wrestling champion and a five-time national judo champion. A View Newspaper article called Reynolds the 'most highly recruited high school football player in Nevada history'. As a senior, he recorded 94 tackles (including 12 tackles for loss) and 6 sacks to go along with his junior year totals of 96 tackles and 6 sacks. As a junior, he also ran for a career best 393 yards from his fullback position. He was recognized at the Palo Alto Nike training camp in 2004 for his performance in their SPARQ (Speed, Power, Agility, Reaction, and Quickness) test. He scored higher on the test than any player in the Camp's history. As a senior, he was a USA Today first team All-American, a Parade All-American (a publication that also recognized him as the top linebacker in the country), a U.S. Army All- American, and Nevada's Gatorade player of the year. Rivals.com and ESPN.com both ranked him the No. 2 outside LB in the nation. He was a consensus top 30 player nationally and Rivals.com placed him as the best player in the state of Nevada. He was also selected as the Las Vegas Sun state defensive player of the year. Reynolds was awarded the 2005 Walter Payton Trophy at the US Army All-American Bowl awards dinner. At Bishop Gorman, Reynolds was a high school teammate of fellow OU Sooner DeMarco Murray. College career =2005 and 2006 seasons= Reynolds was relegated to special teams as a true freshman, logging tackles against Oklahoma State, Nebraska, and Tulsa. Although he was penciled in as a starter for the Sooners, Reynolds injured his ACL after spring practices and was redshirted for the 2006 Sooners. =2007 and 2008 seasons= As a redshirt sophomore in 2007, Reynolds appeared in 13 games and recorded 60 total tackles. As a redshirt junior in 2008, he appeared in only six games and recorded 44 tackles. =2009 season= In 2009, Reynolds recorded 79 total tackles to rank third on the Sooners team behind Travis Lewis and Quinton Carter. In December, 2009, the NCAA denied Reynolds his request to play a sixth year due to injuries. Reynolds told a reporter at the completion of his college career that he had no interest in pursuing an NFL career.

The notations given in the Wikipedia article define the original function : \\\\vartheta_{00}(z; \\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp (\\\\pi i n^2 \\\\tau + 2 \\\\pi i n z) which is equivalent to : \\\\vartheta_{00}(z, q) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty q^{n^2} \\\\exp (2 \\\\pi i n z) However, a similar notation is defined somewhat differently in Whittaker and Watson, p. 487: : \\\\vartheta_{0,0}(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty q^{n^2} \\\\exp (2 \\\\pi i n x/a) This notation is attributed to \\"Hermite, H.J.S. Smith and some other mathematicians\\". They also define : \\\\vartheta_{1,1}(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty (-1)^n q^{(n+1/2)^2} \\\\exp (\\\\pi i (2 n + 1) x/a) This is a factor of i off from the definition of \\\\vartheta_{11} as defined in the Wikipedia article. These definitions can be made at least proportional by x = za, but other definitions cannot. Whittaker and Watson, Abramowitz and Stegun, and Gradshteyn and Ryzhik all follow Tannery and Molk, in which : \\\\vartheta_1(z) = -i \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty (-1)^n q^{(n+1/2)^2} \\\\exp ((2 n + 1) i z) : \\\\vartheta_2(z) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty q^{(n+1/2)^2} \\\\exp ((2 n + 1) i z) : \\\\vartheta_3(z) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty q^{n^2} \\\\exp (2 n i z) : \\\\vartheta_4(z) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty (-1)^n q^{n^2} \\\\exp (2 n i z) Note that there is no factor of œÄ in the argument as in the previous definitions. Whittaker and Watson refer to still other definitions of \\\\vartheta_j. The warning in Abramowitz and Stegun, \\"There is a bewildering variety of notations...in consulting books caution should be exercised,\\" may be viewed as an understatement. In any expression, an occurrence of \\\\vartheta(z) should not be assumed to have any particular definition. It is incumbent upon the author to state what definition of \\\\vartheta(z) is intended.

He was signed by the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Later that year he became the placekicker for the New Orleans Saints, for whom he set an NFL record (now surpassed) for most consecutive successful field goals to start a career, and then became the first kicker in NFL history to convert three field goals of more than 40 yards in the Super Bowl. He played college football at Oklahoma. Hartley has also played for the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Early years Hartley prepped at Carroll High School in Southlake, Texas, where he was coached by former North Texas coach Todd Dodge. He set a state record with 90 PAT's in 2002 (surpassed by Carroll Dragon, Kevin Ortega, in 2004 and then another Carroll Dragon, Cade Foster, in 2009). Coming out of Carroll, Hartley was rated as the 2nd best placekicker in the country, by Rivals.com. College career Hartley began his college career at Oklahoma in 2004. He spent most of his first season redshirted, but after inconsistent play from Trey Dicarlo, head coach Bob Stoops decided to pull Hartley's redshirt and start him. He only played in three games during his abbreviated first season and finished 1-for-1 on field goals and 12-for-12 on extra points with his only field goal coming in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game. Hartley struggled during his sophomore year, missing eight of his 22 field goal attempts despite making two field goals from beyond 50 yards. He went 37 of 38 in extra points attempts. Hartley broke out during his junior season going 19-for-20 in field goals and 49-for-50 in extra points. Hartley's .950 field goal percentage was among the highest during the season and earned him a nomination for the Lou Groza Award which goes to the nation's best placekicker. Hartley's only miss of the season came during a controversial loss to Oregon when a 44-yard kick was blocked after Hartley had already successfully made four field goals. Hartley's senior season did not quite match the level of performance of the year before. He finished going 13-for-15 in field goals and 71-for-77 in extra points. Professional career =Denver Broncos= Hartley was not drafted during the 2008 NFL draft but he signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos. However, he was released on July 21 just before the start of training camp. =New Orleans Saints= Hartley on November 16, 2008 in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs Hartley was signed by the New Orleans Saints on October 29, 2008 to replace Taylor Mehlhaff, who was released. He played in his first game on November 9, 2008 against the Atlanta Falcons. Hartley came out strong, booting 13 for 13 field goal attempts for the 2008 season. He was expected to be the Saints starting kicker for the 2009 season. However, Hartley was given a 4-game suspension after testing positive for a banned stimulant, Adderall.http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2009/08/its_official_new_orleans_saint.html Hartley remained inactive (while longtime Saints kicker John Carney handled the kicking duties) until the Saints' twelfth game of the season, against the Washington Redskins. Hartley then kicked four field goals, including the game winning kick in overtime that allowed the Saints to preserve their undefeated record.Bradley Handwerger, \\"Saints kicker Hartley makes most of opportunity\\", WWL-TV.com, December 9, 2009 (retrieved December 10, 2009). He missed the first field goal of his professional career in this game, from 58 yards. He held the NFL record for most consecutive field goals made to start a career, with 16 until the record was broken in 2012 by Kai Forbath of the Washington Redskins.http://www.neworleanssaints.com/team/roster/garrett- hartley/d919b513-e24b-4cd8-a03f-efe66302b08c On January 24, 2010, he made a 40-yard field goal in overtime against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship game to send the New Orleans Saints to their first Super Bowl.\\"Saints defeat the Vikings in overtime to earn first Super Bowl berth\\", Los Angeles Times, January 24, 2010 (retrieved January 24, 2010). He continued in Super Bowl XLIV, going 3-for-3 with field goals of 46, 44, and 47 yards. He became the first kicker in Super Bowl history to convert three field goals of 40 yards or more.Ralph Vacchiano, \\"New Orleans Saints kicker Garrett Hartley makes three field goals, helps boot Indianapolis Colts\\", New York Daily News, February 7, 2010 (retrieved February 8, 2010). The 2010 season began erratically for Hartley. He missed 2 field goal attempts in the Saints' Week 1 home win over Minnesota, then made 3 kicks despite windy conditions in a Week 2 win at San Francisco. In a Week 3 match with Atlanta, he made a last-second field goal to send the game into overtime, but then missed a 29-yard field goal attempt in overtime that would have won the game. In response, the Saints re-signed John Carney,\\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/09/espn- john-carney-to-kick-sunday-for-philadelphia-eagles/1\\", ESPN, September 30, 2010. and Hartley was inactive for the next 2 games. With injuries mounting at other positions, however, the Saints decided not to continue carrying 2 kickers, cutting Carney and returning Hartley to his starting position. He later signed a contract extension that was reported to make him the highest paid kicker in the game.Sheldon Mickles, \\"Payton discusses why Saints let go of Carney\\", The Advocate, October 14, 2010.

The procedure is known as ebullioscopy. The first ebullioscope was invented in 1838 by Honor√© Brossard-Vidal, and was used for measuring alcoholic content. The advantage of this method was that the boiling point is relatively insensitive to other components such as sugars.

Its highest peak is the Taburno, at 1,393 m. It is composed of two groups of calcareous mountains separated by a plain. The fauna is affected by human activities, but the birdlife is very diverse. Several historical structures, mainly religious, are located on the massif. A DOC wine is produced in the area. History The Romans knew the mountain with the name Taburnus. It lay in the Caudine part of the Samnium, near the location of the famous Battle of the Caudine Forks. The name seems to come from the Oscan language. The mountain was mentioned by Virgil in the Aeneid and in the Georgics, where he described it as \\"mighty\\". In his Cynegeticon, Gratius Faliscus described the mountain as \\"craggy\\". Bands of brigands used the massif as a refuge and a base for their activities, especially immediately after the unification of Italy. Geography and geology Aerial view of the massif, with the Taburno group in the foreground and Camposauro in the background. View of the Camposauro group from the Taburno, with the Prata Plain in the foreground. Taburno Camposauro is an isolated calcareous massif in the Campanian Apennines whose formation dates back to the Mesozoic. It lacks superficial waters. Karst phenomena including hollows and caves are frequent on the massif. The southern slopes are much steeper and more craggy than the northern ones. Because of the type of clay and the fossil sand found there it is believed that in the mid-Pliocene there was a shallow sea in the area. The oldest limestone rocks in the province are found on the massif. At the foot of the southern group is the Fizzo source, that provides water to the Royal Palace of Caserta via the Aqueduct of Vanvitelli. It is located west of Benevento, and it falls wholly within its province. It is composed of two groups of mountains, the Taburno in the south and the Camposauro in the north, separated by the Prata plain. The Valle Telesina separates the Taburno Camposauro from the Matese mountains, while the densely settled Valle Caudina separates it from the Partenio massif. The highest peaks are: Taburno (1393 m), Camposauro (1390 m), Alto Rotondi (1305 m), Gaudello (1226 m), Sant'Angelo (1189 m), and Pentime (1168 m), which are placed in a semicircle thus shaping the Vitulano Valley in the center. Its territory is shared by fourteen comuni: Bonea, Bucciano, Cautano, Foglianise, Frasso Telesino, Melizzano, Moiano, Montesarchio, Paupisi, Sant'Agata de' Goti, Solopaca, Tocco Caudio, Torrecuso and Vitulano. The tallest peak is in the municipality of Bonea. Seen from Benevento the profile of the mountain resembles a sleeping woman; for this reason it is referred to as ‚ÄúSamnium‚Äôs sleeper‚Äù (la dormiente del Sannio). The massif is protected as part of the Regional Park of Taburno-Camposauro, which extends for 12,370 hectares, with a total population of about 25,000. The rocky southern slopes of Mount Taburno with Montesarchio in the foreground. Fauna The fauna of the massif is varied. Although the pressure from human activities led to the disappearance of rare species from the area, and the lack of water courses limits the variety of species, the Taburno Camposauro hosts the most diverse fauna in the province of Benevento, due to the many different environments. Because of this diversity, bird species are abundant: 94 have been observed, of whom 75 nesting species. The common raven, the common buzzard, the Eurasian nuthatch, redwings and several Passerine species can be seen on the massif. Mammals are affected by human encroachment and extensive road infrastructure. Most common are rodents, bats, European hedgehogs, moles and foxes. The presence of wolves is uncertain: they are thought to pass through the area during their movements, but a stable population has never been observed. Hares and boars found on the massif were originally introduced for hunting reasons. The number of amphibians is affected by the lack of water. The common toad and, more rarely, the European green toad can be found in the gullies, while near the springs at a lower altitude are the Italian tree frog and the Italian stream frog. The presence of two snakes is known, the four-lined snake and the Aesculapian snake, while several smaller reptiles inhabit the massif, among which the Italian wall lizard and the gecko. Flora Under 800 metres above sea level, the impact of human activities is strong, and the vegetation is mostly olive trees in the Taburno group and vineyards in the Camposauro group. Between 800 and 1000 metres of elevation the flora is mainly Fraxinus ornus, Carpinus orientalis, Ostrya carpinifolia and field elm. Above 1000 metres of elevation, the trees that dominate the Taburno are the European silver fir and the beech, accompanied by plants such as common holly and belladonna, while the Camposauro has a mixed woodland, with a prevalence of evergreen oak in the northwest and on the peak, and the presence of downy oak and maple on the northern slopes. The European silver firs found on the Taburno were planted by the Bourbons around 1846, and are now part of the State-Owned Forest of Taburno (Foresta demaniale del Taburno), which extends for 614 hectares and hosts mostly beeches. Landmarks The Santa Maria in Gruptis abbey The ruins of the abbey of Santa Maria in Gruptis are located in the Camposauro group, on the side of a gorge overlooking the Valle Telesina. It was founded in the 10th century and used by several monastic orders, before being deconsecrated in 1705. On the southern slopes of Mount Taburno, in the comune of Bucciano, is the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Taburnus, built at the end of the 15th century and used by Dominican friars. The complex includes a church, a convent, a cloister and a bell-tower. After falling into disrepair, it was slowly restored starting in 1892. In the Taburno group there are the ruins of the Casina Reale, a hunting lodge used by the Bourbon royalty. The rocky southern mountainside hosts several caves, among which is Saint Simeon's cave, with frescoes dating back to 1600. In the northeastern part of the massif, high above Vitulano, is the Hermitage of Saint Mennas built in the 9th century. On the exact point of the tallest peak of the massif is a large cross with a CAI summit book. Wine production Vineyards in Solopaca, at the foot of the massif. Italian wine, both red, white, rose and sparkling, under the Taburno DOC appellation comes from vineyards in the foothills around the mountains in Campania. Grapes destined for DOC production must be harvested up to a maximum yield of 13 tonnes/hectare with the finished wines fermented to a minimum alcohol level of 11%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 136 Firefly Books 2004 The Taburno DOC is currently a subzone of the Sannio DOC label. Red and rose Taburno is a blend of 40-50% Sangiovese, 30-40% Aglianico with up to 30% of other grape varieties (both red and white), such as Barbera del Sannio, permitted to fill in the remainder of the blend. The whites are made from 40-50% Trebbiano, 30-40% Falanghina and up to 30% of other local white grape varieties. A sparkling spumante is produced under the Taburno DOC from a minimum 60% blend of Coda di Volpe and/or Falanghina with other local white varieties permitted to fill in up to 40% of the blend. Taburno wines labeled as Riserva must attain a minimum alcohol level of 12% and be aged for at least three years prior to release.

In tandem with The Ex's drummer Katrin, Rosemarie also contributed significant female vocal harmonies to the album. The album received critical acclaim and has been singled out by many publications as the band's best album yet. Background & Recording Turn is The Ex's sole studio album to feature contrabassist Rozemarie Heggen, pictured here with bandmates G.W.

He is best known for his novels The Anointed and The Great American Novel, though he wrote more than 15 books. Life and career Clyde Brion Davis was born on May 22, 1894, in Unadilla, Nebraska, to Charles Nelson and Isabel Brion Davis. His father was a friend and strong supporter of the legendary Nebraska politician William Jennings Bryan. A year after the boy's birth, the Davis family moved to Missouri, where Davis attended schools in Chillicothe and Kansas City. At 14, he quit school and was employed in several jobs including printer's apprentice, steamfitter's helper, chimney sweep, electrician, detective and journalist. In 1916, Davis gained his first experience in journalism, working with the Denver Times and Albuquerque Morning Journal. He acquired further experience in journalism writing for the Army newspaper The Pontanezan Duckboard while serving in the United States Army Intelligence Corps (1917-1919) during World War I. Upon his return to the United States, Davis, with the exception of a few months working for the Burns Detective Agency, spent the years between 1919 and 1937 working for various newspapers, including Denver Post (1919), Rocky Mountain News (1920-1922), San Francisco Examiner (1921), Seattle Post-Intelligencer (1930), and Buffalo Times (1931-1937). Davis' fiction efforts were first published by a number of pulp magazines during the 1920s. In 1926, he married artist and writer Martha Wirt. Their only child, David Brion Davis, was born on February 16, 1927, in Denver, Colorado. Davis resided in Hamburg, New York in the late 1930s. He wrote a number of novels and short stories before the publication of his novel The Anointed in 1937. The Book of the Month Club chose The Anointed as its selection for August 1937 and MGM adapted the novel in 1945 to the MGM movie Adventure starring Clark Gable and Greer Garson. Following the success of The Anointed, Davis left journalism for a career in creative writing. For the most part he focused on writing novels and short stories, other than a brief period of syndicate work in Europe for PM and Knight newspapers in 1941, two months in Hollywood as a screenwriter, and two years as an associate editor for Rinehart and Company (1943-1945). Davis was awarded a Huntington Hartford fellowship for the years 1956-1957. Over his career, he wrote more than 20 novels, including The Great American Novel (1938) and The Rebellion of Leo Maguire (1944). The Anointed is about an uneducated egotist who, convinced God has some great purpose in view for him, travels the globe and then takes up book-learning to discover what it is. The Great American Novel (1938) is a humorous novel about a newspaperman who dreams of writing the Great American Novel, but never has the time. His memoir The Age of Indiscretion (1950) was a curmudgeonly retort to nostalgia for the \\"good old days\\" circa 1900. He argued that the America of the mid-20th century was not only richer and healthier than the America of his boyhood, but also happier and more moral. In 1946, Davis and his family moved to Salisbury, Connecticut, where he was an active citizen (serving as Justice of the Peace between 1947 and 1957) until his death in Salisbury on July 19, 1962. His last novel, Shadow of a Day, was published posthumously.

Musick Rebecca Nurse (February 21, 1621 ‚Äì July 19, 1692) was accused of witchcraft and executed in New England during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. She was fully exonerated less than twenty years later. She was the wife of Francis Nurse, with several children and grandchildren, and a well-respected member of the community. She was tried, convicted, in the spring and summer of 1692 and executed on July 19. This occurred during a time when parts of the government and people of the Province of Massachusetts Bay were seized with witch-phobia. Her married sisters Mary Eastey and Sarah Cloyce were also accused. Mary was convicted and executed, but Sarah managed to survive. Early life The daughter of William (c. 1598‚Äì1672) and Joanna Towne (c. 1595/99‚Äì1682) (n√©e Blessing), Rebecca was born in Great Yarmouth, England in 1621. Born February 13, 1621, her baptism is recorded as February 21, 1621. Her family emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, settling in Salem, although most of the Towne family would eventually move inland to Topsfield. Rebecca had three sisters, Susan (baptized October 26, 1625; died July 29, 1630), Mary (baptized August 24, 1634; executed 1692) and Sarah. She also had three brothers, Edmund (baptized June 1628), Jacob (baptized March 11, 1631 or 1632) and Joseph (born c. 1639). Sometime around 1644, she married Francis Nurse (or Nourse; 1618-1695), who was also born in England.Hill, Frances Delusion of Satan Her husband was a \\"tray maker\\" by trade, who likely made many other wooden household items. Due to the rarity of such household goods, such artisans were esteemed. They raised their family in Salem Town (modern day Salem, Massachusetts). The couple had eight children: four daughters and four sons. Their names were John Nurse (born 1645), Rebecca Nurse (born 1647), Samuel Nurse (born 1649), Elizabeth Nurse (born 1655 or 1656), Mary Nurse (born 1657 - 28 June 1749), Francis Nurse (born 1660 or 1661), Sarah Nurse (born 1662) and Benjamin Nurse (born in 1665 or 1666). In 1672, Francis Nurse served as Salem's Constable. It was later written that Rebecca had \\"acquired a reputation for exemplary piety that was virtually unchallenged in the community,\\" making her one of the \\"unlikely\\" persons to be accused of witchcraft. In 1678 they were offered the opportunity to lease-to- own a farm in the rural village area of Salem (today Danvers, Massachusetts), originally a part of a grant given to Townsend Bishop in 1636. This farm still exists, and is today preserved as the Rebecca Nurse Homestead. Rebecca and Francis frequented the Salem Village meeting house and Francis was quite active in the community becoming well respected in Salem Village; he was often asked to serve as mediator to help settle matters. The Nurses officially remained members to the Salem Towne church until their deaths, despite being very active within the village community. In 1699 the Nurses' children were able to officially purchase the farm outright and remained for multiple generations. Accusation and trial On March 23, 1692, a warrant was issued for her arrest based upon accusations made by Edward and John Putnam. Upon hearing of the accusations, the frail 71-year-old Nurse, often described as an invalid, said, \\"I am innocent as the child unborn, but surely, what sin hath God found out in me unrepented of, that He should lay such an affliction on me in my old age.\\"Hill, Frances Delusion of Satan-the Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials London Hamish Hamilton Ltd. 1996 p.88 A public outcry greeted the accusations made against her, as she was considered to be a woman of very pious character, who lived in amity with her neighbours, and had a reputation for benevolence as well as piety: even her neighbor Sarah Holton, who had accused Rebecca of acting quite unreasonably in a quarrel over some trespassing pigs, later changed her mind and spoke in Rebecca's defence.Hill p.100 Thirty-nine of the most prominent members of the community signed a petition on Nurse's behalf. At age 71, she was one of the oldest accused. The examining magistrates, John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, who normally regarded the guilt of the accused as self-evident, took a notably different attitude in Rebecca's case, as they also did in the case of her sister Mary Eastey. They told Rebecca openly that if she was innocent, they prayed that God would show her innocence, for \\"it is a sad thing to see church members accused\\".Starkey, Marion L. The Devil in Massachusetts Doubleday edition 1989 p.82 Hathorne was no doubt influenced by the fact that his sister Elizabeth Porter was a close friend of Rebecca, and one of her staunchest defenders.Hill p.87 Her trial began on June 30, 1692. In accordance with the procedures at the time, Mrs. Nurse, like others accused of witchcraft, represented herself since she was not allowed to have a lawyer. By dint of her respectability, many members of the community testified on her behalf, including her family members. Often the \\"afflicted\\" would break into fits and claim Nurse was tormenting them. Such so-called \\"spectral evidence\\" was allowed into the trial to show that Satan was afflicting others in the community at the behest of the accused. In response to their outbursts Nurse stated, \\"I have got nobody to look to but God.\\" In the end, the jury ruled Nurse not guilty. Due to the public outcry and renewed fits and spasms by the \\"afflicted\\", the judges reviewed her case with the jury. One particular point was emphasized, and the jury requested a second chance of deliberation (a legal practice used in those days). The jury asked Rebecca to explain her remark that another accused witch, Deliverance Hobbs, was \\"of her company\\", the implication being that they had both signed a pact with the Devil. Fatally, Rebecca, who was hard of hearing, did not hear the question: she later explained to her children that she was referring to this woman as a fellow \\"accused\\" witch. However the jury had changed their verdict and sentenced Nurse to death on July 19, 1692. In view of the urgent pleas of her family, and the abundant evidence of her good character, including a moving letter from the foreman of Nurse's jury, the Governor of Massachusetts, Sir William Phips, granted a reprieve, only for it to later be rescinded. Death and aftermath The Rebecca Nurse Homestead in 2006 Many people described Nurse as \\"the woman of self-dignity\\", due to her collected behavior on the gallows. As was the custom, after she was hanged, her body was buried in a shallow grave near the execution spot. They were considered unfit for a Christian burial in a churchyard. According to oral tradition, Nurse's family secretly returned after dark and dug up her body, which they interred properly on their family homestead. Although her exact resting place has never been confirmed her descendants erected a tall granite memorial in the family plot in 1885 at the Rebecca Nurse Homestead cemetery in Danvers (formerly Salem Village), Massachusetts. The inscription on the monument reads: :Rebecca Nurse, Yarmouth, England 1621. Salem, Mass., 1692. :O Christian Martyr who for Truth could die :When all about thee owned the hideous lie! :The world redeemed from Superstition's sway :Is breathing freer for thy sake today. :(From the poem \\"Christian Martyr,\\" by John Greenleaf Whittier) In 1706, her accuser, Ann Putnam, Jr., gave a public church confession upon entering the Salem Village congregation. She expressed great remorse for her role against Rebecca and her two sisters, Mary Eastey and Sarah Cloyce, in particular: \\"I desire to be humbled before God for that sad and humbling providence that befell my father's family in the year about '92; that I, then being in my childhood, should, by such a providence of God, be made an instrument for the accusing of several persons of a grievous crime, whereby their lives were taken away from them, whom now I have just grounds and good reason to believe they were innocent persons; and that it was a great delusion of Satan that deceived me in that sad time, whereby I justly fear I have been instrumental, with others, though ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon myself and this land the guilt of innocent blood; though what was said or done by me against any person I can truly and uprightly say, before God and man, I did it not out of any anger, malice, or ill-will to any person, for I had no such thing against one of them; but what I did was ignorantly, being deluded by Satan. And particularly, as I was a chief instrument of accusing of Goodwife Nurse and her two sisters, I desire to lie in the dust, and to be humbled for it, in that I was a cause, with others, of so sad a calamity to them and their families; for which cause I desire to lie in the dust, and earnestly beg forgiveness of God, and from all those unto whom I have given just cause of sorrow and offense, whose relations were taken away or accused.\\" The Nurse family accepted Ann's apology and were reconciled with her:Starkey p.260 by contrast, they never forgave Samuel Parris, the village minister, whom they held personally to blame for their bereavement - \\"none can know what we suffered by the loss of such a mother\\" - and they did not rest until Parris was removed from office in 1697.Hill p.214 In 1711, her children petitioned the government for a reversal of attainer and were granted compensation for Rebecca's wrongful death. In 1712, the Salem Towne church reversed the verdict of excommunication it had passed on her: \\"that it be no longer a reproach to her memory or an occasion of grief to her children\\".Starkey p.268 In 1892, the community erected a second monument recognizing the 40 neighbors, led by Israel and Elizabeth (Hathorne) Porter, who took the risk of publicly supporting Nurse by signing a petition to the court on her behalf in 1692. One signer was General Israel Putnam's father. The Nurse family remained in the home for many generations. Eventually the Nurse family homestead was sold to Phineas Putnam, a cousin of Rebecca's great-great grandson Benjamin, in 1784. The Putnam family remained until about 1905. By 1909 the farm was saved by volunteers and turned into a historic house museum that includes the original house and cemetery, on 27 of the original of land. In popular culture Henry Peterson Nurse's trial was featured in an episode of the CBS radio program \\"CBS Is There,\\" which aired on July 28, 1947. Rebecca Nurse is a central character in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible. In the original Broadway production in 1953 she was played by Jean Adair, who died shortly afterwards. This work was adapted for films in 1957 and 1996; Nurse was portrayed by actresses Marguerite Coutan-Lambert and Elizabeth Lawrence, respectively. In the first and much acclaimed television adaption by the BBC in 1980 she was played by Ann Dyson. She is likewise a major character in Robert Ward‚Äôs Pulitzer Prize-winning operatic adaptation of Miller‚Äôs play. She inspired other dramatic treatments of the Salem Witch Trials. The PBS film Three Sovereigns For Sarah features Vanessa Redgrave as one of Rebecca Nurse's sisters, Sarah Cloyce; although accused, she escaped execution. The film depicts Nurse and her family members as the main characters. Rebecca was portrayed by actress Shirley MacLaine in the 2002 CBS miniseries, Salem Witch Trials. Nurse was the subject of Lectures on Witchcraft by Charles W. Upham. She is also mentioned in passing in Robin Cook's suspense novel Acceptable Risk. A fictional character believes her to be pious and registers surprise when seeing Nurse on her way to her execution.. Nurse can also be found as a supporting character in Katherine Howe's historical fiction, The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane.Howe, Katherine (2009).\\"The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane\\", Hyperion, 1401340903. In Howe's novel, Nurse is used as a character foil for the main character, Deliverance Dane. Rebecca's main appearances and dialogue can be found during the scenes of the sentencing and execution of those accused of witchcraft. References Further reading Upham, Charles (1980).

As of the 2010 census, its population was 4,431 and it contained 1,728 housing units. Peotone was formed from the eastern half of Wilton Township at an unknown date. It has towns of Andres and Peotone. Interstate 57, Route 50, Route 45, and Route 52 are major routes. Geography According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , of which (or 99.83%) is land and (or 0.17%) is water. A description of the township appears at the bottom of the 1873 plat atlas and it reads \\"...This is an entirely prairie township which a rich, fertile soil, and for agricultural purposes and grain raising is second, perhaps, to none in the county.\\" The land of Peotone Township is very gently rolling and becomes even flatter as you move south in the township. The major waterways in Peotone township include the South Branch Forked Creek, Rock Creek, and Black Creek. Other water includes the Peotone Park District. Demographics Infrastructure In the 1960s Interstate 57 was built and it passes through the east half of Peotone Township. An exit and entrance ramp off the interstate serves as a main entrance to the town of Peotone. While I-57 borders Peotone's west village limits, Route 50 passes through the east side of town. Many of Peotone's businesses are located on along Route 50. Running parallel to Route 50 for much of its path through Peotone Township is the Canadian National Railway. The village of Peotone sprung up alongside this railroad in 1856. The railroad is what brought early settlers to the township. Another main route that passes through Peotone Township is Route 45. Running east of the townships west boundary is the two-lane highway. The Peotone Township stretch of Route 45 was completely resurfaced during the summer of 2008, following a winter full of angry motorists complaining about the serious pothole condition of the highway, which had gotten to be a public safety hazzard. Events Peotone is known county-wide for the Will County Fair the town has hosted for more than 100 years. At the northwest corner of Peotone- Wilmington Road and West Street, the Will County Fairgrounds provides a great place to meet up with friends and family and say goodbye to summer every August.

She co-founded personal-care product manufacturer Tom's of Maine in 1970 as well as wool clothing manufacturer Ramblers Way in 2010 with her husband Tom Chappell.  Biography  Katherine Pope Cheney was born in 1942 in Hartford, Connecticut. Her parents were George Wells Cheney, Jr., an insurance executive, and Mary Frances Pope, a trained artist. She is descended from the founders of Manchester's Cheney Brothers Silk Company, brothers Ward, Rush, and Frank. It became the largest silk mill in the country at the time, and the family opened other textile mills including one for velvet. The Cheney family included accomplished artists; John Cheney was an engraver, and Seth Wells Cheney created portraits. A number of Seth's works were donated to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The Cheney home was turned into a museum which is managed by the Manchester Historical Society. Chappell is a 1963 graduate of Oxford School in West Hartford, Connecticut. She attended Chatham College and Sarah Lawrence College before she and her husband, Tom Chappell, moved to Kennebunk, Maine in 1968 to raise their family. As of 2010, Kate and Tom share a summer home on Monhegan, Maine. Chappell became the Vice President of Tom's of Maine, starting the business jointly with her husband after they developed a saccharine-free, natural toothpaste for their children. It was the first natural toothpaste to receive the American Dental Association's seal of acceptance. Her artistic skills were utilized in overseeing the packaging, advertising and media for the company. She also attended the Sorbonne and the University of Southern Maine, where she graduated summa cum laude in 1983 with an A.B. dgree in Communications after an 18-year hiatus from college. Chappell founded the Kate Cheney Chappell '83 Center for Book Arts at the University of Southern Maine, which was launched in 2008, and serves as Chairwoman on the Advisory Board.

The clothing is made from American-raised Rambouillet sheep wool, silk thread, and vegetable dyes, and spinning, weaving, and knitting is done in East coast states to keep the sourcing local and sustainable. The silk thread used is a reminder of the Cheney mills, which Chappell recalled still functioning in her youth when she would go to the Cheney Hall remnant room with her mother. Recognition In 2009, Chappell was one of five women to receive the Deborah Morton award from the University of New England that year.

He contributed to the translation of Christian religious texts into the Dakota language. The hymnal Dakota dowanpi kin, was \\"composed by J. Renville and sons, and the missionaries of the A.B.C.F.M.\\" and was published in Boston in 1842. Its successor, Dakota Odowan, first published with music in 1879, has been reprinted many times and is in use today. Joseph Renville's father, also named Joseph Renville, was a French Canadian fur trader, and his mother, Miniyuhe, was a Dakota, possibly a daughter of Mdewakaton-Dakota chief Big Thunder. Renville's bicultural formative years may have included some education in Canada. The town of Renville, Minnesota, is named in honor of Joseph Renville, as are Renville County, Minnesota and Renville County, North Dakota. A street in Detroit, Michigan is also named after him. Lac qui Parle He participated in the 1805 Pike Expedition to explore the south and west of the Louisiana Purchase, as well as the U. S. expedition in 1823 to Red River of the North led by Major Stephen Harriman Long. By 1827, Renville had settled at Lac qui Parle, Minnesota, where he built a stockade, kept a band of warriors, and continued his livelihood as a fur trader. In 1835, Thomas Smith Williamson, M.D. (1800-1879), arrived at Lac qui Parle, the first of several missionaries. Another, Stephen Return Riggs (1812-1883) arrived in 1837. Two others, Gideon Hollister Pond (1810-1878) and his brother Samuel William Pond (1808-1891) were largely responsible for the creation of the Dakota alphabet. Renville and the missionaries translated The Bible into English. Renville's French Bible, printed in Geneva, Switzerland in 1588, was used for translating. Riggs wrote that the little group of translators \\"usually consisted of Mr. Renville, who sat in a chair in the middle of his own reception room, in which there was at one end an open fireplace with a large blazing fire, and Dr. Williamson, Mr. G. H. Pond, and myself, seated at a side-table with our writing materials before us. When all were ready, Dr. Williamson read a verse from the French Bible. This, Mr. Renville, usually with great readiness, repeated in the Dakota language. We wrote it down from his mouth. If the sentence was too long for us to remember, Mr. Renville repeated it... That winter, the Gospel of Mark was finished...\\" In 1836, Renville employed a clerk named Eugene Gauss (1811-1896), who, during his service as a private in the United States Army, had become \\"a pious Presbyterian and decided he wanted to be a missionary.\\" Gauss assisted with translation of the Bible from French into Dakota, and Dr. Williamson wrote, \\"Brother Gauss, Mr. R's present clerk being pious and feeling a deep interest in the spiritual welfare of the Dakotas and my own increasing knowledge of the French language make it more practicable to give religious instruction than heretofore.\\" Eugene Gauss was a son of the renowned German mathematician and physicist, Carl Friedrich Gauss. Three Dakota Native Airs Three of the hymn tunes in Dakota Odowan are designated as Dakota Native Airs. Their names are LACQUIPARLE (number 141), LA FRAMBOISE (number 142), and RENVILLE (number 145). The first of these appears in many modern hymnals and is probably the world's most widely known melody of American Indian origin. An examination of distinctive meters and other evidence leads to the conclusion that Joseph Renville probably composed the three hymn tunes, and he certainly composed the three Dakota texts. In modern English-language hymnals, a paraphrase by Philip Frazier, loosely based on Renville's text, appears with the tune LACQUIPARLE, and it is known to many Christians by the opening words, \\"Many and great, O God, are thy works, maker of earth and sky\\". The hymn tune RENVILLE has been adapted for modern congregational singing in Singing the New Testament, a hymnal copublished in 2008 by The Calvin Institute of Christian Worship and Faith Alive Christian Resources.

(It was 21 Roman miles from Capua, and 11 from Beneventum.) It or nearby Arpaia became the seat of an early bishopric, which is now a Latin Catholic titular see under both (synonymous) names.  History  In early times it was an important site: the capital or chief city of the Caudini. Grave goods, found in the necropolis nearby, show that the site was inhabited from the 8th to the 3rd centuries. Caudium is first mentioned during the Second Samnite War, when in 321 BC the Samnite army under C. Pontius encamped there just before their great victory over the Romans in the nearby mountain pass called the Caudine Forks (Livy 9.2), whose exact location is disputed.E.T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites (Cambridge University Press 1967 ), pp. 225‚Äì226 A few years later, the Samnites used Caudium as a place from which to watch the Campanians (Liv. 9.27). Caudium is not mentioned during the Second Punic War, but the Caudini are repeatedly mentioned. Niebuhr supposed that the city was destroyed by the Romans in revenge for their great defeat at the Caudine Forks, but there is no evidence for this, and in a later period it was known as a stopping place along the Appian Way, both in the time of Augustus (Hor. Sat. 1.5.51; Strabo 5. p. 249) and in the late empire.Ptol. iii. 1. ¬ß 67; Itin. Ant. p. 111; Itin. Hier. p. 610; Tab. Peut. In the triumviral period Caudium received a colony of veterans; and it appears from Pliny, as well as from inscriptions, that it retained its municipal character, though deprived of a large portion of its territory in favor of the neighboring city of Beneventum. (Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Lib. Colon. p. 232; Orelli, Inscr. 128, 131.) The period of its destruction is unknown: the name is still found in the 9th century, but it is uncertain whether the town still existed at that time.  Ecclesiastical history  The ancient bishopric of Caudium is considered to have had its seat at what is now the village of Arpaia rather than at present-day Montesarchio.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, vol. 10, p. 283Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol. I, Faenza 1927, p. 186 Felicissimus in 496 is the only ancient bishop of the see whose name is known. In the 10th century its territory became part of the diocese of Sant'Agata de' Goti. = Titular see = The diocese of Caudium was nominally restored in 1970 by the Catholic Church as Latin titular bishopric .Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 839 of Caudium (Latin) / Arpaia (Curiate Italian) / Caudin(us) (Latin adjective).

Drayton Island, during the steamboat period on the St. Johns River, was a scheduled stop for tourists and boasted a hotel built in 1875 that burned in 1878. A small subdivision was established and several homes that still exist were built. During the Plantation slavery period, prior to 1865, cotton and other export crops were grown on the island. Between freezes, orange groves produced prize fruit that brought a premium price in northern markets. The Archaic Indian Mounds, on the north end of the island are owned by The Archaeology Conservancy, Albuquerque, NM. The St. Johns River is navigable from Sanford, Florida to Jacksonville, Florida. Lake George is about south of Jacksonville. The lake is long and about wide. Drayton Island is situated in the north end of the lake. Hog Island, a smaller island is west of Drayton Island. The island is located across the river from a marina in Georgetown. A small public ferry, one of three left on the river, holds two cars at a time and serves the small island's population. We were there this morning. Current toll 9n ferry is $25.00 . History The island was developed as a plantation when William Drayton Sr, a migrant from South Carolina, bought it along with other properties in Florida. It was named after him. He served as chief justice of the Province of East Florida during colonial years and the American Revolution (1765-1780). The ferry that connects the island to the mainland carries a $10 toll. In 2001 it was run by Edward Babbitt, who had operated the ferry for over 40 years.

He had been \\"seriously debating the pros and cons of breathing\\" because he thought it didn't matter, seeing as he knew that the final fate of all was death.

He originally foresaw his death in a series of premonitions, but pushed his luck by giving up his seafaring life...after one last voyage. Alas his crew (rather sick of him) mutinied and in the process of trying to end his life with a gunshot (rather than be thrown overboard...where he'd surely be consumed)...ignited their barrels of gunpowder...with fatal explosive results.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 6,263 and it contained 2,404 housing units. Washington Township was formed from Crete Township and Sherburn Township on an unknown date. Bodies of Water Eagle Lake is a small lake owned by the Beecher Sportsmen's Club on Yates Avenue. Its maximum depth is about 18 feet. The lake was a much larger marshy area when settlers first moved to the area. Most of the lake was eventually drained to make the land suitable for agricultural purposes. Many small creeks also run through the township including Trim Creek and Pike Creek, which drain into the Kankakee River and Plum Creek, which drains into the Calumet River and eventually Lake Michigan. The Land The land to the north, east, south, and west of Beecher is mostly made up of corn, soybean, and the occasional wheat field. Even as the majority of the land is used for farming, the soil is not considered \\"great.\\" The Eagle Lake Region, in the far northeast corner of the township, is somewhat marshy with some clay, which is not ideal for above average crop yields. The farm land is generally more fertile on the west and south sides of the township Towns Beecher is a rural town with a population of approximately 2,900. Beecher is located in the middle of Washington Township. This small, rural village sprouted up along a railroad like so many other little towns across the Midwest. Although, still considered small, Beecher has grown a lot recently. Within the last six or seven years it has seen a population increase close to 1,000 with the construction of several new housing developments on the northeast side of town. Route 1 runs right through the east side of Beecher. This main highway is considered the bread and butter of Beecher's business district. With fast food places like Subway and McDonald's, and local establishments such as Tony's, Aurelio's, and Maxwell's, Beecher has become a suburban hot spot for eateries. However, no one establishment delivers as much of an economic impact as Buddy's. Buddy's is a family-friendly ice cream and sandwich place that gives Beecher its identity. After recreational and high school baseball games many players and fans have been known to ascend upon Buddy's for a nice cold treat on a hot afternoon. Located in the northeast region of the township, is the unincorporated village of Eagle Lake. Known most for the Beecher Sportsmen's Club, Eagle Lake is a happy little village of only about 25 people. A beautiful little, white country church, St. John's Lutheran, sits on a hill about 3/4 of a mile up the road to the north. In the late 1800s a post office existed for a short time at Eagle Lake.

It spawned two close derivatives: the Lada 111 estate and the Lada 112 hatchback. History The prototype of the Lada 110, known as the 300 series, was created in 1987 and optimized for aerodynamics in Zuffenhausen, Germany, in cooperation between AvtoVAZ and Porsche engineers. The first photos of the new compact car were published in the popular monthly magazine Za Rulem in November 1990, and the car itself was demonstrated at the AvtoVAZ Tolyatti factory in 1991. Serial production was planned to start in the following year, but an economic crisis stalled the project and the first cars did not roll off the assembly line until June 27, 1995. The Lada 110 featured a 1.6 litre engine producing approximately . Production began with 8-valve engines; a 16 valve engine was offered later. Overall, the car weighed around 1050 kilograms (2315 lb). It had electric windows, trip computer, power steering, and galvanized body panels. Fuel-injected models were equipped with electronic engine management system. In early 2006, new taillights and a new dashboard were introduced. The car was very successful in the domestic Russian market. It is still popular among taxi drivers in the Southern Federal District for the price-quality ratio.–ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª. –†–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª–µ–π –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏: –ª—É—á—à–∏–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏–µ –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–∫–∏ —Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ In 2007, the Lada 110, 111 and 112 were restyled, modernised and relaunched as the Lada Priora. Trim levels There were three trim levels: Standard, Normal, and Luxe. The Standard trim level included a clock, heated rear windows, power door locks, power trunk lock, onboard control system, immobilizer, body-color bumpers, tweed door and seat trims, and front head restraints. The Normal featured powered windows, exterior mirrors with antidazzle effect, velour seat and door upholstery, and rear head restraints. The Luxe added heated front seats, trip computer, fog lights, electric and heated outside mirrors, velvet seat and door upholstery, a trunk spoiler with integral brake lights, and tinted windows. The model has been a favorite target for styling, both artisanal and professional, especially the version with the five-door hatchback body (Lada-112). Various companies from Tolyatti also designed and offered different body kits: APAL company produced components for the Lada BIS 110 and 111, as did Tornado, Katran, and Grossmeyster; AKS company of Kurage, Autostyle company of Tomcat, and Motorica did so for the Lada 110M (which was included in the official catalogue of AvtoVAZ and considered a restyled version of the original car), Pit-Stop produced the Grand Rally and Rally Sport versions, and Arsenal-Auto built the Sprint. Super-Avto developed a version with a motor of 1.8 liters of its own design and an elongated version of the sedan VAZ-21108 Premier; it was included in the official catalogues of AvtoVAZ. The Motorica company produced the sporting VAZ-21106 version with a Opel engine, altered rear wings, and extended wheel arches. Enterprise, together with AvtoVAZ, produced the Consul in 1999-2006, along with the four-wheel drive Tarzan-2 built on the basis of the station wagon Lada 111, with a raised body placed on a separate frame.

The reviewers noted that the injury criteria did not exceed safe values, the car's interior was well thought out in terms of safety, and the car's body was very rugged, showing better results than those of Nissan Almera, Ford Escort, Mitsubishi Lancer, Hyundai Accent, and Suzuki Baleno. However, the compression of the chest by the seat belt was too high, and the reviewers concluded that the car needed airbags and more modern safety belts equipped with pretensioners and tension limiters to keep up with the new safety standards. Racing The Lada 110 WTCC car during the 2008 World Touring Car Championship season The Lada 110 was entered in the 2008 World Touring Car Championship season by the Russian Bears Motorsport team, with Viktor Shapovalov (#28) and Jaap van Lagen (#29) as the drivers. Team LADA Sport commenced the 2009 World Touring Car Championship season with a trio of 110s for Jaap Van Lagen, Kirill Ladygin and Viktor Shapovalov. The team replaced the 110s with the newer Prioras during the course of the season. Lada 111 The Lada 111 or VAZ-2111 is AvtoVAZ's front wheel drive car with a station wagon bodystyle (modification of Lada 110). It was manufactured from 1998 to 2009.

Lada 111 1,5 Li in Krak√≥w in September 2010 Lada 111 badge In 1998, the Lada 110 received a modification for a station wagon - the Lada 111 - the country's first front-wheel drive car with such a bodystyle. The rear seat can be folded in a ratio of 2:3, allowing passengers and bulky/long loads. The luggage compartment, respectively, increase from 490 to 1,420 liters. Front- wheel drive and a rear door give it a low loading height. With a 20 kg total increase in weight and a higher center of mass, wagon's ride is smoother than the sedan's but the handling is not as good in turns. The wagon was released with options that differ mainly by engine: basic VAZ-21110 With the \\"standard\\", \\"normal\\" and \\"luxury\\" (similar to a sedan car VAZ-21102) with a 1.5-liter 8-valve engine, \\"2111\\" and \\"top-end\\"VAZ-21113 to trim the\\" norm \\"and\\" luxury \\"with 16-valve engine,\\" 2112 \\"and front ventilated disc brakes (like the sedan VAZ-21103). The \\"2111\\" and \\"2112\\" were equipped with fuel injection and catalytic converter. The VAZ-21111 had a carburetor engine \\"2110\\" (production ended in 2002). All-rounders are completed with the \\"short\\" primary pair (3.9 instead of 3.7 for VAZ-2110). Since autumn 2004, these versions been taken over by the 1.6-liter 21112 (8 valves) and 21114 (16 valves).

The Lada 112 was introduced in 1999, and is somewhat more modern and luxurious-looking than the traditional Ladas. The car is relatively popular in Russia today. Coming with a 1.5 through 1.6 litre inline-four engine with about in either 8 valve or 16 valve versions, the Lada 112 could reach a maximum speed of 185 km/h and move from 0‚Äì100 km/h in 12 seconds. It came with a five-speed gearbox and rear drum brakes. Its weight is between 1,050 (2,315 lb) and 1230 kg's. =Variants= AvtoVAZ also provided a 112 Coupe variant, with just three doors instead of five in base model. It was dropped from the Lada model range in 2008, with the launch of the Lada Priora hatchback.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 81,472 and it contained 25,075 housing units. As of 2008, Wheatland Township had over 27,000 parcels located within its boundaries. It ranked third in Will County for land parcels and the highest in EAV (Equalized Assessed Value). It covers parts of Aurora, Bolingbrook, Plainfield, and Naperville (where the Wheatland Township Administrative Offices are located).  History  Most of Wheatland Township was still owned by a Native American tribe, the Potawatomi, until 1833. The Treaty of Chicago obtained this land and officially made it available for settlement. Growth was slow during the 1830s, due to a lack of significant wooded lands. Farmers depended on wood for building and a source of fuel. They also believed if the land could not grow trees then it would not be beneficial for farming. Wheatland Township was surveyed between 1837-1839 and opened up for sale in 1841.Woodruff The earliest settlers in this area were predominantly Scottish and English immigrants. Early farming families included: Stewart (1832), Colegrove (1839), Brockway (pre 1842), Boardman (1830‚Äì32), Boughton (pre 1842), Foster (1837), Wightman (1838), Mather (Pre 19842), Davis (1843), Findlay (1844) Stewart (1850), McLaren (1848) McMicken (1842), Gilmour (1852), King (1852) Royce (1832), Brown (1862), Kinley (1843), Clow (1844), Catchpole (1844), Cotton (1843), Patterson(1844).Plat Other pre-1850 arrivals include Birkett, Varley, Lantz, Fry, Rathbun, Dundore, Mussey among many others. Many of these families are buried in either the Wheatland Presbyterian Church Cemetery or the Wheatland Township Cemetery where their origin of birth can be seen on the historic tombstones *. Nearby and bordering Townships were populated by German and Swedish families bonded by their respective cultural heritages. As adjacent townships grew, small settlements developed around rural crossroads, schools, churches and post offices. These centers offered goods and services and were determined by the distance the area farmers could complete a round trip in one-half day‚Äôs time. Vermont Settlement, in the northwest corner of the township in sections 5-8, was the first settlement; established circa 1843 with the arrival of the Davis, Blanchard and Rice families of Vermont. Later arrivals to the settlement included the Kinley, Leppert, Piedlau and Schoger families. Tamarack crossroads was named in 1852 upon the arrival of Thomas Burnet who brought with him 4 tamarack trees from Detroit Michigan that were planted roughly a quarter-mile apart along 127th Street (originally Chaplins' Road).Burnet The crossroads included a post office that was in operation from 1858-1902, a general store offering hardware supplies, jewelry and watch repair, operated by Thomas Muir of Glasgow Scotland, a blacksmiths shop run by William Nairn, and a school (Tamarack School District 34) which opened in the fall of 1866 and disbanded during the Wheatland School District consolidations.WCRBOE Later crossroads were created along the Joliet, Elgin and Eastern Railroad. Normantown (1886-1903) and Wolfs Crossing (in Oswego Township, Kendall County 1890-1900) provided markets for farmers to weigh, sell and ship their produce. Other centers included East Wheatland Post Office originally on the Frank Boardman farm, Hoddam Post Office on the William Patterson farm, and the Tokio Post Office on the John Clow farm.Keeler Wheatland Presbyterian Church, known locally as The Scotch Church, in recognition of the numerous Scottish families that had settled the area is in section 19. The church was founded in the home of Stephen Findlay on May 20, 1848. Rev. William Oburn was the first Reverend. The first church was built in 1856 and sat in what would currently be the parking lot for the current church constructed in 1906. The original church closed its doors on October 8, 1906, and the current church opened with special services on October 21, 1906.Scots Across the road on the south side of Ferguson Road, known today as 119th Street, was a one-room schoolhouse called the Wheatland Presbyterian School (District 38). The school house originally served eight grades within a single room in preparation for transfer to high school at either Plainfield, Aurora, or Oswego Illinois. The earliest school records housed at the Little White School Museum in Oswego, Illinois date back to the 1870s. The schoolhouse closed when the Wheatland Township schools consolidated into Wheatland Consolidated School District 40-C in the early 1950s. Other churches in the east Wheatland neighborhood included the Zion Lutheran Church at 103rd Street and Book Road, DuPage Presbyterian Church near Weber Road and Boughton Road. There were numerous one room schools in Wheatland Township. West Wheatland had Tamarack school, Wheatland Presbyterian School, Lumbard School, Johnson School, and Pilcher School. East Wheatland had White School, Lantz School, Spaulding School, Dannenburg School, and the Red School. Throughout the early 20th century, the churches created recreational leagues, among themselves, for various competitions including baseball. The most important annual activity within Wheatland Township was the Wheatland Plowing Matches. The plowing competition which began with horses and evolved into tractors measured the quality and accuracy of tilling the soil on various Township farmlands. In later years, the winner of the competition was rewarded with a trip to Scotland, where he could compete with his former countrymen. Farming was the primary industry of the township in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century. The once magnificently beautiful farmland consisting of thousands of acres within the Township has been reduced to approximately six (6) family-owned farms with over . Some of the original farmhouses are still in existence today and can be seen throughout the township. For example, the Boughton family farmhouse is located on Plainfield-Naperville Road. The Clow farmhouse and barn have been preserved by the Forest Preserve District of Will County and is located near 111th Street and Book Road. Wheatland township has grown from 1,098 population in 1880 to over 81,472 according to the 2010 census. Geography According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , of which (or 99.08%) is land and (or 0.92%) is water. Demographics Facilities The Wheatland Athletic Association (WAA) is a non-profit parent volunteer organization which provides Youth Athletic Programs to all residents of the District 204 school community (Naperville/Aurora, Illinois) and surrounding areas. WAA was founded in 1977 to provide T-Ball for 60 children. Today they have over 15,000 participants for children age 2 - 18 as well as adult programs. Notes References *Woodruff, George.

NARC staged a second coup in October 1977, this time without the king's consent, and replaced Thanin with Kriangsak.Kamm, Henry (October 21, 1977). \\"Thai Junta Ousts Civilian Regime, Charging It Delayed Vote Too Long\\", New York Times Education *Vichaibamrungraj School *Uthai Witthayakhom *Bansomdejchaopraya School *Royal Thai Naval Academy *National Defence College of Thailand *Naval War College Military career *Submarine Squadron Commander *Assistant Chief of Staff (operation) *Commander of the Royal Thai Fleet *Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy *Commander- in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy *Supreme Commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces Non-military activities *Member of the House of Representatives *Member of the Constituent Assembly *Senator *Minister of Defense *Leader of 1976 coup *Leader of March 1977 coup attempt *President of the National Policy Council *Member of the National Legislative Assembly‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏°‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡πÇ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡πÅ‡∏ï‡πà‡∏á‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡∏™‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ç‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥ Honour * 70px Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant * 70px Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏†‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå (‡∏ä‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏¢ ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡πÇ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ò‡∏µ‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏û‡∏£‡∏£‡∏©‡∏≤ ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà ‡πï ‡∏ò‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏° ‡πí‡πï‡πë‡πê) * 70px Knight Grand Commander (Second Class, Upper Grade) of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏†‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏•‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤  References  Chaloryoo, Sangad Chaloryoo, Sangad Category:Chiefs of Defence Forces of Thailand Category:Government ministers of Thailand Category:Ministers of Defence of Thailand Category:Thai military personnel Category:Royal Thai Army personnel Category:Thai generals Category:Royal Thai Navy personnel Category:Thai admirals Category:Royal Thai Air Force personnel Category:Royal Thai Air Force air marshals ","title":"Sangad Chaloryu"},{"id":"9509410","text":"Stonebriar Centre, sometimes referred to as Stonebriar Mall, is a mid-range shopping mall located at the intersection of Preston Road (SH 289) and the Sam Rayburn Tollway (SH 121) in Frisco, Texas, U.S.. It contains 4 major department store anchor tenants, a 24-screen AMC movie theater, 2 major restaurants, a Dave & Buster's, and Texas's first Kidzania. History In 1988, Homart, then a subsidiary of Sears, planned on putting a million square foot mall in Frisco, which was a town of about 6,000 people at the time. When Plano city officials learned of Homart's plan, they offered $10 million if the company would move its planned mall across the road into their city limits. Frisco lobbied to keep the planned mall and was able to work out tax incentives to close the deal. Plano then convinced another company, General Growth Properties, to place a mall within their city limits. In 1995, General Growth acquired Homart who had already signed an agreement with Frisco. The City of Frisco made a final offer to General Growth of a half-cent sales tax rebate, property tax abatement for ten years, and infrastructure improvements in and around the mall. Plano continued to lobby hard for the new mall and Frisco eventually upped its sales-tax grant. Frisco finally opened the mall on August 4, 2000. In July 2013, the ice rink at the mall was closed. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Stonebriar Centre, into Seritage Growth Properties. In 2016, the Mall‚Äôs AMC Theatre located on the upper levels was closed for 3 months for updating and remodeling. In 2017, Carlo's Bake Shop opened at the mall. In May 2018, construction began on the 18 story Stonebriar Hyatt Hotel, which would be attached to the mall. In May 2018, a teenager was arrested for planning to commit a mass shooting at the mall. KidZania is opened in the fall of 2019. In January 2019, Sears closed its doors as part of Sears Holdings filing for Bankruptcy. In April 2019, Apple Store closed its store at the mall and relocated to the Galleria Dallas. In November 2019, Amazons 6th Amazon 4 Star store in the U.S. opened at Stonebriar.

In the 1920s and '30s, many of the area's houses were shotgun-style homes that contained no indoor plumbing and had rental rates ranging from $1.25 to $2.50 per week. The homes were built on rough land surrounded by unpaved streets and sidewalks. Lakeside Acres was built in the 1960s and housed many of the area's doctors, teachers, lawyers and other upper middle-class citizens. The homes in Lakeside Acres still stand today, while many other Allendale area homes are dilapidated and some are being torn down for new structures. The area's first public housing complex, Elamito Terrace, was completed in 1951. Elamito Terrace, the name of which later was changed to Jackson Heights, was torn down last year to make way for apartments for the elderly. In 2001, the Fuller Center for Housing partnered with Shreveport-Bossier Community Renewal to start building low-income homes with hopes of revitalizing the neighborhood. Schools * Booker T.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 1,821 and it contained 700 housing units. Will Township was formed from the former township of Carey, which included modern day Monee Township and Will Township, in January 1859. Township Headquarters Will Township offices and road district headquarters are located on the southeast corner of Beecher-Peotone Road and Will Center Road. A former one room schoolhouse makes up part of the Will Township Hall. The road district garage sits on the same property just south of the Township Hall. A yard for storage of gravel, equipment and unused material is a few hundred feet south of the road district garage. Between the garage and the yard is a corncrib that the township also owns and uses for storage. The polling place for Will Township residents is the Peotone Library, located within the village of Peotone. Geography Very gently rolling farmland makes up the majority of Will Township. Since the area was settled agriculture has been the main industry in Will Township. The fertile soil has allowed many generations of families to make a living from the land. Corn, soybean, hay, and wheat fields make up the farm landscape. A few dairy farms and beef farms still operate in Will Township. According to the 2010 census, the township has a total area of , of which (or 99.94%) is land and (or 0.03%) is water. Black Walnut Creek, Rock Creek, Marshall Slough and the Exline Slough are the main bodies of water that run through Will Township. These creeks provide drainage for the farmland. Old atlases show Walnut Creek as being a natural stream. Some areas have been straightened over the years to make farming operations more efficient or to follow property lines. The other creeks are generally figured to be mostly man made drainage ditches following the natural lay of the land. Demographics History The Township of Will did not have a single tree in its entire when settlers began arriving in Will County. For this reason Will Township was settled later than some of the surrounding townships that provided timber. The first settler was John McKenzie, a Scotchman, in 1852. He moved to Missouri a few years later. Crete native John M. Gridley descended upon the township in 1853 and erected the second cabin there. He had tried living several places in Will County, but after 13 years of searching he found a place which he was fond of. He would go down as one of the most prominent men the township ever had. At the organization of Will Township in 1859, Gridley was elected one of the highway commissioners. He remained in Will Township until his death in 1904. By the time the township was formed in 1859 many good men had become residents. Soon after the townships formation it was divided into three school districts. By the mid 1860s, the township would be dotted with school houses that would provide for the upbringing and education of the townships children. After 1860 the township filled up rapidly and little unoccupied land was to be found anywhere in its boundaries. The Will County Plat Atlas, 1862 shows some of the land in Will Township was still owned by the Illinois Central Railroad. It has been reported that the railroad sold land east of Peotone, to early settlers, for $2.50 to $5.00 per acre. Not all sections of the township were owned by the railroad. Early settlers acquired some of the land from the federal government via the Homestead Act. The fertile soil of Will Township would serve its farming inhabitants for generations to come. By 1900 the population of the township was 860. The township has always heavily favored the Republican party. There were 212 votes cast in 1900, 150 of those being Republican and 62 being Democrat. Soil Types Elliot and Ashkum soils are the most common soil types found in Will Township. These soil types are ideal for growing crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Other common soil types found within the Township of Will are Beecher, Pella, Varna, Jasper, Markham, Brenton, and Proctor. These loam soils are all well suited for agricultural purposes. Generally as you move south the productivity of the soil improves modestly. Land The majority of township land is still owned by farmers or retired farmers. Because of the townships close proximity to the Chicago metropolitan area the townships farmland has been disappearing and split up into 5 or country lots. Country living combined with the access of the Chicago job market makes Will Township and attractive place for people to buy a lot and build a single family home. In many instances these homeowners will ask a nearby farmer to farm the back or of their parcel. The 1873 Will County Landowners Atlas describes the landscape of Will Township at the time: The township has no timber, and is considered one of the finest prairie towns in the state. In the modern day Will Township land is used predominantly for farming purposes. Most years corn and soybeans are planted on about the same area throughout the township. Wheat is also planted on a fair area. According to satellite photos taken in May 2015, 720 acres of the township is used for the purpose of growing hay or forage. served as cattle pasture in 2007. in the northern half of the township is planted in dense trees. Infrastructure Interstate 57 runs through the northwest corner of Will Township. Illinois Route 50 runs adjacent to a railroad on the west side of the township. These two roads are the most traveled roads in the township. Beecher-Peotone Road, also known as Beecher Blacktop, is also a main road that runs east to west through the middle of the township. Intersecting with Beecher-Peotone Road is Will Center Road, also a highly traveled route. Bult Field is a small airport in Will Township. Formerly known as Sanger Airport, Bult Field is located on Kedzie Avenue, between Offner Rd. and Eagle Lake Road. The State of Illinois recently purchased the airport as part of its plan to eventually build the larger South Suburban Airport. Many underground pipelines, carrying mostly petroleum or natural gas products, also cross the township. Aqua Illinois is currently installing a water main along Egyptian Trail to carry water from the Kankakee River to University Park, IL. The majority of the township roads are either tar and chip or gravel. These roads are well maintained by the township and provide travel for all township residents. Township Roads Will Township has the responsibility of maintaining about of township road and right of way. Will Township roads are made up of gravel or tar and chip. The township currently has one and a half miles of asphalt road as well. Asphalt roads can be found on Kedzie Ave. between Eagle Lake Rd. and Offner Rd. and the stretch of North Peotone Rd. between Route 50 and Harlem Ave. There are no dirt roads remaining in the township. The Crooked Bridge is a well known location to residents across the region. Located at the corner of Egyptian Trail and Church Road, the Crooked Bridge is a one of a kind bride that crosses Black Walnut Creek. Other roads not previously mentioned that run through Will Township are Ridgeland Ave., Crawford Ave., Western Ave., Corning Ave., and Kennedy Rd. Issues Since the 1980s there has been talk of the State of Illinois building a third Chicago area airport on the fertile farmland of Will Township. The majority of Will Township residents strongly oppose the Illinois Department of Transportation buying or taking land from area landowners for an airport that has not yet been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.

According to legend, a 901 battle of Bavarian forces against invading Magyars instigated the founding of the town. As first mentioned in an 1131 deed, a Saint Vitus Church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk was located here within the Duchy of Carinthia. According to an 1137 agreement, it was \\"repurchased\\" by the Bishopric of Bamberg. Ducal castle However, already in 1149 it served as a residence of the Sponheim duke Heinrich V of Carinthia, where he received King Konrad III of Germany on his way back from the Second Crusade. He was succeeded by his brother Duke Hermann II of Carinthia, who became Vogt protector of the church in 1176 and subsequently the Sponheimer made the estates of Sankt Veit their permanent residence and capital of the Carinthian duchy, which it remained until 1518. Herman's son Bernhard von Spanheim (d. 1256) had the ducal castle and fortifications built, and granted Sankt Veit town privileges 1224. Here he held a glamorous court and received minnesingers like Walther von der Vogelweide, who stayed here in 1214, and Ulrich von Liechtenstein. Sankt Veit also may have been the domicile of Heinrich von dem T√ºrlin where he wrote his Middle High German Diu Cr√¥ne poem. After the House of Sponheim had become extinct in 1269, the Carinthian duchy was acquired by King Otakar II of Bohemia, later it passed to the Meinhardiner Count Meinhard II of Tyrol. His granddaughter Countess Margaret in 1335 finally lost Carinthia to Duke Rudolf IV of Austria from the House of Habsburg, whereafter it was incorporated into the dynasty's Inner Austrian lands and ruled by stadtholders. In 1362 Rudolf granted the Sankt Veit citizens the permission to hold the annual Wiesenmarkt fair, which is arranged up to today as one of the oldest festivals in Central Europe. Its town hall dates from 1468 and the present-day ducal castle from the 15th to 16th century. Demographics At the 2001 census, it had a population of 12,045. Of that, 92.5% are Austrian, 2.3% are Yugoslav, and 2.2% are Bosnian. 74.0% of the population profess themselves to be Roman Catholic, 8.6% are Lutherans/Protestants and 4.3% are Muslims, while 10.2% are without religious confession.

It is based on the 1968 play of the same name by Jay Presson Allen. The screenplay was written by Leonard Gershe (who significantly changed the ending). The film stars Liv Ullmann, Edward Albert, Gene Kelly, Binnie Barnes, Deborah Raffin, Nancy Walker, and Natalie Schafer. Ullman was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Motion Picture Actress, Musical or Comedy, and the Writers Guild of America nominated Gershe's screenplay for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium. Plot Ann Stanley, who sells real estate in New York City, is on vacation with her mother in Greece when her car breaks down. To her rescue comes a young man on a motorbike, Peter Latham, who has a difficult time persuading Ann to accept a ride. They become better acquainted, drink ouzo, and ultimately consummate the relationship. Ann enjoys his company, but still views their relationship as a summer fling. Back home, at a party one night, Ann is stunned when her grown daughter turns up with Peter as her date. Peter was not her daughter's date - he picked her up at her home in place of her daughter's date. It turns out, however, that Peter's goal is to resume his romantic acquaintance with Ann, having developed feelings for her during the summer. The age difference embarrasses Ann greatly. He is 22, and she is 40. Friends and associates of Ann are somewhat aghast at her behavior as the persistent Peter refuses to take no for an answer. In time, after demonstrating a great deal of reluctance, Ann finally acknowledges that the only thing that matters is true love.

A hero of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, he served as Governor-General of Warsaw in Poland, where he was known for his liberal policies that ultimately led to his replacement by the Russian authorities. Family Alexander Imeretinsky was born in Moscow Gubernia on 24 September 1837 to a Georgian royal family of Imeretinsky, a sub branch of the Bagrationi Dynasty. His father, Prince Constantine of Imereti was a head of the royal house of the former Kingdom of Imereti (annexed by Russia in 1810) and a Major General in Russian army. Imeretinsky graduated from Page Corps in Saint Petersburg. Imperial Russian service In 1855 Imeretinsky served in a mounted Imperial Guard pioneer squadron. From 1856 to 1859 he took part in the Caucasian War against Chechens and Dagestanis with a Georgian Grenadier Regiment, then studied at the Nicholas General Staff Academy (1862‚Äì1863). He took part in suppressing the Polish January Uprising in 1863, and in 1876 became chief of staff of the Russian Army in Warsaw. Consequently Imteretinsky was appointed commander of the Warsaw Military District in 1869. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) he led the Second Infantry Division in the Battle of Lovcha together with Mikhail Skobelev, and participated in the Siege of Plevna. After the storming of Plevna he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In 1879 he became the chief of the Petersburg Military District. From 1881 to 1886 he acted as Military Procurator-in-Chief of Russia and was responsible among other things, for the investigation and persecution of the organizers of the murder of Emperor Alexander II of Russia (1881). In 1882 Imeretinsky became a member of State Council of Imperial Russia. =Governor-General of Warsaw= In 1897 he replaced Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov as the Governor-general of Warsaw. He was a supporter of Polish-Russian cooperation, and thought that Poles would voluntarily integrate themselves into the Russian Empire if given the choice and fair treatment. For that reason he removed some restrictive laws, such as one that forbade use of the Polish language in schools, and dismissed the unpopular overseer of education system, Alexander Apuchtin. He also gave permission to erect a monument to Adam Mickiewicz, the great Polish poet. He was criticized for his liberal stance by certain Russian and Polish factions. After the Polish Socialist Party published an article critical of Imeretinsky's liberal policy in 1898, it gained much notoriety, and Imeretinsky was dismissed in 1900, dying on 17 November that year.

It was released in October 1983 by Passport Records in the United States and in April 1984 by Street Tunes in the United Kingdom. After he released his Private Parts & Pieces III: Antiques, the third instalment in his generic album series, Phillips started work on his next full studio album. Phillips was pressured by his US label Passport Records to deliver more radio friendly songs, and produced Invisible Men as a collaborative effort with musician and songwriter Richard Scott. Phillips would not release a complete and arranged album of solo material until Slow Dance (1990). Background and recording In early 1982, Phillips released Private Parts & Pieces III: Antiques, the third instalment in his generic album series containing incomplete compositions, demos, and out-takes. For his next release Phillips committed to a full, standard album, his first since 1984 (1981). At this point in his career, Phillips was pressured by management at his record label, the independent US-based Passport Records, to deliver more commercial and radio friendly songs. Also in early 1982, he had bought a house in Clapham, south London and has since called Invisible Men his \\"mortgage album\\". He set up studio in his home which he named Englewood Studios, and did additional recording in Atmosphere Studios in central London. To help him with the project, Phillips invited musician and songwriter Richard Scott to assist in its production. In a later interview, Phillips acknowledged Scott's confidence and enthusiasm, but noted that this would sometimes result in Phillips being pushed into musical areas where he was uneasy, perhaps due to Scott's inexperience, having recently graduated from university and wanting to get make a career out of music. When it came to the vocals, Phillips was inspired to take them on himself as former Genesis band mates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks had done vocals on their solo albums, and that he was unable to find someone suitable. Phillips had used different guest singers on Sides (1979), but felt that it did not work as well as he had expected. Feeling his vocals were inadequate, Phillips took singing lessons from John Owen-Edwards, who had worked with him on a musical project and had also coached Rutherford. After the backing tracks and rough vocals had been put down for about five songs, Phillips presented his work to his manager Tony Smith and recalled that he was \\"extremely impressed\\". This was when Phillips was enthusiastic about the album until it became increasingly difficult for him to maintain such a level of interest. During recording at Atmosphere Studios, session drummers were brought in to play parts originally programmed on a drum machine as well as singers for additional vocals. Phillips wrote about this period: \\"The money was flowing out. It wasn't a wholly happy time.\\" In addition, pressure was placed upon him to change his image and to present the album under the Anthony Phillips Band moniker which he did not agree with. Invisible Men was cut by Ian Cooper at Townhouse Studios in London. Phillips encountered problems in finalising the album's release in the US as Passport rejected two cuts that Cooper had prepared, coupled with the opinion that none of the songs were suitable for a single. After the second cut was rejected, Phillips recalled that Cooper \\"was a bit beside himself - he just didn't know what else to do\\", and received notes from the label's engineer in New York with suggestions to improve it, which Phillips expressed some disagreement on. Following a three month delay the label suggested a new mix but realised it would cost additional money, so it agreed to release the album. Songs \\"Exocet\\" is a political song inspired by the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which took place during the recording of the album. In one incident in the conflict, an Exocet missile struck a British warship and killed 20 crew members. One of Phillips's musician friends, Argentinian guitarist Enrique Berro Garcia, had to leave the United Kingdom. The end of the song includes a segment of a news report of the war, which was originally a recording error but Phillips decided to keep it. Upon finishing the album, management of Street Tunes Records, the UK label that released it in the country, deemed \\"Exocet\\" too political and ordered its removal. It was replaced with \\"It's Not Easy\\". The track \\"The Women Were Watching\\" also concerns the Falklands War. Release Invisible Men was released in the United Kingdom on 13 April 1984 on Street Tunes, an independent label. Phillips was pleased with the label's enthusiasm towards the album. A 12-inch single of \\"Sally\\" was released which Phillips believed was not the best track for a single. The 1996 Blueprint reissue states that its track order was rearranged to the originally intended order. On October 13, 2017, Esoteric Recordings (a Cherry Red Records label) released a 2-disc deluxe edition of the album. Disc 1 contains a new remaster of the original stereo mix of the album. Disc 2 contains 16 previously unreleased demos and contemporaneous material.

She was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Roscommon constituency at the July 1964 by- election caused by the death of her husband James Burke. Her victory made her the first woman to ever represent County Roscommon as a TD, and she was only the fourth woman to represent Cumann na nGaedheal/Fine Gael since the foundation of the state. Burke topped the poll in every single election she ever fought. Although sometimes erroneously cited as a native of Tulsk, she was, in fact, a native of Bandon, County Cork. She first came to Tulsk to attend a friend's wedding and while there met James Burke, whom she later married in 1959. At the time of the marriage, James had already been a TD for 5 years. It was in James' native Tulsk the pair settled. As a TD, Joan Burke was a pronounced opponent of the ‚Äúmarriage bar‚Äù which prohibited women in Ireland from working in the public sector if they were married (the mentality of the time being that a married woman's place was in the home). She was also a noted advocate for the rights of farmers. She retired from politics at the 1981 general election.

Uses Hobnailed boots (in Scotland \\"tackety boots\\") are boots with hobnails (nails inserted into the soles of the boots), usually installed in a regular pattern, over the sole. They usually have an iron horseshoe-shaped insert, called a heel iron, to strengthen the heel, and an iron toe-piece. They may also have steel toecaps. The hobnails project below the sole and provide traction on soft or rocky ground and snow, but they tend to slide on smooth hard surfaces. They have been used since antiquity for inexpensive durable footwear, often by workmen and the military. Examples include the caligae of the Roman military, and the trench boots of World War I. Important design work for the modern hobnailed boot was done during World War I, e.g. the \\"Pershing boot\\" in the United States. Problems experienced in designing WWI US Army boots were: *Tearing at the backstay: solved by securing the backstay with three rows of stitching each side. *Letting water in: solved by dubbin. *Rotting in foul conditions in trenches: solved by chrome tanning rather than using vegetable tanning. *Cold conducting through hobnails into the feet: that, and need for strength, solved by three thicknesses of leather in the soles. *Sole wear: toe and heel irons in addition to hobnails. Hobnailed boots were formerly used for mountaineering to grip on sloping rock surfaces. Mountaineering hobnailed boots tended to have large pointed hobnails on the extreme edges of the soles and heels to grip small roughness on steeply sloping rock and on snow, particularly before crampons were used.

It was the issuer of Ecuadorian sucre money until dollarization in 2000. The Revoluci√≥n Juliana (July 9, 1925) initiated the process of founding a national bank issuer. The country's crisis, caused by non-convertibility of the currency, banknote printing without reserves to support the increase in currency, inflation, speculation, abuse of credit, unbalanced payments, lack of official control over the banks and banking anarchy and strife, required cleaning up the currency situation. Current general manager is Ver√≥nica Artola. Foundation The Central Bank of Ecuador is the organization created to meet these goals, within a patchwork of reforms of the Ecuadorian economy advocated by the military and civilians who supported Julian ideas. However, as the exchange rate and monetary regime are extremely sensitive in a small open economy like Ecuador's, the proposal had to evolve and overcome the inertia of social sectors uninterested in progress of that nature. An intermediate step was the creation of the Central Fund of Issue and Redemption on June 26, 1926, which oversees debt repayment and temporarily authorizes the circulation of banknotes. On October 18, 1926, President Isidro Ayora declared that banks authorized to issue banknotes must hand over to the Central Fund specified quantities of gold and silver which, in total, amounted to ten million six hundred thousand sucres. Meanwhile, the mission headed by Edwin W. Kemmerer prepared a comprehensive economic overhaul, which modernised Ecuador's financial practices. Kemmerer was chosen for this task as he had successfully performed similar tasks in other countries in South America. On February 11, 1927, the Kemmerer mission presented their findings to the Government Bill of the Central Bank of Ecuador, together with an explanatory memorandum. They suggested a corporation licensed for 50 years to issue money, discounted at a fixed rate, become a repository of government and member banks, manage the foreign exchange market and serve as fiscal agent for the country as a whole. Because the functions of the new institution were \\"closely linked to the sovereign rights of the Government and the public interest, the Government was asked to participate in his administration. On March 12, 1927, the President Isidro Ayora enacted the Organic Law of Central Bank of Ecuador (Official Register No. 283). The preparation of the functioning of the new institution was in charge of an Organizing Committee, appointed by himself Ayora. On 3 June 1927, Ecuador approved the statutes; they negotiated between the two agencies, and overcame difficulties between the Central Fund Release and the new institution finally on August 10, 1927 the Central Bank of Ecuador opened its doors. On 25 August 1927, Main Branch opened in Guayaquil. Evolution The new institution's first task was to stabilize and unify the currency. To achieve this, the Issuer Institute won the \\"gold standard exchange\\", a monetary system set the price of the sucre in terms of gold; their basic objective was to keep the price of the sucre fixed at 0.300933 grams of fine gold, or one fifth of the fine gold content of the U.S. dollar at that time. This convertibility forced an economic crisis when the United States entered its Great Depression (1929), which led to enact a new moratorium on payments on February 8, 1932. Since then, the traditional policy of deficit spending and credit, which funded the Ecuadorian economy between 1915 and 1925, regained its validity. Reforms =After the depression of 1929= Price instability driven by government spending and expansionary monetary policy forced the country to resort to another consultant, Manuel G√≥mez Morin, to reform the Central Bank Act and related monetary policy. G√≥mez Morin advised monetary authorities to channel credit to sectors of the economy deemed critical in the development process. Along with Victor Emilio Estrada, prominent Guayaquil banker, advised the Banco Central del Ecuador axis to determine the types of loans offered by private banks to the productive sector and changing the discount rate (1937). The difficulties in implementing the recommendations of Gomez Morin were immense. However, since then the relations between the government and banks were deeply modified. =After World War II= After World War II ended, a new surge in inflation, together with an imbalance of payments rendered it necessary, once again, to bring in foreign experts. In 1948, the manager of the Issuer Institute, Guillermo Perez Chiriboga, and Robert Triffin, from the Federal Reserve System of the United States, were called in to assist. Harvard's consultant proposed to replace the Central Bank Law and the Law of the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Law. This would require instituting a Directory of Ecuador Central Bank as an arm of the government, thereby making it responsible for overseeing national financial matters and giving it the power to devalue the currency, also to run countercyclical policies. The Issuer Institute was authorized to give loans to the state and the industrial sector, and finally, an accounting system was instituted that allowed them to assume the new functions. This was presented as the final goal of price stability and the preservation of sound financial standing. =After the upsurge of Debt= For more than three decades, this monetary regime successfully faced many shocks. However, the extent of the external debt crisis unleashed in 1981, the adjustments necessary to bring an unbalanced economy back into equilibrium, fiscal pressures, unbridled inflation and, above all, the need to reorder the whole economy to return to a more appropriate growth path, made yet more drastic changes necessary. To this end, in May 1992, the government issued the Law of Monetary Regime and State Bank, whereby the Central Bank of Ecuador was able to intervene in the financial system through open market operations. With this powerful instrument of policy, it has been possible to control inflation, unprecedented in the monetary history of Ecuador. Additionally, the need for new commitments for public sector austerity forced to violate the power to grant credit to the Treasury. Finally, in order to protect the interests of customers of the banking system, the Central Bank of Ecuador was authorized to operate as a lender of last resort, within strict financial parameters. It is clear now that the primary commitment of an institution of issue is to ensure price stability and external viability.

F. Smith was a military post established in the Powder River country by the United States Army in Montana Territory on August 12, 1866, during Red Cloud's War. Established by order of Col. Henry B. Carrington, it was one of five forts proposed to protect the Bozeman Trail against the Oglala Lakota (Sioux), who saw the trail as a violation of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie . The fort was abandoned in 1868 and burned by the Sioux under Red Cloud.  History  The U.S. Army was ordered to build forts to protect the Bozeman trail after travel had become hazardous for any but the largest and best-armed parties. Colonel Henry B. Carrington was given command of the effort, planning Fort C.F. Smith at the crossing of the Bighorn River, Fort Phil Kearny to the east of the Bighorn Mountains, and Fort Reno on the Powder River. A fourth fort on the Clark Fork River was never built. Originally named Fort Ransom, the post was renamed in commemoration of Gen. Charles Ferguson Smith. It included a 125-foot square stockade made of adobe and wood for protection, with bastions for concentrated defense. Two companies of the 18th Infantry Regiment (approximately 90-100 officers and men) were stationed at Fort Smith during 1866, and during 1867 the garrison consisted of 400 men of the 27th Infantry. A large Sioux party unsuccessfully attacked haycutters guarded by 20 soldiers near the Fort in the Hayfield Fight in 1867. The Army abandoned Fort C.F. Smith as a condition of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. The site of the fort is located on private land, on what is today the Crow Indian Reservation. It is just outside the town of Fort Smith, Montana. Since most of the fort's buildings were made of adobe, as of 2010 the foundations of the structures can still be seen as low mounds rising a foot or two off the pasture. By looking carefully, the arrangement of buildings around the perimeter of the old parade ground can be discerned. A stone monument in the approximate center of the parade ground (placed in the 1930s) commemorates the fort. A wooden sign, in poor repair, marks the Bozeman Trail. Fort C.F. Smith was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It is included within Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, with including six contributing sites.

The area was introduced to Islam by an 11th-century preacher by the name of Shah Sultan Rumi who arrived in 1053 CE. After gaining the king's respect, Rumi was given a few villages, in particular Madanpur, as a rent-free area. Rumi was buried in Madanpur in 1075. In 1829, the British East India Company tried to takeover the shrine estate. This was contested by the guardians of the shrine who provided an old Persian document dating from 1082 CE. In response, the government abandoned the plan and granted the estate to the document holder; Syed Jalaluddin. In 1874, Netrokona was made a thana. Amidst the Indian independence movement, influential nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose gave a speech at the Methar Patti grounds on 15 March 1939.

The operation was prompted by the invasion of Chad by a joint force of Libyan units and Chadian Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) rebels in June 1983. While France was at first reluctant to participate, the Libyan air-bombing of the strategic oasis of Faya-Largeau starting on July 31 led to the assembling in Chad of 3,500 French troops, the biggest French intervention since the end of the colonial era. The French troops, instead of attempting to expel the Libyan forces from Chad, drew a \\"line in the sand\\". They concentrated their forces on the 15th parallel, the so-called \\"Red Line,\\" (later moved up to the 16th parallel) to block the Libyan and GUNT advance towards the N'Djamena, thus saving the Chadian President Hiss√®ne Habr√©. The Libyan and rebel forces also avoided attacking across the Red Line and provoking the French. The resulting impasse led to the de facto partition of Chad, with the Libyans and the GUNT in the north and Habr√© and the French in central and southern Chad. To end this stalemate, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi negotiated a mutual withdrawal of their countries' troops from Chad in September 1984. The accord was respected by the French, thus signing the end of Operation Manta, but not by the Libyans, whose forces remained in Chad until 1987 (they did, however, continue to respect the Red Line). The violation of the 15th parallel caused a renewed French intervention in Chad under Operation Epervier and the expulsion of Libyan forces from all Chad except for the Aouzou Strip the following year. Background Chad had been involved in a civil war since 1965, which reached its most dramatic phase in 1979 when a fragile alliance between the President F√©lix Malloum and the Prime Minister Hiss√®ne Habr√© collapsed, unleashing factional politics. International mediators midwifed the formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), comprising all armed factions, but civil war reignited in 1980 when Habr√©, now Defence Minister, rebelled against the GUNT's Chairman, Goukouni Oueddei. Habr√© succeeded in taking N'Djamena, the Chadian capital, on August 7, 1982.T. Collelo, Chad Refusing to acknowledge Habr√© as the new Chadian President, Goukouni refounded the GUNT as an anti-Habr√© coalition of armed groups in October in the town of Barda√Ø .S.Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy, p. 188 While Gaddafi had kept himself mostly aloof in the months prior to the fall of N'Djamena,S. Nolutshungu, p. 185 he decided to reinvolve himself in the Chadian conflict after Goukouni's fall. He recognized Goukouni as the legitimate ruler of Chad and decided to arm and train his forces.K. Pollack, Arabs at War, p. 382 Crisis Gaddafi, judging the time to be ripe for a decisive offensive, ordered a massive joint GUNT-Libyan attack against Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in northern Chad, during June 1983. The fall of the city on June 24 generated a crisis in Franco-Libyan relations, with the French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson announcing that day that France \\"would not remain indifferent\\" to Libya's intervention in Chad.M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, A Study in Crisis, p. 91 The 3,000 man-strong GUNT force continued its advance towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Ab√©ch√©, the main city in eastern Chad, which fell on July 8. These victories gave Goukouni and Gaddafi control of the main routes from the north to N'Djamena,M. Azevedo, Roots of Violence, p. 110 and also severing Habr√©'s supply line to Sudan. As the rebels advanced, with poorly concealed assistance from Libya, Habr√© appealed for international help. Rejecting direct intervention and downplaying the Libyan role, France was prepared to go no further than airlifting arms and fuel, with the first French arms shipments arriving on June 27. On July 3, Zaire flew in a detachment of 250 paratroopers, eventually raised to about 2,000 men. Deployed chiefly around N'Djamena, the Zaireans freed Chadian troops to fight the rebels. The United States further announced that 25 million US dollars in military and food aid would be provided. Thus assisted, and taking advantage of the GUNT's overextended supply line, Habr√© took personal command of the Chadian National Armed Forces (FANT) and drove Goukouni's army out of Ab√©ch√© four days after the city's fall. FANT recaptured Faya-Largeau on July 30 and went on to retake other points in the north. French intervention A map of Chad including the 15th parallel (the Red Line) where the French separated government and rebel forces Faced with the collapse of the GUNT-Libyan offensive, Gaddafi increased his force commitment forces in Chad. Libyan MiGs bombed Faya-Largeau on the day after it was recaptured by FANT, in the first undisguised Libyan intervention in the crisis. A force of 11,000 Libyan troops, complete with armour and artillery, was airlifted into the Aouzou Strip, to support the GUNT forces, along with eighty combat aircraft, a considerable portion of the Libyan Air Force. Habr√© entrenched himself in Faya-Largeau with 5,000 troops, but he could not match the massive Libyan firepower, losing a third of his army and being forced out of Faya and retreating 200 miles south.K. Pollack, p. 183 Habr√© issued a fresh plea for French military assistance on August 6.J. Jessup, An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict, p. 116 French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, under pressure from the US and Francophone African states, announced on August 9 his determination to contain Gaddafi. A ground force was rapidly dispatched from the bordering Central African Republic, beginning Operation Manta.M. Azevedo, p. 139S. Nolutshungu, p. 189 The first French contingents were deployed north of N'Djamena at points on the two possible routes of advance on the capital. Fighter aircraft and antitank helicopters were dispatched to Chad to discourage an attack on N'Djamena. As the buildup proceeded, forward positions were established roughly along the 15th parallel from Mao in the west to Ab√©ch√© in the east (the so-called \\"Red Line\\"), which the French tried to maintain as the line separating the combatants. This force eventually rose to become the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by France in Africa since the Algerian War, reaching 3,500 troops and several squadrons of Jaguar fighter-bombers. Stalemate Although France said it would not tolerate Libya's military presence at Faya-Largeau on August 25,M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 92 Mitterrand was unwilling to openly confront Libya and return northern Chad to Habr√©. This inaction gave the impression that the French were willing to concede control of Northern Chad to Gaddafi. The Libyans, too, avoided crossing the Red Line, thereby avoiding engagement with the French troops. While the division of the country left Habr√© unsatisfied with Gaddafi's influence in Chadian affairs, the Chadian President benefited greatly from the French intervention. He was also able to restore his old ties with the French military, and create new ones with the French Socialists. On the other side of the Red Line, the stalemate was a far greater problem for the GUNT, bogged down in the arid north but far away from Tripoli, where the main decision-making took place. It was only a question of time before rifts would start emerging between the Libyan military and the GUNT forces, due to Libya's inability to balance the demands from these two groups.S. Nolutshungu, pp. 189-190 France and Libya pursued bilateral negotiations independently from the Chadian factions which they sponsored, as well as the militantly anti- Libyan Reagan Administration in the United States, which favoured negotiations between Goukouni and Habr√©. For a time, France seemed interested in the Libyan suggestion of replacing Habr√© and Goukouni with a \\"third man.\\" However, these negotiation attempts repeated the failure of the peace talks which had been promoted by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in November 1983. Renewed fighting The OAU-supported mediation attempt made by Ethiopia's leader Mengistu Haile Mariam at the beginning of 1984 was not any more successful than previous attempts. On January 24, GUNT troops backed by heavily armed Libyan counterparts, overran the Red Line and attacked the FANT outpost of Ziguey, northern Kanem,M. Azevedo, p. 110, 139S. Nolutshungu, p. 189, 191 200 km south of the Red Line in order to secure French and African support for new negotiations. Thirty FANT soldiers were killed and twelve taken prisoner, while in Zine, close to Mao, two Belgian doctors of M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders) were taken hostage.G. Ngansop, Tchad, p. 150 This attack forced the French to counter-attack, although not in the manner desired by Habr√©. He felt the French ought to retaliate by striking the GUNT at Faya-Largeau, which would have served as a declaration of war on Libya and escalated the conflict, something Mitterrand wanted to avoid at all costs. Instead, on January 25, French Defence Minister Charles Hernu ordered two Jaguar fighter-bombers to interdict the attackers and pursue them during their retreat. While the advance was blocked, a Jaguar was shot down and its pilot killed, leading to the January 27 decision to move the Red Line from the 15th to the 16th parallel, running from Koro Toro to Oum Chalouba. The French also moved a squadron of four Jaguars from Libreville, Gabon to N'Djamena.M. Azevedo, p. 110G. Ngansop, pp. 150-151 French withdrawal On April 30, Gaddafi proposed a mutual withdrawal of both French and Libyan forces from Chad in order to end the stalemate. The offer was accepted by Mitterrand, and four months later, Mitterrand and Gaddafi met on September 17, announcing that the troop withdrawal would start on September 25, and be completed by November 10. The Libyan offer arrived when the French were becoming bogged down in an intervention that promised no rapid solution. Also, the cost of the mission, which had reached a 150 million CFA Francs per day, and the loss of a dozen troops following a number of incidents, turned the majority of French public opinion in favour of the departure of French forces from Chad.G. Ngansop, pp. 154-155 The agreement was initially hailed in France as a great success that attested to Mitterrand's diplomatic skills. The French troops retired before the expiry of the agreed withdrawal date, leaving behind only a 100-strong technical mission and a considerable amount of material for the FANT. To Mitterrand's embarrassment, France discovered on December 5 that Gaddafi, while pulling out some forces, had kept at least 3,000 troops camouflaged in the north.S. Nolutshungu, p. 190M. Azevedo, pp. 139-140 Reactions to the withdrawal The French withdrawal badly strained Franco-Chadian relations, as Habr√© felt both insulted and abandoned by the French government. Rumors of \\"secret clauses\\" in the Franco-Libyan accord spread from N'Djamena throughout Africa. These rumors obligated the French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas to formally deny the existence of such clauses in the Franco-African summit held in Bujumbura in December. Mitterrand resisted pressure from African governments to return to Chad, with the Foreign Relations Secretary of Mitterrand's Socialist Party Jacques Hustinger proclaiming that \\"France can't be forever the gendarme of Francophone Africa\\".G. Ngansop, p. 158 After the return of the French troops in their country, Mitterrand found himself accused both at home and abroad of having been naive in trusting the word \\"of a man who has never maintained it\\". Gaddafi emerged with a major diplomatic victory that enhanced his status as a Third World leader who had duped the French government.M. Azevedo, p. 140 Aftermath The year following the French withdrawal was one of the quietest since the ascent to power of Habr√©, with both forces carefully remaining on their side of the Red Line, even if the GUNT had initially expressed the desire to march on N'Djamena and unseat Habr√©. Habr√© instead used the truce to strengthen his position through a series of peace accords with minor rebel groups. These weakened the GUNT, which was increasingly divided by internal dissension and progressively estranged from the Libyans, who were pursuing a strategy of annexation towards northern Chad.G. Ngansop, pp. 159-160S. Nolutshungu, pp. 191-193 At the beginning of 1986, the GUNT was increasingly isolated internationally and disintegrating internally. In reaction to this decline of his client, which legitimized the Libyan presence in Chad, Gaddafi encouraged the rebels to attack the FANT outpost of Kouba Olanga across the Red Line on February 18, with the support of Libyan armour. This brought the French return to Chad in Operation Epervier, restoring the Red Line. A few months later and to the surprise of no one, the GUNT rebelled against its former Libyan patrons, opening the way for the Toyota War in 1987 which expelled the Libyans from all Chad except the Aouzou Strip. The Aouzou Strip was finally restored to Chad in 1994.S.

The building was designed in 1937 to host the Mostra della Civilt√† Romana during the 1942 World Fair by Italian architects Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto Bruno La Padula and Mario Romano. It lies in the district of Rome known as the Esposizione Universale Roma (also known as 'E.42' and 'EUR'). It is particularly symbolic of this district, exemplifying its monumentality. The building is an example of Italian Rationalism and of Fascist architecture.  History  View of the building during its construction (1940) The Palazzo della Civilt√† Italiana was constructed as part of the program of the Esposizione Universale Roma, a large business center and suburban complex, initiated in 1935 by Benito Mussolini for the planned 1942 world exhibition and as a symbol of fascism for the world. The Palazzo was designed by the architects Giovanni Guerrini, Ernesto Bruno Lapadula and Mario Romano and constructed between 1938 and 1943. It was inaugurated on 30 November 1940 as the centerpiece of the Esposizione and continues to be its most iconic building. The structure is also considered one of the most representative examples of Fascist architecture at the EUR. The exhibition was cancelled on June 3, 1941, while the building was being finished. It stood empty, abandoned for over a decade. The building opened its doors to the public for the first time in 1953. It hosted the Roma 1953 Agricultural Exhibition (EA53). Between 2003 and 2008, the palace was closed to the public for restoration. Since 2015, it has housed the headquarters of luxury fashion label Fendi, and will continue to do so for the next 15 years at least. Fendi will reportedly pay 2.8 million euros per annum to occupy the space.Fendi's New Headquarters Are a Fascist Icon Blouin Artinfo, July 18, 2013. The ground floor of the building will reportedly be left clear to house exhibitions celebrating Italian craftsmanship.Karmali, Sarah (18 July 2013), Fendi Relocates To A Roman Palace Vogue. An exhibition, entitled \\"Una Nuova Roma\\", about the history of the EUR district was on display until March 7, 2016, on the ground floor of the building.  Design  The EUR provides a large-scale image of how urban Italy might have looked if the fascist regime had not fallen during the war‚Äîlarge, symmetrical streets and austere buildings of limestone, tuff and marble, in either Stile Littorio (lictor), inspired by ancient Roman architecture, or Rationalism. Its architectural style is often called simplified neoclassicism. Marcello Piacentini, the coordinator of the commission for E42, based it on the Italian Rationalism of Pagano, Libera, and Michelucci. The design of the \\"Square Colosseum\\" was inspired more to celebrate the Colosseum, and the structure was intended by Benito Mussolini as a celebration of the older Roman landmark. Similar to the Colosseum, the palace has a series of superimposed loggias, shown on the fa√ßade as six rows of nine arches each, although these two numbers, originally 13 x 8, changed several times (11 x 7, 11 x 6, 7 x 5) during the project and construction phases.Casciato (2002), pp. 56-60 Atop all four sides of the building runs the inscription taken from a speech of Benito Mussolini on 2 October 1935: \\"Un popolo di poeti, di artisti, di eroi, di santi, di pensatori, di scienziati, di navigatori, di trasmigratori\\" (English: a nation of poets, of artists, of heroes, of saints, of thinkers, of scientists, of navigators, of transmigrators). The meaning of trasmigratori in this context is generally obscure even to native Italians today, but at the time it was a reference to the first intercontinental flights pioneereed by the Italians, such as the Decennial Air Cruise undertaken by Italo Balbo. The palace is entirely clad in travertine marble, as is characteristic of buildings in the EUR. It is a parallelepiped on a square base, with six levels rising above a podium. The scale is imposing: the base covers an area of 8,400 square meters, and the building has volume 205,000 cubic meters with a height 68 meters (50 meters from the base). = Statuary = At the four corners of the podium are placed four equestrian sculptural groups by Publio Morbiducci and Alberto de Felci, representing the Dioscuri, the two mythical Greek heroes, sons of Zeus and Leda. About the base of the building are 28 additional statueshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11938018/Fendi- unveils-restored-Mussolini-building-as-its-headquarters-in-Rome.html of approximately 3.4 meters in height, each under an arch, illustrating various industries and trades. These statues were added in 1942, having been constructed by eight companies specialized in the working of Carrara marble in the provinces of Lucca and Massa-Carrara.

Directed by Brian Katkin. Screenplay by John Huckert and Dan Acre, from a story by Huckert, Acre, and Damian Akhavi. Released through New Concorde. 86 minutes, rated R. It was the last film shot at Roger Corman's studios in Venice Beach, California, and it only had a 12-day shooting schedule. The studio was being torn down during the production. The film began life as a remake of Slumber Party Massacre, and writers John Huckert and Dan Acre were hired to pen the script. But after visiting the soon-to-be-demolished studio they came up with this idea instead. Producer Damien Akhavi helped them write the story. Footage from the original Slumber Party Massacre can still be seen during a murder sequence as an in- joke for the production crew. Though principal photography took place in February 2001, the final sequences were not filmed until July 2002. The long break was necessitated by the fact that the scenes were to be shot in Malibu, but the rainfall was unusually heavy, so the completion of the film was postponed. Director Katkin shot another film during the break in this movie's production. Plot The film begins with an egotistical film student named Steve (Stanovich) recounting to his girlfriend Madigan (Shelton-White) the history of Slaughter Studios. As a child he adored the horror movies that were produced there, but the studio closed down twenty years ago after an actor named Justin Kirkpatric was accidentally killed during a film shoot. The next day Steve tells Madigan and some of his fellow students that he wants to use the abandoned studio to film one last horror movie. The catch is that the studio is being torn down the next day, meaning that they only have 9 hours to shoot the entire feature-length picture, whose script is titled Naughty Sex Kittens vs. the Giant Praying Mantis. One of Steve's friends, Trish (Frajko), says that some of the girls in her acting class would probably love to do it. Steve selects a young actor named Kevin (Read) to play the monster, and Madigan will be the production assistant, though she would much prefer to act in the movie, though Steve refuses to give her a part. Later that night Steve and Madigan arrive at the studio, and they are introduced to the cast...snotty Portia (Killian), dim-witted Rebecca (Otis), floozy Darlene (Ellison), airhead Candace (McComas), and Chad (Keefe), who is playing the leading role. Also helping out is Olie (Chulani), who is there to work as the sound department. Steve explains to them that they have to be careful because every hour the security guard will do his rounds. They break into the studio (accidentally disturbing a homeless man in the process) and begin to set up for the shoot. It turns out that Chad is a truly lousy actor, so Steve sends him off to a secluded room to practice his lines so he will not disturb anyone. While going over his lines by himself a shadowy figure sneaks up behind him and kills him with a pick ax. Believing that Chad decided to leave, Steve casts Olie as the leading man. Steve also improvises a lesbian sex scene to be included in the film, and gets Darlene and Rebecca to agree to it. The two become so excited during the scene that they end up actually having sex. Following this the two women go off to shower to clean themselves up; while finding their way back to the set they are murdered. Steve is becoming increasingly agitated due to the disappearances and high levels of his stress medications. Madigan is finally able to secure a part in the movie because of the shortage of actors, and she and Kevin become attracted to one another. During this time Candace wanders off by herself to look for the ghost of Justin Kirkpatric (she is obsessed with him) and is killed. While getting ready for her next scene, Trish is strangled to death by the unknown assailant, but unbeknownst to the murderer, her death is recorded by a hidden video camera. Madigan finds the hidden camera and confronts Steve with it, thinking that he had hidden it in the women's dressing room on purpose. It turns out the camera belongs to Olie, who was hoping to sell the footage to an online porn site for some extra money. Olie decides to leave the studio for fear of facing Madigan's wrath, but on his way out he runs into the security guard, who chases him back into the studio. Steve has Gary (Roseman), the cameraman, hook up Olie's camera to a television to see if they can use any of its footage, whereupon they stumble across Trish's recorded death. Madigan realizes that there is someone hiding in the studio with them, and that this person has probably butchered everyone who has disappeared. Gary, Kevin, and Madigan all think it is best to leave, but Steve, who by now is half crazed with drugs and fear, is only concerned about completing his film. Meanwhile, Olie has discovered the bodies of Rebecca and Darlene and is being chased by the killer, who dispatches him with a spike through the head. Portia, who is unaware of the evening's events because she was passed out after taking too much of Steve's stress medication, comes to and is angered when Kevin refuses to sleep with her. She storms off by herself. Gary, meanwhile, has become separated from the others and is decapitated. Likewise, a delirious Steve has stumbled back to the sound stage and is crushed to death when the killer drops a piece of heavy equipment on him. Kevin and Madigan come across the security guard, who proceeds to chase them throughout the studio. Believing him to be the killer, they escape via car, but the guard gives chase. The two eventually overpower him, and it is discovered that he is not the murderer. In fact, he is the actor who inadvertently killed Justin Kirkpatric twenty years earlier. The three realize that the killer is still inside the studio...and so is Portia. Back at the set Portia is trying to find the others when the killer impales her. It is then that the murderer is finally revealed to be the homeless man that the students scared off earlier in the evening. He says, \\"It ain't right to fuck with a man's house.\\" Beside him sits the ghost of Justin Kirkpatric, who shares his sentiment.

The film originally ended with a director yelling Cut! and the crew applauding. Katkin filmed this ending but didn't like it and edited it out. Director Brian Katkin spoke highly of the writers and gave them respectful mention to their work while being interviewed by Fangora Magazine, but sadly, Fangora's editing department had to shorten the interview for print and edited out various parts of the interview including Katkin's 'nod' to the writers.

They are generally made of either plastic or thin cardboard to minimize additional mass. Use The sole purpose of launch lug is to provide stability for a model rocket prior to and during liftoff by forcing the rocket to remain parallel to the launch rod during the first seconds of flight, before significant velocities are reached and enough momentum is built up to maintain stability. At higher velocities, the fins act as the rocket's primary stabilizing devices. Position In smaller rockets, one launch lug is generally considered enough, and is attached at the joint between one of the rocket's fins and the main rocket body. In larger, heavier model rockets, a second launch lug is generally added closer to the nose cone and lined up with the first, to provide additional support. The diameter of a launch lug generally closely matches that of the launch rod, although it is very slightly larger to minimize friction during the precarious first moments of flight.

He graduated from W. J. Mouat Secondary School in Abbotsford. Career =Commentator= Early career Ranallo began his career as an announcer and manager at the age of 16, when he was offered a job with All-Star Wrestling (in Vancouver), a nationally televised wrestling show throughout Canada. After that program ended production and the promotion folded in 1989, Ranallo became a disc jockey for Abbotsford, British Columbia radio station CFVR (now CKQC-FM). Later, he provided commentary announcing duties for Muay Thai/Kickboxing events and King of the Cage mixed martial arts shows on TSN. Stampede Wrestling and Top Ranked Wrestling From 1999 to 2000, he served as the commentator for the Stampede Wrestling TV show in Calgary. His color- commentator was the late Bad News Allen. Ranallo was also the commentator for KVOS-TV's Top Ranked Wrestling for most of that program's run in 2005‚Äì06. Mixed martial arts, Muay Thai, boxing and New Japan Pro-Wrestling He became most prominently known among MMA fans as the voice of Pride Fighting Championships PPV broadcasts in North America from 2003 until October 2006. He was initially paired with friend, longtime-PRIDE commentator, and MMA legend Bas Rutten. After Rutten departed the broadcast, Bas was replaced by Frank Trigg. Ranallo continued to commentate on MMA as part of the EliteXC and ShoXC broadcast team from 2006 until their closure in October 2008. Ranallo continued to be the voice of MMA on Showtime by becoming the mainstay of the commentary team for Strikeforce until that organisation's acquisition and eventual merger with the Ultimate Fighting Championship in 2013. He was also the lead announcer of the Muay Thai Premier League (a global combat sports league featuring the fighting arts of Muay Thai). Ranallo continues to work as a broadcaster for Showtime Networks, and provides commentary for three major combat sports: Showtime Championship Boxing, Glory Kickboxing, and Invicta Fighting Championships MMA. In 2015 he returned to his pro-wrestling roots when he became the voice of New Japan Pro-Wrestling in the U.S. alongside MMA legend and former NJPW wrestler Josh Barnett. =WWE (2015-2020)= SmackDown commentator (2015‚Äì2017) Ranallo signed a contract with professional wrestling company WWE on December 15, 2015, and made his WWE debut as the play-by-play commentator for the SmackDown broadcast team for its premiere on USA Network on January 7, 2016, thus being dubbed \\"The Voice of SmackDown\\". Ranallo has had many commentary partners while calling SmackDown: Jerry Lawler, Byron Saxton, Michael Cole, Tom Phillips, David Otunga, and John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield. Additionally, Ranallo commentated the Cruiserweight Classic alongside Daniel Bryan; the tournament aired from July 6 to September 14, 2016. Ranallo continued to commentate for the cruiserweights on their weekly WWE 205 Live show which first aired from November 29, 2016. His partners were Corey Graves and Austin Aries. For WWE pay-per-view events, Ranallo was assigned to calling the pre-show of WrestleMania 32 in April 2016, but later commentated on the main cards of several WWE PPVs: the SmackDown or cruiserweight matches on 2016's SummerSlam, Survivor Series and 2017's Royal Rumble, and SmackDown PPVs such as 2016's Backlash, No Mercy, and 2017's Elimination Chamber. Absence from commentary (2017) Ranallo was absent from WWE commentary beginning with the March 14, 2017 episode of SmackDown Live, including missing WrestleMania 33. WWE first claimed that Ranallo had missed a show due to travel issues associated with the March 2017 North American blizzard. When Ranallo missed another show a week later, WWE said he was ill. Ranallo reportedly missed the shows due to depression, with one alleged reason for the illness (supported by Ranallo's close friend Bas Rutten from mixed martial arts) being bullied by fellow commentator John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield. On WWE's Bring It To The Table show, JBL had mocked Ranallo for tweeting about winning the \\"Best Announcer\\" award from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. On March 24, Ranallo tweeted, \\"I'm deeply touched by your tweets of support. My doctor wants me to stay off social media for now but I wanted to thank you.\\" CBSSports.com reported in April, citing an unnamed source, that Ranallo was not expected to return to WWE's television programming. WWE did not confirm this, but told CBSSports.com that Ranallo's contract was valid until August 12, 2017. WWE subsequently removed mentions of Ranallo from their social media websites, and Ranallo also removed mentions of WWE from his Twitter account. Angered WWE fans called on WWE to fire Layfield, with some even claiming they cancelled their WWE Network subscriptions in protest. Ranallo's alleged treatment by Layfield as well as revelations from ring announcer Justin Roberts's autobiography resulted in a scandal for WWE because of their refusal to stop backstage harassment. On April 22, Newsweek reported that Ranallo and WWE \\"mutually agreed to part ways\\", and Ranallo released a statement in which he said his departure had \\"nothing to do with JBL.\\" NXT commentator (2017‚Äì2020) On June 22, 2017, Ranallo announced that he would join NXT as their lead commentator after mutually coming to new terms on a new contract agreement with WWE.

Dave Meltzer reported that Ranallo has signed a new multi-year deal which will have him work all NXT tapings and NXT TakeOver specials. He continued to dual work for Bellator MMA as well working the British show at least whilst back on NXT. On August 31, 2020, Ranallo announced his departure from WWE on his Facebook page, which WWE subsequently confirmed on their website. =Television and internet radio host= In 2006, he was lead news anchor for the Canadian combat sports channel The Fight Network and featured on \\"Fight Network Radio\\" through Sirius Hardcore Sports Radio Channel 98. From January 2009 until 2011, he hosted The MMA Show weekly on The Score and the show was also available as a podcast. Ranallo was also one of three analysts on The Score's show Right After Wrestling, now called Aftermath, which airs after The Score's airing of WWE SmackDown and the replay of WWE Raw. Following the demise of the MMA Show and leaving The Score, Ranallo hosted \\"The Show with Mauro Ranallo\\" Podcast, which was similar to his previous show, though this podcast also became defunct in 2012. On March 9, 2016 in a press release, AXS TV announced that Ranallo would be joining Inside MMA as Bas Rutten's co-host starting March 25. The show ended on September 30, 2016. Other media Ranallo appears in the 2010 documentary Bret Hart: Survival of the Hitman, where he is interviewed about Bret Hart's career. A documentary about Ranallo entitled Bipolar Rock 'N Roller aired May 25, 2018 on Showtime. The film \\"explores Ranallo‚Äôs career, including his work on the two biggest pay-per-view events in television history, and his relentless pursuit of a childhood dream despite seemingly insurmountable odds\\" and exposes Ranallo's daily struggle living with bipolar affective disorder.  Personal life  Ranallo lives with bipolar disorder, being diagnosed at the age of 19 in 1989. The mental illness started after Ranallo's close friend Michael Janzen died aged 19 of a heart attack. In 2015, Ranallo recounted, \\"I would go through these unbelievable mood swings ... I never attempted suicide, but I have had suicidal thoughts ... The biggest challenge is there are many days I feel like a fraud.\\" Additionally, Ranallo said he has \\"been very open about this for many, many years\\", and wants to be an \\"advocate\\" to end \\"stigma attached to mental illness\\".

Completed in 1892, the Pioneer Building was designed by architect Elmer Fisher, who designed several of the historic district's new buildings following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Location From Seattle's earliest days until the early 1880s, the corner of First and James was the site of Henry and Sarah Yesler's home and orchard, with his steam-powered sawmill located across the way. His home served as the center of social life and hospitality in early Seattle. As Seattle's business district began to grow rapidly in the early 1880s, Yesler moved to his new mansion, designed by architect William E. Boone, three blocks away at 4th and James in 1884. Rather than demolishing his old house and fully redeveloping his property, he moved the house to the back of the lot and filled his First Avenue frontage with displaced buildings purchased and relocated from across the street. He began planning an office block at First and James in late 1888 with the completed elevation drawings by architects Fisher & Clark put on public display that December. Local media proclaimed it would be one of the finest buildings in the country, and the largest north of San Francisco. While the lumber was being cut and contracts for the steel work and terra cotta were still being secured, excavation for the southern half of the building began in mid-February, 1889 with the temporary relocation of several existing structures on the site, followed by their demolition, including the original Yesler home, the following month. Yesler's plan was to construct the southern half of the building first, then finish the northern portion the following building season after payments for recently sold property would be secured. Grading was completed and construction began in May but was soon halted due to a shortage of rough stone that was plaguing the city; only 144 tons of the 800 tons of stone that were ordered for the building could be delivered. Several months after the Great Seattle Fire leveled 32 blocks of downtown and new grades and street widths had been firmly established, Yesler proceeded with the construction of the Pioneer Building. Design The Pioneer Building is a symmetrical block, measuring . The exterior walls are constructed of Bellingham Bay gray sandstone at the basement and first floor, with red brick on the upper five floors (with the exception of two stone pilasters which extended to the full height of the tower over the main entrance). Spandrel panels and other ornamental elements are terra cotta from Gladding, McBean in California. There are three projecting bays of cast iron, the curved bays at the corner and on the James Street facade, and the angled bay above the main entrance. The building reflects a mix of Victorian and Romanesque Revival influences. The facades, with vertical pilasters and horizontal belt courses creating a grid, reflect Victorian compositional strategies. Details such as the round arches over groups of windows and the arched main entrance and corner entrance are Romanesque Revival elements. The exterior walls are load-bearing, as is the firewall that extends through the building from the street to the alley. The interior structure is cast iron columns and steel beams supporting timber joists. As was typical practice in the period, the office floors were designed and built with permanent partitions forming 185 office rooms‚Äîa tenant would simply rent one or more office rooms. Light is provided to the interior through two atria‚Äîone in the center of the south portion of the building, the other in the north portion of the building. Constructed at a cost of $270,000 , the Pioneer Building was considered one of Seattle's finest post-fire business blocks. It has always been highly visible, forming a portion of one side of Seattle's Pioneer Place Park. The Pioneer Building originally had a seventh floor tower room (with a pyramidal roof) located directly above the front entrance making the building . It was removed as a result of damage caused by the 1949 earthquake. History The newly constructed building quickly became an important business location for downtown Seattle. During the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897, there were 48 different mining companies that had offices in it. During Prohibition, the Pioneer Building was the clandestine location of \\"Seattle's First Speakeasy.\\" The downtown area began to grow northward, prompting businesses to move in the same direction. By the 1950s and '60s, the entire Pioneer Square district had fallen upon hard times. Many of the buildings, which were barely 60 years old, sat empty and decaying, and were slated to be torn down and replaced with parking garages. The Seattle Hotel was the first to be razed, which prompted the citizens to initiate a campaign to preserve the district. The rest of the buildings were spared the wrecking ball, and Pioneer Square‚ÄìSkid Road Historic District were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1977, the Pioneer Building was listed as a National Historic Landmark alongside two other elements of the city's post-fire rebuilding: a pergola that was built as a cable car waiting area in 1909 (Pioneer Square pergola), and the 1940 replica of a stolen Tlingit totem pole gifted to the city in 1899 (Pioneer Square totem pole). Today, the Pioneer Building houses, among other things, Doc Maynard's Nightclub and Lounge, where one can buy tickets for the popular Seattle Underground Tour. At the end of the tour, there is a gift shop, located fittingly in the building's ground-floor level. Several businesses and offices are also located inside, including The Olmsted Law Group PLLC, dePonce Immigration and Citizenship Law, Cost of Wisconsin miniature golf-course designers' Western Regional Office, and Henry's Bail Bonds. Current use In December 2015, the Pioneer Building was purchased by workspace provider Novel Coworking, which has renovated the building's interior to create private offices and co-working space for small businesses.Lerman, Rachel (December 23, 2015), \\"Seattle‚Äôs latest co-working space will be historic Pioneer Building,\\" The Seattle Times File:Seattle - Pioneer Square totem pole 04.jpgThe Pioneer Building is seen here beyond the totem pole that shares its listing in the NRHP.

Jeff, when in Washington D.C., is a regular meeting attendant. In 2009 Moss was sworn into the Homeland Security Advisory Council of the Barack Obama administration. On 28 April 2011 Jeff Moss was appointed ICANN Chief Security Officer. In July 2012, Secretary Janet Napolitano directed the Homeland Security Advisory Council to form the Task Force on CyberSkills in response to the increasing demand for the best and brightest in the cybersecurity field across industry, academia and government. The Task Force, co-chaired by Jeff Moss and Alan Paller, conducted extensive interviews with experts from government, the private sector, and academia in developing its recommendations to grow the advanced technical skills of the DHS cybersecurity workforce and expand the national pipeline of men and women with these cybersecurity skills. On October 1, the HSAC unanimously approved sending the Task Force recommendations to the Secretary. In October 2013, Jeff announced that he would be stepping down from his position at ICANN at the end of 2013. In 2013, Jeff was appointed as a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, associated with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative, within the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. In 2014, Jeff joined the Georgetown University School of Law School Cybersecurity Advisory Committee. 18 March 2016, Richemont announces his nomination for election to the Board of Directors.https://www.richemont.com/10-press-news/other-group- announcements/458-changes-to-the-board-of-directors-18032016.html In 2017, Jeff was named a Commissioner at the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The GCSC is composed of 24 prominent independent Commissioners representing a wide range of geographic regions as well as government, industry, technical and civil society stakeholders with legitimacy to speak on different aspects of cyberspace. The Commission's stated aim is to develop proposals for norms and policies to enhance international security and stability and guide responsible state and non-state behavior in cyberspace. In 2017, Jeff spearheaded the creation of the DEF CON Voting Machine Village. Debuting at DEF CON 25, the Voting Machine Village allowed hackers to test the security of electronic voting machines, including several models still in active use in the US. The machines were all compromised over the course of the conference by DEF CON attendees, some within hours of the village's opening. The resulting media coverage of the vulnerability of all tested machines sparked a national conversation and inspired legislation in Virginia. In September 2017, the Voting Machine Village produced \\"DEF CON 25 Voting Machine Hacking Village: Report on Cyber Vulnerabilities in US Election Equipment, Databases and Infrastructure\\" summarizing its findings. The findings were publicly released at an event sponsored by the Atlantic Council and the paper went on to win an O'Reilly Defender Research Award. In March of 2018, the DEF CON Voting Machine Hacking Village was awarded a Cybersecurity Excellence Award. The award cites both the spurring of a national dialog around securing the US election system and the release of the nation's first cybersecurity election plan. Current position Moss is currently based in Seattle, where he works as a security consultant for a company that is hired to test other companies' computer systems.

The wagon roads were built for freight wagons and stage travel, and also went up and over mountains and plateaus which travel via the River Trail did not require. Water was in short supply on this route, which is semi-desert for most of its length as far north as what is now Williams Lake, and the route was very rugged, but was favoured due to its lower elevation and more temperate climate than the official and more-documented routes eastward over the plateaus.

By 1889 he was estimated to be worth thirty million dollars. By 1893 the fortune had vanished. One of his homes, Cornwall Hall, was a \\"symbol of the rise, fame and decline of the 'king' of Cornwall (Pennsylvania) during America's Gilded Age\\" and was demolished after 1914. The Cornwall Furnace facilities, donated by his descendants, with their surviving stone furnace, steam-powered air-blast machinery, and related buildings, were once the nucleus of a huge industrial plantation, and are part of a designated National Historic Landmark District.Cornwall Iron Furnace, State Historic Site located in Cornwall, PA at www.cornwallironfurnace.org He commissioned architect (and fraternity brother) J.

At no taller than , Bilon was considered one of the smallest adult dwarfs in the US, but he never characterized himself as disabled. Throughout much of his adult life, he was an active member of Little People of America. During his last years, Bilon served as District 5 director of the organization.  Early years  Bilon was born in the mid-sized industrial town of Youngstown, Ohio. He was born to Michael and Esther Bilon. Bilon attended Ursuline High School in Youngstown. Bilon studied acting formally and was a graduate of Youngstown State University's school of speech and drama.  Career  Although he appeared in various television commercials and was hired for promotional events, he described himself as a \\"starving actor\\". When not acting, Bilon held several other jobs, including a bouncer at a bowling alley and a basketball coach for elementary school students. He worked as a radio dispatcher for the Mahoning County Sheriff's Department in Youngstown. He occasionally would assist in undercover operations which was facilitated by his diminutive stature. In 1979, while attending a Little People of America convention, Bilon was spotted by producer Steve Rash and director Fred Bauer, who were seeking potential cast members for the slapstick comedy, Under the Rainbow. Of the more than 400 potential actors interviewed, Bilon was among 150 selected to appear in the film. He took a leave of absence from his job as a dispatcher and went to Hollywood to \\"begin his new role\\". The small role gave Bilon an opportunity to perform with top professionals including Chevy Chase, Carrie Fisher, and Eve Arden. He later commented in a newspaper interview, \\"When a star like Chevy Chase sees you after a scene and says it was hilarious, as you watch him practically falling out of his seat, it makes you feel real good\\". Bilon's next major opportunity to participate in a film came in 1981, when he was selected to operate one of the mechanical \\"creatures\\" used in the filming of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Four mechanical E.T.s were created for the production. The puppets (constructed of fiberglass, polyurethane, and foam rubber) were designed for different functions. As a contemporary newspaper article reported: \\"One of the 'bodies' contained mechanical controls for large body movements and was operated by cables, the second had electronic controls and the third was operated by a combination of controls\\". Bilon \\"moved\\" a fourth E.T. that was needed for scenes in which the creature \\"lurched\\" across the floor. During five months of filming, the actor was burdened by a rubber costume that weighed nearly as much as he did. Fred Skidmore, a spokesman for Universal Studios, confirmed that Bilon played the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial throughout most of the film. \\"Pat did do the majority of the movie\\", Skidmore said. \\"He was also E.T. when E.T. appeared at the Hollywood Bowl last summer\\". Steven Spielberg, producer- director of the film, called Bilon \\"E.T.'s biggest helper\\".  Personal life and final days  Bilon was passionate about his ethnic heritage; he once hosted a Ukrainian Radio Hour on WKTL-FM, based in Struthers, Ohio, part of the Youngstown area. Pat was active in St. Anne's Ukrainian Catholic Church in nearby Austintown, Ohio and taught Sunday school. He was also a member of UNA Branch 119.http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1983/058303.shtml Bilon died in his home at 1 a.m. on January 27, 1983, aged 35, of complications from a blood infection after a bout of pneumonia.

It connected the city of Taipei with the town of Tamsui. History The Tamsui Line was opened on 25 August 1901, during Japanese rule, and had 17 stations, two of which (Dadaocheng, Beimen), located before Taipei Railway Station were closed to passenger traffic by 1916 and 1923 respectively (the former station, located on a branch, continued to be used by freight trains until 1937). Changan and Jiantan Stations were shut down in 1950. In 1954 a temporary Fuxinggang Station was built for the 9th annual Taiwan Province Games, which closed after the games ended. A spur track known as the Asia Branch Line located before Tamsui Station provided access to the British Merchant Warehouse operated by Royal Dutch Shell, which was closed in 1971 and the surviving track was heritage-listed along with the British Merchant Warehouse in 2000. In addition, Tatung Company had a station located between Shuanglian and Yuanshan Stations, which was originally built during World War II, finally opened on 7 October 1946 and closed on 1 March 1980. The Tamsui Line was finally closed on 15 July 1988 and was later demolished. The Taipei Metro Tamsui Line currently operates along a route similar to that of the one occupied by the TRA Tamsui Line during its existence. Infrastructure The Tamsui line was a single track line with passing sidings at most stations. Sidings range from just over 1 mile apart to the maximum distance between Zhuwei and Tamsui which was a 2.6-mile segment. Because of the limited capacity, the maximum operable headway was every half-hour.

Yorkstone slabs Newly-laid Yorkstone or York stone is a variety of sandstone, specifically from quarries in Yorkshire that have been worked since mediaeval times. Yorkstone is a tight grained, Carboniferous sedimentary rock. The stone consists of quartz, mica, feldspar, clay and iron oxides. The ratio of quartz to mica varies considerably. The stone can be split along mica-rich layers: it has a slaty cleavage and may therefore be called sandstone slate. Formerly riven (split with a chisel along the bedding planes between the sedimentary layers), it is now also often sawn. It is used for flagstones and for building walls.Articles apparently produced by Dermot Kennedy at http://www.cbstonesales.co.uk/, and also published in 2011 on Ezinearticles.com: , , Known for its hard-wearing and durable qualities, Yorkstone has been used in a wide array of building, construction and landscaping applications around the world for many years. In Yorkshire, split stones called thackstone (Scots thack, English thatch) were employed as roofing. The traditional London paving stone has been cut and pressed from quarries in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire. Yorkshire Stone is most commonly used for paving and garden walls, but it is also a popular choice for new builds as well as home extensions and conversions due to its durability to harsh weather conditions. The colour of Yorkstone depends on the minerals within its makeup and differs throughout the quarries from which it is mined. It also depends on the age of the stone and turns darker with weathering. Newly quarried Yorkstone is available as slabs for paving, setts and walling stones. It is also available to buy from stonemasons as a custom-shaped product such as signage. Reused Yorkstone paving, salvaged from demolished sites, is valued for its naturally weathered surfaces. Both old and new Yorkshire Stone can be used for paving and building alike. Reclaimed Yorkshire stone is becoming more popular for its colouring and also for environmentally friendly builds. Most stone companies in Yorkshire will cut the stone to 140mm walling size and offer a colour matching service for home extension projects. Yorkstone often shows features such as laminations with cross bedding, and rusty Liesegang bands.

Blanche Douglass Leathers (1860 - January 26, 1940) was the first woman master and a steamboat captain on the Mississippi River in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her nicknames include \\"little captain,\\" the \\"angel of the Mississippi\\" and the \\"lady skipper.\\"  Biography  Leathers was born in Tensas Parish, Louisiana and her father was a cotton planter. She married Captain Bowling S. Leathers in 1880 and had her honeymoon on his boat. Her husband taught her how to pilot and navigate the river. Leathers earned her master's license in 1894. Then Leathers began her historic voyage as the first woman steamboat captain on the Mississippi. As the Natchez steamed away from New Orleans, tugs, ferries and freighters whistled in salute. Newspaper reporters interviewed her and she gave out autographs. She would make regular trips from New Orleans to Vicksburg and was the only woman captain of a large Mississippi river packet. Leathers said that she often managed the employees, performed boat inspections and then took over as captain when her husband needed. In 1896, the Public Ledger wrote that Leathers had taken command of the Natchez. She worked on the river for 18 years and then retired in New Orleans after the death of her husband. In 1929, she came out of retirement and started piloting a steamboat, the Tennessee Belle. The last time she renewed her pilot's license was in 1935. Leathers died in New Orleans on January 26, 1940 of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 79. A children's book, Steamboat! The Story of Captain Blanche Leathers was published in 1999 by Judith Heide Gilliland and illustrated by Holly Meade. In 2009, Leathers was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame.

Biography Van Dieren was the last of five children of a Rotterdam wine merchant, Bernard Joseph van Dieren, and his second wife, Julie Fran√ßoise Adelle Labb√©. Details of his education are unknown but it seems that his early training was as a scientist, as a research assistant in a laboratory. Gifted in science, extremely intelligent and with a phenomenal memory, he was also well-versed in literature as well as an able violinist and amateur artist. His career as composer began when he was twenty when some of his early works were published in the Netherlands. In 1909 he relocated to London with his wife-to-be, Frida Kindler (1879‚Äì1964), a very gifted concert pianist whom he married on 1 January 1910. By this time he had decided to study music seriously. A son, Hans Jean Jules Maximilian Navarre Benvenuto Bernard van Dieren (1910‚Äì74), was born the same year.Smith, B. (2004). Dieren, Bernard H√©l√®ne Joseph van (1887‚Äì1936), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was largely self-taught, though he spent 1912 in Europe where he met the composers Busoni and Schoenberg.Adrian Corleonis, AllMusic His early contact with the music world was as a musical correspondent for several European newspapers and periodicals. During the First World War he was for a short time involved in secret service in the Netherlands, as a cypher expert in the Intelligence Department. He suffered most of his life from ill health and had numerous operations for kidney-related complaints. To relieve the recurring pain, morphine was prescribed, and it is thought that in later life he became addicted to the drug. Because of these recurring bouts of illness, his wife, a former pupil of Busoni, supported the family by teaching the piano and by giving recitals. They also relied on financial support from a group of admirers and friends, which included notable personalities such as Jacob Epstein, Osbert and Sacheverell Sitwell, Augustus John, Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, Philip Heseltine (the composer Peter Warlock) and Cecil Gray.Bernard van Dieren, Philip Heseltine and Cecil Gray: A Significant Affiliation. Hywel Davies Music & Letters Vol. 69, No. 1 (Jan., 1988), pp. 30‚Äì48 The latter two were especially drawn by his charismatic and powerful personality and gave untiring support for his cause by prompting performances and publication of his works. However, this sometimes over enthusiastic support generated a backlash from non-believers. Eric Coates, who played viola in the under- rehearsed premiere of Diaphony (1916), witnessed the contempt of Parry, Stanford and others towards van Dieren.Eric Coates (1953). Suite in Four Movements Heseltine made van Dieren his heir in his will, inspiring claims by Heseltine's son Nigel that van Dieren had murdered Heseltine.Heseltine, Nigel (1992), Capriol for Mother: a Memoir of Philip Heseltine (Peter Warlock), Thames Publishing In 1925 van Dieren worked for the Philips electrical company but recurring illness forced him to resign the following year. Some of his works were published in 1927 and in the same year his Fourth String Quartet was performed at the Frankfurt Festival. In 1930 he completed his comic opera 'The Tailor'Gazzoni, Giovanni and John Goss (1930). \\"Bernard van Dieren's 'The Tailor',\\" The Musical Times, Vol. 71, No. 1053, pp. 999‚Äì1000.

London: Oxford University Press. Eventually two of his more important works were broadcast by the BBC: Diaphony in 1934 and the Chinese Symphony in 1935. He died on 24 April 1936 in London, and is buried on the edge of the graveyard of St Laurence's Church, West Wycombe. Constant Lambert, who conducted the first public performance of the Chinese Symphony from BBC Broadcasting House on 15 March 1935,BBC Radio Times listing, 15 March 1935 claimed that the theme for the opening movement, \\"Palindromic Prelude\\", from his 1938 ballet Horoscope, was dictated from beyond the grave by van Dieren.Adrian Corleonis, AllMusic Musical Style The music of Bernard van Dieren is harmonically chromatic, rhythmically fluid and freely polyphonic, tonally anarchic rather than atonal Stephen Banfield (1985).

According to Stephen Banfield,Stephen Banfield (1985). Sensibility and English Song van Dieren, ‚Äúif he belongs anywhere‚Äù, is best positioned as part of the inter-war lyrical tradition. In his chamber music the influence of Schoenberg can be detected, along with ‚Äúa textual complexity (comparable with Busoni) which engages the imagination‚Äù.Emile Wennekes, notes to CD \\"String Quartets from the Twenties\\" The six quartets gained immediate attention from leading performers of the day: for instance the Second String Quartet was premiered by the Amar Quartet, with Paul Hindemith on viola, at the Donaueschingen Festival in 1922.Emile Wennekes, notes to CD \\"String Quartets from the Twenties\\" The Fourth Quartet is written for the unorthodox combination of two violins, viola and double bass.Bacharach, A.L.

The text uses German translations by Hans Bethge of Chinese poetry, also used by Mahler in Das Lied von der Erde a few years earlier.

In present medical consensus, a focal infection is a localized infection, often asymptomatic, that causes disease elsewhere in the host, but focal infections are fairly infrequent and limited to fairly uncommon diseases.See, for example, David Schlossberg, ed, Clinical Infectious Disease, 2nd edn (Cambridge University Press, 2015), and Yomamoto T, \\"Triggering role of focal infection...\\", in Harabuchi Y et al, eds, Recent Advances in Tonsils and Mucosal Barriers of the Upper Airways (Karger, 2011). (Distant injury is focal infection's key principle, whereas in ordinary infectious disease, the infection itself is systemic, as in measles, or the initially infected site is readily identifiable and invasion progresses contiguously, as in gangrene.)J Craig Baumgartner, Jos√© F Siqueira Jr, Christine M Sedgley & Anil Kishen, ch 7 \\"Microbiology of endodontic disease\\", in John I Ingle, Leif K Bakland & J Craig Baumgartner, eds, Ingle's Endodontics, 6th edn (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2008), p 221‚Äì24. Focal infection theory, rather, so explained virtually all diseases, including arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and mental illnesses.Paul R Stillman & John O McCall, A Textbook of Clinical Periodontia, (New York: Macmillan Co, 1922), \\"ch 18 Focal infection\\".Nils Skaug & Vidar Bakken, ch 8 \\"4Systemic complications of endodontic infections\\", subch \\"Chronic periapical infections as the origin of metastatic infections\\", in Gunnar Bergenholtz, Preben H√∏rsted-Bindslev & Claes Reit, eds, Textbook of Endodontology, 2nd ed. (West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp 135‚Äì37. An ancient concept that took modern form around 1900, focal infection theory was widely accepted in medicine by the 1920s. In the theory, the focus of infection might lead to secondary infections at sites particularly susceptible to such microbial species or toxin. Commonly alleged foci were diverse‚Äîappendix, urinary bladder, gall bladder, kidney, liver, prostate, and nasal sinuses‚Äîbut most commonly were oral. Besides dental decay and infected tonsils, both dental restorations and especially endodontically treated teeth were blamed as foci. The putative oral sepsis was countered by tonsillectomies and tooth extractions, including of endodontically treated teeth and even of apparently healthy teeth, newly popular approaches‚Äîsometimes leaving individuals toothless‚Äîto treat or prevent diverse diseases. Drawing severe criticism in the 1930s, focal infection theory‚Äîwhose popularity zealously exceeded consensus evidence‚Äîwas discredited in the 1940s by research attacks that drew overwhelming consensus of this sweeping theory's falsity. Thereupon, dental restorations and endodontic therapy became again favored. Untreated endodontic disease retained mainstream recognition as fostering systemic disease.James M Dunning, Principles of Dental Public Health, 4th edn (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1986), ch 13 \\"Dental needs and resources\\", ¬ß \\"Systemic infection of dental origin\\", p 272‚Äì73.Gavett G, \\"Tragic results when dental care is out of reach\\"4, PBS Frontline website, 26 Jun 2012 But only alternative medicine and later biological dentistry continued highlighting sites of dental treatment‚Äîstill endodontic therapy, but, more recently, also dental implant, and even tooth extraction, too‚Äîas foci of infection causing chronic and systemic diseases.Hal A Huggins & Thomas E Levy, Uninformed Consent: The Hidden Dangers in Dental Care (Charlottesvi4lle VA: Hampton Roads Publishing, 1999), ch 12 \\"The cavitation\\" & ch 13 \\"Focal infection\\". In mainstream dentistry and medicine, the primary recognition of focal infection is endocarditis, if oral bacteria enter blood and infect the heart, perhaps its valves. Entering the 21st century, scientific evidence supporting general relevance of focal infections remained slim, yet evolved understandings of disease mechanisms had established a third possible mechanism‚Äîaltogether, metastasis of infection, metastatic toxic injury, and, as recently revealed, metastatic immunologic injury‚Äîthat might occur simultaneously and even interact.Jed J Jacobson & Sol Silverman Jr, ch 17 \\"Bacterial infections\\", in Sol Silverman, Lewis R Eversole & Edmond L Truelove, eds, Essentials of Oral Medicine (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2002), pp 159‚Äì62. Meanwhile, focal infection theory has gained renewed attention, as dental infections apparently are widespread and significant contributors to systemic diseases, although mainstream attention is on ordinary periodontal disease, not on hypotheses of stealth infections via dental treatment.Shantipriya Reddy, Essentials of Clinical Periodontology and Periodontics, 2nd edn (New Delhi: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, 2008), ch 13 \\"Periodontal medicine\\", esp pp 115‚Äì16. Despite some doubts renewed in the 1990s by conventional dentistry's critics, dentistry scholars maintain that endodontic therapy can be performed without creating focal infections. Rise and popularity (1890s‚Äì1930s) =Roots and dawn= In ancient Greece, Hippocrates reported cure of an arthritis case by tooth extraction. Yet modern focal infection theory awaited Robert Koch's establishment of medical bacteriology in the late 1870s to early 1880s. In 1890, Willoughby D Miller attributed a set of oral diseases to infections, and a set of general diseases‚Äîas of lung, stomach, brain abscesses, and other conditions‚Äîto those infectious oral diseases.Willoughby D Miller, The Micro-Organisms of the Human Mouth: The Local and General Diseases Which Are Caused by Them (Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Thieme, 1892). In 1894, Miller became the first to reveal existence of bacteria in samples of dental pulp.Shanon Patel & Justin J Barnes, \\"Introduction: How has endodontics developed?\\", in Shanon Patel & Justin J Barnes, eds, The Principles of Endodontics, 2nd edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp 4‚Äì5. Miller advised root canal therapy. Yet focal infection theory met a cultural climate where ancient and folk ideas, long entrenched via Galenic humoral medicine, found new outlets through bacteriology‚Äîa pillar of the new \\"scientific medicine\\". Emigrating from Russia in 1886, international scientific celebrity Elie Metchnikoff‚Äîdiscoverer of phagocytes, mediating innate immunity‚Äîwas embraced in Paris by Louis Pasteur, who granted him an entire floor for research once the Pasteur Institute, the globe's first biomedical institute, opened in 1888.Alfred I Tauber & Leon Chernyak, Metchnikoff and the Origins of Immunology: From Metaphor to Theory (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), pp viii, 11. Later the Institute's director and 1908 Nobelist, Metchnikoff believed, as did his rival Paul Ehrlich‚Äîtheorist on antibody, mediating acquired immunity‚Äîand as did Pasteur, that nutrition influenced immunity.As later elucidated, antibody molecules, which are secreted by activated B cells, mediate but one arm of acquired immunity, whose other arm is mediated by killer T cells. As acquired immunity's two principal mediators, B cells and T cells are subsets of lymphocytes‚Äîthemselves a subset of white blood cells, aka leukocytes‚Äîas their base of residence is peripheral lymphoid tissues. On the other hand, innate immunity is mediated not only by phagocytes but also by a third subset of lymphocytes: natural killer cells. Further, innate immunity also includes soluble components‚Äîcomplement proteins and, more recently identified, innate antibody secreted by B cells‚Äîwhile still other lymphocytes, specifically helper T cells, bridge innate immunity to adaptive immunity, and vice versa. Thus, the seeming division between innate immunity and acquired immunity is more practical than natural. Immunology's early feuds over whether immunity is innate or is acquired reflected limited perspectives. Sharing Pasteur's view of science as a means to suppress the problems plaguing humankind, Metchnikoff brought into France its first cultures of yogurt for probiotic microorganisms to foster health and longevity by suppressing the colon's putrefactive microorganisms alleged to foster the colon's toxic seepage, autointoxication. As the 20th century opened, British surgeons were still knife-happy, and called for \\"surgical bacteriology\\".Andrew Scull, Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), pp 33‚Äì37. Surgical pioneer Sir Arbuthnot Lane, famed for an emergency appendectomy performed on England's royalty, drew from Metchnikoff and clinical observation to issue dire warnings about \\"chronic intestinal stasis\\"‚Äîthat is, constipation‚Äîits \\"flooding of the circulation with filthy material\\" and causing autointoxication, which Lane then treated with colon bypass and colectomy. In America, alleged bowel sepsis wreaking degeneration and disease had been targeted since 1875 by John Harvey Kellogg in Michigan at his huge Battle Creek Sanitarium‚Äîhe coined the term sanitarium‚Äîyearly receiving several thousand patients, including US Presidents and celebrities, and advertising itself as the \\"University of Health\\". When embracing focal infection theory, however, American medical doctors sided against alleged \\"health faddists\\" like Kellogg as well as Sylvester Graham, and endorsed the academic tradition of German \\"scientific medicine\\". =Medical popularity= In 1900, British surgeon William Hunter blamed many disease cases on oral sepsis.William Hunter, Oral Sepsis as a Cause of Septic Gastritis, Toxic Neuritis, and Other Septic Conditions (London: Cassell & Co, 1901). In 1910, lecturing in Montreal at McGill University, he claimed, \\"The worst cases of anemia, gastritis, colitis, obscure fevers, nervous disturbances of all kinds from mental depression to actual lesions of the cord, chronic rheumatic infections, kidney diseases are those which owe their origin to or are gravely complicated by the oral sepsis produced by these gold traps of sepsis.\\" He apparently indicted dental restorations. Incriminating their execution, rather, his American critics lobbied for stricter dental licensing requirements. Still, Hunter's lecture‚Äîas later recalled‚Äî\\"ignited the fires of focal infection\\".John I Ingle, PDQ Endodontics, 2nd edn (Shelton CT: People's Medical Publishing House, 2009), p xiv. Ten years later, he proudly accepted that credit. And yet, read carefully, his lecture asserts a sole cause of the sepsis: dentists who instruct patients to never remove partial dentures. Focal infection theory's modern era really began with physician Frank Billings, based in Chicago, and his case reports of tonsillectomies and tooth extractions claimed to have cured infections of distant organs. Replacing Hunter's term oral sepsis with focal infection, Billings in November 1911 lectured at the Chicago Medical Society, and published it in 1912 as an article for the American medical community. In 1916, Billings lectured in California at Stanford University Medical School, this time printed in book format.Frank Billings, Focal Infection: The Lane Lectures (New York & London: D Appleton & Co, 1918). Billings thus popularized intervention by tonsillectomy and tooth extraction. A pupil of Billings, Edward Rosenow held that extraction alone was often insufficient, and urged teamwork by dentistry and medicine. Rosenow developed the principle elective localization, whereby microorganisms have affinities for particular organs, and also espoused extreme pleomorphism.Edward C Rosenow, ch 43 \\"Elective localization of bacteria in the animal body\\", in Edwin O Jordan & I S Falk, eds The Newer Knowledge of Bacteriology and Immunology (Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, 1928), pp 576‚Äì89. Since 1889, in American state Minnesota, brothers William Mayo and Charles Mayo had built an international reputation for surgical skill at their Mayo Clinic, by 1906 performing some 5,000 surgeries a year, over 50% intra-abdominal, a tremendous number at the time, with unusually low mortality and morbidity.\\"Mayo Clinic history\\", Mayo Clinic, Website access: 21 Sep 2013. Though originally distancing themselves from routine medicine and skeptical of laboratory data, they later recruited Rosenow from Chicago to help improve Mayo Clinic's diagnosis and care and to enter basic research via experimental bacteriology. Rosenow influenced Charles Mayo, who by 1914 published to support focal infection theory alongside Billings and Rosenow. At Johns Hopkins University's medical school, launched in 1894 as America's first to teach \\"scientific medicine\\", the eminent Sir William Osler was succeeded as professor of medicine by Llewellys Barker,\\"The Lewellys Franklin Barker Collection\\", Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Website access: 23 Sep 2013. who became a prominent proponent of focal infection theory. Although many of Hopkins' medical faculty remained skeptics, Barker's colleague William Thayer\\"The William S Thayer Collection \\", Repository Guide to the Personal Papers Collections of Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Website access: 21 Sep 2013. cast support. As Hopkins' chief physician, Barker was a pivotal convert propelling the theory to the center of American routine medical practice. Russell Cecil, famed author of Cecil's Essentials of Medicine, too, lent support. In 1921, British surgeon Hunter announced that oral sepsis was \\"coming of age\\". Although physicians had already interpreted pus within a bodily compartment as a systemic threat, pus from infected tooth roots often drained into the mouth and thereby was viewed as systemically inconsequential. Amid focal infection theory, it was concluded that that was often the case‚Äîwhile immune response prevented dissemination from the focus‚Äîbut that immunity could fail to contain the infection, that dissemination from the focus could ensue, and that systemic disease, often neurological, could result. By 1930, excision of focal infections was considered a \\"rational form of therapy\\" undoubtedly resolving many cases of chronic diseases. Its inconsistent effectiveness was attributed to unrecognized foci‚Äîperhaps inside internal organs‚Äîthat the clinicians had missed. =Reception by dentistry= In 1923, upon some 25 years of researches, dentist Weston Andrew Price of Cleveland, Ohio, published a landmark book,Weston A Price, Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic, Vol 1 & Vol 2 (Cleveland: Penton Publishing, 1923). then a related article in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1925. Price concluded that after root canal therapy, teeth routinely host bacteria producing potent toxins. Transplanting the teeth into healthy rabbits, Price and his researchers duplicated heart and arthritic diseases. Although Price noted often seeing patients \\"suffering more from the inconvenience and difficulties of mastication and nourishment than they did from the lesions from which their physician or dentist had sought to give them relief\\",Weston A Price, Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic, Vol 1 (Cleveland: Penton Publishing, 1923), p 488. his 1925 debate with John P Buckley was decided in favor of Price's position: \\"practically all infected pulpless teeth should be extracted\\".Baumgartner et al, Ingle's Endodontics, 6th edn (Hamilton: BC Decker, 2006), p 286, not giving that precise summary, cite Buckley‚ÄìPrice debate on the subject: As chairman of the American Dental Association's research section, Price was the individual who, perhaps beyond any other, shaped the dentistry profession's opinion.British Journal of Dental Science, 1928;72:101. Textbook authors relied on Price's 1923 treatise into the late 1930s.Examples: William H O McGehee, A Text-book of Operative Dentistry, 2nd edn (Philadelphia: Blackiston's Son & Co, 1936), pp 39 & 110; Louis V Hayes, Clinical Diagnosis of Diseases of the Mouth: A Guide for Students and Practitioners of Dentistry and Medicine (Brooklyn NY: Dental Items of Interest Publishing, 1935), p 389. Unsuspected periapical disease was first revealed by dental X-ray in 1911, the year that Frank Billings lectured on focal infection to the Chicago Medical Society. Introduced by C Edmund Kells, the technology became used to feed the \\"mania of extracting devitalized teeth\\". Even Price was cited as an authoritative source espousing conservative intervention at focal infections.Journal of the Canadian Dental Association, 1935;1:451. Kells, too, advocated conservative dentistry. Many dentists were \\"100 percenters\\", extracting every tooth exhibiting either necrotic pulp or endodontic treatment, and extracted apparently healthy teeth, too, as suspected foci, leaving many persons toothless. A 1926 report published by several authors in Dental Cosmos‚Äîa dentistry journal where Willoughby Miller had published in the 1890s‚Äîadvocated extraction of known healthy teeth to prevent focal infection. Endodontics nearly vanished from American dental education. Some dentists held that root canal therapy should be criminalized and penalized with six months of hard labor. =Psychiatric promulgation= Besides heredity, focal infection and autointoxication was psychiatry's predominant explanation of schizophrenia near the turn of the 20th century. In American state New Jersey, the director of the psychiatric asylum at Trenton State Hospital since 1907 was Henry Cotton. Drawing influence from the medical popularity of focal infection theory, Cotton identified focal infections as the main causes of dementia praecox (now schizophrenia) and manic depression (now bipolar disorder). Cotton routinely prescribed surgery to clean the nasal sinuses and to extract the tonsils and dentition. Yet, seeking to clean the entire body of focal infections, Cotton frequently prescribed surgical removal of the appendix, gall bladder, spleen, stomach, colon, cervix, ovaries, testicles, and thereby claimed up to 85% cure rate. Despite the death rate of some 30%, Cotton's fame rapidly spread through America and Europe, and the asylum drew influx of paying patients. The New York Times praised his accomplishments and heralded \\"high hope\\". Cotton made a European lecture tour, and Princeton University Press and Oxford University Press simultaneously published his book in 1922.Henry A Cotton, The Defective, Delinquent, and Insane: The Relation of Focal Infections to their Causation, Treatment and Prevention (Princeton/London: Princeton University Press/Oxford University Press, 1922). Despite scepticism within his profession, psychiatrists were under pressure to match Cotton's treatments, as patients would ask why they were being denied successful intervention. Other patients, ostensibly for their own good, were pressured or compelled into treatment without their own consent.Phil Fennell, Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People since 1845 (London & New York: Routledge, 1996), p. 120. Cotton had his two sons' teeth extracted as preventive healthcare‚Äîalthough each later committed suicide. By the 1930s, however, focal infection fell from psychiatry as an explanation. Criticism and decline (1930s‚Äì1950s) =Early skepticism= Addressing the Eastern Medical Society in December 1918, New York City physician Robert Morris had explained that focal infection theory had drawn much interest but that understanding was incomplete, while the theory was earning disrepute through overzealousness of some advocates.Robert T Morris: \\"The matter of focal infections is one of the very new subjects of the day which men are taking up with a great deal of interest but are going ahead perhaps with incomplete knowledge and not comprehending the range and scope of the entire subject; consequently this subject is falling into disrepute in certain fields because of the over-enthusiasm of some of the advocates of focal infection theory in relation to distant demonstration‚Äîendocarditis, rheumatism, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, various forms of neuritis, etc. The philosopher, taking all evidence judicially, will eventually give the medical profession the basic facts and what is valuable in the subject. Right now one might utter a warning to the general medical profession against taking too active an interest in the subject.\\" [\\"Address on medicine and surgery\\", American Medicine, 1919 Jan;25(1):17‚Äì23, pp 18‚Äì19]. Morris called for facts and explanation from scientists before physicians continued investing so steeply in it, already triggering vigorous disputes and embittering division among clinicians as well as uncertainty among patients. In 1919, in New Orleans, at the annual meeting of the National Dental Association (forerunner of the American Dental Association), dental X-ray originator and pioneer C Edmund Kells delivered a lecture, published in 1920 in the Association's journal,C Edmund Kells, \\"X-ray in dental practice\\", Journal of the National Dental Association, 1920 Mar;7(3):241‚Äì72 [JADA provides the article free in two parts (1 & 2 )]. largely discussing focal infection theory, which Kells condemned as a \\"crime\\". Kells stressed that X-ray technology is to improve dentistry, not to enhance the \\"mania of extracting devitalized teeth\\".ADA: \\"C Edmund Kells was a dental pioneer who championed the use of X-rays in dentistry during the late 19th century and early 20th century. 'The X-ray in dental practice' is a paper read by Dr Kells at a 1919 Association meeting in New Orleans. Much of the paper discusses focal infection theory, which Dr Kells argued was leading to the unnecessary extraction of teeth. He also made it clear that dental X-rays should be used to enhance dentistry, and not to encourage the 'mania for extracting devitalized teeth' \\" [\\"JADA Centennial: From the February 2013 issue of JADA\\", American Dental Association, Website access: 21 Sep 2013]. Kells urged dentists to reject physicians' prescriptions of tooth extractions. Focal infection theory's elegance suggested simple application, but the applications brought meager \\"cure\\" rate, occasional disease worsening, and inconsistent experimental results, although the lack of controlled clinical trials, among present criticism, was standard at the time‚Äîexcept in New York City. Around 1920, at Henry Cotton's claims of up to 85% success treating schizophrenia and manic depression, Cotton's major critic was George Kirby, director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute on Ward's Island.Richard Noll, The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders (New York: Facts on File, 2007), pp 170‚Äì170. Two researchers, bacteriologist Nicolas Kopeloff and psychiatrist Clarence Cheney, ventured from the New York State Psychiatric Institute to Trenton, New Jersey, to investigate Cotton's practice. =Research attacks= In two controlled clinical trials with alternate allocation of patients, Kopeloff, Cheney, and Kirby found no effectiveness of Cotton's psychiatric surgeries, as patients who improved already had that prognosis and others did so without surgeries. They presented their findings at the American Psychiatric Association's 1922 and 1923 annual meetings, and published two papers. Most of Cotton's data were questioned at Johns Hopkins University by Phyllis Greenacre, who later helped steer American psychiatry into psychoanalysis. Colectomy for psychosis vanished except in Trenton until Cotton‚Äîwho used publicity and word of mouth, kept the 30% death rate unpublicized, and passed a 1925 investigation by New Jersey Senate‚Äîdied by heart attack in 1933. As early as 1927, Weston Price's researches were criticized for \\"faulty bacterial technique\\".Henry W Crowe & Herbert G Franking, \\"Aetiology continued: Dental infections and degenerative diseases‚Äîa review and commentary\\", pp 23‚Äì32, Bacteriology and Surgery of Chronic Arthritis and Rheumatism with End-Results of Treatment (New York/London: Humphrey Milford/Oxford University Press, 1927), p 32. In the 1930s and 1940s, researchers and editors dismissed the studies of Edward Rosenow and of Price as flawed by insufficient controls, massive doses of bacteria, and contamination of endontically treated teeth during extraction. In 1938, Cecil and Angevine reported 200 cases of rheumatoid arthritis, but no consistent cures by tonsillectomies or tooth extractions. They noted that, \\"Focal infection is a splendid example of a plausible medical theory which is in danger of being converted by its enthusiastic supporters into the status of an accepted fact.\\" Newly a critic, Cecil alleged that foci were \\"anything readily accessible to surgery\\". In 1939, E W Fish implanted bacteria into guinea pigs' jaws and reported that four zones develop. The first zone was the zone of infection, whereas the other three zones‚Äîsurrounding the zone of infection‚Äîrevealed immune cells or other host cells but no bacteria. Fish theorized that by removing the infectious nidus, dentists would permit recovery from the infection, and Fish's reasoning and conclusion became the basis for successful root canal treatment. Still, endodontic therapy of the era indeed posed substantial risk of failure, and fear of focal infection crucially motivated endontologists to develop new and improved technology and techniques. =End of the focal era= The review and \\"critical appraisal\\" by Hobart A Reimann and W Paul Havens, published in January 1940, was perhaps the most influential criticism of focal infection theory. Recasting Hunter's views of 30 years earlier as widely misinterpreted, they summarized that \\"the removal of infectious dental focal infections in the hope of influencing remote or general symptoms of disease must still be regarded as an experimental procedure not devoid of hazard\\". By 1940, Louis I Grossman's textbook Root Canal Therapy flatly rejected the methods and conclusions made earlier by Price and especially by Rosenow.Louis I Grossman, Root Canal Therapy (Philadelphia: Lea & Febiger, 1940), ch 2, reprinted in Journal of Endodontics, 1982 Jan;8(Suppl):S18-S24, available at Robert Kaufmann's EndoExperience.com under \\"The endo file cabinet: Textbook excerpts: Grossman's Endodontics: Chapter on focal infection\\", Accessed online 17 Feb 2014. Amid improvements in endodontics and medicine, including release of sulfa drugs and antibiotics, a backlash to the \\"orgy\\" of tooth extractions and tonsillectomies ensued. Easlick's 1951 review in the Journal of the American Dental Association notes, \\"Many authorities who formerly felt that focal infection was an important etiologic factor in systemic disease have become skeptical and now recommend less radical procedures in the treatment of such disorders\\". A 1952 editorial in Journal of the American Medical Association tolled the era's end by stating that \\"many patients with diseases presumably caused by foci of infection have not been relieved of their symptoms by removal of the foci, many patients with these same systemic diseases have no evidence focus of infection, foci of infection are as common in apparently healthy persons as in those with disease\\".Philip M Preshaw & John J Taylor, ch 21 \\"Periodontal pathogenesis\\", in Michael G Newman, Henry Takei, Perry R Klokkevold & Fermin A Carranza, Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, 11th edn (St Louis: Saunders/Elsevier, 2012). Some support extended into the late 1950s,Joseph M Dougherty & Anthony J Lamberti, Textbook of Bacteriology, 3rd edn (St Louis: Mosby, 1954), p 231 yet focal infection vanished as the primary explanation of chronic, systemic diseases, and was generally abandoned in the 1950s. Revival and evolution (1990s‚Äì2010s) Despite the general theory's demise, focal infection remained a formal, if rare, diagnosis, as in idiopathic scrotal gangreneRonald T Lewis, ch 25 \\"Soft tissue infection and loss of abdominal wall substance\\", in Robert Bendavid, ed, Abdominal Wall Hernias: Principles and Management (New York, Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer, 2001), p 192. and angioneurotic edema.Technical Manual #8-225: Dental Specialist (Washington DC: Department of the Army Headquarters, 20 Sep 1971), pp Glossary-7 & 5-14. Meanwhile, by way of continuing case reports claiming cures of chronic diseases like arthritis after extraction of infected or root-filled teeth, and despite lack of scientific evidence, \\"dental focal infection theory never died\\". In fact, severe endodontic disease resembles classic focal infection theory. In 1986, it was noted that, \\"in spite of a decline in recognition of the focal-infection theory, the association of decayed teeth with systemic disease is taken very seriously\\". Eventually, the theory of focal infection drew reconsideration.Nikos Donos & Francesco D'Aiuto, ch 3 \\"Periodontitis: A modern clinical perspective\\", in Brian Henderson, Michael Curtis, Robert Seymour & Nikolaos Donos, eds, Periodontal Medicine and Systems Biology (West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), pp 33‚Äì34. Conversely, attribution of endocarditis to dentistry has entered doubt via case-control study, as the species usually involved is present throughout the human body.John I Ingle, PDQ Endodontics, 2nd edn (Shelton CT: People's Medical Publishing House, 2009), p xv. =Stealth pathogens= With the 1950s introduction of antibiotics, attempts to explain unexplained diseases via bacterial etiology seemed all the more unlikely.Michael Wilson, Rod McNab & Brian Henderson, Bacterial Disease Mechanisms: An Introduction to Cellular Microbiology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p 597. By the 1970s, however, it was established that antibiotics could trigger bacteria's switch to their L phase. Eluding detection by traditional methods of medical microbiology, bacterial L forms and the similar mycoplasma‚Äîand, later, viruses‚Äîbecame the entities expected in the theory of focal infection. Yet until the 1980s, such researchers were scarce, largely via scarce funding for such investigations. Despite the limited funding, research established that L forms can adhere to red blood cells and thereby disseminate from foci within internal organs such as the spleen,Gerald J Domingue, Cell Wall- Deficient Bacteria: Basic Principles and Clinical Significance (Reading MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1982), p 455. or from oral tissues and the intestines, especially during dysbiosis. Perhaps some of Weston Price's identified \\"toxins\\" in endodontically treated teeth were L forms, thought nonexistent by bacteriologists of his time and widely overlooked into the 21st century.L H Mattman, Stealth Pathogens, 3rd edn (CRC Press, 2000), ch 1 \\"History\\". Apparently, dental infections, including by uncultured or cryptic microorganisms, contribute to systemic diseases.Peter Mullany, Philip Warburton & Elaine Allan, ch 9 \\"The human oral metagenome\\", Karen E Nelson, ed, Metagenomics of the Human Body (New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg, London: Springer, 2011), p 166.Lida H Mattman, Cell Wall Deficient Forms: Stealth Pathogens, 3rd edn (Boca Raton FL: CRC Press, 2000), pp 286 & 289, while p 291 lists for p 289 a citation of =Periodontal medicine= At the 1990s' emergence of epidemiological associations between dental infections and systemic diseases, American dentistry scholars have been cautious, some seeking successful intervention to confirm causality. Some American sources emphasized epidemiology's inability to determine causality, categorized the phenomena as progressive invasion of local tissues, and distinguished that from focal infection theory‚Äîwhich they assert was evaluated and disproved by the 1940s. Others have found focal infection theory's scientific evidence still slim, but have conceded that evolving science might establish it. Yet select American authors affirm the return of a modest theory of focal infection. European sources find it more certain that dental infections drive systemic diseases, at least by driving systemic inflammation, and probably, among other immunologic mechanisms, by molecular mimicry resulting in antigenic crossreaction with host biomolecules, while some seemingly find progressive invasion of local tissues compatible with focal infection theory. Acknowledging that beyond epidemiological associations, successful intervention is needed to establish causality, they emphasize that biological explanation is needed atop both, and the biological aspect is thoroughly established already, such that general healthcare, as for cardiovascular disease, must address prevalent periodontal disease, a stance matched in Indian literature. Thus, there has emerged the concept periodontal medicine. Amid continuing research interest, Indian textbooks find focal infection theory established, if in more modest form than originally.Sanjay Saraf, Textbook of Oral Pathology (New Delhi: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, 2006), ch 9 \\"Spread of oral infections\\". Akshata et al have attacked the stigma and posed focal infection theory as a correct theory earlier misapplied and thereby discredited yet later refined as knowledge grew over time. In a paper winning an Indian prize, they clarify \\"that the oral cavity can act as the site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, especially in immunocompromised hosts\\", especially those \\"suffering from malignancies, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis\\", or \\"undergoing other immunosuppressive treatment\\", and that \\"uncontrolled advanced periodontitis\\" \\"presents a substantial infectious burden for the entire body by releasing bacteria, bacterial toxins, and other inflammatory mediators into the bloodstream that then affect the other parts of the body\\", this altogether \\"a paradigm shift in thinking about the directionality of oral and systemic associations\\". =Dental controversies= During the 1980s, dentist Hal Huggins, sparking severe controversy, spawned biological dentistry, which claims that conventional tooth extraction routinely leaves within the tooth socket the periodontal ligament that often becomes gangrenous, then, forming a jawbone cavitation seeping infectious and toxic material. Sometimes forming elsewhere in bones after injury or ischemia,Leon Chaitow, Cranial Manipulation: Theory and Practice, 2nd edn (Edinburgh, London, New York, elsewhere: Elsevier, 2005), pp 348‚Äì49. jawbone cavitations are recognized as foci also in osteopathy and in alternative medicine,Examples: Ellen Hodgson Brown, Healing Joint Pain Naturally: Safe and Effective Ways to Treat Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and Other Joint Diseases (New York: Broadway Books, 2001); Shirley MacLaine, Sage-ing While Age-ing (New York: Atria Books, 2007). but conventional dentists generally conclude them to be nonexistent. Although the International Academy of Oral Medicine & Toxicology claims that the scientific evidence establishing the existence of jawbone cavitations is overwhelming, and even published in textbooks, the diagnosis and related treatment remain controversial,IAOMT, \\"IAOMT position paper on jawbone osteonecrosis\\", International Academy of Oral Medicine & Toxicology, 27 Jul 2014. and allegations of quackery persist.Stephen Barrett, \\"A critical look at cavitational osteopathosis, NICO, and 'biological dentistry'\\", Quackwatch, 4 Apr 2010. Huggins and many biological dentists also espouse Weston Price's findings on endodontically treated teeth routinely being foci of infection, although these dentists have been accused of quackery.Stephen Barrett, \\"Stay away from 'holistic' and 'biological' dentists\\", Quackwatch, accessed online: 17 Sep 2013. Conventional belief is that microorganisms within inaccessible regions of a tooth's roots are rendered harmless once entrapped by the filling material, although little evidence supports this. A H Rogers in 1976 and E H Ehrmann in 1977 had dismissed any relation between endodontics and focal infection. At dentist George Meinig's 1994 book, Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed, discussing researches of Rosenow and of Price, some dentistry scholars reasserted that the claims were evaluated and disproved by the 1940s.J Craig Baumgartner, Leif K Bakland & Eugene I Sugita, ch 3 \\"Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice\\" , in John Ide Ingle & Leif K Bakland, eds, Endodontics, 5th edn (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2002), p 64. Yet Meinig was but one of at least three authors who in the early 1990s independently renewed the concern. Boyd Haley and Curt Pendergrass found especially high levels of bacterial toxins in root-filled teeth.Mark A Breiner, Whole-Body Dentistry: A Complete Guide to Understanding the Impact of Dentistry on Total Health (Fairfield CT: Quantum Health Press, 2011), pp 171‚Äì174. Although such possibility appears especially likely amid compromised immunity‚Äîas in individuals cirrhotic, asplenic, elderly, rheumatoid arthritic, or using steroid drugs‚Äîthere remained a lack of carefully controlled studies definitely establishing adverse systemic effects. Conversely, some if few studies have investigated effects of systemic disease on root-canal therapy's outcomes, which tend to worsen with poor glycemic control, perhaps via impaired immune response, a factor largely ignored until recently, but now recognized as important. Still, even by 2010, \\"the potential association between systemic health and root canal therapy has been strongly disputed by dental governing bodies and there remains little evidence to substantiate the claims\\".C Murray, ch 48 \\"Endontology and general systemic health\\", ¬ß¬ß \\"The 'focal infection' era\\" & \\"Effects of general systemic health on endodontics\\", in Michael Baumann & Rudolf Beer, eds, Endodontology, 2nd edn (New York: Thieme, 2010). The traditional root-filling material is gutta-percha, whereas a new material, Biocalex, drew initial optimism even in alternative dentistry, but Biocalex-filled teeth were later reported by Boyd Haley to likewise seep toxic byproducts of anaerobic bacterial metabolism.Mark A Breiner, Whole-Body Dentistry: A Complete Guide to Understanding the Impact of Dentistry on Total Health (Fairfield CT: Quantum Health Press, 2011), pp 168‚Äì69, 174‚Äì175.Breiner, Whole-Body Dentistry (Quantum Health, 2011), pp Seeking to sterilize the tooth interior, some dentists, both alternative and conventional, have applied laser technology. Although endodontic therapy can fail and eventually often does,J Craig Baumgartner, Jos√© F Siqueira Jr, Christine M Sedgley & Anil Kishen, ch 7 \\"Microbiology of endodontic disease\\", in John I Ingle, Leif K Bakland & J Craig Baumgartner, eds, Ingle's Endodontics, 6th edn (Hamilton Ontario: BC Decker, 2008), p 257: \\"Microorganisms found in failed endodontically treated teeth have either remained in the root canal from previous treatment or have entered since treatment via leakage. ... Those remaining from the original microbiota would need to have maintained viability throughout treatment procedures, including exposure to disinfectants, and thereafter adapted to a root canal environment in which the availability of a variety of nutrients is more limited because of lack of pulp tissue. This might occur as a result of an inability of chemomechanical instrumentation procedures to completely debride the root canal system in a single visit and because of the inaccessible locations of bacteria in isthmuses, accessory canals, and apical regions of canals. While it is considered that many such remaining bacteria will be unable to cause harm once entombed by the obturation material, there is little evidence for this\\". dentistry scholars maintain that it can be performed without creating focal infections. And even by 2010, molecular methods had rendered no consensus reports of bacteremia traced to asymptomatic endodontic infection. In any event, the predominant view is that shunning endodonthic therapy or routinely extracting endodontically treated teeth to treat or prevent systemic diseases remains unscientific and misguided.Highlighting publications and findings by Price, by Meinig, and by Haley, holistic dentist Mark A Breiner advises not routine extraction of root- filled teeth, but routine monitoring, and extraction only when the tooth seems to especially impair health [Mark A Breiner, Whole-Body Dentistry: A Complete Guide to Understanding the Impact of Dentistry on Total Health (Fairfield CT: Quantum Health Press, 2011), pp 164, 168 & 175].

(2001). \\"Attacking the Money Machine\\" . MSNBC.com. Retrieved February 14, 2007. ) is a financial institution incorporated in 1988. It is based out of The Bahamas, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. The Bank was accused by the United States of having links to Islamist terror organizations, alleging that it was a major source of funds for the operations of Osama bin Laden and his associates. Al Taqwa bank was subsequently placed on a list of entities and individuals associated with Al Qaeda that is maintained by the UN Security Council. On August 2, 2010, the bank was removed from the list. None of the key individuals affiliated with the bank have ever been charged of any crime, whether by the United States or any other government. History The Al Taqwa (Arabic for \\"piety\\") network of financial companies was set up in 1988 by prominent members of the Muslim Brotherhood, most notably Al Taqwa's chairman and co-founder, Youssef Nada. Later, Ahmed Huber, a vocal admirer of the Muslim Brotherhood, was hired because the company needed at least one Swiss citizen on its board. Another co-founder was Fran√ßois Genoud, one of the key managers of Nazi assets after the second world war who later attained notoriety as the publisher of Joseph Goebbels' diaries. Al Taqwa Bank was targeted early on by the United States because of its known links to Osama Bin Laden's family. The U.S. also targeted it because its allegedly terror-related funds indirectly filter through the banking system of the United States, through its use of correspondent accounts, to various terror organizations around the world. At the time Al Taqwa Bank assets were frozen it held $220m of money destined to allegedly fund terror activity against the West, such accounts with the Swiss Banca del Gottardo, which in turn holds correspondent accounts with Citibank and the Bank of New York. Komisar, L. (2002). \\"Shareholders in the Bank of Terror?\\" . Salon.com. Retrieved February 14, 2007.  Proven connections to terrorist financing  In 2001, authorities in the Bahamas cancelled Al Taqwa's bank license there due to its involvements in finance of Islamic terror organizations using new laws designed to crack down on money laundering. These laws would require Al Taqwa to maintain a physical presence in that country, which the Bahamas would not be able to give to a suspected terror bank. Hartnell, N. (2002). \\"Bahamas-Based Firms On US Terrorist Financing Blacklist \\" . Bahamas News Archive. Retrieved February 14, 2007. Later that year, Al Taqwa offices in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, along with the homes of Youssef Nada, Ahmed Huber, and one other Taqwa director, were raided by law enforcement agencies after being put on the Bush administration's \\"terrorist financiers\\" watch list. Discovered in Nada's home was a document titled \\"The Project\\". Nada claimed to have no knowledge of who wrote it or how it came into his possession. The document describes a plan to establish \\"the reign of God over the entire world\\" by developing a framework of religious, educational and charitable organizations in the western world. It also recommends that readers engage in the \\"study of the centers of power locally and worldwide, and the possibilities of placing them under influence\\" and \\"nurtur[e] the sentiment of rancor with regard to Jews.\\" No charges were pressed. Jordan accused the Al Taqwa bank of providing financial aid to the Jordanian organizations of Khader Abu Ghoshar and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi involved in plotting terrorist attacks on tourists during Jordan's \\"Millennium Celebration\\".  U.S. and Swiss investigations  In 2002, the United States Treasury Department contacted the Swiss government by letter in an effort to convince authorities that Al Taqwa Bank had set up a special line of credit for Al Qaeda financial kingpin Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim to finance terrorist attacks by various terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda and Hamas. Shahzad, S. (2001). \\"Al Qaeda Primed for Wider Struggle\\" . Asia Times. Retrieved February 14, 2007. The communique stated that Al Taqwa Bank used secret accounts, convoluted real estate transactions, and other financial methods of obscuring the flow of money to funnel cash directly to organizations that would use the funds for terrorist attacks. Money would allegedly flow from Kuwait and the UAE into Al Taqwa offices in Lugano and Malta, where Al Taqwa provided \\"indirect investment services for Al Qaeda, investing funds for bin Laden, and making cash deliveries on request to the Al Qaeda organization.\\" Isikoff, M. and M. Hosenball. (2004). \\"Paying for Terror\\" . MSNBC.com. Retrieved February 14, 2007. These letters were intended to convince the Swiss to take legal action against banking operations the U.S. government considered suspect (Youssef Nada was himself based in Switzerland). These appeals had apparently been going on since the mid-1990s; Swiss banking officials knew of the reports of Al Taqwa Bank's connections to terrorism, but did not have the evidence to take official action, due to Switzerland's strict banking-secrecy laws and the lack of transparency inherent in traditional hawala banking. This drama played out largely away from public scrutiny. However, in 2002 the semi-secret intergovernmental letters were obtained by an American lawyer involved in a class-action suit against supposed terrorist financiers and subsequently entered into the public record. Official response to allegations Al Taqwa's board of directors, none of whom have ever been charged in any criminal case by the United States or any other government, have consistently denied any connection to the financing of terrorism.

Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Leo Eaton, it was first broadcast on 24 March 1968 on ATV London. In this episode, the Mysterons drug champagne that is being consumed at a party on Cloudbase, causing Spectrum personnel to take leave of their senses. Plot On 7 July, Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews) hosts an unauthorised party to mark the first anniversary of Spectrum's founding with Cloudbase's personnel, where they drink non-alcoholic champagne. A furious Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) prematurely ends the party and reprimands the personnel for their lack of discipline. Shortly after, the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) vow to destroy Atlantica, an undersea World Navy base. In view of this threat, Spectrum take over an operation to bomb and disperse a wreck that is drifting towards Atlantica. Captains Blue and Ochre (voiced by Ed Bishop and Jeremy Wilkin) are selected for the mission and briefed at Maxwell Field, where they behave with uncharacteristic flippancy and absent-mindedness. Before taking off in a V17 bomber, they encounter a man whom they fail to recognise as Captain Black, who switches their flight plan. On Cloudbase, all personnel except White and Scarlet fall into a trance-like state. White and Scarlet realise that the champagne is to blame and that they are both unaffected because neither of them drank any ‚Äì White was absent from the party, and Blue accidentally knocked Scarlet's glass out of his hand. The Mysterons used their powers to spike the champagne with a compound used in pest control, which chemical analysis indicates causes amnesia and childish recklessness. Failing to question their new flight plan, the stupefied Blue and Ochre cross into the restricted airspace over Atlantica and bomb the base's defence system control tower. Alerted by Maxwell Field, White and Scarlet intercept the V17 in a Spectrum Passenger Jet and cripple it with an air-to-air missile before Blue and Ochre bomb the base itself. Blue finally comes to his senses and ejects himself and Ochre moments before the V17 crashes into the ocean. Despite the Mysterons' partial success, the Cloudbase personnel have good cause for celebration on 10 July, for this is Spectrum's true anniversary: although its charter was drawn up on 7 July, the organisation was not officially created until the World President signed the document three days later. For this occasion, White organises a party with several bottles of real champagne ‚Äì which, to Scarlet's delight, have his codename emblazoned on the label. Production The V17 scale model was a re-use of the RTL Transporter that appears in the Thunderbirds episode \\"The Cham-Cham\\". While flying the V17, Blue and Ochre listen to a radio broadcast of \\"Dangerous Game\\", an instrumental composed for that episode. This episode is one of two (the other being \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\") to feature all of the regular characters, although not all have speaking parts. \\"Flight to Atlantica\\" is one of several Captain Scarlet episodes written by Tony Barwick to include a mention of 10 July. Barwick liked to insert references to this date as it was his birthday. Reception Geoff Willmetts of the website Sfcrowsnest regards \\"Flight to Atlantica\\" as (\\"story-wise\\") one of the best episodes of the series, arguing that it \\"would work in any medium\\". He adds that it marks \\"one of the rare times when the Spectrum captains are less than formal, with elements of arrogance and slaphappy showing how well disciplined they normally are.\\" Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine describes the episode as \\"amusing\\" and adds that it contains \\"plenty of character-breaking moments\\". He expresses surprise that Scarlet is \\"treated as a hero\\" in the final scene given that it was he who arranged the unauthorised champagne party (an \\"unbelievably bone- headed blunder\\" on his part) and is therefore indirectly responsible for the near-total destruction of Atlantica.

His daughter Sarah Smith-McDowell and her husband, William Wallace McDowell bought the house after her parents died. It is a blend of architectural styles dating from its original 1840 construction and additions completed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The floor plan is typical of Adam style, better known as Federal style in America. It is a double-pile plan, Flemish bond, five-bay mansion that features a double-tier porch semi- engaged beneath an extension of its gable roof. Each three-bay end wall has a pair of interior chimneys. The brick walls are 12 to 20 inches thick. The original Federal character that dominated the house's exterior remains in the large fanlights above the front doors and in the delicacy of the front porch that is supported by twelve slender fluted columns (six on each level). The house has corbelled cornices that feature dentils. The exterior of the building at one time displayed penciling, and remnants remain in several spots. Although much of the dwelling's original Greek Revival interior woodwork was replaced during a Neoclassical style remodeling in 1913, the second floor's mantels, window frames, and door frames are original, dating from the 1840s. A one-story semicircular sunroom was added to the southern end wall in the late 1880s. Today the house is on the grounds of Asheville- Buncombe Technical Community College.

Thompson was an eighth-round pick in the 1975 NFL Draft out of Oklahoma State. He spent his first five seasons as a backup at halfback and wideout for the Lions (his position at halfback was why he wore #39 even after playing exclusively as a receiver, which is technically outside of the NFL's uniform numbering system [receivers were only limited to wearing numbers between 80 and 89 then]). On December 11, 1977, Thompson blocked a David Lee punt on the Baltimore Colts 21 yard line, returning it 2 yards for a touchdown with 14 seconds left in the game. The clutch play gave the Lions an improbable 13-10 victory. In 1980, Thompson earned a starting role as wide receiver opposite Freddie Scott. Thompson caught 19 passes for 511 yards and 3 touchdowns. He caught another 214 passes over the next six seasons, including 26 touchdowns. He would lead the Lions in receiving in 1985 with 51 catches, for 736 yards and 5 scores. Thompson's career ended when the Lions released him before the start of the 1987 season. He played all 12 seasons of his career with the Lions, scoring 39 total touchdowns. College Career Leonard Thompson played high school football at Pueblo High in Arizona. He attended Arizona Western College before being discovered by Scouts at Oklahoma State, who convinced Thompson to transfer there.https://tucson.com/f-leonard-thompson-eighth-round-oklahoma- state-pueblo/article_669bd238-0beb-11e6-af22-cb7015ef7bc2.html Thompson would see his first action at running back for the Cowboys in 1973. Oklahoma State, coached by Jim Stanley, struggled to a 5-4-2 record in 1973. During his first season of action, Thompson carried the ball 90 times for 518 yards and six touchdowns. During his senior season in 1974, Thompson worked both as running back and wide receiver. He carried the ball fewer times in 1974, 33, and scored fewer touchdowns, 3. However, Thompson emerged as a receiver out of the back field, catching five passes for 114 yards and a touchdown. To further show Thompson's athletic skills, he even pass for one touchdown during his senior season. https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/oklahoma- state/1974.html Pro Career Leonard Thompson was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 8th round (194th player selected overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft. The same draft produced Doug English, who would go on to a multi-All Pro career for the Lions, but Thompson would play for the franchise longer than any other player drafted by the Lions that year.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/teams/det/1975_draft.htm Four the first four seasons of his career, Thompson played in every game, but only occasionally was a starter. Despite starting in only one game for the Lions in 1978, Thompson still caught four touchdown passes that season. The first touchdown pass in his pro career came in the form of a 19-yard pass from quarterback Gary Danielson in the Lions 21-14 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197812030crd.htm Whereas Thompson began to emerge during the 1980 season, his career year was in 1981. He was a full-time stater for the first time in his pro career, as he hauled in 30 passes for 550 yards and three touchdowns. While the Lions finished 8-8 under head coach Monte Clark, the Lions could not find consistency under center after Danielson was injured. Both Eric Hipple and Jeff Komlo did their best. The Lions lost both Komlo starts and went 6-4 under Hipple, who was in his second year. Despite the Lions instability at quarterback over the next few seasons, Thompson would be a constant for the Lions offense. Thompson caught seven passes for 150 yards in the Lions wild card 31-7 loss to the Washington Redskins, in the post season of the strike shortened season. The Lions won the NFC central the following season with a 9-7 record. They received a first round play, but lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round. In that game, Thompson caught six passes for 74 yards, but the Lions lost in the last minutes of the game when 49ers quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to Freddie Solomon. The following season the Lions tail spun into a 4-11-1 record, despite Thompson catching 50 passes for 773 yards, and the emergence of the speedy Jeff Chadwick at receiver. Thompson had emerged as a favorite target of Hipple's but it was around this time that Thompson began to have issues with his knees. His knees gave him so much trouble, Thompson's participation in practice was limited. It wasn't long before Thompson had to have multiple surgeries on his kneeshttps://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/11/28/Leonard- Thompson-makes-it-look-so-easyThe-Lions-wide/9195502002000/ In 1986, his final season in the NFL, Thompson caught 25 passes for 320 yards and five touchdowns. However, he would have a shinning moment that season. In a nationally televised Monday Night game against the Chicago Bears, catching a touchdown pass from rookie Chuck Long. However, the Bears came back to beat the Lions 16-13.https://www.mlive.com/lions/2017/09/detroit_lions_on_monday_night.html This wasn't the only time Thompson came through in a nationally televised game. In a Thanksgiving contest against the New York Jets in 1985, Thompson caught three touchdown passes from Eric Hipple as the Lions cruised to a 31-20 win.https://www.ganggreennation.com/2017/11/23/16692844/jets-thanksgiving- history Thompson's NFL career came to an end when the Lions released him after the preseason in 1987. Thompson ended his career as the Lions all-time leader in touchdown receptions with 35, a mark that was passed by Herman Moore and later by Calvin Johnson, the latter who is now the Lions all-time leader in touchdown receptions. Thompson currently ranks at third at with 35.https://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/2018/10/31/where-does-golden-tate- rank-all-time-among-detroit-lions-wide-receivers/ References  External links  *Detroit Lions Game Summaries: 1975 to 1979 *NFL.com player page Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Oklahoma City Category:American football wide receivers Category:Arizona Western Matadors football players Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys football players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Players of American football from Oklahoma Category:African-American players of American football ","title":"Leonard Thompson (American football)"},{"id":"9510717","title":"Lashinda Demus"},{"id":"9510731","text":"Mayfield Township is one of nineteen townships in DeKalb County, Illinois, USA.

Route description Entering from West Virginia at Marietta via the Marietta‚ÄìWilliamstown Interstate Bridge, I-77 passes through rolling Appalachian terrain. The interchange with I-70 at Cambridge was noted on the cover of the 1969 Ohio Department of Highways official highway map as being the \\"World's Largest Interchange\\", covering over of land. Other major Interstate Highways I-77 connects with in Ohio are I-76, I-80 (Ohio Turnpike), and I-90. The interchange with the Ohio Turnpike was completed December 3, 2001, providing direct access; previously, traffic had to exit at Ohio State Route 21 to get to the Turnpike. I-77 is also known as the \\"Vietnam Veterans' of America Highway\\" in Ohio, and the Willow Freeway in Greater Cleveland. History =Planned route= Originally planned to run from Port Huron, Michigan, to Charlotte, North Carolina, I-77 appeared on the original Interstate system route numbering plan in 1957. The part of I-94 from Detroit northeast to Port Huron was originally planned as I-77 in 1957; the current I-77 was I-79. When the current I-79 was added in Pennsylvania, the I-77 designation was moved to its current route, but the I-77 in Michigan also remained in the 1958 numbering plan, so the designation followed I-90 and I-75 in order to keep it continuous; the designation north of I-77's westward turn was to have been Interstate 177. I-77 in Michigan later became part of I-94. =Ohio= Initially, U.S. Route 21 in Ohio traveled from Marietta to Cleveland. In 1962, Interstate 77 in Ohio first started appearing in Akron and Canton. Soon, it drastically grew in the process as time went on. By the end of 1971, US 21 was decommisioned in Ohio in favor of Interstate 77 which was nearly complete. It was eventually finished in 1976 with the final connection being opened in Independence. Exit list Auxiliary routes Interstate 277 is a spur route in Akron connecting I-77 to I-76.

During his career, he worked on telecasts for the Detroit Red Wings, Florida Panthers, Phoenix Coyotes and Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He also worked nationally in the United States for ESPN, ABC, Versus, NBC Sports Network and NBC. On April 17, 2017 the Hockey Hall of Fame announced that Strader was the 2017 recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for his outstanding contributions to play-by-play broadcasting of the game of ice hockey. While hockey was his primary focus, he also called college basketball, WNBA, and NBA D-League games. Biography A native of Glens Falls, New York, Strader honed his broadcasting skills at the college radio station WMUA 91.1 while studying for his Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. =Broadcasting career= Local work Strader's professional broadcasting career began as the radio announcer and public relations director for the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL from 1979 to 1985. A two-time New York State Broadcasters Association honoree, Strader was named the AHL's top public relations professional in 1984. In 1985, the NHL's Detroit Red Wings called Strader up from the farm club, and he took over the play-by-play duties, calling TV games on both WKBD and PASS Sports alongside Mickey Redmond until 1996. Strader called games for the Florida Panthers for the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 seasons when not calling games for NBC or Versus. Strader was hired by the Phoenix Coyotes on July 2, 2007. He was reunited with his former ESPN and ABC partner, Darren Pang, for Coyotes broadcasts for two seasons. With no television contract in place for Coyotes games, Pang left in 2009 to join the Blues. Strader was joined in the broadcast booth by former NHL player Tyson Nash. In July 2011, Strader left his position with the Coyotes to accept a full-time job with NBC/Versus. He joined the NHL Dallas Stars as their TV play-by-play voice at the start of the 2015-2016 NHL season. In June 2016, Strader was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a fairly rare and aggressive form of cancer of the bile duct.\\"Statement from Dave Strader on his cancer diagnosis\\" The Dallas Stars, September 21, 2016 During a break in his treatment, he returned to the broadcast booth on February 18, 2017, a 4-3 overtime home win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After the game, the Stars saluted Strader at center ice. Strader broadcast all five games of that Dallas home stand including one on NBC. In April 2017, he also broadcast games in the first round Stanley Cup playoff series between the Washington Capitals and Toronto Maple Leafs on NBC networks. National work Dave Strader broadcasting NHL hockey for NHL on NBC (2015) Following the death of longtime ESPN broadcaster Tom Mees in 1996, Strader was hired by the cable network to take the vacant play-by-play spot on National Hockey Night broadcasts.

Early life L√Ω Ph·∫≠t M√£ was born in 1000 in Hoa L∆∞, Ninh B√¨nh, during the reign of king L√™ Ho√†n, when his father L√Ω C√¥ng U·∫©n was an official of the royal court. His mother was L√™ Th·ªã Ph·∫•t Ng√¢n, daughter of L√™ Ho√†n. When he was nine, L√Ω C√¥ng U·∫©n became the new ruler of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. In 1020, as crown prince, Ph·∫≠t M√£ was marching his army south through Thanh H√≥a, he encountered the spirit of Mount Tr·ªëng ƒê·ªìng, which promised to help his campaign. Ph·∫≠t M√£ successfully invaded Champa, killed the Cham commander, and destroyed half his army. Reign At the beginning of his reign, Th√°i T√¥ng relied mostly on his father's advisers who were left to him and together they crushed a rebellion led by two of his brothers challenging his throne. Later, he personally led an army to defeat yet another unsatisfied brother. When his rule became more secure, Th√°i T√¥ng started to demonstrate his unconventional style of governing. He promoted one of his favorite concubines to royal status. He rejected his officials' advice and plowed the land himself during the spring plowing ceremony. In 1039, Th√°i T√¥ng had a serious discussion with his official about whether a good government depended upon strong personal leadership or a sophisticated institution. In the end, he accepted his officials' opinion and started to reform the government. One of those reforms was to reorganize the royal family and make it into a parallel of the government, which was a bureaucratic system. Another significant reform was the publication of a new law, which replaced the old law that was either copied or borrowed from Tang China. In 1044, Th√°i T√¥ng with his army invaded Champa. The war was won and the Cham king, Jaya Simhavarman II, was killed. The amount of the plunder was considerable.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., In 1049, having dreamed of Avalokite≈õvara seated on a lotus, he ordered the construction in ThƒÉng Long of the one pillar pagoda, which survived in twentieth-century Hanoi. Starting around 1049, Th√°i T√¥ng became less occupied with worldly affairs. He began to seek solutions of life through religion. He died in 1054 and a few months before his death, he transferred the governing job to his son L√Ω Nh·∫≠t T√¥n (L√Ω Th√°nh T√¥ng). The succession went much smoother than the one in 1028 and proved the success of Th√°i T√¥ng‚Äôs institutional reform.

In 1989, he deliberately injured himself during a World Cup qualifying match in an attempt to avoid a loss by the Chile national team. The incident resulted in a lifetime ban for Rojas and one World Cup ban for Chile. His ban was subsequently lifted in 2001.  Career  Rojas was born and raised in Chile. He began his career in 1976 with the Chilean club Aviaci√≥n. Rojas went on to play for Colo-Colo from 1983 until 1987. With Colo- Colo, Rojas won national titles in 1983 and 1986. In 1987, after a successful performance in the Copa Am√©rica 1987 championship, he transferred to Brazil's S√£o Paulo where he remained until 1989. After his retirement he returned to S√£o Paulo to serve as a goalkeeper coach, training Rog√©rio Ceni. In 2003, Rojas served as interim coach and took the team to the Copa Libertadores for the first time since 1994. He was later a goalkeeping coach for Brazilian side Sport Club do Recife.  1989 World Cup qualifying incident  In 1989, Rojas was in goal for Chile's 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Brazil at Rio de Janeiro's Maracan√£ stadium. Chile, down 1‚Äì0, would be eliminated from the upcoming World Cup if they lost or if the match ended in a draw. Around the 70-minute mark of the match, Rojas fell to the pitch writhing and holding his forehead. A firework, thrown from the stands by a Brazilian fan named Rosenery Mello do Nascimento, was smoldering on the pitch about a yard away. It seemed that Rojas had been hit by the firework, an incident that could have had the match nullified and possibly even have had Brazil penalized by FIFA. Rojas, his head bloodied, was carried off the field; his teammates then refused to return claiming that conditions were unsafe. The match was unfinished. Video evidence later showed that Rojas had not been hit by the firework. His head injury was discovered to have been self-inflicted with a razor blade he had hidden in his glove. FIFA awarded Brazil a 2‚Äì0 win, effectively eliminating Chile from the 1990 World Cup. As a consequence, Chile was banned from the 1994 FIFA World Cup and Rojas was banned for life, along with the coach Orlando Aravena and the team doctor Daniel Rodriguez. A Chilean inquiry found that Aravena had ordered Rojas and Rodriguez by walkie-talkie to remain on the ground and that Rojas was to leave the field on a stretcher. The team's co- captain, Fernando Astengo, was banned from football for the next five years for deciding to remove the team from the field. In 2001, following a request for a pardon, Rojas' ban was lifted by FIFA.

She was named after Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy, the so-called \\"Red Count\\", and was noted for her lavish Italian interior decoration. Because much of its sailing would be in warmer waters, the designers included an outdoor dining area, unusual for ships of this era. Conte Rosso had a sister ship, . Building William Beardmore and Company built the ship in Dalmuir, Glasgow for the Italian Lloyd Sabaudo Line. She was launched in 10 February 1921 and completed on 14 March 1922. Conte Rosso was long between perpendiculars, had a beam of and her gross register tonnage was 17,857. She had four steam turbines driving two screws by double reduction gearing. Conte Rossos code letters were NJVH until they were superseded in 1934 by the maritime call sign IBEI. Service history She entered service in 1922 carrying passengers between Italy and New York City. She was the first new transatlantic liner built after World War I and the largest Italian liner to date. In 1928 she was replaced on the New York route by the newer and began service between Italy and South America.The New York Times In 1932 Lloyd Sabaudo merged with Navigazione Generale Italiana and Cosulich Line to form Flotte Riunite. Flotte Riunite transferred Conte Rosso to the Trieste ‚Äì Bombay ‚Äì Shanghai route. After 1933 this became one of the major escape routes for the Jewish population of Germany and Austria as Shanghai was one of the few places that did not require paid emigration visas. Conte Rosso served as an Italian troop ship during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in the 1930s. Incidents On 31 January 1925, 19-year-old Antonietta Gigliobianco mysteriously fell overboard from Conte Rosso to her death, orphaning her two- year-old son Ernesto. After he was turned over to the ship's chaplain, a media outcry in New York City ensued, which reunited the boy with his father Leonardo Gigliobianco. Sinking In World War II the Italian Government again used Conte Rosso as a troop ship. On 24 May 1941 the Royal Navy submarine sank her by torpedo off the coast of Sicily while in convoy from Naples to Tripoli. Of the 2,729 soldiers and crew aboard, 1,300 were killed.

It was completed in 1831, and is now on the List of historic civil engineering landmarks. The base line measurement was the first project of its kind undertaken in America, and essential for Massachusetts' pioneering Trigonometrical Survey, performed under chief engineer Robert Treat Paine. Its careful measurement was critical, since the accuracy of the whole triangulation network depended on it. The base line was measured with greater accuracy than previously possible by using a new measuring device invented by Simeon Borden, which employed a bi-metallic measuring instrument to provide constant readings despite temperature variations. His apparatus was long, enclosed in a tube, and employed with four compound microscopes. Borden was a highly competent engineer whose ability was widely recognized. Indeed, the entire project became generally known as the Borden Survey. He measured the base line with a nominal accuracy of better than one part in 5 million. As Professor A. D. Butterfield has written, \\"The work performed and results obtained far surpassed in magnitude and attainment of any previous work of this kind in America.\\" It appears that the north end of the baseline lies just south of the intersection of today's Route 116 and Route 5 in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. According to the Valley Historians, the south end is still marked by a copper plug set into a boulder, located in the back yard of the house at 30 Bridge Street, Hatfield, Massachusetts.

Background  Electronic resources, particularly electronic journals and ebooks, can be viewed as an integral part of library collections. Recent studies have shown that not only are libraries acquiring significant amounts of digital content, but also that this content is both replacing and eclipsing traditional media. Scholarly communication, particularly how libraries deliver and consume information, has changed as a result of the Web. With the majority of library catalogs and electronic collections now accessible online, either remotely or via public terminals in libraries, patron preference also tends toward electronic journal usage. The most-cited reasons for preferring electronic journals include ease of access, ease of printing, and ease of searching. It is common for libraries to seek solutions to address new issues broached by electronic resources and electronic access to the library. These solutions are typically software (and hardware) to help librarians track and serve information digitally, thereby maintaining the library‚Äôs relevance as a research partner when competing with freely available information on the Web. E-resource access and management services (ERAMS) are one such category of solution.  Overview  E-resource access and management services (ERAMS) are a new business category of library services designed specifically to make electronic collections accessible for patrons and manageable for librarians so that libraries can realize the full use and value of their e-resource purchases. ERAMS is designed to be used in library planning and budgeting to help libraries continue to provide electronic resources effectively to aid patron research. Many products and services fall into the broad category of ERAMS: A-to-Z title lists, OpenURL link resolvers, federated search services, MARC records services, electronic resource management (ERM) applications, and more.  Key principles  The foundations of ERAMS are a clear focus on electronic resources and an accurate and comprehensive knowledgebase of local library holdings. Companies that provide ERAMS often focus on web-native and Web 2.0 technology to provide fully integrated and interoperable products. There are four essential processes for delivering effective ERAMS: * Collect an e-resource knowledgebase * Correct the knowledgebase to maintain accuracy * Connect people with answers using the best method * Control budgets, collections, and workflows to optimize value  See also  * Library 2.0 * Integrated library system * Library computer system * Online public access catalog (OPAC) * Library collection development  References  * * Institute for the Future, the (2002) Final Synthesis Report of the e-Journal User Study, December 2002 * Waltham, M., Hey, T., and Lynch, C., (2006) How is scholarly communication changing as a result of the Web?, ASLPSP 2006 * Schonfeld, Roger C., King, Donald W., Okerson, A., Fenton, Eileen G., (2004) The Nonsubscription Side of Periodicals: Changes in Library Operations and Costs between Print and Electronic Formats, June 2004 * ARL Statistics 2004-05 Ed, Kyrillidou, Martha, and Young, Mark (NOTE: see especially page 10) Category:Library management Category:Library 2.0 ","title":"ERAMS"},{"id":"9511138","text":"John Stuart Dyson is a political and business leader in New York.

Romanesque tower of the Saints Peter and Paul Church in Lower Heembeek and the house where Jan Baptist van Helmont performed an alchemical transmutation. (Drawing by the architect Leon Van Dievoet, 1963.). Neder-Over-Heembeek is a northern part of the City of Brussels municipality, inside the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. It is a former municipality which lost its municipality status when it was merged with the City of Brussels. Now it is a section of that municipality, and a predominantly industrial zone, remarkable principally for the Military Hospital, which is the National Burns and Poisons center.  History  It was once a small village, just named Heembeek on the edge of medieval Brussels, and was founded around a small church that became the center of a parish. Later a second church was built around a growing hamlet in the north, and the two parishes were separated, that became two villages: Over-Heembeek (\\"Upper Heembeek\\") surrounding the church of St Nicholas in the northern part, and Neder-Heembeek (\\"Lower Heembeek\\") surrounding the church of Saints Peter and Paul in the southern part of Heembeek. Both parishes came into the possession of Dieleghem Abbey in 1112 and 1155, respectively. During the 15th century the Goudenaken family was the owner of the castle at Lower Heembeek. In 1505, it came into the possession of the famous Busleyden family DE BRABANTSCHE FOLKLORE, p.35. dbnl.org. with the marriage of Adriana van Goudenaken and Gilis van Busleyden. They had twelve children. Gilis was the brother of two other famous members of the family: Hieronymus van Busleyden and Frans van Busleyden (aka Franciscus Buslidius). DE BRABANTSCHE FOLKLORE, p.24. dbnl.org. For more than a century the castle remained in the hands of the Busleyden family. In 1554, after the decease of his mother Adriana, Jan van Busleyden became Lord at Heembeek. But only two years later he died, and his son Gilis inherited Heembeek Castle in 1557. Being a minor, he came under the guardianship of his uncle Willem van Busleyden. Gilis died in Brussels in 1596. With his wife Anna he had six children. Adriaan-Eric Van Busleyden inherited Heembeek Castle, but he died in 1617. His brother Lodewijk had already died in 1615 and the castle was handed to Margareta Van Busleyden. She was married to Jan van Tiras. DE BRABANTSCHE FOLKLORE, p.39. dbnl.org. When Margareta died in 1663 Frans-Robrecht van Tyras became heir of the castle at Lower Heembeek (sloth van busleyden op de schipvaert). He died two months later and Jan Frans 't Serclaes, the son of Joanna Van Busleyden became the next owner of het casteelke of sloth van Busleyden. He sold the castle in 1674 to the monks at Dieleghem Abbey. DE BRABANTSCHE FOLKLORE, p.44. dbnl.org. Two years later, they resold the castle to the widow of Jan Bollaert from the well-known merchant family in Antwerp. In 1814, the two parishes of Lower and Upper Heembeek were finally merged into one parish when the first municipality did appear in 1813, but instead of taking back the older name Heembeek, the two adjectives were kept to preserve the identity of the two parishes. Erfgoed - Neder-Over-Heembeek, heembeekmutsaard.be In 1921, the annexation of the former Brabantian municipalities of Haren, Laken and Neder-Over-Heembeek to Brussels took place tripling the size of the Belgian capital to its present- day extent.Brussels, esdoornblad.ca Grensgevallen (5): Haren, brusselnieuws.be, 25 August 2014 Today, now as a part of in the City of Brussels, \\"Heembeek\\" is frequently used to name various civil and commercial services located in that area (such as transportation stops, or a school), ignoring the historic distinction of parishes.

Jan van Helmont and alchemy  In 1618 or thereabouts, a most curious incident changed the course of scientific history here. In a farm near the church lived the local medic, one Jan van Helmont, a follower of the teachings of Paracelsus. His son Mercurius, a close friend, tutor and collaborator of Leibniz, records that one evening, a stranger knocked at the door and was admitted. The two men talked late into the night about alchemy, and on leaving, the stranger left van Helmont with some unusual powder: he immediately mixed it with eight ounces of mercury, sealed in a clay crucible which was heated over the fire for twenty minutes, and broke the pot - to find eight ounces of gold. There are some suggestions that this visitor may have been a researcher who had had a significant hand in events leading up to the execution of the Counts of Egmont and Hoorne for heresy in 1568. This opened van Helmont's eyes to the possibility of scientific process, and he went on to become one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry.Alchemy Tried in the Fire: Starkey, Boyle, and the Fate of Helmontian Chymistry, Newman and Principe In 1843, the same farm became the residence of Count Gioacchino Pecci, the Papal Nuncio, who showed a more than passing interest in searching the place from top to bottom. Count Pecci became Pope Leo XIII in 1878.

It was established by the Bank of Jamaica Act 1960 and was opened on May 1, 1961. It is responsible for the monetary policy of Jamaica on the instruction of the Minister of Finance.  History  The Bank of Jamaica, established by the Bank of Jamaica Law (1960), began operations in May 1961, terminating the Currency Board System which had been in existence from 1939. The establishment of the Central Bank was in recognition of the need for an appropriately regulated financial structure to encourage the development process, particularly as Jamaica was about to embark on the road to political independence. The Central Bank's role tended to be of a largely reactive nature as the institution grappled with several national and international developments. However, in recent years, monetary policy implementation has been characterized by a more proactive stance, as the Central Bank has actively sought to encourage the appropriate environment for economic growth and development. As a result, the Central Bank introduced a programme for financial reform - The Financial Sector Reform Programme (FSRP) in 1985. This initiative was aimed at more effective intermediation, through the encouragement of market forces and the strengthening of the Central Bank's capacity to implement monetary policies.  Organization  The Bank of Jamaica is run by a Board of Directors headed by the Governor of the Bank of Jamaica. The Board of Directors is composed of the Governor who is also Chairman of the Board, the Senior Deputy Governor, the Financial Secretary and six other directors. All are appointed by the Minister of Finance for five year terms.

Early life and career Knoebel was born in Dessau, Germany, in 1940.ULAN Full Record Display (Getty Research) From 1962‚Äì64 he studied at the Darmstadt \\"Werkkunstschule\\", in a course based on the ideas of the pre-Bauhaus course taught by Johannes Itten and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. From 1964 to 1971, he studied under Joseph Beuys at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf with fellow students Blinky Palermo (with whom he shared a studio and a love), J√∂rg Immendorff, Ivo Ringe and Katharina Sieverding.Imi Knoebel Dia Art Foundation. Work Knoebel's work explores the relationship between space, picture support and color.Imi Knoebel - Biography and Offers Auktionshaus Ketterer. The style and formal concerns of his painting and sculpture have drawn comparisons with the high modernist principles of both Kazimir Malevich and the BauhausJohn-Paul Stonard: \\"Knoebel, Imi\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [14-02-2007], http://www.groveart.com/ Between 1966 and 1969, Knoebel worked on a series of \\"Linienbildern\\", or line paintings, encompassing 90 panels\\"The Security of the Pure Square\\" - Karola Krauss on Imi Knoebel Deutsche Bank ArtMag. Another series of 250,000 \\"Linienbilder\\" drawings were done on DIN A4 sheets in the years between 1969 and 1973/75.Imi Knoebel Virtual Museum of Modernism NRW. In 1968 Knoebel created his first major work, an installation with a variety of geometrical objects called Raum 19, named after classroom No. 19, which Beuys had given to his students at the academy. Raum 19 comprises seventy-seven components made from wood and Masonite, including painting stretchers, both assembled and in pieces; large constructions of stretchers with untreated Masonite attached as picture planes; and larger cubic volumes and curved blocks that resemble sections of an arched window or door frame.Colin Lang (September 2008), Imi Knoebel Artforum In 1992, Knoebel created a second version of ‚ÄúRaum 19‚Äù for the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (Hessian State Museum Darmstadt) in close proximity to Joseph Beuys' ‚ÄúBlock Beuys.‚Äù In 1968, Knoebel also used photography as an artistic medium. Beginning in 1968, Knoebel was one of the first Beuys students to use photography as an independent artistic medium. For his Innenprojektionen (Interior Projections; 1968‚Äì1970) black-and-white photographs, he started using empty slide projections, creating empty squares of light, projected on a wall or in a darkened, closed-off room.J√∂rg Heiser, Pleasure Series: Seriality and Color in Knoebel‚Äôs Work Deutsche Bank ArtMag. This later evolved to his placing slides covered in copy ink with precisely carved vertical and horizontal lines into the projector and then cast throughout the room. Projecting these lines at various angles throughout a darkened space, at windows, corners, wall fittings and architectural irregularities, offered limitless possibilities for the artist. Knoebel documented these light projections with his camera and displayed the variations in large grids, often with as many as 80 photographs comprising a single work. Knoebel‚Äôs 1968 Projektion 1, is a series of luminous, disorienting black-and-white photographs of light projections that bring to mind the architectural slicings that Gordon Matta-Clark was conducting at that time.Roberta Smith (August 25, 2011) A Collection‚Äôs Contest of Objects New York Times. Projection X (1970‚Äì71) and Projektion X Remake (2005), two versions of the same video concept,Project, Transform, Erase: Anthony McCall and Imi Knoebel, June 09 - September 30, 2007 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. are his only videotapes based on these outdoor projections. During a nocturnal drive through the sleeping city of Darmstadt, a large, luminous X-shaped beam of light was projected from a vehicle onto the walls of buildings. The collection of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (Hessian State Museum Darmstadt) holds extensive series of photographs, slides, and the video Projection X by Knoebel. From the mid-1970s on, Knoebel then turned towards a gestural use of color on layered plywood boards or metal plates. From 1975 to date, Knoebel has been working on overlapping coloured rectangles called \\"Mennigebilder\\" (\\"Red Lead Pictures\\"), named after an anti-corrosion paint used in steel construction by the name of Mennige Paint, which the artist has used in these works. Whereas in his early years his palette was reduced to white, black, and brown, since 1977 he has been producing works with more color.Imi Knoebel - Works from the Schaufler Collection, March 19 - October 2, 2011 Schauwerk Sindelfingen. His painting has since been characterized by a gesturally expressive application of colour on panels of layered plywood and metal placed in specific spatial relation.Imi Knoebel: WEISS - SCHWARZ, March 25 - May 15, 201 Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg. In the 1980s, Knoebel continued his associative loading of geometricizing picture elements and started to focus on the portrait. The arrangement of three, in colour nuanced vertical rectangulars next to and between two horizontal rectangulars is Knoebel‚Äôs formal solution for depicting the notion ‚Äòportrait‚Äô. Knoebel made a series of 24 colorful monochromes in homage to his friend Blinky Palermo after Palermo‚Äôs death in 1977.Benjamin Genocchio (August 14, 2008), A Language in Itself of Colored Shapes and Forms New York Times. The monumental series, acquired by Dia Art Foundation in the 1970s, was meticulously restored by the artist, who installed the work at Dia:Beacon in May 2008, marking its first ever exhibition in North America. In 1997, the German Bundestag commissioned Knoebel to create the four-part installation Rot Gelb Wei√ü Blau 1-4 for one of its office buildings. In June 2011, Knoebel‚Äôs six stained-glass panes within the apse of the Notre-Dame de Reims Cathedral were unveiled alongside the stained-glass works of Marc Chagall completed in 1974. =Kinderstern= In 1988, Knoebel created the work Kinderstern, a Social Sculpture realizing the extended notion of art, formulated 1967 by Joseph Beuys, his Professor at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, by which art also ought to change society. Since 1988, Kinderstern (Children Star) stands for the Children's rights and is the only artwork worldwide where proceeds go 100% to children in need. =Reims Cathedral= More than a century after being severely damaged by German bombing raids, Knoebel designed three new stained glass windows for the Reims Cathedral. Knoebel refused payment for his participation in the project. The creation of the colored, patterned windows, which cost ‚Ç¨900,000, was financed by the German Foreign Ministry. They were officially presented on May 12, 2015, during a ceremony attended by the Foreign Ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany and Laurent Fabius of France.Henri Neuendorf (May 12, 2015), German Artist Imi Knoebel Gifts New Stained Glass Windows to Reims Cathedral, Destroyed in WWI Artnet. Exhibitions Knoebel's first exhibition, IMI + IMI, with Imi Giese, a fellow student of Beuys‚Äôs, was held in Copenhagen in 1968. Since that time, he has exhibited his works in documentas 5 (1972), 6 (1977), 7 (1982), and 8 (1987), and at Sonsbeek (1971). In 1996 the Haus der Kunst, Munich, staged a large retrospective of his works which travelled throughout Europe, including such venues as the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern, Centre Julio Gonz√°lez, Valencia. Knoebel had a major retrospective in summer 2009 at the Hamburger Bahnhof and the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin;Imi Knoebel: Knife Cuts Part 2, April 23, 2009 - April 11, 2010 Dia Art Foundation - Press Release, April 15, 2009. the Neue Nationalgalerie showed an arrangement of monumental key works relating to the upper hall of the famous Mies van der Rohe building, as well as gestural painting in various shades of white, which used the glass panes surrounding the upper storey of the building.

The movement aimed to raise the self-esteem and national awareness of people of undivided India regardless of their religion, caste, sex or age. It was a comprehensive programme of physical, mental, and intellectual culture, based on folk traditions of physical exercise, art, dance, drama, music, singing and social service. The Bratacharis undertake to perform good deeds, strengthen fellowship and develop the mind and body through dance.  In the words of the Founder  Gurusaday Dutt, the founder of the movement, in his book \\"The Bratachari Synthesis\\"(first published in 1937) wrote: Bratachari purports to present a complete synthesis of life, an integrated system of culture consisting of a complete philosophy of life, coupled with and expressed through a simple scheme of practical training and discipline for the building up of the inner life and character as well as the body, or in other words, for the simultaneous and harmonious cultivation of the body and soul of man. \\"Brata\\" signifies a solemn or sacred purpose, ideal or objective which is pursued as a joyous rhythmic ritual simultaneously through an integrated use of thought, word, and physical movement, and is also used to signify the combined joyous integrated ritual itself. \\"Chari\\" denotes one who pursues a purpose, ideal or objective. According to the Bratachari, the whole of life should be regarded as a Brata and should be pursued as a complete whole and as an integrated ritual, inspired by a noble purpose which is at once spiritual and practical. The single Brata or solemn purpose and ritual of life is divided into five bratas representing a five-fold path in the complete realisation of life which, however, must be pursued simultaneously and not in separate compartments. The five bratas are: Knowledge, Labour, Truth, Unity and Joy. The name Bratachari thus denotes one who has solemnly undertaken the duty of buildingt up his or her life through the systematic and integrated pursuit to the five bratas. Therefore, the ultimate goal of a Bratachari is the attainment of the ideal of the complete man by attaining perfection in self-development in all spheres of life‚Äì physical, mental, moral and social; or in other words, the attainment of the ideal of a perfect citizen of the world. At the same time, it is an essential principle of the Bratachari teaching that before one can be a complete citizen of the world, one must, be a complete citizen of a particular regional unit. The movement seeks to create in each country a nationwide discipline of common citizenship among persons of both sexes, of all castes and creeds and of all ages, by developing a high character, physical fitness in ideal and practice, the pursuit of constructive work, an observance of the dignity of labour and a joyous community spirit through common participation in national dances and songs as well as community dances and community songs.  The Movement  The movement was propagated by the Bengal Bratachari Society which was started by Gurusaday Dutt. It has its office at 191/1, Bepin Behari Ganguly Street, Kolkata 700 012, India. Bratachari societies were established in many places of undivided Bengal. The monthly magazine Bratachari Barta of the Bratachari movement, was published by the Faridpur Bratachari Samiti from November 1934 onwards. Subsequently, in 1936, the monthly \\"Banglar Shakti\\" started being published by The Bengal Bratachari Society. It was revived in 2003 and the present Editor is Naresh Banerjee, one of the biographers of Gurusaday Dutt. The headquarters of the movement is in Kolkata. But it is now independently growing in Bangladesh, particularly in Sylhet and Dhaka, where Bratachari training has been incorporated into the Bangladesh Education system. The All Bengal Bratachari Training camp is held annually at Bratacharigram in Joka, Kolkata, India. Teachers and youths from all over undergo training in the Bratachari system of education. On the 125th birth anniversary of Gurusaday Dutt in 2006, the Bengal Bratachari Society organised a torch rally from his birthplace in Bangladesh to his workplace in West Bengal. 19 Bangladeshi Bratacharis participated in the rally. The Bangladeshi group started their rally on 19/12/2006 from Birasri in Sylhet, the birthplace of Gurusaday Dutt, and ran for the next 3 days until they reached Banapol port on the border of India. On the Indian side, 5000 Bratacharis were waiting to receive the Bangladeshi Bratacharis. Two leaders from the two Banglas, exchanged their greetings by exchanging two flamed torches.

Early life Melvyn Jeremy Taub was born in London, England, the only son of Wilfred Taub (originally Schlachtaub) and Adela Robin. He attended the Clapton Jewish Day School (now Simon Marks Jewish Primary School), where he met his future Jetset bandmate Angus Nanan, before continuing his education at Central Foundation Boys' School. The Jetset Along with teenage friend Paul Bevoir, Taub formed the Jetset in July 1981; the band developed their style under the guidance of former Advertising and Secret Affair drummer Paul Bultitude, playing their first gig at the Rock Garden in Covent Garden, London, in 1981, and gaining valuable live experience as a touring support act to Secret Affair later the same year and during 1982. The band set about crafting perfectly executed and packaged bubblegum pop, inspired by the music and merchandising of The Monkees and The Beatles. From the beginning The Jetset presented themselves as already every bit as famous as their 1960s heroes. The band's marketing sowed the seeds of Jetset myth before they were even well known. An eye-catching EP sleeve included the band clowning around in stills \\"from their forthcoming TV series\\", hanging out of the Monkee-influenced ‚ÄòJetsetmobile‚Äô (a very English Ford Capri with customised ‚ÄòJETSET‚Äô number plates). They even had a suitably barmy Jetset cartoon strip that appeared in Shadows & Reflections, the underground magazine of long-time Jetset champion Chris Hunt. Taub added the trademark nasal vocals to The Jetset's authentic 1960s pop sound, and the band went on to record five albums before their acrimonious split in 1988. As Paul Bevoir started to assume more control of the band's direction and sound, and took on more of the singing duties, Bultitude and Taub quit the band, leaving Bevoir to finish the final Jetset album without them. Bevoir had occasionally appeared live as The Jetset without Taub, most notably on a tour of the United States in 1986. Mari Wilson's Wilsations Through their connection with Bultitude, Bevoir and Taub had temporarily joined Mari Wilson's Wilsations as backing vocalists in 1981. Bevoir soon left to focus on his own music, while Taub went on to enjoy chart success with the Wilsations, before returning to work with Bevoir in The Jetset. Actor As an actor, Taub appeared in It's All True, an Arena television film in the early 1980s, starring alongside Koo Stark and directed by Julien Temple, as well as in a number of TV commercials worldwide. Later career Early demos recorded by Taub have subsequently been released under the name of Melvyn And the Smartys, but after the demise of The Jetset, he continued to work in the music industry as an international press and promotions manager for EastWest Records and Sony Music. Upon leaving Sony in 2003, he continued to work with Oasis, Travis, Simple Minds, Big Audio Dynamite, Craig David, Taio Cruz, Bill Wyman, Orbital and Simply Red on a freelance basis. He later went on to form The International Department, an international music promotion and marketing company, with Paul Bultitude and Doe Phillips. He continues to work closely with Manic Street Preachers, Marc Almond, Mick Hucknall, Grace Jones, and Jake Bugg in promotional and tour management roles.

It lies just off the M1 motorway some 35 km north of Dublin City and beside the Delvin River. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, it expanded significantly with the development of numerous housing estates in the area. History Evidence of ancient settlement in the area include the ruins of St Patrick's parish church (dated to the 13th century) and nearby chapel of St Christopher (dated to the 15th century). Part of the Preston chapel of St Patrick's survives, including the tomb of William Preston, 2nd Viscount Gormanston, and his second wife Eleanor Dowdall. The ruins of these structures lie within Stamullen graveyard, which contains a number of unusual gravestones, including a cadaver monument (dated to c.1450) within St Christopher's chapel. In October 1999, a real IRA training camp and underground firing range were discovered near the village. Amenities The village contains a supermarket, pub, three hairdressers, barbers, veterinary clinic, butcher, fast food outlet, laundromat and a coffee shop. A Benedictine monastery was established in the town in 2012. This facility, the Silverstream Priory, falls within the Diocese of Meath. In March 2012, two American monks moved into Silverstream House, originally built in 1843 by the Preston family (the Viscounts Gormanston). The monastery's adherents celebrate the Liturgy in Latin, performs Gregorian chant, and Eucharistic Adoration. Stamullen has a community centre which is also home to St Patricks GAA, Stamullen Football Club, Stamullen Badminton Club, and Stamullen Bowls Club. The village is also home to the M. Donnelly Stamullen Road Club Cycling Team. A free magazine is delivered each month to homes and businesses within the community. Education New St. Patrick's National School building, opened in 2008 St. Patrick's National School, originally opened in 1954, was extended in the 1980s to increase capacity to 6 classrooms. Numbers declined for some time, but with the building boom starting in the late 1990s numbers started to climb again. A number of pre-fabs were built in advance of the granting of planning approval for a new building which opened in 2008. As of 2019, the school had an enrollment of more than 660 pupils. Demographics In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of Stamullen had increased significantly (almost 8-fold), from 427 to 3,361 inhabitants. According to the 2016 census, more than 85% of homes in the village (869 of 1,018 households) were built between 1991 and 2010. As of the 2006 census, Stamullen then had the second lowest percentage of people in the over 65 age group and the lowest percentage of people in the 45-64 age group in any town in Ireland with a population over 1500.

On May 12, 1987, Galanis was charged in separate federal and state cases in Manhattan with stealing more than $115 million from investors and cheating the government of millions of dollars in false tax deductions.\\"Shelter Promoter is charged\\", New York Times, By Arnold H. Lubasch, May 13, 1987 Galanis was promoting a tax shelter. In the federal case, as announced by then United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in Manhattan, involved \\"a massive racketeering scheme\\" with Galanis operating a tax shelter program that obtained about $40 million from about 2,500 investors. Giuliani called Galanis \\"a career white-collar criminal.\\"Jail Charles Hurwitz website The scheme was this: Galanis's company lent the investors $4 for each $1 they invested and told them that they were eligible to deduct four times their actual investment on their taxes. However, the loans were fabricated. In the New York state case, Galanis was charged with selling real-estate tax shelters involving the Nashua Trust Company, which was said to be acquiring and developing non-casino hotels in Atlantic City.\\"Behind The Project, A Man Protected By A Maze\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, George Anastasia and Fen Montaigne, Sunday, June 15, 1986 None of that work ever happened.

Launched on 29 June 1927, her maiden voyage was from Genoa to Naples to New York City, which occurred on 13 April 1928. In 1932, after acquisition by the Italian Line, she was transferred to the South America service but was laid up in Santos, Brazil in 1940. During World War II, she was acquired by the United States and was used as an American troopship‚Äîrenamed USS Monticello (AP-61) in 1942. After the war, in 1947, she was returned to the Italian Line and renamed the Conte Grande. After a two-year hiatus, in 1949, she resumed service to South America. In 1960, she was transferred from the Italian Line to Lloyd Triestino (also chartered by Italian Line), where she served for another year until being scrapped in 1961. Her sister ship was the SS Conte Biancamano. Beginnings Conte Grande was built by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino at Trieste as an Italian-flagged passenger ship. She was launched on 28 June 1927 and entered service with Lloyd Sabaudo of Genoa at Cantieri San Marco for service on the North Atlantic tourist and passenger trade. In 1933 she transferred to the South American tourist trade. Early in June 1940 the Conte Grande was in Santos, Brazil, on one of her regular South American cruises. Here her officers held her awaiting developments after Mussolini's attack on France on 10 June 1940. On 27 February 1942 she was transferred to Brazilian registry and a Brazilian crew replaced the Italian crew who were interned. She was purchased on 16 April 1942 by the United States and renamed USS Monticello. She was commissioned the same day at S√£o Paulo in Brazil under the command of Captain Morton L. Deyo, USN. World War II USS Monticello (AP-61) The USS Monticello sailed north under the escort of the to Philadelphia for conversion to a troop transport which was completed 10 September 1942. She left New York on 2 November for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, carrying troops to Casablanca. Returning to New York, she sailed again on 25 December, carrying men for the various commands of the China-Burma-India Theater to Karachi, by way of the Panama Canal, Australia, and Ceylon. The transport returned to New York on 24 April 1943, carried reinforcements to Oran on two voyages, then sailed from Africa to San Francisco by way of the Panama Canal. Through the first half of 1944, she carried men from San Francisco to Californian ports, Australia, Hawaii, and the burgeoning bases of the South Pacific. In June 1944, she began the first of a series of transatlantic voyages bringing men to win victory in Europe. She reported to New York for an eight-week availability on 20 July 1945 and while there her Navy crew transferred off and were replaced by a Coast Guard crew beginning on 21 July 1945. Her first Coast Guard commanding officer was Commander George R. Leslie. He took command on 6 August 1945 and was replaced the next day by Captain R. S. Patch, USCG. Postwar service The vessel remained under repair at Todd's Shipyards, Brooklyn, until 2 October. During this time all of her armament was removed. She departed New York, bound for Naples, on 8 October 1945, with 176 Italian officers, 5,590 Italian Army enlisted men, 13 U.S. Army officers and 34 Army enlisted men, a total of 5,813. She arrived at Naples safely on 19 October. She departed Naples on 22 October and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on 3 November 1945. She departed Norfolk on 8 November and arrived at Le Havre, France on the 17th. She departed Le Havre on 19 November and arrived back at her home port of New York on 27 November. She then departed New York on 10 December, bound for Marseille, arriving there on 20 December. She departed Marseilles on 22 December, arriving at New York on 1 January 1946. Decommission and transfer She decommissioned at Norfolk on 22 March 1946 and returned to the War Shipping Administration for disposal on 27 May 1946. She was returned to the Italian government in June 1947, redubbed Conte Grande, and after being laid up for two years, resumed service as a passenger vessel in South America.

It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Sp√§rck Jones, and others. The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent state-of-the-art TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.  The ranking function  BM25 is a bag-of-words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, regardless of their proximity within the document. It is a family of scoring functions with slightly different components and parameters. One of the most prominent instantiations of the function is as follows. Given a query , containing keywords q_1, ..., q_n, the BM25 score of a document is: : \\\\text{score}(D,Q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\text{IDF}(q_i) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{f(q_i, D) \\\\cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \\\\cdot \\\\left(1 - b + b \\\\cdot \\\\frac{D}{\\\\text{avgdl}}\\\\right)} where f(q_i, D) is q_i's term frequency in the document , D is the length of the document in words, and is the average document length in the text collection from which documents are drawn. k_1 and are free parameters, usually chosen, in absence of an advanced optimization, as k_1 \\\\in [1.2,2.0] and b = 0.75.Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, Hinrich Sch√ºtze. An Introduction to Information Retrieval, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 233. \\\\text{IDF}(q_i) is the IDF (inverse document frequency) weight of the query term q_i. It is usually computed as: :\\\\text{IDF}(q_i) = \\\\ln (\\\\frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{n(q_i) + 0.5}+1) where is the total number of documents in the collection, and n(q_i) is the number of documents containing q_i. There are several interpretations for IDF and slight variations on its formula. In the original BM25 derivation, the IDF component is derived from the Binary Independence Model. The above formula for IDF has drawbacks for terms appearing in more than half of the corpus documents. These terms' IDF is negative, so for any two almost-identical documents, one which contains the term may be ranked lower than one which does not. This is often an undesirable behavior, so many applications adjust the IDF formula in various ways: * Each summand can be given a floor of 0, to trim out common terms; * The IDF function can be given a floor of a constant \\\\epsilon, to avoid common terms being ignored at all; * The IDF function can be replaced with a similarly shaped one which is non-negative, or strictly positive to avoid terms being ignored at all.  IDF information theoretic interpretation  Here is an interpretation from information theory. Suppose a query term q appears in n(q) documents. Then a randomly picked document D will contain the term with probability \\\\frac{n(q)}{N} (where N is again the cardinality of the set of documents in the collection). Therefore, the information content of the message \\"D contains q\\" is: :-\\\\log \\\\frac{n(q)}{N} = \\\\log \\\\frac{N}{n(q)}. Now suppose we have two query terms q_1 and q_2. If the two terms occur in documents entirely independently of each other, then the probability of seeing both q_1 and q_2 in a randomly picked document D is: :\\\\frac{n(q_1)}{N} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{n(q_2)}{N}, and the information content of such an event is: :\\\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\\\log \\\\frac{N}{n(q_i)}. With a small variation, this is exactly what is expressed by the IDF component of BM25.  Modifications  * At the extreme values of the coefficient BM25 turns into ranking functions known as BM11 (for b=1) and BM15 (for b=0). * BM25FHugo Zaragoza, Nick Craswell, Michael Taylor, Suchi Saria, and Stephen Robertson.

BM25+ was developed to address one deficiency of the standard BM25 in which the component of term frequency normalization by document length is not properly lower-bounded; as a result of this deficiency, long documents which do match the query term can often be scored unfairly by BM25 as having a similar relevancy to shorter documents that do not contain the query term at all.

Borden was born in Freetown, now Fall River, Massachusetts, to Simeon and Amey Briggs Borden, he was the 4th great grandson of Richard and Joan (Fowle) Borden, who immigrated to Rhode Island from England in 1838. His younger brother Nathaniel Briggs Borden was an important businessman in the Fall River, Massachusetts and a United States Representative. Simeon received a limited education at Tiverton, Rhode Island, and studied geometry and applied mathematics on his own. He became a woodworker and metalworker, practiced surveying, and in 1828 headed up a machine-shop in Fall River. In 1830 Bordon invented a new apparatus for accurately measuring the base line for the upcoming Massachusetts' Trigonometrical Survey. It was 50 feet long, enclosed in a tube, and used with four compound microscopes. The tube and microscopes were mounted on trestles, and adjustable to any direction. Borden's equipment was judged to be more accurate and convenient than any instrument available, and thus he assisted in measuring the Massachusetts base line (now known as the Borden Base Line) to a remarkable accuracy in 1831, and afterwards led the triangulation of the entire state from 1834-1841 as Superintendent of the Survey. He described this first geodetic survey in America in the ninth volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. Borden surveyed and marked the line between Rhode Island and Massachusetts after their disputed boundary had been tried before the United States Supreme Court in 1844. He then turned his attention to railroads and telegraphs. In 1851 he strung a telegraph wire, suspended on masts 220 feet high, across the Hudson River from the Palisades to Fort Washington, a distance of more than a mile.\\"Simeon Borden\\", Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography, edited by James Grant Wilson, John Fiske and Stanley L.

His family moved to Little Falls, Minnesota, when he was in high school and he played college football at the University of Minnesota, where he was a teammate of future Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Aaron Brown, whom he faced in Super Bowl I. In the 1966 NFL draft, Gillingham was the thirteenth overall selection. In his rookie season, he alternated as the starter at left guard with veteran Fuzzy Thurston. During the 1967 season, he took Thurston's spot full-time, opposite perennial All-Pro Jerry Kramer. He started the Ice Bowl and Super Bowl II, coach Vince Lombardi's final games after nine seasons with the team. Gillingham was the last member of the Lombardi-era Packers to be active with the franchise. By time he retired, Bart Starr, whom he blocked for when Starr was leading the Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls, was the team's coach. Gillingham was a five-time Pro Bowler (1969, '70, '71, '73 and '74), six-time All Pro (1968, '69, '70, '71, '73, '74, and a two-time AP NFL First Team All Pro (1969 and '70). Gillingham was selected as the inaugural winner of the Forrest Gregg Award for the NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year following the 1970 season. He was the NFC choice as the NFLPA/Coca-Cola Offensive Lineman of the Year for 1971. Gillingham was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1982. The only season he was not on offense was 1972 when head coach Dan Devine inexplicably shifted him to the defensive line after the pre- season, even though Gillingham was the team's best offensive lineman. During that campaign, the success of the Packers' offense heavily depended on a strong running attack led by MacArthur Lane and John Brockington. Devine's move failed when Gillingham sustained a season-ending knee injury two games into the regular season, and he was criticized for eventually being a factor in diminishing the team's playoff run. After his playing days, Gillingham was in the real estate business in Minnesota and retired in 2010. Noted for his brute strength, he was one of the first players in the NFL to use weight training to stay in playing shape during the offseason. His oldest son, Karl, is a Professional Strongman and has competed in two Worlds Strongest Man competitions. Middle son, Brad, is a 6 time World Champion powerlifter with several National and World Records. Youngest son, Wade, is a former Professional Strongman and is widely regarded as having one of the best grips in the world. Gillingham died at age 67 in 2011 in Little Falls, survived by his three sons and one daughter. In 2016, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Gillingham to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2016 References External links  Category:1944 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American football offensive guards Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Western Conference Pro Bowl players Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:People from Little Falls, Minnesota Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Players of American football from Wisconsin Category:Players of American football from Minnesota ","title":"Gale Gillingham"},{"id":"9511559","text":"North Howden is a hamlet in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

In January 1915 Orduna rescued the Russian crew of the sailing ship Loch Torridon, which had sprung a leak while transporting timber off the west coast of Ireland.The \\"LOCH TORRIDON\\" Later in July 1915, en route to New York City, Orduna was targeted by a U-boat. The torpedo, which was spotted by Captain Taylor, missed the ship, which arrived safely. In 1918 Orduna collided with the 4,406-ton steamer Konakry, carrying a cargo of ballast from Queenstown to Trinidad. Konakry was lost in the accident. =Between the wars= In April 1923 she was involved in another rescue, transporting the crew of the barquentine Clitha, which had been abandoned and set on fire, to England after they had been rescued by the schooner Jean Campbell. In 1925, Dean James E. Lough of the Extra-Mural Division of the New York University chartered Orduna for the transport of 213 students to France, with lectures taking place on board. In 1938 the Orduna was used for the third and final 'Peace Cruise', carrying 460 Scouters and Guiders, including Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, and their daughter Heather, on a cruise to Iceland, Norway, Denmark and Belgium. Orduna left Liverpool on 8 August, returning on 25 August via Dover. Robert Baden-Powell was too ill to leave the ship during the voyage, but parties of local Scouts visited him on the ship at most of the stops, while the Scouters and Guiders on the ship took the opportunity to tour local landmarks and attend receptions. During the stop at Reykjav√≠k on Thursday, 11 August, during which Orduna moored beside the German cruiser Emden, a party from the Scouts of Iceland brought some rock on board so that Baden-Powell could still 'set foot in Iceland'. The Orduna called at Trondheim, Norway, on 15 August, Copenhagen, Denmark on 18 August, and Belgium on Sunday 21 August, before returning to England.

Habitat  They have a natural range extending from Scandinavia to North Africa and from Europe to Korea; there are also transplanted populations as far apart as Japan and Madagascar. The adult spiders are photophobic and live in places free from light, frequently in caves and tunnels, though they can sometimes be seen outside of caves and mines as they will emerge around dusk to hunt, often using a single silk lasso line and swinging down upon their prey. They are often found in areas that are frequented by bats. The spiders are most often observed in railway tunnels and mines since these are more likely to be visited by humans. The young spiders are, after several instars (and in contrast to the adults), strongly attracted to lightSmithers P, Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society, 2005, Vol 13; Part 6 Pages 213-216‚Äîprobably an evolutionary adaptation which ensures the spread of the species to new areas (see Life cycle for further details). Meta menardi ‚ôÄ  Morphology  They are shiny satin black to reddish brown in colour, often having a different-coloured rear body which varies from black, brown or even olive green and are one of the largest spiders found in the United Kingdom, adults reaching roughly 5 cm legspan and 15 mm body length. However, the giant house spider, cardinal spider and the raft spider are larger. It is widespread and locally abundant, although rarely noticed due to its habits. They are neither endangered nor protectedUK Joint Nature Conservation Committee, http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1815 in the UK. closely resembles , which sports a fainter mark on its abdomen and no rings on its legs. The ecology of the two species is very similar. On the other hand, the two species seems to exhibit different tolerance to the microclimatic variations within the cave, which emerged as the main factors determining the differentiation of their niche. Cave spiders feed on smaller invertebrates, most frequently myriapods and slugs.Peter Smithers, Journal of Arachnology, August 2005 The European cave spider is not dangerous to humans and although (in common with nearly all spiders) they have venom, its effect on large mammals is negligible. They are unlikely to bite if carefully handled but if sufficiently provoked they are capable of inflicting an unpleasant \\"nip\\". They are non-aggressive and generally slow moving and are regarded (by arachnophiles) as \\"gentle giants\\".  Life cycle  After mating, females produce a drop-shaped Egg sac (cocoon). Egg sacs are tear-shaped white pendants (sometimes with a slightly yellow centre) usually hanging from the roof of the habitat by a silk thread approximately 20 mm long. Egg sacs are usually laid in the vicinity of the cave entrance, where the air flow velocity ranges between 0.3 and 0.6 m/s. The cocoon (2‚Äì3 cm in radius) contains an average of 200/300 eggs and is laid near the cave entrance at the end of the summer. After hatching, the spiderlings remain in the cocoon until the first molt, feeding on the yolk. They leave the cocoon in spring, move towards the cave entrance and disperse via ballooning outside the cave.  Media mistakes  A media frenzy was caused when British Telecom engineers working in the grounds of Windsor Castle discovered a colony living in conduits and manholes. These were incorrectly described as swarms of aggressive spiders, up to 9 cm in size, which a leading entomologist believed were venomous. The BBC reported that it \\"may be a new species or a type of spider previously thought to have been extinct for thousands of years.\\" The initial incident was widely reported but when the species was properly identified the matter received little publicity.

He spent most of his career in the United Kingdom working for the Daily Express and as a theatre critic for the London Evening Standard, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Conservative Party from 1935 until his death. Life in Canada Baxter's father, James B. Baxter, was a Yorkshire-born Methodist who had emigrated to Canada, and Baxter was born in Toronto. He left school at the age of 15, to work as an office boy for a stockbroker. However, Baxter disliked the work and left soon after to work for the Nordheimer Piano and Music Company where he sold pianos. He was made personal assistant to the owner. In his spare time he composed music, sang in operas, and wrote a novel. Wartime service Baxter found that he enjoyed writing and was considering a professional career as a novelist when the First World War broke out. In 1915 he enlisted in the Canadian Military Engineers and served as a lieutenant in the infantry with the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France. He was attached to the Royal Engineers for a time in 1918. Baxter received no decorations in the war, saying he was \\"neither sufficiently forward, nor far enough back\\". Entry to newspapers After the end of the war, Baxter remained in Europe and settled in London. In 1920 he managed to get an interview with fellow Canadian Lord Beaverbrook, who was one of the British \\"press Barons\\" seeking to build up the circulation of the Daily Express to match that of Lord Northcliffe's Daily Mail. The interview led to an appointment as a leader-writer and occasional reporter. When something written by Baxter caught the approving eye of editor R.D. Blumenfeld, Baxter was put in charge of page 4 of the paper which included the editorial, opinion pieces, and letters to the editor. Baxter was appointed the managing editor of the Sunday Express, a paper launched after the war, in 1922. Under Baxter's guidance, the paper became livelier and its features were remarked upon. After two years, Baxter was moved to the same position on the Daily Express, in effect as deputy to Blumenfeld. Baxter, who was nicknamed \\"Bax\\" within the office, got on well with both Blumenfeld and Beaverbrook. In 1924 Baxter married Edith Letson, a girl from Vancouver. In early January 1923, Beverley Baxter made a last-minute effort to save the life of Edith Thompson, who had been sentenced to death for murder. Like many others, he was convinced Thompson had been unjustly found guilty in the Bywaters-Thompson trial. In his memoirs, he provides a staggering account of the events, concluding that \\"on an appointed day we shall rub our eyes and believe that it could only have been in a nightmare that judicial killing was ever countenanced by a supposedly civilised people\\" (Strange Street, 1935, p. 154ff ) Editorship In 1929, when offered a considerable increase in salary to work for the Daily Chronicle group (Inveresk publications), Baxter made the move; however, within months Blumenfeld retired and he was persuaded back to follow him as editor-in-chief of the Daily Express. Baxter increased circulation, which for the first time it exceeded 1,000,000 under his stewardship; in 1933 it topped 2,000,000. That year Baxter left the newspaper industry to work as Public Relations counsel for the Gaumont British Picture Corporation Ltd. In 1935 his autobiography, Strange Street was published; it illuminated the internal rivalries of Fleet Street newspapers and was well- reviewed. He was recruited by Allied Newspapers to be an Editorial Adviser in 1938 but did not hold this post for very long. Transfer to politics Baxter was selected as Conservative Party candidate for Wood Green in London in 1935. The 1935 general election was called inconveniently for him as he was touring in Canada at the time and had to be sent a telegram urging him to return immediately; he won the seat with a majority of over 21,000. Parliamentary contribution Baxter's maiden speech in December 1935 argued that the problems of depressed areas in Britain could be alleviated by encouraging emigration to the other countries of the British Empire, and he returned to this theme in several later speeches. He used his experience in the film industry when the issue of a Films Council to encourage more production in Britain was debated; Baxter called for a \\"dictator approved by the industry\\" to take charge. During the debates about foreign policy in the late 1930s, Baxter was an advocate of appeasement. In a debate in July 1938 he called for the United Kingdom to go to Germany helpfully, and not to block Germany wherever she tried to expand. He drew a parallel between Germans and Britons, saying that the two had the same human ambitions and sense of destiny. While a Member of Parliament Baxter often wrote features which were published in various newspapers (especially the Daily Sketch), and he became known as one of the most eloquent and persuasive supporters of the government. Second World War In the early days of the war, Baxter obtained a pledge from the government that there would be no repeat of an incident when the police went to newspaper offices to check on the contents of the next days' papers. He supported Neville Chamberlain in the Norway debate of May 1940, and the next morning protested vigorously about the attacks on Chamberlain's character, urging him not to regard the vote as one of censure but to show the courage of David Lloyd George; Chamberlain however decided otherwise and resigned that day. Despite his allegiance to Chamberlain, the incoming Churchill government appointed Baxter to an unofficial post with the Ministry of Aircraft Production where he was responsible for keeping up production of aero-engines. He became as strong a campaigner for the new Prime Minister as he had been for the old; when Sir John Wardlaw-Milne put down a motion of no confidence after the loss of Libya in June 1942, Baxter put down an amendment assuring Churchill of \\"unqualified support in the introduction of any measures .. for the intensified prosecution of the war\\". In April 1941 Baxter was in the minority, but with the government, in opposing a motion to keep theatres and cinemas closed on Sundays. =Brendan and Beverley= Baxter's earlier support for Chamberlain was not forgotten, nor was Brendan Bracken, who had switched from one to the other and become Minister of Information under Churchill. Writing under the pseudonym of Cassius, Michael Foot in Brendan and Beverley (1944), imagined a joint effort by a Chamberlain supporter and a Churchill supporter to write a reply to Guilty Men (1940), which he had co-written under another pen name. Foot characterised the two men as Mr Tadpole and Mr Taper, the two petty politicians in Benjamin Disraeli's Coningsby, and while insisting that they were fictitious, identified his targets in the title of the book. Post-war Baxter retained his seat at the 1945 general election, a Labour landslide, with a majority reduced to under 6,000. Despite having no official role he was mentioned as a potential future Conservative Party leader by Sir Hartley Shawcross in July 1946. Baxter was part of the large Conservative rebellion against the Anglo-American loan in December 1945, and in 1948 was one of eight Conservatives to oppose Marshall Aid. However, he supported the suspension of capital punishment. Southgate At the 1950 general election, Baxter moved constituencies to stand for the newly created Southgate constituency. He was always returned with more than 60% of the votes cast. After Churchill returned to power in 1951, Baxter condemned the Foreign Office under the previous Labour government for having been \\"like a branch of the State Department\\". Baxter was given a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list of 1954. He continued to support the abolition of capital punishment and acted as a sponsor of Bills to that effect brought in by the Labour MP Sydney Silverman, and spent a great deal of the late 1950s campaigning for a reduction in theatre tax. In 1959 he signed a motion deploring the call by some Labour MPs for televising the proceedings of the House of Commons. London theatre critic In a foreword to Beverley Baxter's collection of theatre reviews, published in 1949, he writes that he \\"first did dramatic criticism for the Daily Express 25 years earlier\\", and was the author of a failed play, It Happened in September, \\"which made the round of the provinces and arrived in the blackout at St James's Theatre in December 1942. The critics said that I was a bad playwright and I replied with an article in the Evening Standard in which I declared that they were bad critics.\\" Four months later he was appointed by Lord Beaverbrook as theatre critic for the Standard, a post which he held for the next 8 years, combining it with his duties as a Conservative MP for the Wood Green constituency. Milton Shulman, then the paper's film critic, would fill in whenever Baxter was on holiday or his political commitments made him miss a first night. And as Shulman reports in his 1998 memoirs, he eventually found that \\"Baxter's ability to attend first nights was becoming somewhat erratic.\\" In fact Shulman was instrumental in Baxter's 1951 downfall. Gavin Lambert had written \\"a sardonic knifing of all of Fleet Street's working theatre critics but was particularly derisive about the 'merciless volubility' of Beverley Baxter\\". It was published in an undergraduate magazine Panorama edited by Kenneth Tynan, and Shulman mischievously showed the article to Charles Curran, the features editor, who passed it to Baxter who \\"was not amused.\\" About a year later, Baxter was presented with a golden opportunity to get his own back, when he reviewed Tynan's performance as the Player King in Alec Guinness's 1951 production of Hamlet at the New Theatre in London, writing: \\"I am a man of a kindly nature, who takes no joy in hurting those who are without defence, but Mr Ken Tynan would not get a chance in a village hall unless he was related to the vicar. His performance was quite dreadful\\" Tynan responded with an open letter to the Standard, published 22 May 1951, declaring that his performance was \\"not 'quite dreadful'; it is, in fact, only slightly less than mediocre.\\" This intrigued the Standards editor Percy Elland who gave Tynan freelance work for the Standard and in July 1951 Beaverbrook appointed him as replacement for Baxter as the paper's theatre critic, a post Tynan held until August 1953. Last years In 1961 Baxter broke the whip to support a Conservative backbench amendment to restore corporal punishment for young offenders. He was very concerned at the Macmillan government's application to join the European Communities lest it damage ties with the Commonwealth, and abstained rather than support the government when it was put to the vote in August 1961. In poor health, Baxter announced that that Parliament was to be his last. He was criticised in January 1963 by the television programme That Was The Week That Was for having made no speeches since the 1959 general election. Baxter died in London before Parliament was dissolved, but no byelection to replace him was held due to the imminence of the general election.

The casino is owned and operated by Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming, which also owns the Diamond Jo Casino - Worth in Northwood, Iowa. It is a member of the Iowa Gaming Association, and its license is held by the Dubuque Racing Association, which operates Q Casino. Beginning operations on May 18, 1994, the Diamond Jo was a 3-level, , 1,500-passenger vessel in Dubuque's Ice Harbor. The boat was a dockside that did not cruise, the casino became land-based when its new facility opened December 11, 2008. The Diamond Jo Casino is located at 301 Bell Street, in the rapidly developing Port of Dubuque. The casino, along with the nearby National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium and other attractions, have helped to create a large and growing tourism market in Dubuque. Riverboat casino As a riverboat operation the Diamond Jo was the smaller of Dubuque's two casinos, with of gaming space. It has 777 slot, keno, and video poker games, and 17 table games, including: Big Raise Hold 'em, Blackjack, Craps, Four card poker, Let It Ride, Roulette, Texas Hold 'em, and Three card poker. The operation had 3 restaurants: the Diamond Deli, HighSteaks Restaurant, and Jo's Caf√©. History On April 1, 1991, the Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) and local businessman Robert Kehl opened Iowa's first riverboat casino in Dubuque's Ice Harbor, the Casino Belle. This boat's operation was short-lived, however, and relocated to Missouri in 1993, following a change in ownership. Soon after, the DRA began to search for a new riverboat to operate under the gaming license already in place. The organization selected the Greater Dubuque Riverboat Entertainment Company L.C., and its boat, which was later named the Diamond Jo, following a local naming contest. The name honors businessman Joseph \\"Diamond Jo\\" Reynolds, who owned a Dubuque shipping company, among other enterprises. The \\"first\\" Diamond Jo Casino began operations on May 18, 1994. After a year and a half, in October 1995, that boat was replaced with a larger, 1,500-passenger riverboat. In July 1999, Dubuque-based Peninsula Gaming purchased the casino operation, and spent $1 million updating the riverboat. Peninsula Gaming continues to operate the casino. In 2006, Peninsula opened a second Diamond Jo Casino in Northwood, Iowa, from Dubuque. Peninsula was acquired in November 2012 by Boyd Gaming. Expansion In September 2006, Peninsula Gaming officials announced that the Diamond Jo would begin a major expansion, during which it would become a land-based casino. The $75 million project, set to open in November 2008, will include 1,000 slot machines, 17 table games, and a poker room in a new casino. Also included in the project are a 36-lane bowling & entertainment center, 3 restaurants, retail stores, and a 1,130-space, $23 million parking ramp. The casino's expanded operation is part of the \\"America's River Project: Phase II\\", which will also involve a major expansion of the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium. The museum will take over the Diamond Jo's existing Portside Building, as well as the riverboat, and renovate them into an IMAX-like theater and exhibit space. Land-based casino complex The land-based complex, which is a short distance away from the old casino property, opened on December 11, 2008. The new, two-story, $82 million facility has approximately 900 slot and video machines, 17 table games, and a separate high-stakes gaming area. The Diamond Jo complex features three sitdown restaurants (The Woodfire Grille, The Filament and Kitchen Buffet), two bars (the Tree Bar and The Game Sports Bar), a 30 lane bowling alley (Cherry Lanes) with scheduled leagues, and an entertainment theatre complex (The Mississippi Moon Bar). Mississippi Moon Bar The Mississippi Moon Bar was named after the refrain in the Doobie Brothers song \\"Black Water\\", which the casino uses in their current commercial campaign. The Doobie Brothers were also one of the first groups to perform at the bar.

If called into active federal service, the group is gained by United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE). Mission The 152d Air Operations Group's primary day-to-day mission is to augment and support the 603d Air Operations Center, located at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, a part of United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE). The 603d AOC and 152d AOG work together to set up and run an AN/USQ-163 \\"Falconer\\" weapons system, for the European and African theater of operations.

In the event of hostilities, the Joint Force Commander assigns a Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) to lead the AOC weapon system. Quite often the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is assigned the JFACC position for planning and executing theater-wide air and space forces. When there is more than one service working in the AOC it is called the Joint Air and Space Operations Center. In cases of Allied or Coalition (multinational) operations, the AOC is called a Combined Air and Space Operations Center. There are usually five divisions in the AOC. These separate, but distinct, organizations fuse information that eventually becomes the Air Tasking Order. The divisions are the Strategy Division, the Combat Plans Division, the Combat Operations Division, the Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Division and the Air Mobility Division. The Air Communications Squadron supports all aspects of the mission systems and ensures they have the tools needed to generate the Air Tasking Order and execute Air power. The AN/USQ-163 Falconer is the weapons systems used by the JFACC and within Air Operations Centers by the United States Air Force combat forces to plan and execute military missions utilizing airborne resources. It is used to generate the Air Tasking Order and execute Air power. History The 152d Air Operations Group was initially established at Fort Clayton in the Signal Corps during 1939 as the Signal Aircraft Warning Company, Panama. In 1942 the company expanded to battalion size. It provided air defense of the Panama Canal Zone until December 1942, when it was inactivated. The battalion, now the 558th Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion was activated again in the China Burma India Theater in 1944. The 558th served in combat until the surrender of Japan and remained in theater until January 1946, when it returned to the United States and was inactivated. In March 1946, the battalion was transferred to the Air Corps, redesignated the 152d Aircraft Warning and Control Group and allotted to the National Guard. In March 1948, the group was activated and federally recognized in the New York Air National Guard at Westchester County Airport as the air control element of the 52d Fighter Wing. It was assigned three aircraft warning and control squadrons in New York and New Jersey, and an aircraft control squadron stationed with the group headquarters. In August 1951 the group and its squadrons were called to active duty in the expansion of the United States Air Force during the Korean War and moved to Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire as part of Air Defense Command (ADC). The unit did not deploy to Korea, instead it moved to Canada where it operated new radar sites being constructed for Northeast Air Command. In December the group was inactivated and returned to state control. The unit was moved to the White Plains Armory and eventually to Roslyn Air National Guard Station on Long Island. The mobilization command for the group changed from ADC to Tactical Air Command (TAC). In 1954, the unit was redesignated the 152d Tactical Control Group and changed its mission from air defense to control of tactical aircraft in both offensive and defensive combat. The group was called to active duty during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and deployed to Germany, where it operated a network of radar sites until being once again returned to state control in 1962. In 1984 the 152d moved to Hancock Field Air National Guard Base, near Syracuse. It became the 152d Air Control Group in 1992 as the Air Force dropped the terms \\"Tactical\\" and \\"Strategic\\" from its units names with the inactivation of TAC and Strategic Air Command. Air Combat Command became the new mobilization command for the 152d. In 2000, the unit's federal mission was changed to augment the Air Operations Center at Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany, for the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE). The Air Operations Center provides planning, direction, and control of assigned Air Forces. They also direct activities of forces and monitor actions of both enemy and friendly forces.

The Monti Trebulani, a small mountain group in the modern province of Caserta, take their name from it. It was situated in the district north of the Vulturnus (modern Volturno), in the mountain tract which extends from near Caiatia (modern Caiazzo) to the Via Latina. Pliny terms the citizens Trebulani cognomine Balinienses, probably to distinguish them from those of the two cities of the same name among the Sabines;Plin. iii. 5. s. 9. but the Campanian town seems to have been the most considerable of the three, and is termed simply Trebula by Ptolemy, as well as by Livy. The first mention of the name occurs in 303 BCE, when we are told that the Trebulani received the Roman franchise at the same time with the Arpinates.Livy x. 1. There seems no doubt that the Campanian city is here meant: and this is quite certain in regard to the next notice in Livy, where he tells us that the three cities of Compulteria, Trebula, and Saticula, which had revolted to Hannibal, were recovered by Fabius in 215 BCE.Id. xxiii. 39. The Trebulanus ager is mentioned also by Cicero among the fertile districts of Campania, which Servilius Rullus proposed to distribute among the poorer Roman citizens;(Cicero De lege agraria ii. 2. 5. and Pliny writes that it was noted for its wines, which had rapidly risen in estimation in his day.Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8. The Liber Coloniarum also mentions Trebula among the municipal towns of Campania. It appears to have received a fresh body of settlers under Augustus, but without attaining the rank of a colony.Lib. Col. p. 238; Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Ptol. iii. 1. ¬ß 68. The site of Trebula, which was erroneously fixed by Cluverius and some local writers to the south of the Vulturnus, appears to be correctly identified by local antiquarians with a place called Treglia or Tregghia, at the foot of the Pizzo San Salvatore, about 10 km north of the Vulturnus and 13 km northeast of Capua. There are said to be considerable ancient remains upon the spot, which together with the resemblance of name would seem clearly to establish the position of the ancient city.Romanelli, vol. iii. pp. 575, 576; Trutta, Antichit√† Allifane.

It is sometimes referred to as a \\"surface enrichment\\" process.The Surface Enrichment of Carat Gold Alloys - Depletion Gilding. Mark Grimwade in Gold Technology, Issue 26; July 1999. Process Most gilding methods are additive: they deposit gold that was not there before onto the surface of an object. By contrast, depletion gilding is a subtractive process whereby material is removed to increase the purity of gold that is already present on an object's surface. In depletion gilding, other metals are etched away from the surface of an object composed of a gold alloy by the use of acids or salts, often in combination with heat. Since no gold is added, only an object made of an alloy that already contains gold can be depletion gilded. Depletion gilding relies on the fact that gold is highly resistant to oxidation or corrosion by most common chemicals, whereas many other metals are not. Depletion gilding is most often used to treat alloys of gold with copper or silver. Unlike gold, both copper and silver readily react with a variety of chemicals. For example, nitric acid is effective as an etching agent for both copper and silver. Under the proper circumstances, even ordinary table salt will react with either metal. The object to be gilded is coated, immersed, or packed in a suitable acid or salt, and usually heated to speed the process. These chemicals then attack the metallic copper and silver in the object's surface, transforming it to various copper and silver compounds. The resulting copper and silver compounds can be removed from the object's surface by a number of processes. Washing, chemical leaching, heating, or even physical absorption by porous materials such as brick dust have all been used historically. Meanwhile, the relatively inert gold is left unaffected. The result is a thin layer of nearly pure gold on the surface of the original object. There is no well-defined minimum gold content required to successfully depletion gild an object. However, the less gold that is present, the more other material must be etched away to produce the desired surface appearance. In addition, the removal of the other metals usually leaves the surface covered with microscopic voids and pits. This can make the surface soft and \\"spongy\\" with a dull or matte appearance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more base metal is removed. For this reason, most depletion gilded objects are burnished to make their surfaces more durable and give them a more attractive polished finish. Like other gilding processes, depletion gilding provides a way to produce the appearance of pure gold without its disadvantages: its cost and rarity, and its softness and denseness. By producing a layer of gold over a layer of copper or other metal, objects can be made that are lighter, sturdier, and cheaper while still appearing to be nearly pure gold. Variations The term depletion gilding usually refers to the production of a layer of gold. However, it can also be used to produce a layer that is an alloy of gold and silver, sometimes referred to as electrum. Certain chemicals, such as oxalic acid, attack copper but do not affect either silver or gold. Using such a chemical, it is possible to remove only the copper in an alloy, leaving both silver and the gold behind. Thus, if the original object is composed of copper, silver, and gold, it can be given a gold surface by removing both silver and copper, or an electrum surface by removing only the copper. Likewise, with an appropriate chemical, a layer of nearly pure silver can be produced on an object made of copper and silver. For instance, sterling silver can be depleted‚Äî'depletion silvering'‚Äîto produce a fine silver surface, perhaps as preamble to application of gold, as in the Keum-boo technique. However, in the majority of cases depletion gilding is in fact used to produce a gold finish, rather than one of electrum or silver. Applications Depletion gilding is a decorative process, with no significant industrial applications. It is not widely used in modern times, having been superseded by processes more suited to mass production, such as electroplating. Some individual artisans and small shops continue to practice it. However, depletion gilding was widely used in antiquity. While it requires skill to execute it well, the process itself is technologically simple, and uses materials that are readily available to most ancient civilizations. Some form of depletion gilding has been used by nearly every culture that developed metalworking. The South American Sican culture in particular developed depletion gilding to a high art.Precious Metal Objects of the Middle Sican. Izumi Shamada and Jo Ann Griffin in Scientific American Special, Volume 15, Number 1, pages 80-89; 2005. Some ancient alloys, such as tumbaga, may have been developed specifically for use in depletion gilding. The technique was not known to be used by Anglo-Saxons until detailed examination with electron microscopes of treasures such as the Staffordshire Hoard revealed its use in the twenty-first century.Britain's greatest treasure hoard reveals how goldsmiths fooled the Anglo-Saxon worldhttps://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/17/staffordshire-hoard- anglo-saxon-gold-secret-technique-treasure Certain cultures are thought to have attached mythical or spiritual significance to the process. Gold was considered sacred in many early civilizations and was highly valued in nearly all of them, and anything relating to it had the potential to take on cultural importance. Moreover, the ability to turn what appeared to be an object made of copper into what seemed to be pure gold would be very impressive. There is some speculation that depletion gilding may have contributed to the concepts of alchemy, a major goal of which was to physically transform one metal into another.

Portion of US air pollution that comes from power plantsFrom US EPA (Cleaner Power Plants (retrieved 2014-04-12) It is primarily in USA analyzers were the most used, in particular to reduce pollution from coal combustion Coal quality parameters of greatest interest include ash, moisture, sulfur, and energy density (also known as heat content). Although most coal operations can obtain this information about coal quality by taking physical samples, preparing the samples, and analyzing them with laboratory equipment, these processes often involve a time lag of up to 24 hours from gathering the sample to final analysis results. In contrast, coal analyzers provide analysis information each minute on material being transported by conveyor either at the mine or the power plant. This timely coal quality information in turn allows the operator to improve his process by taking timely process control actions, such as sorting, blending, coal homogenization, or prep plant control. There are several different types of coal analyzers. Some of the more sophisticated analyzers use prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) or pulsed fast thermal neutron activation (PFTNA) to determine the elemental content of the coal. Another emerging technology for elemental analysis is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). PGNAA and LIBS enable analysis of sulfur and ash (the latter, by summing the ash constituents). When combined with a second type of analyzer, the moisture meter, they provide moisture and energy value as well. Moisture meters are often found in conjunction with the elemental analyzers, but sometimes are used alone, or in conjunction with ash gauges. Most moisture meters use microwave technology. The emerging technology of magnetic resonance (MR) offers a more direct measurement. Most ash gauges employ gamma attenuation principles. Coal analyzers were first introduced in the early 1980s with the US and Australia leading the way. The demand for coal analyzers has been highest in the US, due to the need to control sulfur as mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. By 2005, more than 600 coal analyzers were in use throughout the world. Most of these analyzers are mounted around an existing conveyor belt, although a significant minority analyze sample streams taken from the main process stream.

The strike led to the demise of the International Seamen's Union and the creation of the National Maritime Union (now part of the Seafarers International Union of North America). Strike Joseph Curran was a seaman aboard the Panama Pacific ocean liner SS California. He had been an able seaman and boatswain since 1922. Although he had joined the International Seamen's Union (ISU), he was not active in union activities. In 1936, Curran led a strike aboard the ocean liner SS California, then docked in San Pedro, California. Curran and the crew of the Panama Pacific Line's SS California went on strike at sailing time and refused to cast off the lines unless wages were increased and overtime paid.Barbanel, \\"Joseph Curran, 75, Founder of National Maritime Union,\\" New York Times, 15 August 1981; Kempton, Part of Our Time, 1998 (1955); \\"Retired Union Boss Joseph Curran Dies,\\" Associated Press, 14 August 1981.Schwartz, Brotherhood of the Sea: The Sailors' Union of the Pacific, 1885‚Äì1985, 1986. The strike was essentially a sitdown strike. Curran and the crew refused to leave the ship, for the owners would have simply replaced them with strikebreakers. The crew remained aboard and continued to do all their duties except cast off the lines. The California remained tied up for three days. Finally, United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins personally intervened in the SS California strike. Speaking to the crew by telephone, Perkins agreed to arrange a grievance hearing once the ship docked at its destination in New York City, and that there would be no reprisals by the company or government against the Curran and the strikers. During the SS California's return trip, the Panama Pacific Line raised wages by $5 a month to $60 per month. But Perkins was unable to follow through on her other promises. United States Secretary of Commerce Daniel Roper and the Panama Pacific Line declared Curran and the strikers mutineers. The line took out national advertising attacking Curran. When the ship docked, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents met the ship and began an investigation into the \\"mutiny\\". Curran and other top strike leaders were fined two days' pay, fired and blacklisted. Perkins was able to keep the strikers from being prosecuted for mutiny, however. Seaman all along the East Coast struck to protest the treatment of the SS California's crew. Curran became a leader of the 10-week strike, eventually forming a supportive association known as the Seamen's Defense Committee. Formation of NMU The SS California strike was only part of a worldwide wave of unrest among US seamen. A series of port and shipboard strikes broke out in 1936 and 1937 in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. In October 1936, Curran called another strike, the 1936 Gulf Coast maritime workers' strike, in part to improve working conditions and in part to embarrass the ISU. The four-month strike idled 50,000 seamen and 300 ships. Curran, believing it was time to abandon the conservative International Seamen's Union, began to sign up members for a new, rival union. The level of organizing was so intense that hundreds of ships delayed their sailing time as seamen listened to organizers and signed union cards.\\"C.I.O. Goes to Sea,\\" Time, 19 July 1937. In May 1937, Curran and other leaders of his nascent movement formed the National Maritime Union. The Seamen's Defense Committee reconstituted itself as a union. It held its first convention in July, and 30,000 seamen switched their membership from the ISU to the NMU. Curran was elected president of the new organization. Elected secretary-treasurer of the union was Jamaican-born Ferdinand Smith. Thus, from its inception NMU was racially integrated. Within six years, nearly all racial discrimination was eliminated in maritime hiring, wages, living accommodations and work assignments.Horne, Red Seas: Ferdinand Smith and Radical Black Sailors in the United States and Jamaica, 2005. Within a year, the NMU had more than 50,000 members, and most US shippers were under contract. Stripped of most of its membership, the ISU became almost moribund.

Javal is remembered for his studies of physiological optics and his work involving a disorder known as strabismus.  Academic background  Originally trained as a civil engineer, he switched to the medical profession, receiving his degree from the University of Paris in 1868. Following graduation, he traveled to Berlin, where he studied under Albrecht von Graefe (1828-1870). During the Franco-Prussian War he served as a medical officer. In 1878 he opened an ophthalmological laboratory at the Sorbonne and was its director until 1900. Like his father politically active, he represented the district of Yonne in the French Parliament from 1884 to 1889.  Contributions in ophthalmology  With his student Hjalmar August Schi√∏tz (1850-1927), he constructed an early keratometer, also known as the \\"Javal Schi√∂tz ophthalmometer\\". This device is used to measure the curvature of the corneal surface of the eye, as well as to determine the extent and axis of astigmatism. Javal also made important contributions in regards to the study of eye tracking, and with his assistant Marius Hans Erik Tscherning (1854-1939), he researched astigmatism and conducted studies in the field of optics. Javal described eye movements during reading in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye movement in the absence of technology. Javal's interest in strabismus was due to the disorder affecting his father and sister. Javal himself had heterochromia. At middle-age Javal developed glaucoma, and by 1900 was totally blind after suffering repeated attacks of acute angle-closure. He was a friend of Ludwik ≈Åazarz Zamenhof (1859-1917), the inventor of Esperanto, and he stressed the importance of learning this language by the blind. In addition, he was involved in social reform issues that included education and circumstances surrounding the poor. Today the \\"Louis Emile Javal Silver Service Distinction\\" is issued by the International Contact Lens Council of Ophthalmology. Javal died of stomach cancer and donated his left eye to histopathological research in England where, however, it got lost without a report being published.Rohrbach JM: Emile Javal (1839-1907) and his glaucoma blindness - a Life for Politics, Publishing, Vision Research, and Blind Fellow Men.

It went into full operation in 2014.\\"Administrative Report: Kean University To Open The First American University In China\\", Administrative Report ; Union, New Jersey; June 12, 2006. Wenzhou-Kean University would have been China‚Äôs first full-scale American-style university in 2007, but the plans became caught up in red tape by the Chinese central government.Centenary College closes satellite schools in China, Taiwan after finding rampant cheating, accessed July 25, 2010. In December 2011, the Chinese government ultimately approved Kean University‚Äôs preliminary plans to establish a degree-granting branch campus in Zhejiang Province. The branch campus will begin as a three-year pilot program between Kean and Wenzhou University, with Chinese provincial and municipal governments funding the construction and operation. The Chinese Ministry of Education authorized an investment of 1.5 billion Chinese yuan ‚Äî the equivalent of about $236 million ‚Äî for the project. Meanwhile, Kean maintains academic control of the campus, making all curriculum and hiring decisions., accessed January 10, 2012. History Kean University started building ties with the country in 1998, when the university enrolled close to 200 public officials, mostly from Zhejiang Province, in a Kean master's degree program in public administration. Over the years, Kean staff members have visited China 10 times, with President Dawood Farahi making two visits himself. The City of Wenzhou, Wenzhou University and Zhejiang Province selected Kean University as its partner because of that longstanding relationship. Two classes each of 25 Wenzhou officials traveled to Kean University since then and spent 15 months earning Master of Public Administration degrees. These same officials had risen in government positions in the province and reached out to Kean to establish the full University campus in Wenzhou. On May 8, 2006 Kean University President Dawood Farahi and a Chinese education department official signed the documents that would permit the construction of Kean University in China at a formal ceremony on Kean's Union Township campus. They were surrounded by high-ranking Communist Party officials from Zhejiang, the province where Kean University- Wenzhou would have been located. Wenzhou-Kean University is a Chinese-American jointly established higher education institution with independent legal person status and limited liabilities. On November 16, 2011, the Ministry of Education of the People‚Äôs Republic of China approved the application of preparation on establishing Wenzhou-Kean University that is cooperatively run by Wenzhou University and Kean University USA. On December 16, 2013, the Ministry of Education Panel led by Prof. HUANG Wei, the Academician from Chinese Academy of Sciences inspected and reviewed the application works for the establishment of the University. Campus and Academics Set on approximately 300 acres in a rural, mountainous region in Wenzhou, the campus was designed with an American-style concept, offering students, staff and visitors a true, authentic American experience. The campus was divided into three primary zones, with an academic section at the center. A Cultural/Retail/Housing zone will be located on the left and to the outside of this section. A Residential/Athletic/Recreational zone will then wrap above these two areas. Kean plans to enroll some 150 students in the first year of Wenzhou-Kean University in 2012 to work out start-up problems and get approvals from Kean‚Äôs accrediting body and New Jersey. Enrollment is expected to reach 5,000 full-time students by Fall 2016. Classes are taught in English by Kean University professors and also those who were recruited from other English-speaking countries, and students will earn degrees from Kean. The initial programs Kean would offer include finance, accounting, international business, English and computer science, according to the agreement between Kean and Wenzhou. All classes are taught in English with all accreditation standards being held to those established by the Middle States Accreditation body, and students will earn degrees issued by Kean University. Kean University supplies all academic personnel, programs and course materials. Students enrolled at Wenzhou-Kean University will have access to the same digital resources as Kean students in the U.S. by logging into a portal with their student ID. Kean students will also have opportunities to study in China while paying only the in-state tuition and fees they would pay if residing in New Jersey. Wenzhou-Kean University (WKU) had 204 students enrolled in 2012 and has over 800 students enrolled today. Most of the current students are from China's Zhejiang Province. WKU offers 7 majors including English, Computer Science, Finance, Accounting, Graph Design, Marketing, and Global Business. WKU also recruits students who reside outside of Zhejiang Province, (including, as of Fall 2016, in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao). From November 2014 to December 2017 the Division of Academic Affairs was led by the Vice- Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Dr. Holger Henke. During that time several new majors were rolled out, various student support services implemented, and the student body grew from 850 to ca. 1,950. Finances The construction project and all costs of operating the University will be paid for through tuition and financing provided by the municipal and provincial governments in China. There will be no cost to Kean University or the state of New Jersey. After the fourth year of operation, between 5 percent and 10 percent of annual revenue from tuition will be invested in curriculum development, program updates and instructional innovation, according to the agreement. English Immersion Program This intensive immersion program is designed to provide a competitive advantage to gifted and talented undergraduate and graduate students who plan to enter a higher education institution where the language of instruction is English. Many international students have difficulty with English, particularly as it relates to their chosen field of study. And even when they have sufficiently mastered the language, there are still social and cultural differences to deal with. The course of study begins by focusing on both enunciation and pronunciation, followed by public speaking training using specially structured interactive exercises. There are daily short writing assignments which receive both peer and faculty feedback. Each group of about ten students regularly works with a mentor to ensure that only English is being used. Primary instruction is provided by faculty with experience and expertise in ELT. Academic credits earned are eligible for transfer to any accredited US institution or to affiliated partners. Upon completion of the program, students will be well prepared to face the challenges of academic life in whichever university they choose.

Beginning as an essay, it discusses the narrator's self-destructive impulses, embodied as the symbolic metaphor of The Imp of the Perverse. The narrator describes this spirit as the agent that tempts a person to do things \\"merely because we feel we should not.\\" Plot summary The narrator explains at length his theory on \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\", which he believes causes people to commit acts against their self-interest. This essay- like discussion is presented objectively, though the narrator admits that he is \\"one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse\\".Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 114. He then explains how his conviction for murder was the result of this. The narrator begins his story by explaining how he murdered a man using a candle that emitted a poisonous vapor: The victim enjoyed reading in bed at night and, using the candle for illumination, dies in his poorly ventilated room. No evidence is left behind, causing the coroner to believe the man's death is an act of God. The narrator inherits the man's estate and, knowing he can never be caught, enjoys the benefits of his murderous act for many years. The narrator remains unsuspected, though he occasionally reassures himself by repeating under his breath, \\"I am safe\\". One day, he notes that he will remain safe only if he is not foolish enough to openly confess. In saying so, however, he begins to question if he is capable of confessing, and is beginning to feel overpowered by a sudden urge to confess to the murder. He fearfully runs through the streets, arousing suspicion. When finally stopped, he feels struck by some \\"invisible fiend\\". He reveals his secret with \\"distinct enunciation\\", though in such a hurry as if afraid of being interrupted. He is quickly tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Analysis \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\" begins as an essay rather than as a work of fiction, a format that Poe previously used in \\"The Premature Burial\\".Peeples, Scott. Edgar Allan Poe Revisited. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1998: 147. It is, therefore, less about plot and more about theory.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 58. As Poe describes this theory: The work theorizes that all people have self-destructive tendencies, including the narrator. The narrator's ultimate confession as a murderer is not inspired by any feelings of guilt but, instead, from an overwhelming desire to publicize his actions despite knowing that he should not. The story may have been inspired by John Neal's, \\"Idiosyncracies,\\" a short story similar to Poe's published two years earlier in Brother Jonathan.Lease, Benjamin. That Wild Fellow John Neal and the American Literary Revolution. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, 1972: 174. Poe's theory of the Imp of the Perverse may also be an early notion of the subconscious and repression which would not be fully theorized until Sigmund Freud.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge, La.: Louisiana State University Press, 1998: 12. Many of Poe's characters display a failure to resist the Imp of the Perverse‚Äîincluding the murderer in \\"The Black Cat\\" and the narrator in \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\".Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 113. The opposite of this impulse is seen in Poe's character C. Auguste Dupin who exhibits reason and deep analysis.Hutchisson, James M. Poe. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2005: 202. One of the earliest examples, which predates \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\", was in Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. In one scene, the title character is overcome by an overwhelming desire to let himself fall off a steep cliff.Peeples, Scott. Edgar Allan Poe Revisited. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1998: 57. Additionally, scholars and critics suggest that Poe had his own Imp of the Perverse. Poe biographer Jeffrey Meyers suggested that Poe wrote it to justify his own actions of self-torment and self-destruction. James M. Hutchisson says that the work reflects Poe's jealousy and sense of betrayal that led to his public feud with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and New England literary culture; the so-called \\"Longfellow War\\" was occurring at the same time Poe wrote \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\".Hutchisson, James M. Poe. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2005: 201. Three months after the story was published, Poe lashed out against Boston's literary circle by trying to hoax them by reading his obscure poem \\"Al Aaraaf\\" at a lecture. Biographer Daniel Stashower suggests Poe's purposeful attempt to provoke his audience and alienate himself further was inspired by his Imp of the Perverse.Stashower, Daniel. The Beautiful Cigar Girl: Mary Rogers, Edgar Allan Poe, and the Invention of Murder. New York: Dutton, 2006: 274. Publication history \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\" was first published in the July 1845 issue of Graham's Magazine. A slightly revised version appeared in the Boston-based gift book May-Flower for 1846.Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809‚Äì1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 571. Critical response Poe reported in the Broadway Journal in December 1845 that the Nassau Monthly at Princeton College harshly criticized \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\". Calling it a \\"humbug\\", the reviewer noted that the author's line of reasoning about this philosophical idea was difficult to follow. \\"He chases from the wilderness of phrenology into that of transcendentalism, then into that of metaphysics generally; then through many weary pages into the open field of inductive philosophy, where he at last corners the poor thing, and then most unmercifully pokes it to death with a long stick.\\"Thomas, Dwight & David K.

His political cartoons often appear in a multi-panel comic-strip format and frequently blend comic-strip and editorial-cartoon conventions. The cartoons used to appear in approximately 100 newspapers around the United States. He was president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists from 2008 to 2009. Rall draws three editorial cartoons a week for syndication, draws illustrations on a freelance basis, writes a weekly syndicated column, and edits the Attitude series of alternative cartooning anthologies and spin-off collections by up- and-coming cartoonists. He writes and draws cartoons for the tech and politics news site founded by journalist Gina Smith, aNewDomain, and is the editor-in- chief of the satirical news website skewednews.net. Rall also writes and draws cartoons for Sputnik International, a news website platform established by the Russian government-owned news agency Rossiya Segodnya. He is a graphic novelist and the author of non-fiction books about domestic and international current affairs. He also travels to and writes about Central Asia, a region he believes to be pivotal to U.S. foreign policy concerns. In November 2001 he went to Afghanistan as a war correspondent for The Village Voice and KFI Radio in Los Angeles. He returned to Afghanistan in August 2010, traveling independently and unembedded throughout the country, filing daily \\"cartoon blogs\\" by satellite. Early life and education Frederick Theodore Rall III was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1963, and raised in Kettering, Ohio, near Dayton. He graduated from Fairmont West High School, in 1981. From 1981 to 1984, Rall attended Columbia University's engineering school, where he contributed cartoons to the campus newspapers, including the Columbia Daily Spectator, Barnard Bulletin, and the Jester. He failed to complete his studies in the engineering school, where he majored in applied physics and nuclear engineering, but returned to graduate several years later from Columbia's School of General Studies in 1991 with a bachelor of arts, with honors, in history. Career Rall says his drawing style was originally influenced by Mike Peters, the editorial cartoonist at his hometown paper, the Dayton Daily News. Later influences included Jules Feiffer, Garry Trudeau, Charles M. Schulz, and Matt Groening. Rall's 1990s work focused on the issues and concerns surrounding twentysomethings and Generation X, terms coined in the late 1980s to describe people born from the early to mid 1960s to the mid 1980s. While living in San Francisco Rall met Dave Eggers, who hired him as a contributing editor and writer for Might magazine, a publication Eggers edited and co-founded. Among other essays, Rall authored two seminal essays for Might, \\"Confessions of an Investment Banker\\" and \\"College is for Suckers.\\" He wrote op/ed columns for The New York Times, including \\"Why I Will Not Vote\\" (1994), which justified apathy among Generation Xers who saw neither Democrats nor Republicans responding to their concerns. In 1998 Rall published \\"Revenge of the Latchkey Kids\\", a compendium of essays and cartoons that criticized the Baby Boomer-dominated media for ignoring and ridiculing young adults and their achievements. Rall's cartoons have been handled by San Francisco Chronicle Features, no longer in business, and ‚Äî since 1996 ‚Äî by Universal Press Syndicate.Biography on the Ted Rail website Rall's cartoons have appeared regularly in Rolling Stone, Time, Fortune and Men's Health magazines, as well as Mad magazine (for which he also wrote) and were for several years the most reproduced cartoons in The New York Times. Rall began frequent travels to Central Asia in 1997, when he attempted to drive the Silk Road from Beijing to Istanbul via China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan as a staff writer for P.O.V. magazine. P.O.V. published his adventures as Silk Road to Ruin, a title he used for his 2006 collection of essays and cartoons about Central Asia. Rall returned to the region for POV in 1999 to travel the Karakoram Highway from Kashgar, in western China, to Islamabad. Subsequent trips included two trips in 2000, \\"Stan Trek 2000\\"‚Äîin which Rall brought along 23 listeners to his radio show for a bus journey from Turkmenistan to Kyrgyzstan via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan‚Äîand a U.S. State Department-sponsored visit to Turkmenistan, where he met with Turkmen college students and dissidents to explain the nature of free press in a democracy. A 2002 assignment for Gear magazine to cover the world championships of buzkashi in Tajikistan was not published due to the magazine's going out of business, but turned up in an edited form in Silk Road to Ruin. He returned to Tajikistan, Xinjiang Province in western China and Pakistan during the summer of 2007. The Attitude: The New Subversive Cartoonists series of books is a series of anthologies of alternative comics edited by Rall. Frustrated that cartoons prevalent in alternative weekly newspapers were being ignored in favor of mainstream and art comics, Rall edited the first \\"Attitude\\" anthology, Attitude: The New Subversive Political Cartoonists, in 2002, with its mission to bring together cartoonists who were \\"too alternative for the mainstream and too mainstream for the alternative.\\" Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists followed in 2004, and in 2006 Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists appeared. Each volume contains interviews with, cartoons by and personal ephemera related to 21 different cartoon creators. The first and second volumes emphasized political and humor cartoons; the third volume exclusively features web cartoonists. Rall also edited three cartoons collections by Andy Singer, Neil Swaab, and Stephanie McMillan under the name \\"Attitude Presents:\\". From 2006 to 2009, Rall was Editor of Acquisitions and Development at the comic strip syndicate United Media. While there, he helped bring to syndication Keith Knight's The Knight Life, Signe Wilkinson's Family Tree, Tak Toyoshima's Secret Asian Man, Dan Thompson's Rip Haywire, and Richard Stevens' Diesel Sweeties.MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Universal Uclick to syndicate United's comic strips,\\" The Beat (February 24, 2011). Rall's work includes the book The Anti-American Manifesto (Seven Stories Press), published in September 2010. His book, The Book of Obama: From Hope and Change to the Age of Revolt (Seven Stories Press) was released in July 2012. =Other media= Rall was a regular guest on Hannity & Colmes, as well as NPR. He contributes a cartoon called \\"Left Coast\\" to the Pasadena Weekly. In February 2005, BBC television broadcast a 30-minute profile of Rall as part of their series Cartoonists on the Front Line. Rall maintains a blogTed Rall Blog , Rall.com at his website. Rall released a series of animated political cartoons on his website and on YouTube in collaboration with David Essman.tedralltoons channel, YouTube Rall had a Saturday and Sunday radio talk show on KFI radio in Los Angeles from August 1998 to August 2000. After 9/11, KFI brought him back to travel to Afghanistan and file live on-air reports from the battle of Kunduz and elsewhere in northern Afghanistan. Rall's show was also broadcast live from Havana as well as Pakistani-held Kashmir. In 2005 he had a weekend show on San Francisco's KIFR-FM. Rall has been a frequent guest on National Public Radio, the BBC and Fox Radio. Politics A panel from a Ted Rall cartoon satirizing Antonin Scalia's remark that he saw nothing wrong with \\"slapping\\" terrorism suspects. In 2009 Rall called for Barack Obama to resign as President of the United States, because \\"the gap between the soaring expectations that accompanied Barack Obama's inauguration and his wretched performance is the broadest such chasm in recent historical memory.

The King of Comix, The Village Voice, July 27, 1999 accusing Maus creator Art Spiegelman of lacking talent and controlling who gets high- profile assignments from magazines such as The New Yorker through personal connections, including his wife, a New Yorker editor. In retaliation for Rall's piece, New York Press illustrator Danny Hellman sent two sets of e-mails under Rall's name to at least 35 cartoonists and editors, including Rall's employers. After Rall tracked down Hellman's identity, Hellman ignored Rall's cease-and-desist letters. After several weeks, Rall filed a $1.5-million lawsuit for libel per se, libel per quod, injurious falsehood, violation of civil rights, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rall's suit stated that Hellman was attempting to sabotage his career. Four of Rall's five claims were dismissed, leaving libel per se.Dean, Michael. Danse Macabre: Another Date for Ted Rall and Danny Hellman, The Comics Journal. The lawsuit remains unresolved. In a Rall cartoon from May 3, 2004, Pat Tillman (a former Arizona Cardinals player who abandoned his NFL career to enlist in the United States Army Rangers and was killed in Afghanistan) is depicted asking an Army recruiter, \\"Never mind the fine print. Will I get to kill Arabs?\\" The narrator points out that he was killed and the reader is then given a choice: \\"idiot,\\" \\"sap,\\" or \\"hero.\\" Later, after Tillman's anti‚ÄìIraq War sentiments and the friendly fire circumstances of his death became public, Rall wrote that he regretted making such sweeping assumptions about Tillman's motives, describing Tillman as \\"one hell of an interesting human being.\\" A November 8, 2004, cartoon depicted mentally disabled children as classroom teachers in an attempt to make an analogy to American voters who reelected Bush, drawing complaints from advocates for the disabled and led to his cartoons being dropped from The Washington Posts website. Rall responded in his blog saying: \\"I regret hurting people who I have nothing against. I do want to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, and I think I failed in that with this cartoon. Not to mention that the cartoon failed‚Äîtoo many people got bogged down in the analogy and the main point got lost.\\" On October 22, 2007, Rall published a cartoon saying \\"Over time, however, the endless war in Iraq began to play a role in natural selection. Only idiots signed up; only idiots died. Back home, the average I.Q. soared.\\" That caused an uproar by military supporters both conservative and liberal alike. Rall is listed at #15 in Bernard Goldberg's book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America as a \\"vicious, conspiracy-minded, hate-filled jerk\\". Rall perceived the listing as an honor, replying, \\"Not only am I grouped with many people whom I admire for their achievements and patriotism, I'm being demonized by McCarthyite thugs I despise.\\" Rall solicited funds from readers and left-wing bloggers while considering whether to sue Ann Coulter for libel and slander for her (later self-described as \\"joking\\") statement that, \\"Iran is soliciting cartoons on the Holocaust. So far, only Ted Rall, Garry Trudeau, and The New York Times have made submissions.\\" Coulter first made the remark at the 2006 Conservative Political Action Conference meeting in Washington, D.C. on February 10 and then printed it in her syndicated column the following week. By 18 days later, pledges totaled over $21,000. However, pledges are no longer being solicited, and in a December 27, 2006 blog entry, Rall posted an email that was sent to pledged contributors to the lawsuit, stating that his attorneys had determined, \\"The road ahead is too uncertain to justify spending thousands of dollars of pledges, not to mention my own money\\". =Dismissal from the Los Angeles Times= In July 2015, the Los Angeles Times released a \\"note to readers\\" stating that Rall had been dropped from the paper because of allegations that he had lied about a police encounter in 2001.\\"Editor's Note: a note to readers\\", Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2015. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) claimed that Rall misrepresented the encounter in a May 2015 opinion blog post he wrote about enforcement of jaywalking laws in Los Angeles.Ted Rall, \\"LAPD's crosswalk crackdown: Don't police have something better to do?\\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 2015. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, whom Rall had repeatedly mocked in his cartoons for the LA Times, provided a copy of an audio recording of the encounter (the location of the original microcassette, and whether it still exists, remains unknown) that the LA Times found to \\"raise serious questions about the accuracy of Rall's blog post\\". The LA Times told readers the source was the LAPD, protecting Beck's anonymity despite the newspaper's ethics policies, which prohibit the use of anonymous sources. Rall stood by his version of the incident.\\"Cartoonist Ousted By Los Angeles Times Speaks Out\\", KCBS-TV, July 29, 2015. Another version of the recording, which Rall posted online after having it restored by sound engineers, included sounds of bystanders talking.

On August 19, the LA Times issued a lengthy statement reaffirming its conclusion that Rall's original blog post \\"did not meet its standards\\". In it, they reported they had the audio recording investigated by two audio and video forensics experts and it still did not support Rall's version of the event.\\"Times reaffirms decision that Ted Rall's blog post did not meet its standards\\", Los Angeles Times, August 19, 2015.

The journal was established by Jan Jindy Pettman (Australian National University) in 1999. In 2020, the editors-in-chief are Brooke Ackerly (Vanderbilt University), Elisabeth Jay Friedman (University of San Francisco), Krishna Menon (Ambedkar University Delhi), and Marysia Zalewski (Cardiff University). Past editors include Heidi Hudson (University of the Free State), Laura Sjoberg (University of Florida), and Cynthia Weber (University of Sussex). The journal is published by Taylor and Francis.  Origins  Gender as a subject of analysis noticeably increased in the mid-1990s in the study of international relations. At this time there was a significant focus on the ways in which conceptions of gender influenced language, policies, and processes occupying the international arena. The creation of the journal was a result of this feminist thinking building up in the areas of international politics. Key conferences that were a factor in perpetuating these ideals were the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women. At the 1996 meeting of the International Studies Association, Routledge representatives approached members of the Feminist Theory and Gender Studies section (FTGS) with the idea of a feminist journal, modeled on the recently launched journal, Feminist Economics. The establishment of the journal was a collaborative effort headed by Jan Jindy Pettman in 1999. The editorial board was envisioned to be culturally diverse, featuring scholars in different cultural and ethnicity groups with a wide range of geographic representation.  Indexing  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 0.970, ranking it 67th out of 161 journals in the category \\"Political Science\\" and 19th out of 40 journals in the category \\"Women's Studies\\".

As a young university medical student in Leon in the 1970s, T√©llez was recruited by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). T√©llez went on to become a comandante in the popular revolt to oust the Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In the subsequent FSLN government, she served as Health Minister and has also been an advocate for women's rights. She ultimately became a critic of repression and corruption under FSLN President Daniel Ortega and left the party to found the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS).  Operation Chanchera  As \\"Commander Two\\", at age 22, she was third in command in Operation Chanchera, on August 22, 1978 that occupied the Nicaraguan National Palace in Managua, where the Nicaraguan National Assembly was in session. The revolutionaries captured 1,500 civilian hostages and threatened their lives unless their demands were met. The demands included a prisoner release and a monetary ransom. There was a subsequent release of key Sandinista political prisoners and a million- dollar ransom payment, which T√©llez played a role in negotiating. This event revealed the potential vulnerability of the Somoza regime and helped the FSLN win support from Latin American governments and unite and mobilize diverse factions of the opposition to the regime. Following the operation, thousands of youths and women joined the Sandinista movement. A popular insurrection grew along with the FSLN and contributed to the fall of the Somoza regime on July 19, 1979. Military commander during the Nicaraguan Civil War Upon her arrival in Panama with the released Sandinistas in August 1978, T√©llez trained in Cuba and Panama to become a military commander. In February 1979 she was back fighting in Nicaragua and she went on to establish a place in the Tercerista leadership structure. For five months she led Sandinista platoons throughout the country in skirmishes with the Nicaraguan National Guard: first in the Southern Front with Ed√©n Pastora's forces, and later in Central and northern Nicaragua. According to Sandinista Commander M√≥nica Baltodano, her raids on the northern provinces in conjunction with Cmdr. Finally, she led the Sandinista units fighting the enemy's elite forces block by block for six consecutive weeks until they captured the city of Le√≥n in June 1979, the first major city to fall to the Sandinistas in the Revolution, followed by Managua two weeks later. This was followed by the Sandinista Provisional Government Junta's installation in this city soon after. Public service in the Sandinista Movement An increase in government repression and rise of political prisoners being taken prompted T√©llez to go underground in 1976. While underground she did educational work in the mountains. She later served as Minister of Health in the first Sandinista administration. The administration's public health campaign that won Nicaragua the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's prize for exceptional health progress. Specifically, T√©llez has been quoted discussing the specific health inequalities present in the mining industry in Nicaragua. Within the Sandinista government, T√©llez held positions alongside religious figures to advocate for gay and lesbian rights, as well as reproductive rights for women in Nicaragua. Political career Early experience within the FSLN political party included T√©llez's position as the Political Secretary for Managua. T√©llez also served as a member of the Council of the State. The first congress of the FSLN had an election in 1990 which prompted discontent regarding the election process; however the Directorate decided that the election of a new body would nevertheless be done so by slate rather than voting for individual members. This stunted the potential political candidacy of T√©llez, who was being supported by many rank-and-file members. T√©llez would have been the Directorate's first female member. In 1995 T√©llez founded the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) after resigning her seat in the FSLN. Other former Sandinistas such as Ernesto Cardenal and Sergio Ram√≠rez have joined the MRS political party. The MRS political party opposed the current corruption in the Nicaraguan government and appointed Herty Lewites to run as the party's candidate in the 2006 presidential election against Daniel Ortega. Four months before the election was to be held, Lewites died of natural causes. Ortega, who was president from 1985 to 1990, won the presidential election and regained political power in Nicaragua. On June 4, 2008, T√©llez began a hunger strike to protest the \\"dictatorship of Daniel Ortega\\", her former comrade-in- arms. Ortega and his supporters stripped the MRS of its legal status about one week later. T√©llez suspended her hunger strike on June 16, after doctors told her she would suffer irreparable damage if she continued her fast. She vowed to begin \\"a new stage of struggle\\" against what she termed the dictatorial policies of Daniel Ortega. Academic life as a historian T√©llez wrote publications on Nicaraguan history that underscore the importance of the north-central region of the country to the nation's political and economic history. In 2004 she was appointed Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professor in Latin American studies at the Harvard Divinity School, but was barred from obtaining an entry visa to the US under the Patriot Act, on grounds that she was a terrorist, citing as evidence the raid on the Nicaraguan National Palace in Managua. This prompted 122 members of the academic community from Harvard and 15 other North American universities to publish a statement in her defense, stating:  References   External links  * Global Feminisms Project: Nicaragua Category:1955 births Category:Nicaraguan revolutionaries Category:Living people Category:Latin Americanists Category:Sandinista National Liberation Front politicians Category:Sandinista Renovation Movement politicians Category:Women in war in Central America Category:Nicaraguan women in politics Category:People of the Nicaraguan Revolution Category:Women in warfare post-1945 Category:20th-century women politicians Category:Nicaraguan historians Category:Women historians ","title":"Dora Mar√≠a T√©llez"},{"id":"9512035","text":"Keshabpur () is an Upazila of Jessore District in the Division of Khulna, Bangladesh.

It is operated by the University of Iowa and is a member of Iowa Public Radio's news network. Its signal serves most of eastern Iowa. WSUI is one of two National Public Radio member stations in the region, along with 90.9 KUNI in Cedar Falls. WSUI's sister station is classical music outlet 91.7 KSUI. WSUI's studios and offices are on Grand Avenue in Des Moines.IowaPublicRadio.org/contact-us The transmitter is off Sand Road SE in Hills, Iowa.Radio-Locator.com/WSUI History =Experimental Years= WSUI got its start in 1911, prior to the era of broadcast radio, operating a \\"wireless telegraph\\" transmitter under the experimental radio call sign 9YA. It began airing voice broadcasts in 1919, and was granted a full license on June 26, 1922, originally as WHAA. WSUI may be the oldest educational station west of the Mississippi River. It was one of several AM stations opened by Midwestern universities in the early days of radio, along with Iowa State University's WOI, which also began Morse code transmissions in 1911, the University of Minnesota's KUOM and St. Louis University's WEW in 1912 and the University of Wisconsin's WHA in 1915. The station's call sign, 9YA (the \\"Y\\" in the call sign indicating operation under a Technical and Training School license) was in use by the State University of Iowa--now the University of Iowa--since 1915, starting sometime after the installation of the university's first Morse code transmitter in 1913. As of 1916 university electrical engineering students were operating a 2,000 watt spark gap transmitter at a 750-meter wavelength that could be heard 1000 miles away, with two-way communications taking place within a 500-mile radius. The station aired 300-word lessons on a regular schedule that dealt with wireless communication. =Early Sound Broadcasts= Carl Menzer, whose interest in wireless began at his high school in Lone Tree, entered the State University of Iowa as a freshman in 1917, and later became station director for WHAA/WSUI, a position he held until his retirement in 1968. After the World War I moratorium on radio transmission was lifted in 1919, Menzer brought vacuum tube technology to 9YA, signaling the start of regularly scheduled voice and music broadcasts. The first ‚Äúradio telephone‚Äù station, built using two donated experimental vacuum tubes, required use of two microphones for voice and for pickup of a windup phonograph. The microphones were swapped frequently when the one in use became too hot to touch due to high current. In spite of audio quality and technical issues, the station gained a following among a collection of crystal radio enthusiasts. Within two years it had inspired sufficient interest to cause State University of Iowa President Walter A. Jessup and other educators to envision the feasibility of advanced study in broadcasting. That led to an application for a university broadcast license. On June 26, 1922, the call letters WHAA were assigned. By the end of September, test transmissions were complete, and on October 17, 1922, the station was officially on the air. A gala on-air commemoration included a talk by President Jessup. =Switch to WSUI= WHAA changed its call letters to WSUI in 1925. WSUI represents the initials of State University of Iowa, the legal name of the University of Iowa. New radio stations in Iowa today have call signs beginning with a K. In the earliest days of broadcasting, stations in Iowa, such as WHO Des Moines and WOI in Ames, were given call letters starting with a W. In 1923, the boundary between K and W stations moved from the western border of Nebraska and South Dakota to the Mississippi River, putting Iowa in K territory. Despite this change, stations in Iowa that already had W call signs were apparently allowed to request new ones: besides WSUI, WJAM became WMT in 1928, and WKBB became WDBQ in 1952. WSUI was a charter member when National Public Radio first began in 1971. It was one of the 90 stations to carry the inaugural broadcast of All Things Considered, NPR's signature afternoon news program. It also served as a source of NPR programming for the Quad Cities until that area got its own public radio station, 90.3 WVIK, in 1980. =Studios and Transmitter= WSUI's studios were located for many years in the university's Engineering Building. They were relocated to a former supermarket building, just south of the campus, in the late 1990s, when expansion of the College of Engineering required WSUI and KSUI to vacate their space. The studios are now located in an office building on Grand Avenue, west of the campus. WSUI's original three self-supporting broadcast towers were located just west of Mormon Trek Boulevard on the far west side of the campus. On June 29, 1998, a fierce line of thunderstorms packing winds of nearly 100 miles-per-hour toppled two of the towers. For months afterwards, WSUI's nighttime power output from the single remaining tower was limited to 1,250 watts non-directional. Today, the towers are located about 10 miles south of Iowa City, in the community of Hills. A single tower is used during the day, when the station has a non-directional signal. Due to the transmitter's power, as well as Iowa's flat land, with near-perfect soil conductivity, its daytime signal covers almost all of eastern Iowa and part of western Illinois. Power is fed to all three towers in a directional array at night to protect WLS in Chicago at nearby 890 AM, concentrating WSUI's signal northward toward the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City areas. =Notable alumni= WSUI alumni include Harry Kalas, who served as Sports Director for the campus radio station WSUI and did play-by-play for all types of sports. Kalas received baseball broadcasting's highest honor‚Äîthe Ford Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame. =Early television= Iowa is a pioneer in educational broadcasting. It is home to two of the oldest educational broadcast stations in the world, the University of Iowa's WSUI and Iowa State University's 640 WOI. In 1933, The University of Iowa experimental TV station W9XK, later W9XUI, provided twice a week video programming, with WSUI providing the audio channel. By 1941, the FCC allocated TV channels 1 and 12 for the W9XUI television station. This early attempt at educational broadcasting ended with US entrance into World War II. The concept of pure educational television, which Dr. E.B. Kurtz and his Iowa colleagues pioneered, was buried by the commercial television system which dominated development of the electronic media in Iowa after World War II. Although the University of Iowa applied for a construction permit for station WSUI-TV on channel 11 in February 1948, it was not granted before the FCC halted the issuance of any new permits eight months later in the Freeze of 1948. In 1951, the university supported the reallocation of channel 11 to Des Moines for an educational television station there, and its own permit does not appear in any further records. Iowa Public Television's KIIN-TV (channel 12) signed on in 1970, returning educational television to the area.

The unit is geographically-separated from its supporting unit, the Missouri Air National Guard's 131st Bomb Wing. Mission The 157 Air Operations Group responds to operational requirements within the Headquarters Pacific Air Forces (HQ PACAF) area of responsibility, which covers an area from the east coast of Africa to the west coast of the Americas. Operations The group mans an Air Operations Center (AOC), the senior element of the Theater Air Control System using the AN/USQ-163 Falconer. An AOC is the command and control center that plans, executes and assesses aerospace operations during a contingency or conflict. The AOC plans and executes missions by theater aerospace forces for Joint Forces Air Component Commanders.When a Commander, Air Force Forces is also the Joint Forces Air Component Commander in a theater, the AOC is also the Joint Air Operations Center. In cases of multinational operations, the AOC becomes a Combined Aerospace Operations Center. The AOC enables Joint Forces Air Component Commanders to exercise command and control of aerospace forces in support of a Joint Force Commander. An AOC consists of a large number of related systems which interoperate to plan, conduct, and monitor the air and space war. History =World War II= The 157th Air Operations Group was first organized in the Signal Corps on 15 January 1944 as the 582d Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion. The battalion served in the Mediterranean and European Theater of Operations as an element of Twelfth and Ninth Air Forces. The battalion was organized in Italy, primarily from elements of the provisional 2691 Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion (Mobile) and 732d through 734th Signal Aircraft Warning Companies that had been attached to it, which were simultaneously disbanded. The battalion operations were conducted by radar operating detachments, which frequently moved. Elements of the battalion participated in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. Following V-E Day, the battalion remained in Germany as part of the occupation forces until it was inactivate, along with its component companies, on 7 November 1945. This was a period of personnel turmoil, with most experienced members of the unit being transferred to other units for return to the United States, being replaced by \\"low point\\" men who were late arrivals to the theater. On 22 October, the battalion was reduced to nominal strength of one officer and one airman, who were transferred to the 555th Signal Aircraft Warning Battalion when the 582d was inactivated. =Air National Guard= The battalion was converted to the Air Corps, redesignated the 157th Aircraft Control and Warning Group and allotted to the National Guard in May 1946. It was organized in the Missouri National Guard later that year, but did not receive federal recognition until 1948.

In North America, though a small number of draft horses are also shown under saddle, the term \\"Draft horse showing\\" refers to a specific horse show competition that primarily features driving exhibitors presenting their horses to be judged in harness. Worldwide, some draft horse shows also feature riding classes. The driving events at these competitions are somewhat akin to fine harness classes at horse shows for light horses, though the four horse and larger hitch classes also resemble some aspects of combined driving. Draft horse shows are different from draft horse pulling competitions, where teams of horses compete to determine who can pull the most weight. Driving Competitions Clydesdale horses participate in a heavy horse turnout challenge in the UK. Exhibitors of these classes must follow a pattern for each class in which they participate. The pattern is the same for every class. The hitches enter the arena one at a time, following one another. They travel to the right, along the rail in a counter-clockwise direction. A hitch is a unit consisting of the exhibitor, his or her horse(s) and vehicle, being a cart or wagon. The judge is observing each hitch from the middle of the ring where he or she is standing. All of the hitches make a few laps in this counter-clockwise direction and then reverse. A lap is completed when a hitch travels the entire way around the arena next to the rail. When the reverse is made, the hitches diagonally cut the ring in half in order to go the opposite direction. This allows the judge to see the other side of each hitch. A couple more laps are made going in this clockwise direction. While making these laps on the rail, the horses are trotting and usually asked to walk for a few steps only once during the entire class. Next, all of the hitches line up, coming to a complete stop in the middle of the ring, all facing the same direction. The judge then looks at each hitch individually and has them back up. This requires the driver of each hitch to direct his or her horse(s) to back either the cart or wagon a few feet, stop, and then step forward to the original position. Finally, the judge places all of the hitches in the order of his or her preference. Types of classes =United States and Canada= The main classes in a show exclusively for draft horses are limited to driving competition, and generally include the following: * Ladies' Cart‚ÄîOne horse driven in a cart by a woman * Men‚Äôs Cart‚ÄîOne horse driven in a cart by a man * Team -- Two horses hitched side by side on a show wagon, driven by a man or woman * Tandem‚ÄîTwo horses hitched with one lead horse directly in front of one wheel horse, driven by a man or woman in a cart. Considered an unsafe hitch by many drivers, since the tendency for the lead horse to turn around and face the wheel horse. * Unicorn‚ÄîThree horses hitched as a team with one horse in front of the team, driven by a man or woman * Four‚ÄîFour horses hitched as two teams, one pair in front of the other, driven by a man or woman * Six -- Six horses hitched as three teams, one in front of another, driven by a man or woman * Eight‚ÄîEight horses hitched as four teams, one in front of another, driven by a man or woman \\"Breeding\\" or \\"Halter\\" classes are also offered at many shows. These classes evaluate the conformation of the animals. In the United States and Canada, the breeds of draft horses shown, include: * Belgian * Percheron * Clydesdale * Shire * Suffolk Punch * American Cream Draft Horse * Spotted Draft Horse Belgians, Percherons and Clydesdales tend to be the dominant breeds seen at North American draft horse shows. The cost of a draft horse depends on the level of competition at which an exhibitor would like to compete. If an exhibitor would like to compete at the highest level, receiving first place honors at the toughest shows, a great horse could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000, with the most expensive horse sold at public auction costing $112,500. A draft horse shown as a hobby and competing only at local or county fairs would start at approximately $1,000. A harness exhibitor uses appropriate equipment for driving, beginning with a truck and trailer to haul the draft horses to the show. A show harness, a show wagon, and a show cart must be purchased as well. These three items are only used in the arena while a hitch is performing. Another set of work harness and a practice wagon is used at home for training. Along with the costly equipment, decorations that are put up at the draft horse shows and miscellaneous tack items must also be obtained. A hitch is judged the moment it enters the arena. Usually, there is only one judge for all the hitches in an entire horse show, and it is usually a different judge than the halter classes. The hitches are judged on a variety of aspects including physical conditioning of the horses, conformation, hoof size, cleanliness and quality of turnout, movement of the horses, quality of action, manners and how well the horses work together as a team and as a hitch as a whole. The presentation and soundness of the wagon is also evaluated, as well as the drivers ability to drive the hitch. There is no standard or uniform set of rules. All judges have their own opinion on what they like, putting more emphasis on certain aspects than others do. This is what makes draft horse showing so unique; the outcome of a show can never be predicted. Australia Horse drawn fertilizer spreader in an agricultural implements class at Woolbrook, New South Wales The major agricultural shows in Australia hold led (conformation), trade and turnout classes for draft horses. At field days draft horses are also shown in long reining, ridden, log snigging, ploughing, pulling, novelty events, agricultural and other implements events, too.Woolbrook Heavy Horse Workout Program, Australian Draught Horse Stud Book Society Inc., October 2008 The draft breeds exhibited in Australia are: * Australian Draught HorseDraught Horses Retrieved 2010-6-12 Horse Breeds: The Australian Draught Horse * Belgian * Clydesdale * Percheron * Shire * Suffolk Punch Preparation for a show Before leaving the farm all equipment is checked for problems, cleaned thoroughly, and packed into the truck‚Äìtrailer used for travel. Most hitches use a semi trailer to transport their horses and all their equipments from show to show. Generally, the maximum number of horses that can be trailered in this manner is nine. Most exhibitors arrive the day before showing begins so that they may set up their stalls, including stall decorations that display the farm name and colors, and prepare for the hectic show schedule. Most exhibitors bathe their horses before departing from their home farms so that their stock arrive at the show looking well groomed. Other trainers and farms are evaluating their competition as soon as they arrive, so this is as much for show as is practical. Depending on the show's facilities, the draft horses tend to be hosed down upon arrival, or bathed completely to remove any dirt from their coats, though each farm has their own way of doing things. Clydesdales require extra attention after the bathing process, due to their leg feathers, which are coated in sawdust to help keep dirt out of the wet hair. The morning of the show horses are completely groomed, sometimes using a vacuum to remove any dust that has settled into the horses' coats since their bath. Next, most breeds have their hooves painted black, usually with hoof black or a glossy black spray paint. Exceptions to this are the Clydesdale and Shire breeds which commonly have white hooves, linked to the white leg markings preferable for their breed. For these breeds, it is necessary to powder their white feathers with baby powder, or a similar substance, once again depending on preference. While the hooves are drying, the mane is rolled and tails are braided up in a specific way. At this point, the horses are harnessed and then sprayed with fly spray to prevent movement in the show ring. Harnesses are wiped down again to remove any dust that has settled on them and the horses are hitched to the cart or wagon that will be used during the next class.

O'Donoghue's 57-yard field goal against Tennessee in 1976 still remains tied for the record for the longest field goal in Auburn history. He received All- American honors in 1976.http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/spec- rel/aa-odonoghue.html O'Donoghue was selected in the fifth round of the 1977 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills, but was cut five games into the 1977 season after making only two of six field goal attempts. After lengthy immigration problems, he was picked up by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1978. The Bucs had joined the league in 1976 and had compiled a 2‚Äì26 record in their first two years. O'Donoghue played for two years with the Bucs helping them improve to a 15‚Äì17 by converting 55 of 64 point after touchdown attempts and 24 of 43 field goals attempts. In 1980 O'Donoghue replaced Steve Little as the kicker for the St. Louis Cardinals. He missed a potential game-winning kick against the Washington Redskins in the last game of the 1984 season that would have sent his Cardinals to the playoffs, and missed three field goal attempts in overtime of a Monday Night Football game against the New York Giants during the 1983 season, resulting in a 20‚Äì20 tie. Even with a host of missed attempts, O'Donoghue still set the long-standing Cardinals record for most points in a season, with 117 in 1984. In his NFL career, he had a field goal success rate of 59.3%. www.pro-football-reference.com O'Donoghue is the most recent Irish-born player in the NFL. Personal life After the NFL, O'Donoghue sold real estate for a few years, then got into car sales. He is currently living in Clearwater, Florida and is a car salesman. O'Donoghue was the only member of his family to immigrate to the US and become an American Citizen. His older brother, Coli, is a partner at an architectural firm based out of Dublin, Ireland. O'Donoghue married his first wife, Laura, while playing for Tampa Bay. They lived in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, and had one daughter, Daeja. They divorced in the late 80s. He remarried shortly after to his second and current wife, Monica, and currently reside in Clearwater, Florida. They have two children, Neil and Courtney.

The wing is dedicated to improving readiness through integrated training, tactics development and operational testing for command and control of air, space and cyberspace. It hosts the Air Force's only Air Operations Center Formal Training Unit at Hurlburt Field, Florida. The unit was first activated in 1947 under Air Defense Command (ADC) as the 505th Aircraft Control and Warning Group. It controlled radar units in the northwest until inactivating in February 1942 during a general reorganization of ADC. It was activated again during the Vietnam War in November 1965. It initially commanded both aircraft warning units and forward air control squadrons, but in December 1966, those units were transferred to the 505th Tactical Air Control Group. It continued to manage the airspace over South Vietnam until the American withdrawal in 1973.

Stationed at McChord Field, becoming the first post-World War II aircraft control and warning unit in ADC. For the remainder of 1947 the group supported two radar stations, one at Arlington, Washington, and one at Half Moon Bay near San Francisco. These stations worked with fighter squadrons to improve ground-control and interception techniques. The group included a fleet of B-25 Mitchells used extensively to perform radar calibration flights. The experience gained from operating the two sites proved invaluable to air defense planners who were in the process of designing a nationwide early warning radar network. As tensions increased between the US and the USSR, the importance of the 505th mission grew. In September 1949, the group no longer operated B-25s, yet they remained focused on early warning systems, supporting detachments along the Pacific Northwest coast. The group provided early warning operating radar systems including the AN/TPS-1. On 15 March 1950, the reserve 564th ACWG was activated as a Corollary unit at Silver Lake, sharing the 505th's equipment and facilities. The 564th was called to active duty on 10 May 1951 and was inactivated, with its personnel used as fillers for the 505th. With a growing movement to assign homeland defense to reserve units, the 505 ACWG inactivated on 6 February 1952. =Vietnam War= On 2 November 1965, the 505 ACWG was re- activated as the 505th Tactical Control Group (TCG). Replacing the 6250th Tactical Air Support Group that activated three months earlier, 505 TCG called Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam home. The 505th was responsible with providing Command and Control (C2), for the Tactical Control System in Southeast Asia (SEA). This mission included the operation of numerous radar sites throughout South Vietnam and Thailand from 1965 to 1973. In addition to the radar sites, the group managed O-1 Bird Dog observation aircraft assigned to five squadrons from late 1965 through 1966. These O-1 units included the 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23d Tactical Air Support Squadrons, operating from various bases throughout SEA. Forward Air Controllers (FACs) flew the \\"Bird Dogs\\" to find and mark enemy activity, direct air strikes and perform battle damage assessment. Units included: * The 619th Tactical Control Squadron activated at Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 8 April 1964 It was responsible for operating and maintaining air traffic control and radar direction-finding equipment for the area from the Mekong Delta to Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands with detachments at various smaller airfields throughout its operational area. It remained operational until 15 March 1973. * The 620th Tactical Control Squadron with responsibility from Pleiku to the DMZ, was located at Monkey Mountain Facility. * 505th Tactical Control Maintenance Squadron * The 621st Tactical Control Squadron which supported tactical air operations in Thailand, located at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, and later at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base. * The 19th TASS which operated mainly from the Central Highlands south, located at Bien Hoa Air Base. * The 20th TASS based at Da Nang Air Base. * The 21st TASS headquartered at Pleiku Air Base. * The 22nd TASS based at Binh Thuy Air Base. * The 23rd TASS based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base. Maintenance support was provided by the 505th Tactical Control Maintenance Squadron first based at Tan Son Nhut and later at Bien Hoa AB. Initially assigned to the 2d Air Division in Vietnam, the 505th was reassigned to the Seventh Air Force on 1 April 1966. Soon afterward, the 505th received approval for its emblem and official motto ‚Äì \\"Search and Direct\\". The group eventually lost its flying squadrons but the radar mission grew. The group was the only unit to furnish all of SEA an electronics ground environment system for aircraft control and warning and radar services. After eight years of service in Vietnam the group earned thirteen campaign streamers and five Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Combat \\"V\\" devices. With the American withdrawal in 1973 came the unit's inactivation. =Post-Vietnam era= The 505th's lineage continued with the activation of the 4442d Tactical Control Group on 1 March 1980. Functioning as the 4442d, the unit aligned under the USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center. The group established a headquarters at Hurlburt Field, Florida where it managed a command, control, communications (C3) and intelligence complex. Along with the C3 operations, the unit conducted operational tests and evaluated tactical air control elements. It also provided training on tactical air control and operated the USAF Air Ground Operations School until 1997. The 505th has remained at Hurlburt since 1980 but received several name changes to match the evolution of its mission. With the elimination of MAJCOMs in 1991, the unit re-designated as the 505th Air Control Group. In April 1993, when the 505th began operating the new USAF Battlestaff Training School, the Air Force renamed the unit 505th Command and Control Evaluation Group. At the same time, the mission expanded to include a new detachment at Kirkland AFB, New Mexico. By 1998, with the ever-increasing importance of the Air Operations Center as a weapons system and the units expanding mission to train personnel in its use, the Air Force again changed the 505th's name, this time to the Air Force Command and Control Training and Innovation Center (AFC2TIC). The center continued to test new command and control systems and train personnel on their use in combat. Realizing that the center incorporated more than just a building with several detachments located around the US, the Air Force gave it group status on 15 April 1999. =Current era= The group became a wing on 12 March 2004. Now the 505th Command and Control Wing, it controls two groups: the 505th Training Group at Hurlburt Field and the 505th Test and Evaluation Group at Nellis Air Force Base.

It ceased publication with volume 5, issue 13 of August 19, 2011. History In early 2006, The Vanguard, a previous two-year-old alternative publication for Vancouver, folded. Several of the staff and writers involved with The Vanguard came together soon after its demise to continue the nascent tradition of an alternative periodical for the rapidly expanding population of Clark County. Former Vanguard columnist and Willamette Week Screen editor James Walling joined with longtime cohort Eric A. Johnson and soon-to-be production manager Melissa Wolf to found The Vancouver Voice. In the summer of 2007, the publication became embroiled in some of the controversy surrounding the Camas, Washington mayoral race after publishing a vitriolic letter from one of its readers that attacked the character of candidate and former city councilwoman Liz Pike. Pike responded by sending a letter of complaint from her attorney to the paper and the writer of the letter (who is unaffiliated with the paper's staff). Walling declined to acquiesce to Pike's complaint. In the general election, Pike was defeated by Paul Dennis, earning only 25 percent of the vote.http://www.clark.wa.gov/elections/results/2007/2007GeneralResults.pdf In September 2010, Voice freelancer Marcus Griffith was the first journalist to question what was initially reported as a local acid attack. The incident which later was revealed to be a hoax, and resulted in felony theft charges related to funds gathered for the alleged victim. Griffith posted his initial investigation on the website of the paper. This resulted in The Voice being labeled \\"Satan's paper\\" by religious groups sympathetic to the perpetrator of the hoax. In 2011, the paper's Oregon-based owners offered if for sale, after having purchased it in 2008 from Vancouver resident James Walling. After three years the paper was folded by Oregon Lithoprint Incorporated, citing \\"general economic malaise in the region, and specific challenges to the newspaper industry.\\" Content and focus The Voice featured content in the vein of most traditional alternative weekly periodicals, though more serious journalistic coverage of crimes and similar incidents has occurred. Past cover stories have included conflicting development models in the area (high density mixed use versus urban sprawl), and the tenth anniversary of Vancouver School of Arts and Academics.

The unit was constituted on 1 July 1916 in the Regular Army as the 17th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, Texas and originally inactivated 26 September 1921 at the Presidio of Monterey, California. Formerly a part of the 1950s Combat Arms Regimental System, it was reorganized as a part of the U.S. Army Regimental System, an ongoing effort to maintain the lineage and history of the U.S. Army through its units. Today, the 17th Cavalry Regiment is found across the army within the combat aviation brigades, where the squadrons, now constituted as attack/recon helicopter squadrons, carry on the legacy of the 17th Cavalry Regiment. History =Formation= The 17th Cavalry Regiment was organized under the provisions of the National Defense Act of 1916 at Fort Bliss, Texas on 30 June 1916 and constituted on 1 July 1916. Brigadier General John J. Pershing had taken his columns into Mexico only a short time before and the need of cavalry troops was pressing. Thirty-two officers and seven hundred and ninety-one veterans from the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 8th and 14th Cavalry Regiments were transferred as the nucleus of the new regiment. Many of these were recalled from the Mexican Punitive Expedition and since all were experienced troopers, little time was spent in whipping the organization into shape. The regimental commander, Colonel Willard A. Holbrook, assumed command on 9 July 1916, on which date the men from the 8th joined the 17th Cavalry Regiment. Colonel Holbrook held command until he was promoted to the rank of major general. In honor of the cavalry regiments that contributed officers, men and experience to the formation of the 17th Cavalry Regiment, the regimental shield shares much from the coats of arm of those units. Orange is from the 1st Cavalry and was the official color that has historically represented dragoons. The color green was taken from the 3d Cavalry. Their uniforms contained green facings in honor of the 3d Cavalry's first engagement at Vera Cruz, and its contribution throughout the campaign of 1847 to the capture of Mexico City. The regiment chose the unicorn from the 6th Cavalry Regiment, which represents the knightly virtues and, in the rampant position, a symbol of fighting aggressiveness, combined with speed and alacrity. The demi-horse, in honor of cavalry mounts, was taken from the shield of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. The diagonal line, being the traditional military symbol of cavalry, came from the 14th Cavalry. The first mounted formation of the regiment was held on 4 August 1916 and consisted of all fifteen troops and the wagons of the supply troop. =Arizona= On 14 May 1917, over five weeks after the American entry into World War I, the regiment received orders for a change of station due to disturbances along the border of Arizona. By 17 May, the regiment loaded up on trains and traveled from El Paso to arrive at Douglas, Arizona, on the mid-afternoon of 18 May. The regiment established itself at Camp Harry J. Jones, Douglas, Arizona, with outposts near Naco, Arizona (30 miles west along the border), west of town near the C & A Copper Smelter, Forrest, Arizona, and Slaughter's Ranch (13 miles east). Trouble began in the copper mining districts of Arizona as the Union (IWW) became unmanageable. On 5 July 1917 a provisional squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel White, marched north to Globe, Arizona, for strike duty. Later that month, forest fires in Mormon Canyon (Turkey Creek) grew beyond the control of the forest rangers, prompting another call for assistance by the civil leaders; a detail of fifty men under Second Lieutenant Arthur S. Harrington was deployed to assist them. The regiment would remain in the Southwest until the end of World War I. After the Armistice with Germany was signed in November 1918, the regiment was under orders to move to Hawaii. Among the junior officers who served with the 17th Cavalry was First Lieutenant Lucian Truscott, later to become a four-star general officer. =Hawaii= On 5 April 1919, the 17th Cavalry set sail from San Francisco on the USAT. Sherman, bound for Honolulu and Schofield Barracks. The massive demobilization following the end of World War I, would leave the 17th Cavalry manning the garrison at Fort Shafter and Schofield Barracks until the fall of 1920. Still, the problem remained of covering approximately one hundred miles of rugged coast line with one regiment of cavalry to effectively repel any attempted landing of troops from transports and hold them off until the arrival of reinforcements. With the exception of the sector in and around the city of Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, the entire coast line of the island was left to the 17th Cavalry Regiment. The regiment developed an intricate system of shielded lights and telephone lines for command and control as well as reporting, with camps placed in locations that provided cover and concealment from the air or sea. Reorganization in 1921 resulted in a reduction of the number of cavalry regiments from seventeen to fourteen, this included inactivation of the 17th Cavalry. Lack of funds, reduced personnel authorization, and serious doubts that \\"the mounted combat of large bodies of cavalry is probably a thing of the past\\" contributed to the decision as well as a new regimental organization that was designed to reduce overhead, increase firepower, and retain mobility. Many old, famous cavalry units came dangerously close to being lost to the Army because of organizational changes, but a new policy of retaining surplus units on the rolls of the Army in an inactive status was established, preserving unit designations and histories for future use rather than disbanding or re-designating them. The regiment left Schofield Barracks by truck for Honolulu on 16 September and embarked on the USAT. Buford for Monterey, California. The officers and enlisted men were transferred to the 11th Cavalry on 26 September, and the 17th Cavalry was placed on the inactive list. =Vietnam= Troop A, 17th Cavalry was reconstituted on 1 September 1957 in the Regular Army and consolidated with the 82d Airborne Reconnaissance Company and the consolidated unit designated as Troop A, 17th Cavalry, an element of the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. It was reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry (organic elements constituted 6 March 1964 and activated 25 May 1964). Troop B, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry was the ground reconnaissance element of the 3d Brigade Task Force, 82d Airborne Division in Vietnam. It arrived in Vietnam on 18 February 1968 and departed on 11 December 1969. Troop B, 17th Cavalry was reconstituted on 25 April 1957 in the Regular Army and consolidated with the 101st Airborne Reconnaissance Troop and the consolidated unit designated as Troop B, 17th Cavalry, an element of the 101st Airborne Division. It was reorganized and redesignated on 3 February 1964 as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated as elements of the 101st Airborne Division) at Fort Campbell, KY. The 2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry was originally deployed to Vietnam on 12 December 1967 as the ground cavalry squadron of the 101st Airborne Division, but as the division changed to an airmobile mode the squadron was converted to an air cavalry status during the period December 1968 - June 1969. Troops A, B and C (airmobile aviation) thus joined the squadron in March 1969 to complete the conversion. The previous Troop A (ground reconnaissance) had been serving the 1st Brigade of the division since 29 July 1965. The entire squadron was involved in intense aerial combat during the Operation Lam Son 719 invasion of Laos, when the helicopters supported the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's drive and retreat directly. This action took place between February and April 1971. In 1970-71 the squadron raised provisional air cavalry Troops E and F. The squadron departed Vietnam on 8 February 1972. In 1965 Troop A, 2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division was given a Valorous Unit Award for Operation Harrison Tuy Hoa Vietnam, Meritorious Unit Citation, and later after being employed for recon scout patrols in the Toumoroung battle to defend a Special Forces outpost and the Vietnamese company on the edge of complete destruction. Troop A deployed under the command of Captain Bill Carpenter, who called in napalm air strikes on his own position as it was being overrun. Departing from this battle, Troop A patrols were tasked to rescue and reinforce Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth's Tiger Force (the battalion recon platoon of the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry) of 45 soldiers who had been overrun and outnumbered 40 or more to 1. The 80 men of Troop A were at that time deployed in reconnaissance efforts along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and throughout the Dak To Province. Each of the 12 patrols rendezvoused with a chopper flight to fight their way in to rescue and re-enforce Tiger Force. The scout's radio frequency was changed to Tiger Force as it did every time the scouts were officially attached to another unit. Troop A was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for heroism during this battle by President Lyndon Johnson. The unit was also awarded, as attached reinforcements under the command of Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth, the South Vietnamese Presidential Citation. 8000 combat helicopter missions were flown during this three-week battle. Troop C, 17th Cavalry was reconstituted 1 March 1957 in the Regular Army and consolidated with the 11th Airborne Reconnaissance Company and the consolidated unit designated as Troop C, 17th Cavalry, an element of the 11th Airborne Division (later designated as the 11th Air Assault Division). It was relieved 1 July 1958 from assignment to the 11th Airborne Division when the 11th was inactivated in southern Germany and its elements reflagged as the 24th Infantry Division and inactivated on 15 November 1958. Troop C was reactivated for a short period (16 March 1962 to 16 January 1963) at Fort Knox, KY, before the lineage was redesignated on 1 February 1963 as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry, and remained assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test)(organic elements concurrently constituted). Troop B, 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry, was activated on 7 February 1963 at Fort Rucker, AL, while the rest of the squadron (less Troop B) was activated on 19 March 1964 at Fort Benning, GA. The squadron was relieved from assignment to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) on 30 June 1965 and inactivated the next day. The assets of the 11th Air Assault Division and the 2d Infantry Division were merged and reflagged as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), and within several months the division was sent to Vietnam. The squadron was reactivated on 25 November 1966 at Fort Knox, KY, and was organized with Troops A, B, and C as air cavalry and Troop D as ground cavalry. The 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry arrived in Vietnam on 30 October 1967 and was assigned to the 12th Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade, primarily stationed at Dƒ© An. It was responsible for air cavalry support in the western part of III Corps Tactical Zone. On 20 July 1970 it was placed under the control of II Field Force, Vietnam. In January 1971 Troop C was transferred to the 7th Squadron, 1st Cavalry. Troops A, B and D departed Vietnam together in April 1972 and Troop C rejoined them for the redeployment. In late 1970 the squadron was placed under the operational control of the 1st Cavalry Division and, when combined with the division's 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry, enabled the 1st Cavalry Division to form an ad hoc air cavalry brigade - a highly successful innovation. The squadron was inactivated on 19 June 1973 at Fort Lewis, WA. Troop D, 17th Cavalry was initially in Vietnam as the ground reconnaissance element of the 199th Infantry Brigade (Light), arriving on 13 December 1966 and departing on 12 October 1970. The unit was raised as an air cavalry troop from the assets of Troop D, 3d Squadron, 5th Cavalry to support the 101st Airborne Division. This second tour lasted from 15 December 1971 to 20 March 1972. Finally, the unit was activated again on 30 April 1972 using the assets of Troop D, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry to serve the 11th Aviation Group at Da Nang. It departed Vietnam on 26 February 1973. Troop E, 17th Cavalry was the ground reconnaissance element of the 173d Airborne Brigade, arriving in Vietnam from Okinawa on 6 May 1965. The troop was colocated with the brigade throughout its service in Vietnam and departed on 14 August 1971. Troop F, 17th Cavalry was the ground reconnaissance element of the 196th Infantry Brigade (Light), arriving in Vietnam from Fort Devens, MA, on 26 August 1965. The troop was colocated with the brigade throughout its service in Vietnam and departed on 31 March 1972. Initially the unit was equipped with jeeps carrying mounted 106mm guns. Later Troop F was equipped with APCs, and in November 1969 it was outfitted, in addition to its APCs, with M551 Sheridans, M114 scout vehicles and APCs equipped with 106mm mounted guns (one per platoon), converting them into Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicles (ACAV). The lineage of Troop G, 17th Cavalry, was perpetuated by HHT, 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry which arrived in Vietnam from Fort Knox, KY, on 28 October 1967 and was attached to the 17th Aviation Group at Pleiku. It moved to ƒê·∫Øk T√¥ Base Camp in March 1968 and in May returned to Pleiku. In September 1969 the squadron was relocated to Kontum, moved to Dragon Mountain in November, and in January 1970 the unit returned to Pleiku. In March 1971 it went to Qui Nhon and in late 1971 it was posted to An Son. The following troops and companies served with the squadron in Vietnam: *Troop A (Air Cav), October 1967 - July 1971, transferred to the 10th Aviation Battalion *Troop B (Air Cav), October 1967 - July 1971, transferred to the 52d Aviation Battalion *Troop C (Air Cav), July 1968 - April 1972, assets transferred to Troop H, 10th Cavalry *Troop D (Ground), October 1967 - July 1971, transferred to the 52d Aviation Battalion *61st Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter), July 1971 - March 1972, departed Vietnam *129th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter), July 1971 - April 1972, transferred to the 17th Aviation Group *180th Aviation Company (Assault Support Helicopter), March 1972 - April 1972, transferred to the 17th Aviation Group *Troop H, 10th Cavalry (Air Cav), April 1972, transferred to the 17th Aviation Group *Troop D, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry (Air Cav), July 1971 - February 1972, departed Vietnam The 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry departed Vietnam on 18 April 1972. Troop H, 17th Cavalry was initially the ground reconnaissance element of the 198th Infantry Brigade (Light), arriving in Da Nang aboard Military Sea Transports on 22 October 1967 from Fort Hood, TX, where it has been formed from units of the 1st and 2d Armored Divisions. Troop H departed Vietnam on 1 October 1971. It was re-raised in Vietnam from the assets of Troop B, 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry and served a second tour in Vietnam from 30 April 1972 to 26 February 1973 under the 17th Aviation Group at Pleiku. Troop K, 17th Cavalry arrived in Vietnam on 1 October 1970 as an air cavalry unit of the 17th Aviation Group in Nha Trang. It departed Vietnam in December 1970. =Post Vietnam= On 2 June 1988 the squadron was assigned to the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) and activated at Fort Drum, NY. On 16 November 1992 the lineage of the former 11th Airborne Reconnaissance Company was withdrawn from the 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry and concurrently the lineage of the 10th Reconnaissance Company was consolidated with Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry. Troop E, 3d Squadron, 17th Cavalry, was constituted 16 December 1995 in the Regular Army and activated at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. On 21 January 1988, the 4th squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was reflagged into the 5th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment headquartered at Camp Garry Owen, South Korea south of the small Korean town of Yong Ju Gol. The 5th Squadron 17th Regiment Air Cavalry was one of the front line units stationed throughout the region in South Korea northwest of Seoul commonly referred to as the western corridor. The mission of the 5th squadron was to maintain readiness to deploy and conduct reconnaissance operations to enable the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division to conduct decisive full spectrum operations, and provide patrols and support for operations maintaining security of the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between North and South Korea. The 5th Squadron Headquarters (HHT) and two Armor Cavalry Alpha (A) and Bravo (B) Troops were stationed at Camp Garry Owen in 1988. The Air Cavalry Troops Charlie, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot (C-F) were stationed separately at Camp Stanley when the 5th Squadron was initiated until later that year when the Air Cavalry relocated to Camp Mobile. In 1992 the Armor Cavalry moved to Camp Pelham, later renamed Camp Garry Owen and the Air Cavalry was moved to Camp Stanton. On 5 April 1996 the 5th Squadron 17th Cavalry Regiment was reflagged as the 4th Squadron 7th Cavalry Regiment leaving the 5th Squadron inactive to present. The Squadron was reactivated on 2 June 1988, as the Cavalry Squadron of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at Griffis AFB.

Traditions Major General Holbrook, while he had commanded the regiment, had presented a cup to be awarded during a regimental competition among the officers of the 17th Cavalry. The competition became an annual event and continued to be held in Hawaii. The test consisted of a ten-mile cross-country ride containing two series of four jumps each, followed by two series of five jumps each and a fifteen-foot water jump. The winning riders' names were engraved on the cup, which was maintained by the regiment. Unfortunately, it cannot be found today.

In its work it carries on with the musical history started in the earlier Republic of Dubrovnik (then Ragusa).  History  Music in Dubrovnik advanced with the support of the most affluent nobility. The first musical groups were formed to perform concerts in celebration of the city's patron, Saint Blaise (locally Sveti Vlaho). For these performances only the most talented musicians were selected. As the number of musicians in the Republic increased, the Senate decided to introduce qualified professors who could teach music to the youth. Apart from teaching, these professors played in the orchestra Knez's Music (Croatian: ). Musical influence during this time mostly came from the Italian city states, so the professors during this time were mostly from Italy. Young musicians extended their musical education most often in the cities of Naples and Rome. In modern times, an orchestra was formed on August 25, 1925 under the name Dubrovnik Philharmonic Orchestra. The first symphony concert was held in the Marin Dr≈æiƒá Theatre under the Polish conductor Tadeusz Sygietynski, then the conductor of the Warsaw Opera company. Reviews of the performance were good, and the activities of the orchestra were soon financed by the local government. Over the years the orchestra changed its name several times. In 1946 it took on the name Dubrovnik City Orchestra. In 1992, it began to work closely with the Dubrovnik Summer Games and changed its name to the Dubrovnik Festival Orchestra. The current name was adopted in 1995. Over the years many well-known conductors and performers have played with the orchestra: Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá, Zubin Mehta, Kirill Kondrashin, Ernst M√§rzendorfer, Henryk Szeryng, Mstislav Rostropovich, Antonio Janigro, Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrakh, Sviatoslav Richter and others.  Present  The orchestra regularly performs at the Dubrovnik Summer Festival. Its repertoire includes many of Dubrovnik's 18th century classics, especially those of Luka Sorkoƒçeviƒá and Ivan Mane Jarnoviƒá. The orchestra also holds concerts in the atrium of the Rector's Palace, as well as performing around Croatia and internationally.

The park was served by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and ferries from San Francisco. It operated from 1917 until it closed in 1939. Opened in 1917, Neptune Beach occupied a beach front zone now known as Crab Cove and was originally owned by the Strehlow family. Admission to the park was a dime. The park was described as a place for private picnics, with a clubhouse for dancing, and barbecue pits. The Cottage Baths were vacation cottages, available for rent. There were dances on Friday and Saturday night.Alameda Info.com Neptune Beach day ticket Attractions The Strehlows owned and operated the beach and filled in a section of the Bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and a roller coaster with views of the Bay. Its two outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by swimmers such as Olympian Johnny Weissmuller, who later starred as MGM's Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne who started a chain of health clubs. The park also featured a hand-carved carousel from the Dentzel Company and a Ferris wheel. The park closed in 1939 because of the Great Depression, the completion of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price and in general, the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines that ran past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Young people in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side by swimming around the fence. While some of the resort homes from Neptune Beach still exist and can be seen near Crab Cove, the vast majority of the structures‚Äîthe carousel, the Ferris wheel, roller coaster and other rides‚Äîwere auctioned off in 1940 for a fraction of their original costs.

The furnace was a leading Pennsylvania iron producer from 1742 until it was shut down in 1883. The furnaces, support buildings and surrounding community have been preserved as a historical site and museum, providing a glimpse into Lebanon County's industrial past. The site is the only intact charcoal-burning iron blast furnace in its original plantation in the western hemisphere. Established by Peter Grubb in 1742, Cornwall Furnace was operated during the Revolution by his sons Curtis and Peter Jr. who were major arms providers to George Washington. Robert Coleman acquired Cornwall Furnace after the Revolution and became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. Ownership of the furnace and its surroundings was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1932. Overview Cornwall Iron Furnace was one of many ironworks that were built in Pennsylvania over a sixty-year period, from 1716-1776. There were at least 21 blast furnaces, 45 forges, four bloomeries, six steel furnaces, three slitting mills, two plate mills, and one wire mill in operation in Colonial Pennsylvania. The furnaces at Cornwall Furnace went through two stages of technology. Peter Grubb was born in Delaware about 1702 and settled in what is now Lebanon County in 1734. He bought about of magnetite rich land. Grubb also noticed that his land had the other natural resources needed to produce iron. Namely, vast stands of timber for the production of charcoal, running water to operate the bellows, and an ample supply of limestone needed to add flux to the smelting furnaces. Grubb's plans were further helped by the fact that the magnetite at Cornwall was either very close to or on the surface of his land. He was ready to venture into the iron business and set about the task of building an iron \\"plantation\\". These centers of iron production were usually located well away from the heavily cleared farmlands and were nestled in the Ridge and Valley section of Pennsylvania. Grubb constructed his furnaces, first a bloomery and later the more modern charcoal-fired blast furnace and the support buildings and mill village that was needed to house his workers. He named his operation Cornwall because his father, John Grubb had come from Cornwall, UK in 1677. Cornwall Iron Furnace was an excellent fit for the agricultural based economy of the Thirteen Colonies. Iron was needed to make into tools, nails and weapons. The official policy of Great Britain frowned on manufacturing in the colonies, but England was no longer able to produce the needed iron for its needs let alone the needs of the colonists. In fact England had become dependent on importing iron from Sweden. Peter Grubb was not really an ironmaster, but a builder. In 1745 he leased the ironworks to a consortium, Cury and Company, for 25 years and returned to Wilmington. The consortium continued the operation, with ownership passing to Peter's sons, Curtis and Peter Jr., after his death in 1754. The brothers took over the operation in 1765 and ran it quite successfully until the late 1780s. Curtis operated the Cornwall Furnace and lived on site; c1773 he built the original 19 rooms of the mansion that still stands prominently next to the property. Peter Jr. ran a forge at Hopewell, refining the pig iron produced by the furnace into more valuable bar iron. The ironworks were major suppliers to the Revolutionary War effort, and George Washington once visited to inspect the operation. Unfortunately for the Grubb family, as described in Curtis Grubb's biography, they were unable to retain control of the operation after Curtis' marriage in 1783. Most of the Grubb's holdings gradually fell into the hands of Robert Coleman, culminating in 1798. Coleman's son, William, was named manager of Cornwall Furnace and lived in the mansion; in 1865 the Colemans remodeled it into the 29 room structure known today as Buckingham Mansion. Iron Act In American Colonial history, the Iron Act, passed in 1750, was part of the British legislation designed to encourage the production of raw materials (including pig iron) in colonial America, but to restrict their manufacture there into finished iron goods. Existing manufacturing works could continue, but new ones for certain processes were prohibited. Bloomery The first furnace built by Peter Grubb at Cornwall Iron Furnace was a bloomery. Grubb built this in 1737 to test the market value of his ore. It was an economical way to test the market without having to invest in building the much more efficient and profitable blast furnace. A bloomery is basically an enlarged blacksmith's hearth. It consists of a pit or chimney with heat- resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. (Sandstone was used at Cornwall.) Near the bottom, one or more clay pipes enter through the side walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by natural draft or by forced with a bellows. An opening at the bottom of the bloomery may be used to remove the bloom, or the bloomery can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the bottom. The first step taken before the bloomery can be used is the preparation of the charcoal and the iron ore. The charcoal is produced by heating wood to produce the nearly pure carbon fuel needed for the refining process. The ore is broken into small pieces and roasted in a fire to remove any moisture in the ore. Any large impurities in the ore can be crushed and removed. Since slag from previous blooms may have a high iron content, slag from previous blooms can be broken up and recycled into the bloomery with the new ore. In operation, the bloomery is preheated by burning charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; this allows the bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also be added to the bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities. The small particles of iron produced in this way fall to the bottom of the furnace and become welded together to form a spongy mass of the bloom. The bottom of the furnace also fills with molten slag, often consisting of fayalite, a compound of silicon, oxygen and iron mixed with other impurities from the ore. Because the bloom is highly porous, and its open spaces are full of slag, the bloom must later be reheated and beaten with a hammer to drive the molten slag out of it. Iron treated this way is said to be wrought, and the resulting nearly pure iron wrought iron. Blast furnace In 1742, Grubb replaced his bloomery with a high charcoal-fired cold blast furnace. The blast furnace burned hotter than the bloomery and was able to render molten pig iron (\\"charcoal iron\\") from the ore. A blast furnace relies on the fact that the unwanted silicon and other impurities are lighter than the molten iron that is the main product. Grubb's furnace was built in the form of a tall chimney-like structure lined with refractory brick. Charcoal, limestone and iron ore (iron oxide) were poured in at the top, and air was blown in through tuyeres near the base. The resulting \\"blast\\" promotes combustion of the charcoal (more modern furnaces use coke or even anthracite), creating a chemical reaction that reduces the iron oxide to the base metal which sinks to the bottom of the furnace. The exact nature of the reaction is: Fe2O3 \\\\+ 3 CO ‚Üí 2Fe + 3CO2 More precisely, the compressed air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the fuel to produce carbon monoxide, which then mixes with the iron oxide, reacting chemically to produce iron and carbon dioxide, which leaks out of the furnace at the top. In the beginning of the reaction cycle, the hot blast, also called \\"wind\\", containing pre-heated gas from Cowper stoves and air, is blasted into the furnace through tuyeres. The wind will ignite the coke and the Boudouard reaction will take place: C + O2 ‚Üí CO2 CO2 \\\\+ C ‚Üí 2 CO The temperature in the furnace typically runs at about 1500 ¬∞C, which is enough to also decompose limestone (calcium carbonate) into calcium oxide and additional carbon dioxide: CaCO3 ‚Üí CaO + CO2 The calcium oxide reacts with various acidic impurities in the iron (notably silica), forming a slag containing calcium silicate, CaSiO3 which floats on the iron. The pig iron produced by the blast furnace is not useful for most purposes due to its high carbon content, around 4-5%, making it very brittle. Some pig iron is used to make cast iron goods, often being remelted in a foundry cupola. For other purposes further processing is needed to reduce the carbon content to enable iron to be used for tools or as a construction material. There have been various processes for this. The earliest process was conducted in the finery forge. In the late 18th century, this began to be displaced by 'potting and stamping', but the most successful new process of the industrial revolution period was puddling. This is now done by forcing a jet of high- pressure oxygen into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some of the carbon is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can be separated from the oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is commercially pure iron. At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a cementation furnace to produce blister steel (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use. =Charcoal= The blast furnaces at Cornwall Furnace needed a tremendous amount of charcoal in order to keep them fired and thereby create a steady production of iron. The making of the charcoal became an industry in itself. Hardwood trees were chopped down, dried, stacked and fired in pits. A collier carefully stacked the wood around a chimney. The stack of wood was covered with leaves and dirt and was set on fire in the center. The fires were allowed to smolder for ten to fourteen days, under the careful, round the clock, supervision of the collier. The colliers were careful to make sure that enough heat was produced to expel moisture, tar and other substances from the wood without burning the wood up entirely. Wood was not charred until just before it was needed to keep it from getting wet and becoming useless. The demand for charcoal was so tremendous that Cornwall Furnace used an entire acre of wood every day for making charcoal. =Working at the furnace= The furnace operated twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, except for when it was closed for repairs. Cornwall Iron Furnace was capable of producing 24 tons of iron a week. A large waterwheel powered the bellows. Carts loaded with charcoal passed to and fro between the coal barn and the furnace under a protective roof designed to keep the charcoal dry. Other wagons hauled the ore from the mine to the top of the furnace on the hillside. Workers then manually transported the charcoal and ore to the furnace. The guttermen worked at the base of the furnace. They raked the cooling sand and dug channels for the molten pig iron. Next, they stacked the bars of pig iron outside. The working conditions were very difficult. Temperatures inside the casting house reached as high as 160 ¬∞F (71 ¬∞C). Such a massive and difficult iron and charcoal making operation need a massive and hardened workforce. The furnace alone needed as many as sixty people working around the clock in twelve-hour shifts. The iron works support staff included a company clerk, a host of teamsters, woodcutters, the colliers, farmers and household servants. There was a wide gap between the classes. Workers were housed in small homes and worked very hard for low wages. The owners and supervisors of the furnace lived in mansions with sizable servant staffs. Historians have likened life at the furnace to life in a feudal barony. There were three groups of workers at Cornwall Iron Furnace: Free labor, indentured servants and slaves. Slavery was legal in Pennsylvania until it was gradually abolished beginning in 1780 when the importation of slaves was prohibited. The management of the furnace had quite a bit of trouble with the staff of indentured servants. These unskilled workers were imported from Germany, England and Ireland. Many of them worked at Cornwall for a short time before eventually running away. The Coleman legacy =Robert Coleman= Robert Coleman rose from a holding clerkship at a prothonotary's office in Philadelphia to bookkeeper at Cornwall Iron Furnace to becoming Pennsylvania's first millionaire. Coleman arrived in Philadelphia from Ireland in 1764. After serving as a clerk and bookkeeper he went on to acquire a lease on Salford Forge near Norristown in 1773 and immediately made a sizeable profit by manufacturing cannonballs and shot at Salford and Elizabeth Furnaces. He then used his profits to purchase a two thirds share of Elizabeth Furnace, shares of Cornwall and the Upper and Lower Hopewell Furnaces, (not the similarly named Hopewell Furnace), and ownership of Speedwell Forge. Soon Coleman was able to construct Colebrook Furnace, purchase the rest of Elizabeth Furnace and acquired 80% ownership of Cornwall Furnace and the ore mines nearby. His business acquisitions and the profits turned from them enabled him to become the first millionaire in the history of Pennsylvania. =George Dawson Coleman= George Dawson Coleman was the grandson of Robert Coleman and son of James Coleman. George Dawson Coleman married Deborah Brown of Philadelphia and had several children including Ann Coleman who moved to France and revitalized Ch√¢teau de Villandry (alongside her husband Joachim Carvallo). George Dawson Coleman controlled much of the Coleman iron fortune with his brother, Robert. George acquired greater control of the ore mines at Cornwall and was able to experiment with iron furnaces that were fueled by anthracite coal instead of coke. He also invested in the expanding railroad, and built houses, a school and church for his employees. He was much loved his community and went on to serve several times in the Pennsylvania State Legislature. (Several churches built by the Coleman family are still in existence in the area, and they are known as Coleman Chapels.) George oversaw many improvements in production at Cornwall Iron Furnace. The bellows were replaced with \\"blowing tubs\\". The blowing tubs were piston-powered air pumps and containers that held compressed air and forced that air into the furnaces. The waterwheel was replaced by a steam engine in 1841. And the furnace stack was rebuilt in the 1850s. The Colemans turned direct supervision of Cornwall Iron Furnace to John F. Reynolds in 1848. He was a graduate of West Point and managed the furnace until the outbreak of the Civil War. Reynolds was commissioned a general and was the first Union General to fall at the Battle of Gettysburg. =Robert Habersham Coleman= Robert Habersham Coleman was the fourth and last generation scion of the Colemans. He shut the facility in 1883, opening new facilities for the company. In 1881, at the time he took over his family's business, Coleman was worth about seven million dollars. By 1889 he was estimated to be worth thirty million dollars. By 1893 the fortune had vanished. One of his homes, Cornwall Hall, was a \\"symbol of the rise, fame and decline of the \\"king\\" of Cornwall (Pennsylvania) during America's Gilded Age.\\" Downfall Cornwall Iron Furnace became obsolete by the 1880s. The Bessemer and open-hearth processes of creating steel, the replacement of charcoal with coke and anthracite coal, the discovery of iron deposits at the Iron Range in Minnesota near Lake Superior, and the building of modern factories in Pittsburgh, Steelton and Bethlehem brought about the end of iron production in Cornwall. Cornwall Furnace no longer earned a profit in its last ten years of operation and the last owner, Robert Habersham Coleman, had it shut down on February 11, 1883. In 1932, the furnace and ancillary buildings were deeded by Margaret Coleman Buckingham and have since been restored and open to the public.

Organic egg production is the production of eggs through organic means. In this process, the poultry are fed organic feed. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, organic means that the laying hens must have access to the outdoors and cannot be raised in cages.United States Code of Federal Regulations; 7 CFR 205.239 (a)(1) Only natural molting can occur within the flock; forced molting is not allowed. Organic certification also requires maintenance of basic animal welfare standards. Differences between \\"free range\\" and \\"organic\\" German organic egg with only the EU egg code Significant differences cover feed, medication, and animal welfare. Organic hens are fed organic feed; it is prohibited to feed animal byproducts or GMO crops ‚Äì which is not disallowed in free range environments; no antibiotics allowed except in emergencies (in free range, it is up to the farmer, but the same levels of antibiotics as conventional farming is allowed); required animal welfare standards in organic farms are higher, which can improve the quality of both the eggs and the meat. In the European Union (EU), to identify and trace egg production, a unique code must legally be printed on all eggs. A ‚Äú0‚Äù code distinguishes organic farming eggs. The regulation on egg marking includes four levels with strict requirements on husbandry conditions. While free-range and indoor keeping requires 1100 cm¬≤ indoor space per hen it makes 1667 cm¬≤ (or 6 hens per square meter) the minimum for organic farming. Organic feed Organic feed is grown without the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. It is often grown by certified organic farmers, whose practices are monitored for three years prior to being certified organic. If the crop is contaminated by cross-fertilization with GMOs, it is rendered useless for organic grading. Finally, there can be no animal by- products in organic feed. Living conditions At an organic farm (in Bruthen, Victoria) chickens sometimes end up laying eggs somewhere other than the owner expected In the United States, \\"organic\\" egg production means that the flock may not live in cages and must have access to outdoor areas. Antibiotics Organic egg producers cannot feed low-level antibiotics to the poultry. Antibiotics are only allowed during an outbreak of infection or disease. Molting Some farms induce molting in their flocks to affect egg production. In organic egg farms, the birds are allowed to go into a natural molt but are not induced. Animal welfare Meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products labeled ‚Äúorganic‚Äù have must come from animals who are ‚Äú(m)anaged without antibiotics, added growth hormones, mammalian or avian byproducts, or other prohibited feed ingredients.‚ÄùAgricultural Marketing Service, ‚ÄúOrganic Livestock Requirements,‚Äù The National Organic Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture, July 2013. Farms, processors, and distributors must be inspected by the USDA before they are allowed to use the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù label. However, fewer than 5 percent of chickens are raised in accordance with these standards.\\"About The U.S. Egg Industry,\\" American Egg Board, 1 May 2018 The ‚Äúorganic‚Äù label does not guarantee that animals were treated any better than those raised on conventional CAFOs. The Washington Post reported that large operations are able to sell their eggs as organic because the USDA has \\"interpreted the word 'outdoors' in such a way that farms that confine their hens to barns but add 'porches' are deemed eligible for the valuable 'USDA Organic' label.

History  Thirty-five charter members of Bethel Baptist Church began meeting on January 3, 1943 in a rented store front in Los Angeles, California. Members brought their own chairs to the first service. By 1958, two more \\"missions\\" or services were established in Baldwin Park and Monterey Park. In 1969, at age 24, Thomas A. Wolf \\"Brother Tom\\" became senior pastor of the then-named First Southern Baptist Church of East Los Angeles. Demographic shifted in the '60s in East Los Angeles, and the small number of people still attending were predominantly Caucasian/Anglo and elderly in an area that was becoming more diverse with Hispanic, Armenian and Asian families moving in as Caucasian/Anglo families moved to the suburbs. The churches' new make-up was approximately 50 percent Hispanic, 40 percent Caucasian or Anglo and 10 percent Asian. Wolf created a leadership team that reflected this new cultural make-up with Hispanics filling over 50 percent of elder and leadership roles and Asian serving approximately 20 percent of these roles. Located on Brady Ave, church members began to refer to the congregation as The Church on Brady. Although never officially changed this was how it became recognized. Brother Tom, as he was called, developed and led the church in a common mission to \\"become a spiritual reference point east of downtown Los Angeles and a sending base to the ends of the earth.\\" Wolf pioneered \\"Oikos Evangelism\\": reaching out to one's circle of influence; home church groups or \\"Share Groups\\". He fostered a new church, an American apostolic church, rather a church based solely on tradition. In the early 1990s The Church on Brady was responsible for more missionaries than any other church in the International Mission Board, regardless of size. Lyle E. Schaller states, \\"The Church on Brady tenaciously and persistently pursued the perennial apostolic paradigm of church ... multiplication rather than church maintenance.\\" The Church on Brady started many new churches both locally in or near Los Angeles and internationally. By 1983 the original building on Brady was far outgrown and in need of repair. Wolf led the church through a building phase that was completed in 1987. Even though many were sent out, Brady faced a constant issue of overcrowding due to perennial growth. In October 1991, Erwin McManus was first introduced to The Church on Brady as the keynote speaker at Brady's Spare Not Conference on World Evangelism. He was then invited to move to The Church on Brady and Los Angeles to transition into the role of Senior Pastor. Early in 1994, McManus officially became Senior Pastor. Wolf then moved into the role of \\"Teaching Pastor\\" and simultaneously accepted a teaching position at Golden Gate Seminary in San Francisco. Born in El Salvador, McManus had moved at an early age to the United States with his family. He brought 15 years experience as an evangelist and speaker.Erwin McManus, Senior Pastor, Mosaic Church, Los Angeles, CA, Churchexecutive.com McManus built on the foundation set at Brady. Multi-media was the new tool in churches at the time. McManus encouraged use of these new tools making greater use of art and dance as weekly components of worship. Regular night-time services began being offered. A new name was sought with \\"MOSAIC\\" being the accepted choice.Gerardo Marti. 2005. A Mosaic of Believers: Diversity and Innovation in a Multiethnic Church. Indiana University Press. It was at this time that the Sunday night service was moved to the Club Soho, a nightclub in downtown Los Angeles (relocating several years later to the Mayan Theater, also in downtown Los Angeles). MOSAIC has since become a single church with multiple sites. In 2006, Mosaic had approximately 60 nationalities with 2,000 in weekly attendance. Gerardo Marti, A Mosaic of Believers: Diversity and Innovation in a Multiethnic Church, Indiana University Press, USA, 2009, p. 2Southern Baptist Convention Press Since then, Mosaic has expanded to 7 campuses along the Pacific Coast and has a weekly attendance of over 5,000.  Beliefs  Mosaic's mission is to live by faith, to be known by love, and to be a voice of hope. The church exists to declare the name of Jesus to the world and to create a place called home for those who don't have one. Mosaic has established five core values: # Mission is why the church exists: The Church is a movement, not an institution. Every follower of Jesus is commissioned by God. Commission. Wind # Love is the context for all mission: The Church is relational, not programmatic. Every follower of Jesus is part of a larger community. Community. Water. # Structure must submit to spirit: The Church is empowering, not controlling. Every follower of Jesus is called and connected uniquely to serve. Connection. Wood # Relevance to culture is not optional. The Church is an incarnation, not esoteric. Every follower of Jesus celebrates communion with God. Communion. Fire. # Creativity is the natural result of spirituality. The Church is transforming, not conforming. Every follower of Jesus grows in Christ Like character. Character. Earth.  Campuses  Mosaic Hollywood In 2017, Mosaic began expanding and launching new campuses along the Pacific Coast. There are currently 7 campuses that meet weekly: Hollywood, South Pasadena, Venice, Orange County, Seattle, Mexico City, and Ecuador. Mosaic Hollywood launched in 2011 at the former Fifth Church of Christ, Scientist building at 7107 Hollywood Boulevard. The 1959 structure located at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue has been designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.Mosaic South Pasadena Mosaic South Pasadena launched in 2017. It currently meets at 1023 Fair Oaks Ave in the historic Rialto Theatre. On December 20, 2019, building owner Izek Shomof told the South Pasadena News that Mosaic will get a new 20-year lease for its weekend religious services to continue operating in the Rialto. Since moving into the abandoned theatre, Mosaic has hosted several movie nights, showing classic and modern films alike inside the theatre, such as ‚ÄòIt's A Wonderful Life\\", \\"Ghostbusters\\", and \\"La La Land.\\" Mosaic Venice was launched in 2017. Mosaic Orange County was launched in 2018. Mosaic Seattle was launched in 2019. Mosaic Mexico City was launched in 2018. Mosaic Mexico is led by Emerson and Christina Nowotny. Mosaic Ecuador was launched in 2020.  Cultural topics  Mosaic has a podcast called \\"Battle Ready,\\" hosted by Erwin and Aaron McManus. The podcast covers a variety of topics, ranging from leadership, to personal struggles that humans experience. In one of the most viewed episodes on Youtube of the Podcast, Erwin and Aaron discuss mental health and the struggles of being human. They talk about their personal experience with battling stress and anxiety, and how they overcome those struggles every day. Since the episode's release on April 9, 2018, Mosaic and Erwin have continued to help others overcome their battles with mental health. In an interview with Fox News, released on February 26, 2019 about his book, The Way of The Warrior: An Ancient Path to Inner Peace, Erwin commented: > \\"‚ÄôThis is just a part of being human. This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre broken. This > doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt find wholeness, but what it actually means is > that you‚Äôre a human being and you‚Äôre dealing with real issues in life. But > the pain inside of us has to be addressed.‚Äô\\" Mosaic has advocated for refugees, both domestically in the United States and globally around the world. World Vision International, a Christian organization that works to overcome poverty and injustice, listed Mosaic's Lead Pastor, Erwin McManus, as one of the top 25 mission minded church leaders. The list includes pastors and leaders who are, \\"missions focused, Kingdom-minded and passionate about caring for the poor and oppressed\\". On April 29, 2019, CCM Magazine released an article, mentioning Mosaic's involvement abroad. On May 28, 2019, the online magazine Hypebeast published an article, \\"Church and Streetwear: A Match Made in Heaven\\", in which Emily Jensen wrote and quoted McManus as having a large gay attendance and being \\"for everybody.\\" On June 25, 2019, the article was updated after several former members disputed McManus's comment. McManus responded with a statement describing the church's community as diverse. On July 13, 2019, Refinery29 published an article on Mega Churches which described Mega-Churches as image- obsession and claiming to have \\"open doors\\" while also being unwelcoming and unsupporting to LGBTQ+ members and the LGBTQ+ community. One former attendee said that openly gay people were denied leadership positions at Mosaic because they were gay. Pastor Erwin McManus and Aaron McManus have a TV Show called McManus on Trinity Broadcasting Network's Hillsong Channel. The McManus TV show covers the hottest, hardest topics and current events, bringing unique insight, scriptural wisdom, and clarity. Music Mosaic has a worship band named Mosaic MSC, led by Worship Pastor Mariah McManus. The band has released three live albums and three extended plays.

In astrodynamics  In astrodynamics, canonical units are defined in terms of an object's reference orbit. In this system, a reference mass, for example the sun, is assumed to be 1 \\"mass unit\\" and the mean distance from the orbiting object to the reference object is considered the \\"distance unit\\". Canonical units are useful when the precise distances and masses of objects in space are not available.

Along with the valve spring, it serves to positively locate the valve so that it may make proper contact with the valve seat. A valve guide is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or integrally cast into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the exhaust valve and into the cylinder head where it may be taken up by the cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life. The clearance between the inner diameter of the valve guide and the outer diameter of the poppet valve stem is critical for the proper performance of an engine. If there is too little clearance, the valve may stick as oil contaminants and thermal expansion become factors. If there is too much clearance, the valve may not seat properly and excessive oil consumption can occur. Over time, the inner diameter of the valve guide and the outer diameter of the valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine remanufacturers began reaming valve guides, rather than replacing them, as part of their remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the valve guides in a head to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the valve guide with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, remanufacturers also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated. Studies have been conducted which show that through the proper selection of the reamer and reaming process, valves guides can be quickly and efficiently reamed to a consistently repeatable size. Aircraft engines In aircraft piston engines, the valve guides are typically shaped in a tube with a flare at one end, so as to resemble in section, the letter \\"T\\". Their replacement involves removing the worn part by driving it out with a hammer and specifically-shaped punch. Installation involves heating the cylinder (with its integral head) and freezing the valve guide so as to ease insertion, and then driving the new guide in quickly with a hammer. Once the parts return to room temperature the new valve guide will be solidly in place and ready to be reamed and honed to proper diameter. Oil seals As valve guides wear, their ability to positively locate the valve to the valve seat decreases. As the valves lose their ability to seal the combustion chamber properly, the engine can lose performance and start to burn oil, leaking from the top of the cylinder head into the intake and exhaust manifolds. Modern engines are fitted with valve stem oil seals which can be replaced if oil leakage occurs.

Farrell was the first round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1982 NFL Draft; Buccaneers management had actually intended to select defensive end Booker Reese, and Farrell's name was turned in due to a communication error in the draft room. The team then traded the next year's first round pick in order to get Reese as well. Ironically, Farrell played at a high level for the Buccaneers, while Reese ultimately came to be considered one of the most disappointing draft picks in team history.Gary Shelton, \\"Opportunity Lost: Ex-Buc Booker Reese had everything going for him until drub abuse led to a prison cell.\\" St. Petersburg Times, July 27, 2003.Pat Yasinskas, \\"Draft room tale: Bucs' big bungle\\", ESPN.com, April 21, 2010. Tampa Bay's team performance declined during Farrell's years with the team. After his first contract expired in 1985, he signed a one-year contract for the 1986 season based on the team's assurances that things would improve, but the team had another bad year and Farrell made news by publicly telling a group of Bucs fans, \\"I know what I want this Christmas . . . I want to get the hell out of Tampa Bay.\\"Jerry Greene, \\"Farrell's Revelation: I Want Out Of Tampa Bay\\", Orlando Sentinel, December 3, 1986. New England acquired him in return for three draft picks, and he was the Patriots' starting guard for three seasons before shoulder surgery kept him on the injured reserve list for most of the 1990 season. Near the end of that season, the Patriots tried to reactivate him without using a protective designation for him; under the rules then applicable, this had the effect of putting him on waivers, and he was claimed by the Denver Broncos.\\"Patriots Lose Farrell to Broncos: Denver Claim of Veteran Foils New England Waiver Gamble\\", The Boston Globe, December 1, 1990 . He finished that year and played another in Denver, then one more for Seattle before concluding his NFL career.

There are considerable ruins here including those of a theatre, of thermae or baths, and portions of the ancient pavement. Several inscriptions have also been found here, some of which bear the name of its people, Plebs Trebulana, Trebulani Mutuscani, and Trebulani Mut., so that no doubt can remain of their attribution.Chaupy, Maison d'Horace, vol. iii. pp. 93-96; Orell. Inscr. 923, 3442, 3963 As this seems to have been much the more considerable place of the two Sabine cities named Trebula (the other being Trebula Suffenas), it is probably that meant by Strabo, who mentions Trebula without any distinctive adjunct but in conjunction with Eretum.Strabo v. p. 228 The Liber Coloniarumn also mentions a \\"Tribule\\", municipiumLiber Coloniarum, p. 258 which is probably the same place. Martial also alludes to Trebula as situated among cold and damp mountain valleys,Martial, v. 72 but it is not certain which of the two places he here refers to. Temple of Feronia There was once a temple of Feronia, which was plundered by Hannibal.Hazlitt's Classical Gazetteer, p. 354 Virgil speaks of Mutusca as abounding in olives (oliviferaeque MutuscaeThe Aeneid vii. 711), which is still the case with the neighbourhood of Monteleone Sabino, and a village near it consequently bears the name of Oliveto.

In general they do not refer to records in the formats actually issued during Parker's lifetime, so with a few exceptions technically they should all come under the heading of compilations. For instance, no record label in 1944 would have issued an album of 78s entitled The Immortal Charlie Parker to describe a relative unknown at that time, and in 1948 there would never have been a record entitled Newly Discovered Sides by Charlie Parker as if an unearthed archeological artifact - anything by Bird in 1948 would have been fairly new. It is also worth noting that a significant proportion of the listings outside of the live list are in fact live recordings.

The name was chosen in honor of Humbert I Biancamano, founder of the Savoy dynasty. She was built in the Scottish shipyard William Beardmore & Co. in Dalmuir, near Glasgow. She was built for the Genovese shipping company Lloyd Sabaudo, operator of the Conte Rosso and Conte Verde. The engine, equipped with two steam turbines double reduction unit and two propellers, allowed her to reach a speed of 20 knots, and vented in two funnels. She housed 180 passengers in first class, 220 in second class, 390 in economic class and 2,660 in third class. Conte Biancamano was the first of two sister ships, her sister Conte Grande not seeing completion until 1927. First years of service First- class cabin of the Conte Biancamano, reconstruction at Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. Conte Biancamano was launched 23 April 1925, and made her maiden voyage on 20 November 1925 from Genoa to New York, sailing, as expected, on a direct route to North America. The ship, provided with all the most innovative amenities of its time, was intended primarily as a luxury liner. The last trip for the Lloyd Sabaudo departed from Genoa to New York on 25 November 1932. In 1932, Lloyd Sabaudo, together with other Italian shipping companies, merged to form the famous Italian Line. The Conte Biancamano was then used for direct routes to South America. This was continued for six trips, the last of which began on 1 July 1932. In 1934, she was used for military purposes. She carried troops and military equipment on behalf of the Ministry of the Navy in preparation for the war in Ethiopia. In 1936, she was transferred to Lloyd Triestino, one of the companies in the group, which took a direct route to the Middle East. In March 1939, the ship carried the first team of climbers (led by the mountaineer Fritz Wiessner) on the 1939 American Karakoram expedition to K2. Scenes of the team on board feature in a BBC documentary titled 'Mountain Men: The Ghosts of K2'. In 1939 on at least one passage many German Jewish refugees were able to book passage on her, from Genoa to Shanghai, via the Suez Canal and with stops at many ports, as a means of escaping the Nazi terror and genocide. In 1940, she returned to Italian Line and was used for a trip from Genoa ‚Äì Naples ‚Äì Panama ‚Äì Valparaiso ‚Äì Panama. USS Hermitage (AP-54) SS Conte Biancamano as USS Hermitage (AP-54) At the start of the Second World War, she was seized and interned in the Panamanian port of Crist√≥bal, where she was moored. In December 1941, with the entry of the United States into the war, she was seized by the United States. She was converted to a transport by Cramp Shipbuilding of Philadelphia; and commissioned 14 August 1942, Captain Donald F. Patterson in command. The ship could accommodate up to seven thousand men following its conversion. The ship was armed with one 127/38mm gun 5\\"/38 caliber dual purpose gun and six 76/50mm guns.3\\"/50 caliber dual purpose gun =Operation Torch= Embarking 5,600 army troops and sailors, on 2 November 1942 Hermitage departed New York with her skipper acting as convoy commodore. Six days later the North African invasion began, and Hermitage on 10‚Äì25 November debarked her passengers at Casablanca to participate in the momentous campaign. Returning to Norfolk, Virginia 11 December, Hermitage next headed for the Pacific with nearly 6,000 passengers embarked. After embarking and debarking passengers at Balboa, Noumea, Brisbane, Sydney, Pago Pago, and Honolulu, the former luxury liner put in at San Francisco 2 March 1943. =Pacific operations= Hermitages next swing westward, begun 27 March took her to Wellington, New Zealand; Melbourne; and Bombay. At Bombay she embarked some 707 Polish refugees, including nearly a hundred children, for a voyage back to California which ended 25 June. In the next year Hermitage made three similar cruises through the South Pacific, with battle-bound marines, soldiers and sailors, civilians, and Chinese and Indian refugees among her diversified passengers. Hermitage reached New York 28 May from the South Pacific via Noumea, Goodenough Island, and the Panama Canal. =Operation Overlord= Departing New York 16 June 1944 with over 6,000 passengers, most of them bound for the invasion of Europe just begun at Normandy, Hermitage sailed to Liverpool and Belfast to debark the troops before returning to New York 12 July. From then until the end of the war she made 10 more such voyages, principally to Le Havre, to bring replacements to the European theater and transport wounded Allied soldiers and prisoners of war back to the States. V-E Day, 8 May 1945, found Hermitage part of the celebration in Le Havre harbor as Allied ships greeted the end of 6 years of war with a cacophony of bells, whistles and sirens screaming through air illuminated by hundreds of signal flares and rockets. =Late- and post-war= October 1945 newsletter. US Army service member's discharge records showing passage on the USS Hermitage. Following the Normandy Landings, she made several trips between Europe and the U.S. to transport troops and return wounded prisoners, the first of which was on 16 June 1944. She was at Le Havre on 8 May 1945, the day of Germany's surrender. On Thursday, 22 November 1945 the Hermitage sailed from Marseilles Harbor with 5,799 aboard with units from the 12th Armored Division and the 629th Tank Destroyer Battalion. The ship arrived in New York City on Saturday, 1 December 1945 at Pier 88 North River, at 48th Street at approximately noon. Departing New York 12 December, the well-traveled transport sailed to Nagoya, Japan to embark some 6,000 homeward bound veterans on 19 January 1946 and return to Seattle 4 February 1946. Assigned to the San Francisco-Marianas run for Operation Magic Carpet, the return of thousands of Pacific troops, she made three further voyages before decommissioning at San Francisco 20 August 1946. While serving with the Navy, the former luxury liner had sailed approximately 230,000 miles and transported 129,695 passengers, including American, British, Australian, French, and Netherlands fighting men as well as Chinese, American, Polish, and British civilians and German and Italian prisoners. A return to Italy The ship during her last voyage in Naples, 1960 In 1947, the ship was returned to Italy and underwent refit and modernization at a shipyard in Monfalcone in 1948. Structural changes saw her bow replaced with a sleeker design, as well as an increase in length overall. Interior changes included more passenger accommodations, increasing her capacity to 252 first-class passengers, 455 in cabin class, and 893 in economy class. The refit also saw her name Conte Biancamano restored. With her structural and interior refit and modernization completed, she became the premiere ocean liner of the renewed Italian merchant fleet. Her interior refit was made possible through the collaboration of painters such as Massimo Campigli, Mario Sironi, and Roberto Crippa, as well as decorative design work by Gustavo Pulitzer, Paolo De Poli and Gi√≤ Ponti. Art work including sculptures made by Marcello Mascherini were placed on the ceiling of the grand hall depicting the myth of Jason and the Golden Fleece. On 14 July 1949, Conte Biancamano was placed on the Genoa ‚Äì Buenos Aires route until 21 March 1950 when she was moved to the Genoa ‚Äì Naples ‚Äì Cannes ‚Äì New York route. She was returned to the Genoa-Buenos Aires route in 1957, until at least 1958. In May 1957 the body of the late Eva Per√≥n (Evita) was transported on the Conte Biancamano under a false name, for interment in Italy.

According to that archive: > In 1972, weary of the hectic pace of life in Detroit, the Whelans moved to a > cabin on oxbow Lake in the woods of northern Michigan, outside the small > town of Mancelona. Their peace was soon disturbed, however, by an oil > company that intended to drill on their property. Since the Whelans did not > own the mineral rights to the land, the company razed three acres and sank > an unsuccessful well, after which it departed. The experience inspired > Whelan to write a children's novel about a young boy who worked on an > oilrig. It was published as A Clearing in the Forest in 1978. That was her first book. Whelan was almost fifty-five when Putnam's published A Clearing in the Forest in July 1978. In nearly thirty-five years since then, she has written fifty-two books of fiction for children and young adults. Many have been set in rural northern Michigan, where she may be considered a regional author, but her settings include Africa, China, Vietnam, India, Czarist and communist Russia. Listening for Lions is set in 1919 British East Africa (now in Kenya). Whelan also writes short stories and poetry for adults.

The first run was in 2005. The race is held on the Surfside public beach, along the Gulf of Mexico, from Surfside to San Luis Pass and back again. The beach is largely undeveloped and extremely hill covered with hard packed, smooth sand. Since it is one of the only marathons in the world run entirely on sand, runners have joined from all over the country and even as far away as Ethiopia, Japan, and Uruguay. Running on sand may result in slower times, approximately 30 seconds per mile more than the your usual pace, but others say the sand is easier than pavement running and great for long runs. In 2007, Stephen Baumgartner was the first runner to break the 3 hour mark finishing in 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 44 seconds. The race begins and ends at the Stahlman Park pavilion on the beach. After the race, a post-race party is held at the scenic park, overlooking the gulf, with plenty of Texas-style BBQ available. Features Each year both the full and half races feature: * Miles of uninterrupted, peaceful beach * Unique shirt to commemorate the event * Event stone drink coasters * Custom designed finisher medals * Imaginative age group awards * Texas-style BBQ after the event * Friendly helpful volunteers * All the sand you can carry home in your shoes!

It is a remake of Strikers 1945 II, which was released earlier in 1997 on multiple platforms. In the game, players chooses one of the six fighter planes to fight against the F.G.R. organization, who leaked information of weapons by the now-disbanded C.A.N.Y. forces. Though first released in arcades, the title was later ported and re-released through download services to other platforms, each one featuring various changes compared to the original version.  Gameplay  P-38 Lightning engaging in a battle against Battle Air Ship Iron Casket. Strikers 1945 Plus is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to Strikers 1945 II, where players chooses one of the six World War II-era fighter planes through eight stages, with the first four being played in random order.Strikers 1945 Plus arcade flyer (SNK, US) Players collect weapon power-ups, bombs and gold bars for points. Each plane is equipped with a unique \\"supershot\\", which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored but the number varies from plane to plane. Using a bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds. Unlike previous entries, Plus is played on a horizontal screen but in a cropped view with each side showing a status bar, while alterations to the gameplay had been made. A respawn system where players immediately starts at the location they died at is used. A hit by enemy fire results in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and the game is over once all lives are lost, unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Synopsis  It is winter of 1945 and the Strikers have successfully eliminated C.A.N.Y.'s forces. The fierce fight was considered a militarist coup d'√©tat disapproving the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. The threat posed by C.A.N.Y. enshrouded the world in the shadow of war. Meanwhile, data on C.A.N.Y.'s new weapons, tightly sealed by the US Department of Defense was leaked by a new organization, codenamed \\"F.G.R.\\", threatening to drag the world into the chaos of war once again with it. Upon learning of the situation, the Strikers, who had been appointed as a new weapons development experimental unit, were convened once again as protectors of the world!

History  * April, 2014 - Genesys Aerosystems acquired Chelton Flight Systems and S-TEC Corporation.S-TEC AND CHELTON FLIGHT SYSTEMS ACQUIRED IN MBO Cobham Sells S-Tec and Chelton Flight Systems * November 10, 2006 - CFS was granted FAA STC approval of the EFIS in the Eurocopter EC 120B helicopter. * September 21, 2006 - CFS was chosen to supply the EFIS for MD Helicopters' light singles program. * 2006 - CFS joins GlobalFlyer in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. * April 30, 2006 - The M28 Sky Truck from Landmark Aviation delivered its first CFS EFIS equipped aircraft. * June, 2001 - Cobham plc acquired Sierra Flight Systems and renamed the company Chelton Flight Systems. * 1997 - CFS founded. A tragic accident on October 15, 2002 claimed the lives of two Chelton Flight Systems employees and seriously injured a third. The accident occurred when their aircraft struck trees while landing at a private airstrip near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in clear conditions. The pilot, Grant Bailey, and the rear passenger, Barry Boepple, were killed instantly. Nate Calvin, Vice President of Engineering, was thrown clear of the wreckage and received a broken leg and several lacerations. System Overview Their aim was to provide a safer way to fly by reducing the number of accidents. This was achieved through enhancing situational awareness with real-time 3-D Synthetic vision, which shows where the plane is headed. Synthetic Vision allows the pilot to see at night or in inclement weather. A Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) was created which alerts the pilot when he is flying too low. Software was also developed that calculates real-time fuel consumption data; so the pilot knows how much fuel is left to burn. The system employs a Highway-In-The-Sky approach, HITS creates a virtual 3-D tunnel which is flown through. The single display integrates many stand alone instruments to provide the operator with information immediately. FlightLogic Electronic Flight Information Systems (EFIS) has a supplemental type certificate (STC) on over 740 aircraft. Design Concepts Chelton Flight Systems uses a two-display setup to bring the glass cockpit to general aviation. One display is the primary flight display (PFD). A PFD is defined as a display that provides all the information necessary for a pilot to control the aircraft. This includes pitch, roll, heading, altitude, airspeed and vertical speed information. In essence, the \\"six pack\\". A multi-function display (MFD) displays supplementary information. The difference between the PFD and MFD is that the MFD has a satellites view of the world. The terrain awareness and warning system is a very useful feature that has visual and auditory cues to alert the pilot of obstacles or terrain in the flight path. Traditionally the TAWS is a separate unit, however CFS has integrated it into their displays. This is the same for the Flight Management System. The FMS is also included in the display unit. The FMS is a complete navigation system providing all ARINC 424 leg types with a Jeppesen database. Instrument approaches, waypoints, and high and low victor airways are part of the FMS.

Dissertation title: √úber die Ausstrahlung bei der Bremsung von Protonen und schnellen Elektronen.Otto Scherzer ‚Äì Sommerfeld Project: Doctorate for Scherzer, 1931. From 1932 to 1933, Scherzer was an assistant to Carl Ramsauer at the Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts-Gesellschaft, an electric combine with headquarters in Berlin and Frankfurt-on-Main. There, he did research on electron optics.Hentschel, 1966, Appendix F, p. XLV and Appendix D, p. XII. He completed his Habilitation in 1934, and he then became a Privatdozent at LMU and an assistant to Sommerfeld.Sommerfeld Biography ‚Äì American Philosophical SocietyPaul Kirkpatrick Address of Recommendation by Professor Paul Kirkpatrick, Chairman of the Committee on Awards, American Journal of Physics 17 (5) 312-314 (1949). In this article, the following students of Arnold Sommerfeld are mentioned: William V. Houston, Karl Bechert, Otto Scherzer, Otto Laporte, Linus Pauling, Carl Eckart, Gregor Wentzel, Peter Debye, and Philip M. Morse. Career In 1935, Scherzer moved to the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt Later known as the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt after the naming convention change in Germany. In 1936, he became an extraordinarius professor and director of the theoretical physics department.Hentschel, 1966, Appendix F, p. XLV. In a landmark 1936 paper, Scherzer proved that the spherical and chromatic aberrations of a rotationally symmetric, static, space-charge-free, dioptric lens for electron beams cannot be eliminated by skillful design, in contrast to the case for glass lenses.O. Scherzer √úber einige Fehler von Elektronenlinsen, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik Volume 101, Numbers 9-10, Pages 593-603 (1936) as cited in Peter Hawkes - The Long Road to Spherical Aberration Correction. This was later called Scherzer's theorem and is the only named and well-established theorem in the field of charged particle optics. In 1947, Scherzer published a sequel to this paper proposing various corrected lenses, dependent upon abandoning one or other requirements as set forth in the 1936 paper.O.

Scherzer‚Äôs derivations contributed to the development of electron microscopy. From 1939 to 1945, Scherzer worked on radar at the communications research headquarters of the German Navy (Nachrichtenmittel-Versuchskommando der Kriegsmarine). In a communication with Sommerfeld, dated 2 December 1944, Scherzer reported war damage in Darmstadt and commented on his work on radar.Personnel Data ‚Äì Sommerfeld Project From 1944 to 1945, Scherzer was head of radar finding research (Arbeitsbereich Funkmesstechnik) for the Reich Research Council (Reichsforschungsrat),The Reich Research Council was formed in March 1937 by Bernhard Rust, a Reich Minister in the Reich Education Ministry.

JHS serves students in the Jacksonville and McAlmont communities and is administered by the Jacksonville North Pulaski School District (JNPSD). In 2007, Jacksonville requested to become separated from the PCSSD and form its own school district, but a final decision has not been made on that request.  History  On May 18, 1907, the Jacksonville Special School District was formed and remained in existence until 1927 when the Pulaski County Special School District consolidated the county's school districts except North Little Rock and Little Rock school districts. Jacksonville High School's primary rival school is North Pulaski High School, Jacksonville's other secondary school which is located on the west side of the city. Jacksonville is home to Little Rock Air Force Base, featuring one squadron known as the 50th Airlift Squadron Red Devils, perhaps the inspiration for the school mascot of Jacksonville High School. Maybe the reverse is true, as the JHS sports teams went by the name \\"Red Devils\\" many years before the 50th Airlift Squadron was located to LRAFB in 1973 and as the 50th Airlift Squadron had different squadron insignia during WWII & the Korean War. In 2014, the people of Jacksonville voted to break away from Pulaski County Special School District, and form their own school district. An interim school board should be named this fall.  Academics  The assumed course of study for students follows the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). Students complete regular (core and career focus) courses and exams and may select Advanced Placement (AP) coursework and exams with the possibility to receive college credit. As of the beginning of the 2014‚Äì15 school year, the school is currently in year 11 of school improvement and is utilizing the national transformation model for school improvement in efforts to spark student achievement. As part of the transformation model requirements, Jacksonville High School brought in administrators with track records of school improvement with the intention of turning the school around. In addition, the school was granted $5.7 million in a technology grant that has provided the school with interactive whiteboards, student response systems, laptops or tablets, and other classroom technologies for educational use in order to improve student achievement at Jacksonville High School. Furthermore, teachers at Jacksonville High School are being offered extensive professional development and training as part of school improvement. Professional development is centered around literacy and mathematics and is provided through programs such as Advanced Placement training through the AP College Board, Laying the Foundation, and the Literacy and Mathematics Design Collaborative. However, with the advancement of Common Core curriculum and PARCC testing, teachers in all subject disciplines are able to receive training, often at no cost to themselves. The school is currently ranked as the 5th worst school in the state due to low test scores on major end-of-course examinations for Literacy, Algebra I and II, Geometry, and Biology. Currently part of the highly troubled Pulaski County Special School District, Jacksonville High School may experience more autonomy in its future, as residents in Jacksonville voted to separate from the district in order to form a unitary and autonomous Jacksonville school district. Previously, the district's involvement in a desegregation lawsuit hindered progress to this end, but a judge has since ruled that the district and other districts involved in the initial lawsuit are released from desegregation penalties. The new Jacksonville North Pulaski School District is expected to be full force by the 2016-2017 school year.  Athletics  In 2013, the boys and girls basketball teams each won the 5A classification state basketball championship. Jackson Price Eubanks is the all-time leader in field goal attempts and field goal misses throughout the 2008-2010 seasons. Also a notable statistic from year 2010 was when Eubanks received All star All state in soccer, and co captain Kyle Stroup did not. For the 2012‚Äì14 seasons, the Jacksonville Red Devils participated in the 5A Classification within the 5A-Central conference as administered by the Arkansas Activities Association. The Red Devils compete in football, volleyball, basketball (boys/girls), soccer (boys/girls), competitive cheer, baseball, softball, and track and field (boys/girls). The 6A Conference members include: Russellville Cyclones Greenwood Bulldogs Jonesboro Hurricanes Pine Bluff Zebras Benton Panthers Searcy Lions West Memphis Blue Devils Lake Hamilton Wolves El Dorado Wildcats Marion Patriots Mountain Home Bombers Arkansas Razorbacks Jacksonville Titans Hall Warriors Siloam Springs Panthers Sheridan Yellow Jacket Home football games are played at Jan Crow Stadium located on the campus, which is named for the former team doctor. For the 2008‚Äì12 seasons, the Jacksonville Red Devils participated in the 6A-East Conference with Jonesboro Golden Hurricane, Little Rock Hall Warriors, Little Rock Parkview Patriots, Marion Patriots, Mountain Home Bombers, West Memphis Blue Devils, and Searcy Lions. = State championships = The Red Devils and Lady Red Devils have won 13 state championship titles in school history, to include: * Arkansas State Football Champions: 1976, 1978, 1981 * Arkansas State Girls Golf Champions: 1994, 1995, 1996 * Arkansas State Boys Basketball Champions: Class 6A - 2009 (Jacksonville-63, LR Hall-62); Class 5A - 2013 (Jacksonville-56, Alma-53) * Arkansas State Girls Basketball Champions: Class 5A - 2013 (Jacksonville-54, Paragould-43) * Arkansas State Boys Track and Field Champions: 1970, 1982 * Arkansas State Baseball Champions: 1987, 2011 Notable alumni The following are notable people associated with Jacksonville High School.

He was a three-time Professional Bull Riders (PBR) World Champion Bull, winning the title in consecutive years from 2002 to 2004. At the time, his three titles made him unmatched by any bull in the history of the PBR. He was also inducted into the North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame for his accomplishments. He was the son of #77 Yellow Jacket and the grandson of #LH600 Wrangler Rivets. Little Yellow Jacket's three-time World Champion Bull record has since been matched by #13/6 Bushwacker, who received his third title in 2014, his year of retirement and Bruiser from 2016 to 2018. When Bruiser won his third title in 2018, he tied Little Yellow Jacket's record of three consecutive titles. Little Yellow Jacket was sometimes referred to as the \\"Michael Jordan of professional bull riding\\" and had his own line of merchandise. It was said he was the greatest bull in the PBR when he was selected to the receive the inaugural Brand of Honor. In Little Yellow Jacket's day he had the largest following of any PBR bull. Later, the bull Bushwacker was deemed to surpass Little Yellow Jacket as the best PBR bucking bull of all time.  PBR career  Little Yellow Jacket was bred on the Berger family ranch, named Rafter Arrow Ranch, in Mandan, North Dakota, by Joe Berger and his son Nevada. \\"'You can't train him to be a bucking bull,' said Berger on LJ's natural talent. 'It's about breeding and blood lines. He got it bred into him. The only thing you can train him is to not buck in the chute.'\\" After Tom Teague of Tom Teague Bucking Bulls got involved with the PBR, he became interested in Little Yellow Jacket. In 2002, Teague tried to persuade owner Joe Berger to sell him a half interest in Little Yellow Jacket while in Denver, Colorado, but Berger would not do so until Little Yellow Jacket had won a World Champion Bull title. Later that year the bull won his first title and Teague approached Berger again. Berger named his price and Teague didn't even haggle, just paid it outright. Later, Englishman Bernie Taupin, a songwriter for Elton John, who has been fascinated with Western culture since childhood, managed to purchase an interest in the bull. Little Yellow Jacket made his debut in the PBR in the year 1999 and went to his first PBR World Finals that year. Little Yellow Jacket competed in the major leagues of the PBR - the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) (known as the Bud Light Cup Series until 2003) starting in his first year. From the beginning to the end of his career, Little Yellow Jacket was said to either \\"help a rider earn a score in the elite 90s or he'd serve up a dirt sandwich\\". The bull seemed to know when he won. After he bucked someone off, he would seek his owner Joe Berger out for his approval. He might also show himself off to the crowd. \\"They'd put him in the chute and he'd go out, throw the guy off and would prance around, and it was like he was saying, 'I knew I could bust your rear,'\\" Tom Teague said. \\"But if a rider happened to ride him, he'd better look out, because Little Yellow Jacket just might try to hook him.\\" But in the end, Little Yellow Jacket never hurt anyone. He mostly had a reputation for being a gentle bull. As a rule, he \\"would not only not try to come after his fallen rider, but would try to avoid and move around the grounded rider\\". Early on in his career, Little Yellow Jacket earned respect from Ty Murray, a bull riding champion and a PBR co-founder, who had been described as the \\"King of the Cowboys\\" and has been referred to as the greatest cowboy of all time. At the PBR World Finals in 1999, Ty scored a 90.5 on Little Yellow Jacket. And it was Little Yellow Jacket's first time in the BFTS. \\"He was then was a young bull that I had no idea about,\\" Murray said. \\"And when I got off of him, I told Cody Lambert, 'Wow! That bull is the real deal!\\" To clarify, 90+ point rides are scored only by elite riders on top bulls, so the PBR keeps special statistics for them called the \\"90 point club.\\" All of Little Yellow Jacket's 14 qualified rides were scored at 90 points or higher except one. Another of Little Yellow Jacket's common meetups was with Michael Gaffney, who described Little Yellow Jacket as \\"the total package.\\" \\"He bucked, kicked, changed directions and had as much intensity as any bull he had seen. Gaffney said all the components made for a 'full load' when you nodded your head. There was nothing easy about his pattern in which Gaffney vividly remembers there being a hop, skip and even a hesitation (when needed) that would rock riders back on their pockets before bringing them down over his front end. And, of course, his power only compounded the difficulty.\\" Gaffney is only one of two riders who scored two qualified rides on Little Yellow Jacket. The other is Cory McFadden. He was successfully ridden by only 12 bull riders for 14 rides in 90 recorded tour outs on the BFTS. He has been ridden 15 times in 93 rides at all levels. He went on to become the World Champion bull three times (2002-2004). Cody Lambert, who was himself a bull rider when younger, said of Little Yellow Jacket at the time, \\"He's the greatest bull that the PBR has ever seen,\\" He became the first bull to win three world titles and also finished runner-up to 2-time World Champion bull #81 Dillinger in 2001. Bruiser has since tied Little Yellow Jacket's record of three consecutive titles when he won his third title in 2018. At the end of his career, Little Yellow Jacket had a buck off rate of 83.53%, with an average buck off time of 2.66 seconds. Before his death, the bull was scheduled to be the inaugural inductee in the PBR's Brand of Honor, and would have been honored in person at a ceremony at the 2011 PBR World Finals. However, Little Yellow Jacket died earlier in that year before the ceremony, which took place without him just prior to the 2011 World Finals opening.  Historic rides  Michael Gaffney and Chris Shivers are two of three riders that still holds the record for the highest marked ride in PBR history. = High Marked Ride = In a record that still stands as of 2017, only three men recorded a score as high as 96.5, doing so on four different bulls between 1999 and 2004: Bubba Dunn rode Promise Land in 1999. Chris Shivers rode Jim Jam in 2000, and Dillinger in 2001. Michael Gaffney rode Little Yellow Jacket at Nampa in 2004. Going to meet him in Nampa, Idaho, both rider and bull had earned fierce reputations and world titles. Michael Gaffney had attempted Little Yellow Jacket twice before and been bucked off each time without a qualified ride. One of those times was just one week prior in Colorado Springs. Gaffney is one of many bull riders who describe Little Yellow Jacket as one of the great bucking bulls in history. \\"'He had the heart of a champion', Gaffney said. 'I think, he was born that way.'...He had intensity and power and, according to Gaffney, 'he was a full load.'\\" He weighed between 1,700 to 1,800 pounds throughout his career. > \\"Nothing was in short supply for him,\\" said Gaffney, who described Little > Yellow Jacket's first move out of the chute as being a \\"slump jump\\" that > included a hop, skip and a hesitation. \\"I had been on him several times > previous to that final day, in Nampa, where I eventually got him rode,\\" > Gaffney said. \\"I had him the week before in Colorado Springs and he had > that, like I said before, that signature move ‚Äï that step out, hop and skip > and kind of rock you back on your (butt) and then just bring you down over > the front end.\\" He then explained, \\"I really made an effort of over > extenuating my posture when I left that day, in Nampa, and that was key > because once he did get in the spin he still did wind up, have the kick and > the speed and the power ‚Äï that old saying is 'you get tapped off' and I was > there. I pulled a foot and helped myself out. I was feeling great and gave > that aggressiveness that I want to have when I was in the position I was.\\" \\"He was the ultimate bull,\\" Gaffney said. \\"He had the attitude and the heart and everything else.\\" Gaffney faced Little Yellow Jacket again later that year \\"in the final outing of his own career\\" in the eighth round of the PBR World Finals and scored 93.75 points. = Million Dollar Ride = At the World Arena in Colorado Springs in 2003, 2000 PBR World Champion Chris Shivers had a chance to ride him for $1,000,000. \\"A police escort accompanied the bull to the Colorado Springs Broadmoor Hotel, where he was penned in the parking lot on a bed of green, symbolizing money, and the lighting fixture above his head was a chandelier.\\" Both rider and bull had to attend a weigh-in before the event. Shivers weighed in at 145 pounds, and Little Yellow Jacket weighed 1,600 pounds. Chris was bucked off in less than two seconds, and the bull's owners received $50,000. \\"Though Shivers took being dumped hard at the time, the legendary cowboy views the bout as a great promotion for pro bull riding\\". \\"That's probably one of the biggest moments in PBR history, and I'm just glad that I was involved in it,\\" Shivers said. This event at the Colorado Springs Invitational Rodeo was the fifth time that Little Yellow Jacket had bucked Chris Shivers off. \\"He's one of the greatest bulls in the world,\\" Shivers said after the ride. \\"My hat's off to him.\\" This event reflected the ability of Little Yellow Jacket, as PBR wrote an article about the high skill level of Chris Shivers in 2013. This article spoke about Chris being the rider who set the 90-point standard. Chris recorded 94 qualified rides in excess of 90 points or better. And yet he did not score one qualified ride on Little Yellow Jacket. , Chris Shivers still holds the record for most 90+ point rides.  Pedigree  Little Yellow Jacket was a dark red Brangus bull. He weighed about and had one horn pointing upward and one downward. Little Yellow Jacket and his foremost ancestors are registered with American Bucking Bull, Inc. (ABBI). His sire was #77 Yellow Jacket and his dam was a Berger cow. His grandsire was #LH600 Wrangler Rivets and his grandam another Berger cow. His mother was killed in a torrid winter storm in 1997. His sire, Yellow Jacket, was the 1999 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. Yellow Jacket was owned by Big Bend/Flying 5 Rodeo at the time of his death. Both Little Yellow Jacket and his sire are listed in the top fifteen bulls in the Top 500 Bull Historical Ranking. Wrangler Rivets was a champion bucking bull who won 13 competitions as a bucking bull. Wrangler Rivets was also a two-time North American Rodeo Commission (NARC) Bull of the Year. His cousin Moody Blues was 1998 PBR World Champion Bull (the title used to be Bull of the Year).  Retirement and death  Little Yellow Jacket's owners, a partnership of Joe and Nevada Berger, Bernie Taupin, and Tom Teague, retired him at the end of 2005. Little Yellow Jacket was kept in a pen when the truck/trailer would pull up to take the other bulls away for the bull riding events. He would throw a fit because he wanted to go with them. Other times he spent in the pasture so he had exercise, company, and breeding with the cows. Berger also sold his sperm for artificial insemination at $700 per straw. Little Yellow Jacket would wake up mornings in his pen and command the other bulls to come \\"join him for a drink of water\\". He was definitely the dominant bull at the ranch. Occasionally, adult visitors were guided to the ranch to view Little Yellow Jacket. After the Bergers had kept Little Yellow Jacket at their ranch in North Dakota and had bred him for awhile, Tom Teague, who owns Teague Bucking Bulls and who held a half interest, asked to buy the full interest in the bull. The Bergers honored his request, so that Little Yellow Jacket could live at Teague Bucking Bulls in North Carolina instead of North Dakota and enjoy milder winters. Joe Berger's son Chad was managing the bulls by this time. Little Yellow Jacket spent his last five years at Teague's ranch. Teague held great regard for Little Yellow Jacket and took special care of him, providing the bull superb feeds, climate control, companionship, and at the time of his death, there remained several pregnant cows. Little Yellow Jacket died in Graham, North Carolina, on September 19, 2011, at the age of 15. \\"Little Yellow Jacket was a tremendous athlete, and the mere mention of his name brings great memories to fans of our sport,\\" said PBR CEO Jim Haworth. \\"He will certainly be remembered as one of the all-time greats.\\" The home page of Teague's website is a memorial to the bull.

Shailkupa has an average literacy rate of 66.3% (7+ years) compared to the national average of 32.4%. History In the Pleistocene era, in the middle of the formation of the land of Bangladesh, the land formed in this region by the sandy soil of the Ganga River of the Bengal delta and the settlement of people continued to grow. Although there is no significant information about the prehistoric period, the first human settlement was developed in this area in the second millennium BC. In ancient times, people of various ethnic groups started to live in search of a fertile land for livelihood and developed human habitation here. In the anthropological analysis, a Shankar Nation settled in this region in the mix of small sections of different ethnic groups. The Austric influence is much more pronounced in terms of language strains in this region. According to the writings of Greek and Latin historians, this region was known as Gangaridai, a powerful nation whose capital was Gangarzia. Pareshnath Majumdar presumed this Gangarajaya belongs to Jessore district, which is mentioned in the history book of Satish Chandra Mitra's Jessore-Khulna. It was under the Maurya Empire between 500 and 200 BC. Later it came under the Samatata Kingdom during the reign of Samudragupta (340-380). In the Gupta era, the Samatata state is divided into administrative units namely Bhukti, Bisoy, Mandal, Bithi and Gram. When Ballana Sena (1160-1179) ruled the Bengal region, Karkata Nag established a kingdom in Shailkupa opposing the Sena caste system. It came under the British rule in 1786, and Shailkupa thana was established in 1863. In 1889, the people of 48 villages revolted against the British in the historic Indigo Revolt. During Pakistan period (1947-1971), Shailkupa was an important administrative unit. Hundreds of freedom fighters participated in the Liberation War of Bangladesh and freed Shailkupa from Pakistani occupation forces on 13 November 1971. Naming Though there is no significant document about how Shailakupa was named or what is the source of naming, but there are some source of naming in various articles. Many people said that during the reign of Sultan Nasir Uddin Shailkupar was Nasirabad. An ancient mound can be found in the village of Harihara near Shailkupar. It was estimated that it was the house of a powerful Hindu feudal king named Medieval Harihar Raja. During this time, a commander of the dynasty sent an army commander to settle in the area and now settled at Pathanpara near Shailkupar. Then there is the love of Shailabala, daughter of Harihara, with a son of the Pathan tribe. At one stage, the youngster came to the bank of the river to ride with the shayalabala. King Harihara send people in different areas to find the daughter. Shailabala is caught with her boyfriend at the hands of the king's people. When he sent the news to the king, he came to the bank of the Kumar river along with the soldier and could not control angry and killed his daughter with a sword. For this the people named Shailakupa after the name of Shailabala. Administration Shailkupa has 15 unions, 211 Mauzas/Mahallas, and 258 villages. Karcher Kole union is one of the larger unions. The largest union in Shailkupa is Umedpur holding no.13. The river Gorai flows to the north-east of Shailkupa while the main town is located on the river Kumar. Geography Shailkupa is an upazila of Jhenaidah district under Khulna division of south- western region of Bangladesh. Shailkupa upazila is 373.42 square kilometers.

Heritage Shailkupa Shahi Mosque: Shailkupa Shahi mosque, which is situated on the bank of the Kumer river, is a remarkable sign of the martyrdom of the Sultanate in southern Bengal. The mosque is in dargapara of Shailkupa. The length of the tall mosque in the north-south (inward) 31.5 ^ 21 feet. The walls are about 5.5 feet wide. There are four domes in the four corner of the mosque. It is ornamented by round and swirling bands. The monuments rise above the mosque. The eastern wall of the mosque has two entrances and two entrance in north and south walls. The central entrance of the eastern wall has a solid monument on either side and it is slightly lower than the corner tower. The carnival of the mosque is paved; inside the west wall three mehrab, Central Mehrab is larger in size. The five feet high two pillar are in the mosque. Above them are brick arches. Six domes were built on these two euphemisms and on the four sides of the wall. These are quite small in size. The mosque is mainly made of brick. There is so much reform and addition to this mosque that it is not easy to properly solve what its original structure was. The central entrance and the angle of the monuments may possibly be later added. However, it is easy to understand the mosque of the Sultanate period. 27 martyrs of Kamanna: 1971's Liberation war of Shailkupa has become history.

Schi√∏tz is credited as being Norway's first professor of ophthalmology. He was born in Stavanger, Norway. In 1877 he received his medical degree from the University of Kristiania (now University of Oslo) later studying ophthalmology in Vienna, where he befriended Ernst Fuchs (1851-1930), and in Paris, where he was employed as \\"directeur adjoint\\" in the ophthalmology laboratory at the Sorbonne. In 1884 he became head of a polyclinic for ear, nose, throat and eye diseases in Kristiania. Dating from 1898, he started teaching ophthalmology at the Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet. He was dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1914 to 1916 and retired in 1921. He was also a skilled technician and mathematician. While in Paris, he invented a keratometer with Dr. Louis √âmile Javal that was to become known as the Javal-Schi√∏tz ophthalmometer, an optical instrument used to measure the curvature of the anterior corneal surface. He presented an early version of the instrument at the international congress of eye specialists in Milan (1880), and demonstrated the finished product at the international medical congress in London (1881). In 1905 Schi√∏tz invented the \\"Schi√∏tz tonometer\\", which is an indentation tonometer used to measure intraocular pressure.

The bank was established in 1953 and started operations in 1956. Its headquarters are in Damascus, with 11 branches in the provincial capitals. The objective of the bank is \\"to foster the stability, integrity and efficiency of the nation‚Äôs financial and payment systems so as to promote optimal macro economic performance\\". The CBS issues Syria's currency, the Syrian pound and sets the intervention price in the foreign currency market for the Syrian pound on a daily basis. The CBS exercises control over all banks operating in Syria. History  At independence, French- and British- owned banks dominated banking activity in Syria. The largest bank, the French- owned Banque de Syrie et du Liban (Bank of Syria and Lebanon), assumed central bank functions and became the bank of currency issue, in addition to its commercial operations. In 1947 Syria joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and fixed the exchange rate at 2.19 Syrian pounds to US$1. The law to establish the Central Bank of Syria was passed in 1953, but the bank did not operate until 1956. Its functions included issuing notes, controlling the money supply, acting as fiscal agent for the government, and controlling credit and commercial banks. It was also to act as the country's development bank until specialized banks were established for various sectors. The Central Bank had considerable discretionary powers over the banking system but was itself responsible to and under the control of the Council on Money and Credit, a policy group of high-ranking officials. After the 1956 Suez War, French and British banking interests were seized as enemy assets. In 1958, and after the union with Egypt, the state began to Arabize the commercial banking system and in 1961 implemented a policy of limited nationalization. In 1966, the state nationalised all commercial banking, merging all existing commercial banks into a single consolidated Commercial Bank of Syria. The government also created specialized banks to promote economic development. Banking and Monetary Policy International sanctions The United States has imposed sanctions against the Central Bank of Syria since May 2004, under Section 311 of the Patriot Act, with the Bank being accused of money laundering. The sanctions shut Syria out of the global financial system. To circumvent the sanctions, Syrians effect foreign transactions through banks in neighbouring countries, especially Lebanon, but making them vulnerable to economic disruptions in those countries. Because of the government's actions in the Syrian Civil War, the U.S., Canada, EU, Arab League and Turkey have all imposed sanctions on Syria, including the Syrian Central Bank. The Syrian Central Bank has been actively trying to undermine these various sanctions, with bank officials meeting friendly institutions such as Gazprombank executives in Moscow in March 2012. The Bank has taken an increasingly clandestine role in the domestic private sector as the country's failing economy has deterred foreign investment. Gold reserves In April 2012, Reuters reported that since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Syria's gold reserves have been cut in half from the pre-civil war level of about $17 billion, with the Syrian government using the reserves to cope with international sanctions. The Governor of the Central Bank Adib Mayalah has sought to deny these reports. This is similar to how the Syrian government is using its foreign reserves to meet the demands of a budget deficit which has greatly increased to about US$6.7 billion. Attacks on bank Since the start of the Syrian Civil War, the Central Bank building was attacked three times: in April 2012 a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the building; in April 2013 it was affected by a car bombing nearby; and in October 2013 it was hit by mortar shells.

His book Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of the Modern World (2000) on a 6th AD climatic disaster has had a mixed reception ‚Äì he and his theory were featured in the 2000 Television pilot to the PBS series, Secrets of the Dead 6th Century catastrophe theory Keys' book Catastrophe: An Investigation into the Origins of the Modern World (2000) theorizes that a natural disaster caused changes during the 6th and 7th centuries in the Christian world that included the end of ancient civilization and initiated what is now known as the medieval era. Key's work expands on that by Mike Baillie in Exodus to Arthur: catastrophic encounters with comets (1999) in which the primary evidence for the event is dendochronology (shown by narrow rings around c. 540 CE), as well as acidity in Greenlandic ice cores (suggesting volcanic activity), as well as accounts of historians such as John of Ephesus, Procopius, and Cassiodorus on changes in climate, including dimming of the sun. Keys adds further information from East Asia and develops his own version of the theory; he attributes the changes to a volcanic event in East Asia, in 535 AD, possible at Krakatoa. The work has received mixed reviews: Publishers Weekly criticized the book, writing that \\"Huge claims call for big proof, yet Keys reassembles history to fit his thesis, relentlessly overworking its explanatory power in a manner reminiscent of Velikovsky's theory that a comet collided with the earth in 1500 B.C.\\"Publishers Weekly A mainly critical review in The New York Times Book Review by Malcolm W. Browne concluded that \\"Still, this book must be taken seriously, if only as a reminder that survival in a world threatened by real dangers hangs by a very slender thread\\". British archaeologist Ken Dark commented that \\"much of the apparent evidence presented in the book is highly debatable, based on poor sources or simply incorrect. [...] Nonetheless, both the global scope and the emphasis on the 6th century AD as a time of wide- ranging change are notable, and the book contains some obscure information which will be new to many. However, it fails to demonstrate its central thesis and does not offer a convincing explanation for the many changes discussed\\". Archaeologist Brian M. Fagan referred to it as \\"investigative journalism\\" and \\"an interesting and, at times, compelling narrative (and good television)\\" concluding that \\"Keys is right to draw attention to the importance of short- term climatic change, but, in our present state of knowledge, the deterministic and somewhat sensationally written Catastrophe goes too far.\\" See also *Extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536 References External links * David Keys - History and Archeology Consultant/Specialist Category:British science writers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David Keys (author)"},{"id":"9513040","text":"Stereotypes of Asians may refer to: *Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States, ethnic stereotypes of East Asians found in American society as well as other Western societies. *Stereotypes of South Asians, oversimplified ethnic stereotypes of South Asian people in Western societies.

It was the fourth film that included a collaboration of Sandler as actor and Dugan as director. The film revolves around Zohan Dvir (), an Israeli army counterterrorist commando who fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream of becoming a hairstylist in New York City. The story was written by Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Robert Smigel. It was released on June 6, 2008, in the US and on August 15, 2008, in the UK. The film grossed $204.3 million worldwide from a $90 million budget. Plot Zohan Dvir (Adam Sandler) is a superhuman Israeli counter-terrorist and is the most feared and respected soldier of the Israel Defense Forces. Despite his constant success however, he has grown tired of the everlasting conflicts in his country and dreams of becoming a hairstylist at Paul Mitchell's in the United States. He finally admits to his parents his desire to cut hair, but they make fun of him. During his next mission against a Palestinian terrorist group led by his arch-enemy, superhuman Fatoush \\"Phantom\\" Hakbarah (John Turturro), Zohan fakes his own death and smuggles himself onto a plane to New York City, cuts his hair, and adopts the alias \\"Scrappy Coco\\" after two dogs (Scrappy and Coco) whom he shared the flight with. Following his \\"success\\" at killing Zohan, Phantom opens a restaurant chain called Phantom Muchentuchen. After his arrival in the United States, Zohan immediately goes to Paul Mitchell to ask for a job. The stylists there laugh at him. He tries other salons but is also refused by other salons due to his lack of experience. Zohan befriends Michael (Nick Swardson) after defending him against a bullying motorist, and is taken in by him and his mother, Gail (Lainie Kazan). Michael is shocked to walk in on Zohan and his mother having sex. Zohan tells him \\"it's natural!\\" and it's clear Zohan loves the ladies. Zohan then meets a fellow Israeli named Oori (Ido Mosseri), who owns an electronics store, at a disco; Oori recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret. Zohan is taken by Oori to an area in lower Manhattan populated with Middle Eastern immigrants, including Palestinians and Israelis. Zohan attempts to land a job in a struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), but Dalia only allows Zohan to sweep the floors. But when one of her stylists unexpectedly quits, leaving her customers high and dry, one of the customers wants Zohan to cut her hair. He puts on a sexy shampoo bowl show and gives her an exceptional haircut, with a back room sex bonus. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the elderly women of lower Manhattan, causing Dalia's business to prosper, which upsets Grant Walbridge (Michael Buffer), a corporate magnate who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a rollercoaster mall. Zohan is eventually identified by a Palestinian cab driver named Salim (Rob Schneider), who bears a grudge against Zohan for having taken his goat away in Palestine because Salim spat on him. Salim convinces his friends, Hamdi and Nasi, to help him kill Zohan, but after several failed attempts they are forced to contact Phantom and convince him to visit New York to find Zohan. Meanwhile, Zohan has fallen in love with Dalia and comes clean to her, Michael and Gail about his true identity. After Dalia rejects Zohan for his counterterrorist background, Zohan decides to leave her to protect her, and confronts Phantom in a championship Hacky Sack game sponsored by Walbridge. Zohan's fight is cut short with sudden news of the Middle Eastern neighborhood block being attacked, and he quickly departs. At the scene of the fire, Zohan calms the Israelis and Palestinians, who each blame the other for the violence, and makes peace with Salim. Phantom then appears and confronts Zohan, but Zohan refuses to fight. Dalia appears, revealing that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, revealed to be racist rednecks hired by Walbridge to instigate an inter-ethnic riot so he can get his new mall in the aftermath. As Zohan and Phantom work to save the block, Phantom admits that he always wanted to be a shoe salesman rather than a terrorist. Although the rednecks are defeated and Walbridge is jailed, the overexcited Phantom accidentally destroys all of the shops on the block with his powers. With the Israelis and Palestinians united, the block is rebuilt and transformed into a collectively owned mall. Phantom opens a shoe shop there; Oori relocates his electronics shop to the mall; Salim gets back his goat (and starts a goat ride business); and Zohan and Dalia, having now married, open a beauty salon together. In the end, Zohan's parents, initially unsupportive of his dream to be a hairdresser, show up, approving of his new job and lifestyle before his father requests that he cut his hair, which Zohan happily does.

Apatow left the project after the first draft in 2000 to work on his show Undeclared and had, for the most part, not been involved in the project since. The film is based in part on the story of Nezi Arbib, an Israeli soldier who after his service moved to southern California and opened a hair salon. Sandler trained with Arbib and his brothers, also former soldiers, for two weeks to learn hairstyling and work with clients. The movie features elements that first appeared in the SNL sketches \\"Sabra Shopping Network\\" and \\"Sabra Price Is Right,\\" which starred Tom Hanks and were written by Robert Smigel. They originated lines such as 'Sony guts' and 'Disco, Disco, good, good'. The first sketch is also notable for featuring one of Adam Sandler's first (uncredited) television appearances while the second featured Sandler, Schneider, Smigel and Kevin Nealon in supporting parts. Robert Smigel worked with Sandler on past films including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky, but this was the first time in which he was credited for helping to write the script. He was also an executive producer on the film which allowed him to further contribute to the movie's comedic sensibility. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz commented that the movie was known in Hollywood circles as \\"the Israeli movie.\\" Haaretz also noted that while \\"Israeli actors were rushing to audition [for the movie],\\" the response among Arab actors was far from enthusiastic. (Emmanuelle Chriqui, who played Zohan's Palestinian love interest, was raised as an Orthodox Jew.) The film poked fun at the popularity of hummus in Israeli culture. In the movie, characters used it to brush their teeth and as a method to douse the flames of a fire,Marks, Gil (2010), Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley and Sons, pp. 269‚Äì271‚ÄòZohan‚Äô Film Styles a New Israeli Hero, Rebecca Spence.

June 19, 2008 Soundtrack The score to the film was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams. He recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage in April 2008. The soundtrack contains many songs in Hebrew, mostly by the popular Israeli band Hadag Nahash, the psychedelic trance duo Infected Mushroom, and Dana International. The film features \\"Strip\\" by Adam Ant, \\"Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango) (Angel City Remix)\\" by Bananarama, the Ace of Base songs \\"Hallo Hallo\\" and \\"Beautiful Life\\", the Rockwell song Somebody's Watching Me and Mariah Carey songs Fantasy and \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\". The soundtrack contains (near the end) music re-arranged for the movie by Julius Dobos, based on the song \\"Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja\\" from the Bollywood movie Disco Dancer (1982) starring Mithun Chakraborty. Reception =Critical reception= Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 37% based on 188 reviews; the site's consensus is that the film \\"features intermittent laughs, and will please Sandler diehards, but after a while the leaky premise wears thin.\\" Metacritic gives the film a rating of 54 out of 100, based on 37 reviews‚Äîindicating mixed or average reviews. John Podhoretz, in The Weekly Standard, wrote that the movie has a \\"mess\\" of a plot and features, \\"as usual for Sandler, plenty of dumb humor of the sort that gives dumb humor a bad name, but that delights his 14-year-old-boy fan base.\\" But the film also has an \\"unusual\\" amount of \\"tantalizing comic ideas\\" so that \\"every 10 minutes or so, it makes you explode with laughter.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the movie a C+ grade, calling it \\"another 'mess' from Sandler\\" which is, unlike Monty Python, a \\"circus that never flies.\\" On the positive side, Time claimed the film to be a \\"laff scuffle,\\" and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.Movie Review: You Don't Mess With the Zohan (PG-13). Roger Ebert. June 6, 2008. David Edelstein of New York Magazine went as far as to say \\"Adam Sandler is mesmerizing,\\" and A.O.

Determined to remedy the lack of siege weapons and of coordination that had ruined his first, he obtained artillery, engineers and miners, and more soldiers. He planned for horses, meat on the hoof, forts for staging of men and supplies, and roads to carry the army and its accouterments. Bienville selected a route up the Mississippi River this time, after receiving assurance from an engineering survey that artillery could be transported overland from there to the Chickasaw villages. A supply depot was built on the western bank of the Mississippi River at the mouth of the St. Francis River. Fort de l'Assumption was built across the Mississippi on the fourth Chickasaw Bluff, at the Margot (present day Wolf) River, to receive men from throughout New France. Three detachments reached the rendezvous in August, 1739: de Noyau with a vanguard from New Orleans, de la Buissioniere from Fort de Chartres with militia and two hundred Illinois, and C√©loron with a 'considerable number of Northern Indians' and a company of cadets from Canada. As in 1736 the southern force was slow. Bienville finally arrived in November and reviewed the force which numbered 1200 Europeans and 2400 Indians, roughly twice the men available in 1736. But the army had already suffered greatly from sickness. To this was added short rations, discontent and desertion during the 'imbecility' of the coming months. 120 miles remained to reach the Chickasaw villages, an easy march for men with rifles, but a different matter for a siege train. As soldiers built carts and wagons, Bienville ruled that the route laid out by the engineer was too low, and that rains had made it impassable. By January 1740 a highland route was blazed, but in the meantime high water interrupted the supply of provisions and the position at Fort de l'Assumption was becoming untenable. Even then the army remained, until in February a council of war decided that they could not march 'without hazarding the reputation of the king's arms'. Finally, in March, C√©loron struck out with his corps of cadets, one hundred regulars, and four or five hundred Indians. Traveling light, and following much the same route as d'Artaguette in 1736, this force quickly reached the villages. C√©loron allowed his Indians to do what they would, and meanwhile remained open to any offers of peace. After several days of useless skirmishing, negotiations were opened. Suffering under steady Choctaw pressure, and impressed by the massive preparations at Fort de l'Assumption, the Chickasaws had long been giving hints that they would be reasonable. The French demanded that all remaining Natchez be bound over. The Chickasaw replied that most of the Natchez were hunting or had left their lands permanently, but with delivery of several Natchez and French prisoners, peace was confirmed. The Chickasaw were quiet for several years afterward, but continued their trade with the British and had nothing to lose by resuming their aggression. A heavy army with siege equipment could not reach them through the wilderness. A light army could reach them, but was useless against their fortified villages. Bienville lamely claimed victory, and if it were not a victory, at least he had taken all possible precautions. But the expedition had cost more than three times the normal yearly expenses of the entire colony of Louisiana with no visible result. Hundreds of men had been lost to disease - including 500 of the 1200 Europeans at Fort de l'Assumption. The incredible months-long delay there lacks definitive explanation, although internal politics and a reluctance to engage without heavy equipment have been advanced as possible reasons.

The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago was established by an Act of Parliament on December 12, 1964. In particular, the Bank's main responsibilities are to issue and redeem currency; maintain monetary and financial stability; act as banker to the government as well as the commercial banks and protect the external value of the Trinidad and Tobago Dollar (TT Dollar). The Central Bank is the only institution in the country which is authorised to issue currency notes and coins. The Central Bank is responsible for: the design of the currency; the maintenance of its integrity and providing an adequate supply of currency to satisfy the needs of the public. for open market operations The Bank became the 100th member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion in 2013. Additionally, it has made a Maya Declaration Commitment to transform the National Financial Literacy Programme into a National Training Institute for Financial Inclusion by the conclusion of 2014. The institute will work with key stakeholders to develop a National Financial Inclusion strategy based on the G-20 principles of leadership, co-operation and empowerment. The financial inclusion strategy will focus on the major pillars of financial education and financial consumer protection.  Challenges  In its 40 years of existence, the Bank has faced many challenges, some a direct result of exogenous shocks, others because of the impact of domestic policies. When the Bank was established in 1964, Trinidad and Tobago was part of the sterling area which provided for full convertibility of the local currency into sterling. The Ministry of Finance administered exchange controls against other currencies. The late 1960s and early 1970s were characterized by great turmoil both at home and abroad. The external source of turmoil was linked to continuing concerns about the strength of sterling and the TT dollar/sterling peg. In November 1967, when the pound sterling was devalued, the TT dollar was adjusted by the same amount to maintain its sterling parity. In 1970, the administration of exchange controls was delegated to the Bank, sterling was subject to exchange controls and the TT dollar peg was shifted from the pound sterling to the US dollar at a rate of TT$2.40 per US dollar. The Defence Finance regulations of 1942 under which exchange controls had been administered was replaced by a new Exchange Control Act in 1970. The domestic turmoil of the early 1970s came in the form of socio-political upheaval, and what came to be known as the Black Power Revolution. One outgrowth of this upheaval was the movement towards the localisation of commercial banks, initiated by the Government but with the Bank playing an important role. In the mid-1980s, the Bank faced a major threat to the financial system when oil prices slumped and the economy slipped into recession. Several non-bank financial institutions (NFIs) failed due to weak internal controls and excessive exposure to the real estate market. Initially, the Bank, in conjunction with the commercial banks, provided short-term financial support. When it was clear that the problem was not one of liquidity but insolvency, the Bank moved to close down five of the NFIs. The crisis of the finance companies was to absorb a great deal of the energy of the Bank's leadership in the mid-1980s. In 1986, as a result of lessons learnt from the NFI crisis, several amendments were made to the Central Bank Act and the Financial Institutions (Non-Banking) Act. The amendments conferred special emergency powers on the Bank to intervene in financial institutions to protect the interests of depositors and creditors. They also established the Deposit Insurance Corporation as a subsidiary of the Bank. The amendments were quite timely as the Bank utilized them that same year to close five NFIs. The Bank was also called upon to intervene in the Trinidad Co-operative Bank in 1986 and in the Workers' Bank in 1989. In 1993, the Bank moved to merge the three indigenous institutions ‚Äì National Commercial Bank, Workers' Bank and Trinidad Co-operative Bank ‚Äì to form the First Citizens Bank (FCB). These actions were designed to avoid losses for depositors and forestall systemic problems in the banking system. The role of the Bank in the formation of FCB is considered as a major achievement in the Bank's history and represents a shining example of an innovative and successful restructuring exercise in the Caribbean. From its inception, the Bank saw itself as having a developmental role. Consistent with this orientation, from the start of the decade of the 1980s, the Bank became involved in a number of institution-building initiatives. Thus, for example, the Bank worked to establish the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange and the Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust Corporation in 1981. In 1986, in collaboration with the commercial banks, life insurance companies, the National Insurance Board and the International Finance Corporation, another familiar institution was established: the Home Mortgage Bank.  Reform of the monetary framework  Prior to the establishment of the Bank in 1964, and in the aftermath of World War II, monetary policy and management were largely conducted by several different institutions. The British Caribbean Currency Board, which was established in 1951, issued and redeemed currency with little or no consideration of prices or credit conditions in the domestic economy. The credit policies of the foreign banks were managed by Headquarters and foreign exchange matters were administered by the Exchange Division of the Ministry of Finance. With the passage of the Central Bank Act (No. 23 of 1964), the Bank took responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary Policy refers broadly to those actions and decisions undertaken by the Bank to create appropriate monetary conditions in line with the developmental objectives of the country. The conduct of monetary policy is influenced significantly by the pace of real economic activity, the fiscal operations of the government, capital inflows and the operations of the commercial banks. These factors impact on liquidity and in turn affect inflation, foreign exchange reserve holdings and the exchange rate. The Bank's monetary policy objectives and tools have had to constantly adapt to the needs of a rapidly changing domestic and international economic environment. The monetary policy framework of the Bank has as its primary objectives, the maintenance of: *a low and stable rate of inflation *an orderly foreign exchange market *an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves As noted earlier, Trinidad and Tobago passed through a major economic and financial crisis in the second half of the 1980s consequent to the slump in oil prices. In addition to a rapid rise in inflation, the country experienced acute balance of payments and debt servicing difficulties. In an effort to help address this situation, initially, the Bank was called upon to administer a dual exchange rate regime and an exchange control system to severely curtail foreign exchange outflows - the system known as the EC zero system. This was essentially a form of strict foreign exchange budgeting to permit traditional importers and other users to receive an allocation of foreign currency on a quarterly basis for the year ahead. When the reliance on these controls proved to be ineffective the Government adopted a new strategy involving the negotiation of a stabilisation and structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the negotiation of debt rescheduling agreements with creditor banks and the Paris Club. In the context of these agreements, the Bank, in the early 1990s embarked on a comprehensive programme of financial sector reform geared to liberalise the financial system as well as to modernise the Bank's prudential and supervisory framework. In recent years the Bank has continued to refine its monetary policy framework and upgrade its regulatory and supervisory regime to bring it more in line with international best practices. The new monetary framework introduced in 2002 uses the repo rate (the rate at which the Bank is prepared to provide overnight financing to commercial banks) as the principal instrument to indicate the desired direction of bank interest rates and to convey the desired monetary policy stance. The Bank has also implemented a phased reduction in the reserve requirement applied to commercial banks. The business of the Bank will continue to evolve as the domestic and international financial environment changes. In addition to its traditional functions such as monetary policy, financial system supervision, its responsibility for currency and management of reserves and its research function, new horizons are emerging. These include improving the country's infrastructure, as evidenced by such initiatives as the reform of the payment system, strengthening the government securities market and participation in the regional credit rating agency and the Automated Credit Bureau.

The first building, also known as the Territorial Prison, was constructed in the Territory of Idaho in 1870; the territory was seven years old when the prison was built, a full two decades before statehood. From its beginnings as a single cell house, the penitentiary grew to a complex of several distinctive buildings surrounded by a sandstone wall. The stone was quarried from the nearby ridges by the resident convicts, who also assisted in later constructions. The Old Idaho Penitentiary is operated by the Idaho State Historical Society; the elevation of the site is approximately above sea level. Prison history Over its 101 years of operation, the penitentiary received more than 13,000 inmates, with a maximum population of a little over 600. Two hundred and fifteen of the inmates were women. Two famous inmates were Harry Orchard and Lyda Southard. Orchard assassinated former Governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905 and Southard was known as Idaho's Lady Bluebeard for killing several of her husbands to collect upon their life insurance. Serious riots occurred in 1952 1971 and 1973 over living conditions in the prison. The 416 resident inmates were moved to the new Idaho State Correctional Institution south of Boise and the Old Idaho Penitentiary was closed on December 3, 1973. In 1992, the Idaho State Historical Society recorded oral history interviews with fifteen former prison guards. These tapes and transcripts cover prison operations and remembrances from the 1950s to the closing of the prison. The collection is open for research at the society. Prison Buildings The Territorial Prison was completed in 1872 and received its first 11 inmates from the Boise County Jail. This building was converted into a Chapel in the 1930s and was destroyed by fire in the 1973 riot. The New Cell House (1889‚Äì1890) consisted of three tiers of 42 steel cells. The third tier closest to the Rose Garden served as \\"Death Row.\\" The area now known as the Rose Garden (as this is what it is now) was once used to execute prisoners by hanging. Of the 10 executions in the Old State Penitentiary, six occurred here. The Administration Building (1893‚Äì1894) housed the warden's office, armory, visitation room, control room and the turn key area. The False Front Buildings (1894‚Äì1895) held the commissary, trusty dorm, barber shop (1902‚Äì1960s) and hospital (originally the blacksmith shop, but was remodeled in 1912 and remained the prison hospital until the 1960s). The Dining Hall (1898) was designed by George Hamilton (an inmate at the time) and burned down in the 1973 riot. Cell House 2 (1899), also known as the \\"North Wing,\\" contained two-man cells. A honey bucket was placed in each cell to serve as a toilet. Inmates burned the building in the 1973 riot. Cell House 3 (1899) was built the same as Cell House 2. It was eventually condemned for habitation, but in 1921 was converted into a shoe factory. In 1928, this building was remodeled for inmate occupancy and became the first cell house with indoor plumbing. Layout of the penitentiary The Women's Ward (1905‚Äì1906) was built out of necessity. Prior to its completion women did not have separate quarters. Male inmates built a wall around the old wardens home to serve as a separate facility for women. This building had seven two-person cells, a central day room, kitchen and bathroom facilities. This building held the infamous Lyda Southard. Built by inmates, the Multipurpose Building (1923) served as a shirt factory, shoe shop, bakery, license plate shop, laundry, hobby room, and loafing room and housed the communal showers. Solitary confinement consisted of two sections. The first, built in the early 1920s, was the Cooler. Although built for solitary confinement, each cell contained 4‚Äì6 men. The second section, known as Siberia, was built in 1926 and housed twelve cells, with one inmate per cell. Cell House 4 (1952) was the largest and most modern cell house at the penitentiary. Some inmates painted their cells and left drawings on the walls that can be seen today. Cell House 5 (1954) was Maximum Security where the most unruly and violent offenders stayed. This building also served as a permanent place of solitary confinement. It includes a built-in gallows and \\"Death Row.\\" Although not a building, there is also an outdoor Recreational Area where inmates boxed and played baseball, basketball, handball, tennis, horseshoes and football. The baseball, and later softball, team was named \\"The Outlaws\\" and frequently played teams from across the Treasure Valley.Idaho State Historical Society. Old Idaho Penitentiary State Historic Site [Brochure]. Boise, ID: ISHS. Museum and Historical Society The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for its significance as a Territorial Prison. The site currently contains museums, an arboretum and is a facility managed by the Idaho State Historical Society. In late 1999, J.C. Earl donated his personal collection of historic arms and military memorabilia to the state of Idaho. These items were placed on exhibition as the J.C. Earl Exhibit at the Old Idaho Penitentiary. They range from the Bronze Age to those used today for sport, law enforcement, and military purposes. The Luristan Bronze collection dates to about 1000-650 BC.

It can be twice the size of an American hot dog.Chilean hot dog and sandwiches History =Origins= The dish was first made in the 1920s in the fuentes de soda (soda fountains) of central Santiago. The completo was brought to Chile by Eduardo Bahamondes who had recently travelled to the United States on business. It was there that he first saw the \\"hot dog\\" which he decided to bring back to his home country. Once back in Chile, he then opened a restaurant in Santiago's historic centre called Quick Lunch Bahamondes where he began to introduce the Chilean people to the hot dog. Recipe =Ingredients= Most completos contain some or all of the following ingredients: *Avocado - Not to be confused with guacamole, traditionally only salt is added to the avocado before it is put on the completo. *Tomato - Fresh tomato is a favourite in Chile. Typically tomatoes are peeled before they are diced for completos. *Mayonnaise - Chile is the country with the third highest consumption of mayonnaise per capita on earth. It is therefore a very popular completo topping. Completo mayo in Chile tends to be house made as this remains the preferred method of preparation by Chileans. *Sauerkraut - Introduced to Chile by the large wave of German immigrants it received in the 19th century, sauerkraut is now completely accepted as being a staple food in Chilean cuisine. *Salsa Americana - A form of relish, what is commonly referred to as americana is a finely chopped or blended mixture of pickle, pickled carrot and pickled onion. =Variations= Throughout Chile, specific names are used to describe the different variations of completos: *Completo: Sometimes referred as completo-completo in order to differentiate it from the other variants, it's the most traditional version. Its ingredients include chopped tomatoes, mayonnaise (a large amount), sauerkraut and salsa americana. *Completo Italiano or simply Italiano: topped with chopped tomatoes, mashed avocados and mayonnaise, this variation is widely viewed as the most popular.\\"D√≠a del Completo\\": Conoce las diez preparaciones m√°s populares de Chile The name comes from its resemblance with the colors of the Italian flag. *Din√°mico (\\"Dynamic\\"): A mix of the aforementioned ingredients (tomatoes, avocados, mayonnaise and sauerkraut) or salsa Americana. *Completo A lo Pobre (\\"Poor man's completo\\"): Made with fried onion, french fries and a fried egg on top of the hot dog. The \\"poor man's\\" in the name is due to the fact that the main ingredients were ones historically favoured by low wage workers. *Tomate mayo (\\"Tomato-mayo\\"): As its name suggests, it is a version with only chopped tomatoes and mayonnaise.Combinations of the Chilean completo =Similar International Variations= The completo is also a type of hot dog eaten in Brazil, which generally includes mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, corn, peas, tomatoes, onions, Parmesan cheese and fries.

It is a small nocturnal animal with large eyes, greyish fur and a long tail. P. furcifer is a specialist feeder on the gum that exudes from insect holes on the surface of certain trees, but it supplements its gum diet with insect prey. This primate is monogamous and a single offspring is born in November or December. It is declining in numbers due to habitat destruction, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being endangered. Description The Masoala fork-marked lemur is so-called because the black stripe along its spine divides on the crown, the two forks continuing on either side of the head to the eye and along either side of the muzzle. The rest of the pelage is some shade of reddish or brownish grey. The head-and-body length is in the range , with a tail of . This lemur typically weighs between . Distribution and habitat This lemur is endemic to northeastern Madagascar. Its range extends from the Masoala Peninsula southwards to Toamasina and it is present at altitudes up to about . It occurs in moist lowland forests. Ecology The social system of the Masoala fork- marked lemur has been described as pre-gregarious. Some adults live as monogamous couples, sharing the same nest hole by day but moving about independently for at least part of the night (the male often follows a few metres behind the female), but a few live as solitary bachelors or have ranges overlapping more than one female. The average size of a female territory is with a male territory averaging . The lemurs sometimes gather at the places where the territories overlap; there is no aggression on these occasions, but much vocalisation for a period of ten or twenty minutes. The animal moves on all fours, running rapidly along branches, climbing and jumping, mostly at a few metres above the ground, but descending to the forest floor on occasion. The diet consists mainly of the natural gum of trees in temperate deciduous forests. The Masoala fork-marked lemur has become specialized for harvesting this substance. Like most lemuriform primates, it has a toothcomb; in Phaner species, the toothcomb has evolved to be more robust and is used to scrape the gum that exudes from holes on a tree made by insects. This structure consists of a row of lower incisors that are long and forward pointing. The favoured food sources are trees in the genus Terminalia, but certain other tree species also provide gum, including Adansonia spp., and the buds of Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa. Certain beetle larvae burrow just under the bark of Terminalia and leave characteristic galleries that ooze gum. This lemur has also been observed licking the flowers of Crateva greveana, and feeding on a \\"syrup\\" produced by insect larvae on thin branches of Rhopalocarpus lucidus trees. This species is nocturnal and has a territory containing about three exclusive Terminalia trees and access to about nine more in overlapping territories. The animal emerges at dusk from its sleeping hole in a large tree such as a baobab, or the abandoned nest of a Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli), moving directly to each Terminalia tree in turn, feeding on the gum and moving on to the next tree. It has a complex itinerary which it regularly follows, and later in the night it visits other less-favoured gum- sources and returns to the previously visited trees and gleans any gum it has missed. The same Terminalia trees are exploited by day by a bird, the crested coua (Coua cristata), which also feeds on gum. Gum is low in nitrogen content, and the Masoala fork-marked lemur needs to supplement its diet with animal prey, which it stalks on the tree bark and among the foliage, catching it with its hands and stuffing it into its mouth. Hunting takes place late in the night when the main gum-gathering activities are over. The animal's faeces are invariably found to contain fragments of insect chitin. In captivity this lemur was found to be very selective about what it ate, rejecting grasshoppers, beetle larvae and small lizards, but feeding avidly on a large moth and a praying mantis. The male and female are in frequent vocal communication throughout the night, but this species in unusual among nocturnal lemurs in not communicating through olfactory signals, and the urine and faeces are allowed to drop to the forest floor. A large cutaneous gland on the throat of the male is used during social grooming when males, females and juveniles groom each other, and the male may rub the gland on the female. The female comes into estrus for three to four days in June, giving birth to a single offspring in November or December. This remains in the nesting hole of the parents at first, but as it gets older it is carried by the mother, clinging to her underside, and when it gets larger, to her back. Status The P. furcifer population is suspected of being in decline as its forest habitat is being destroyed by timber harvesting and slash-and-burn agriculture. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and receives some protection from being present in several national parks, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being endangered.

From the mention of its name by Virgil among the Sabine cities which joined in the war against Aeneas, The Aeneid vii. 711. we may presume that it was considered as an ancient town, and one of some importance in early times. Solinus write that it was established by Greeks in honor of Hera, thus and the name of the city which is after Hera.Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10 It never bears any prominent part in history, though from its position near the frontiers of the Sabine and Roman territories, and on the line by which the former people must advance upon Rome, it was the scene of repeated conflicts between the two nations. The first of these occurred in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, during the war of that monarch with the Sabines;Dionys. iii. 32. his successor Tarquinius Priscus also defeated the Etruscans, who had taken advantage of the friendly disposition of the Sabines to advance through their territory, at Eretum; Id. iii. 59, iv. 3. and Tarquinius Superbus gained a decisive victory over the Sabines in the same neighbourhood.Id. iv. 51. Under the Roman republic also we find two victories recorded over the Sabines at the same place, the one by the consuls Postumius and Menenius in 503 BCE, the other by Gaius Nautius Rutilus in 458 BCE.Id. v. 46; Livy iii. 29. During the decemvirate also the Sabines established their headquarters at Eretum, whence they ravaged the Roman territory.Livy iii. 38; Dionys. xi. 3. It is again mentioned in the Second Punic War as the place whence Hannibal diverged to attack the shrine of Feronia in Etruria, during his advance on Rome (or, according to others, on his retreat) by the Salarian Way.Livy xxvi. 11. But though its position thus brings it frequently into notice, it is clear that it was, under the Roman dominion at least, a very inconsiderable place. Strabo says it was little more than a village, and Valerius Maximus terms it vicus Sabinae regionis. Pliny does not even mention it among the towns of the Sabines, nor is its name found in the Liber Coloniarum: hence it is almost certain that it did not enjoy municipal privileges, and was dependent on one of the neighbouring towns, probably Nomentum (modern Mentana). But its name is still found in the Itineraries as a station on the Salarian Way, and it must therefore have continued to exist as late as the fourth century. From this time all trace of it disappears.Strabo v. p. 228; Valerius Maximus ii. 4. ¬ß 5; Itin. Ant. p. 306; Tab. Peut. The position of Eretum has been a subject of much dispute, though the data furnished by ancient authorities are sufficiently precise. The Itineraries place it 18 miles from Rome; and Dionysius in one passagexi. 3. calls it 140 stadia () from the city, though in another placeiii. 32. he gives the same distance at only 107 stadia. Strabo adds that it was situated at the point of junction of the Via Salaria and Via Nomentana; a circumstance which could leave no doubt as to its position, but that there is some difficulty in tracing the exact course of the Via Salaria, which appears to have undergone repeated changes in ancient times. Hence Abb√© Capmartin De Chaupy was led to fix the site of Eretum at a place called Rimane, where there were some Roman ruins near a bridge called the Ponte di Casa Cotta, but this spot is not less than 21 miles from Rome; on the other hand, Monterotondo, the site chosen by Cluverius, is little more than 15 miles from Rome, and could never by possibility have been on the Via Nomentana. Grotta Marozza (a localit√† of the comune of Mentana), on the left hand of the Via Nomentana, rather more than 3 miles beyond Nomentum, has therefore decidedly the best claim: it is 17.5 miles from Rome, and it is probable that the ancient Via Salaria did not follow the same line with the modern road of that name, but left the valley of the Tiber near Monte Rotondo, and joined the Via Nomentana near the spot above indicated. There are no ruins at Grotta Marozza, but the site is described as well-adapted for that of a town of small extent. Cluverius Ital. p. 667; Chaupy, Maison d'Horace, vol. iii. pp. 85-92; Antonio Nibby, Dintorni di Roma, vol. ii. pp. 143-47; Gell, Top. of Rome, p. 202. At a short distance from Grotta Marozza are some sulphureous springs now known as the Bagni di Grotta Marozza, which are in all probability those anciently known as the Aquae Labanae (the of Strabo, who describes them as situated in the neighbourhood of Eretum.Strabo v. p. 238.

In 1976 he started working with Dave Smith to promote his Model 800 sequencer, and then helped specify the Model 700 Programmer. This association led to development of the Prophet 5, and then on to the entire line of Sequential Circuits products. Bowen was responsible for the original 40 factory programs of the Prophet 5, and as Sequential's Product Specialist created 99% of all of the factory sounds and sequences (as well as the original Prophet VS waveshapes), also contributing to the User Interface (UI) design for the following Sequential products: Prophet 5, Prophet 10, Prophet 600, Prophet T-8, Prophet VS, Drumtraks, 6-Trak, MultiTrak, Tom, Max, Studio 440, and the Prophet 2000 and 3000 libraries. Nielsen Pearson Also during this time, Bowen was bassist and synthesist for the Nielsen Pearson band (1974‚Äì1980), performing on 3 albums with them. He also assisted Billy Cobham in setting up his Moog Modular 55 for various recording sessions (one being Stanley Clarke's 'School Days'), as well as appearing on several other projects, most notably with Herbie Hancock for the Eddie Henderson release, Mahal (Capitol, 1978). From Yamaha to Korg At the end of 1987, Sequential was bought by Yamaha. After a brief stint there, the Sequential design team moved over to Korg, where John was product manager for the Wavestation series (keyboard, AD, and SR racks, 1989‚Äì1992). In 1993 he became part of the original Korg OASYS project team, culminating with the first public presentations of the OASYS keyboard at NAMM and Musik Messe in early '96. After cancellation of the project in September, 1996, John took part in the Korg Z1 voicing. A year later, with the go-ahead from Korg Japan to resurrect the OASYS technology, he found himself back doing UI design for OASYS PCI synths and effects. Creamware In August 1998 Bowen joined Creamware to develop the Modular system used in Pulsar/SCOPE, as well as assisting in some of their other synth design projects. Now working as an independent, he was involved in doing some of the OASYS PCI factory voicing, as well as consulted for Native Instruments in their emulation of a Prophet 5 (called the Pro-52), a VST Virtual Instrument. Later, he helped complete representations of the Pro One and Prophet 5 for the Creamware series of audio cards.

J.P. played regularly at the Coffee Gallery on Grant Street in the early sixties, performing with Meltzer, Gurley and Peter Albin (who later formed Big Brother and the Holding Company) and many others.  Music  J.P.‚Äôs electrified banjo playing on the raga-rock epic ‚ÄúThe Endless Tunnel,‚Äù from David and Tina Meltzer‚Äôs album The Serpent Power, featuring their band of the same name, is a rare glimpse of an inspired creative force, and the album has become a collector‚Äôs item. 'The Serpent Power' was released on Vanguard Records in 1966, and is played on radio stations all over the country. This album, The Serpent Power, was named number 28 of 40 Essential Albums of 1967, by Rolling Stone Magazine in a special Summer of Love issue, 2007, honoring the 40th anniversary of the founding of the magazine, with a special mention of the song J.P. plays on, \\"Endless Tunnel.\\" A recent review of the album by forcedexposure.com states ‚Äú‚Ä¶the epic 13-minute-long 'Endless Tunnel,' an Eastern-tinged acid jam spiced up with an electric banjo, is worth the price of admission alone.‚Äù J.P.‚Äôs first album, ‚ÄúIntensifications,‚Äù recorded with Gene Estribou in the ballroom-turned-recording studio of Gene‚Äôs San Francisco Haight Ashbury mansion in 1965, was originally released on Henry Jacobs' MEA label, and was recently re-issued by Locust Music and has found an enthusiastic new audience.  Life  J.P. was born in Vernon, Texas, the only son of Paul Desmond and Lula Muriel Pickens. Barbara Sue, his older sister, was born in 1934. In 1948 the family moved to Los Angeles, California, where J.P. met his future wife, Mary Ann Bielat. J.P. and Mary Ann married in January 1955 and had three children, Kay Anne, born July 21, 1955, in Los Angeles, California, Cheryl Lynne, born December 29, 1956, in Los Angeles, California, and Paul Desmond, born August 10, 1959, in Portland, Oregon. J.P. and Mary Ann lived in the Los Angeles area early in their married life, and they became friends with Beat artists such as George Herms, Frank Stewart, Wallace Berman and David and Tina Meltzer. J. P. loved music and the joy of creating it, and he loved all music: Ralph Stanley, Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, Billie Holiday, Doc Boggs, Mainer‚Äôs Mountaineers, Don Gibson, Jo Stafford, Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs, The New Lost City Ramblers, Doc Watson, Charlie Parker, Lennie Tristano, Django Reinhardt, Mavis Staples, The HiLos, The Abyssinian Gospel Choir, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix, as well as Eddie Lang, Bix Beiderbecke, Robert Johnson, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Ray Charles and Howlin Wolf, just to name a few of the record albums he owned and listened to regularly. He had studied the piano and saxophone in a formal way, then picked up the guitar, finally settling on the banjo and learning to play bluegrass, a genre that seemed to offer him joy and freedom. J.P. was a complex, intelligent and highly creative individual, as well as a devoted family man, an artist and an accomplished musician, and was well known for his fondness for collecting things. Anything and everything, wherever he went, he collected stuff. His obsession with collecting sprang from his belief that all objects were art, all objects have beauty and were worthy of standing alone as art or of disassembling and re-working to enhance the art inherent within. He had been inspired and influenced by his beatnik artist friends, and by the revolution in the art world earlier last century that produced the Dada/Anti- Art movement and the found object philosophy of Marcel Duchamp. The family lived for a while in Topanga Canyon, and at the top of their driveway was a large garage, used by Frank Stewart as an art studio for his paintings, later becoming the site of a 1962 'Tap City Circus' art/ music party/happening, hosting a number of bluegrass and other musicians, who showed up, looked at the paintings and George Herms's junk art sculptures, drank wine and jammed all day. J.P. also had a passion for the written word, and in 1958 he owned a bookstore in Portland, Oregon, ‚ÄúDays and Nights,‚Äù and carried many titles from Grove Press, which was at that time embattled in court for distributing Henry Miller's works, among others. Later when he lived in Lagunitas, (western Marin County) he worked at the Discovery bookstore in San Francisco. He loved to tell his friends about buying books from people who had just shoplifted them from the City Lights Bookstore up the block. J.P. embraced the philosophy put forth in Jan Yoor‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe Gypsies.‚Äù That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined his adult life and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would go out at night with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish. Intensifications Album cover A restless, creative man, J.P. found it hard to settle down in any profession, and the family moved often. In 1963 they relocated to Lagunitas, a small town located in western Marin County, California, into a house bought for the young family by J.P.‚Äôs parents. San Geronimo Valley was a sleepy, rural community, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s, hippies and musicians were drawn to the beauty and lush charm of the area. For a short time both the Grateful Dead and the band Big Brother and the Holding Company lived in rustic summer houses or camps nearby. The Pickens house overflowed with hippies, visiting artists and musicians from the Quicksilver Messenger Service, Electric Flag and The Youngbloods. The pastoral roads surrounding the house were filled with hippie families living in converted schoolbuses. Many of the young players in the local acid rock scene were fascinated with J.P.'s rapid fire banjo playing, fueled by his love for the east Indian music of Ravi Shankar especially, and he would play raga-like extended compositions loosely based on old bluegrass standards, on his banjo. Many jam sessions were held at the Lagunitas house, lost to posterity but still alive in the recorded psychedelic music of the time; David Meltzer has said his and J.P.'s attempts to fuse jazz, folk, bluegrass, east Indian and rock n roll were ahead of their time, helping to create a musical genre now highly prized, fondly called Marin County Raga Folk. In February 1968 J.P. was set up by an acquaintance (who was looking to reduce his own jail sentence) to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer, and spent some time in jail. In 1969 their home in Lagunitas was lost to foreclosure when J.P.‚Äôs parents stopped paying the mortgage after J.P. refused to enter a mental health hospital for treatment for his addiction to methedrine. J.P. moved his family to the various houses of the commune of the Diggers/Free Family, which was highlighted in the popular book ‚ÄúSleeping Where I Fall,‚Äù written by Peter Coyote, published by Counterpoint in 1998. J.P. died two days after falling out of a second story Tenderloin hotel window to escape the police coming in the hotel room door, intent on raiding an in-progress drug deal. The world lost a creative spirit on July 6, 1973. As Peter Coyote wrote in 1998, ‚ÄúIt was not J.P.‚Äôs music, his adventurous spirit, his quest to live free and improvisationally, his fascination with ‚Äústuff‚Äù, nor mine, which exacted these exorbitant costs, it was drugs and our failures of character and will to refuse them. But we were young men, spending on credit, and the bill had not yet been presented, so, how were we to know?‚Äù As David Meltzer wrote of the friend whose loss he still mourns, ‚ÄúJ.P. exuded such an abundance of the possible and succumbed to the impossibility of realizing it. He was a natural and gifted writer; a profound musician. Irregardless [sic] of the fuel, the drugs, they tapped into a core of creative energy that sought release, expression. We realize our prison only after we design it and move in.‚Äù  Recordings  * Intensifications (MEA, 1965; reissued on CD by Locust Music in 2004) * Serpent Power (Vanguard Records, 1968; reissued on CD in 1996) * Serpent Power \\"Ourobouros\\" (Locust Music, 2007) Quotes and poems ‚ÄúNo man can speak to God for me, nor can he describe the joy I see‚Ä¶.‚Äù \\"When all else fails - do it the right way.\\" \\"Winds blowing through the grey day; Clouds heavy, waiting for a chance to rain; Dawn; Mist off the canal, waters now still.

On September 1, 1937, she collided with NYK‚Äôs Asama Maru in an extraordinarily large typhoon in Hong Kong. She had run aground off the shores of Cape Collinson, and the Asama Maru was at the northernmost part of Chai Wan Bay. The work of refloating the Conte Verde required one month, and the Asama Maru took half a year. From 1938 to 1940, the four Lloyd Triestino ships brought a number of Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria to Shanghai. Nazi persecution intensified especially after Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938. Then the number of the refugees increased dramatically as the ships became their lifeboats.

Two series were produced, with a total of 26 episodes. Synopsis Janus (known in some countries as Criminal Justice) was a spin-off series from the earlier ABC-TV crime series Phoenix. Loosely based on the true story of Melbourne's Pettingill family and the Walsh Street police shootings, Janus follows the bitterly fought prosecutions of a notorious criminal family, the Hennesseys, from the viewpoints of the family, the police and, in particular, the lawyers, prosecutors, barristers and judges involved in all aspects of the story. When the series begins, four members of the infamous Hennessey clan are acquitted of the shooting of two young policemen in a bungled bank heist. The city of Melbourne is shocked as brothers Mal and Steve, along with brother-in-law Darren Mack and friend Ken Hardy, walk free. The prosecutors, judges, magistrates and police‚Äîmany modelled heavily on real-life legal figures‚Äîare determined to put the Hennessey members behind bars if they can. But corruption, legal loopholes, delays, and stretched resources combine to make the quest to jail the group far from straightforward. The operation puts the entire Hennessey clan under observation‚Äîthe matriarch, Shirl; her sons Mal and Steve; daughter Rhonda along with her new husband Darren; and Steve's girlfriend Kirsty (Belinda McClory). Representing the Hennessey family is the unconventional and tough defence barrister, Michael Kidd, played by Chris Haywood. Prosecuting the family is Victoria's newly appointed Crown Prosecutor Vic Manoulis (Jeremy Kewley) and his assistant, young lawyer Rob Griffin (Felix Nobis). And overseeing all of this is the driven and determined cop Peter Faithfull (played by Simon Westaway) who we first got to know in the earlier series of Phoenix. Like Phoenix, this series was produced by Bill Hughes and created and written by Allison Niselle and Tony McDonald. DVD release The first season of Janus was released on DVD in Australia by ABC-DVD in September 2009. The box set, called Janus: Volume One contains all 13 episodes of the first season on 4 x DVDs. It was followed in May 2010 by the ABC-DVD box set release of Janus: Volume Two containing all 13 episodes of the second season on 4 x DVDs.

D. Hirsch, Jr. The Foundation is dedicated to encouraging increased factual content in primary school education. The Role of the Core Knowledge Foundation The Foundation staff serves as the support system for Core Knowledge schools, educators, and parents. The Foundation conducts research on curricula; develops books and other materials for students, parents, and teachers; and serves as a training and communications hub for schools using Core Knowledge. The Foundation has developed a number of publications, including general information packets about Core Knowledge, the Sequences, textbooks, and other supplementary materials for use in conjunction with the Sequence. The Core Knowledge Foundation also offers a variety of staff development workshops to facilitate the process of implementing the Core Knowledge program in schools and hosts an annual national conference, which focuses on the sharing of ideas between educators at every level and making connections across the Core Knowledge network. Implementation of Core Knowledge in Schools The Core Knowledge Curriculum begins in preschool and continues through eighth grade. A group that decides what is important for students to learn is able to consider them culturally literate and then forms the curriculum around those ideas.(Oliva, 2009) The three goals of implementation of the Core Knowledge Curriculum are to teach all of the topics included in the Core Knowledge Sequence, to teach the topics at the grade levels assigned by the Sequence, and to teach the topics to all students whenever possible. Implementation of the Core Knowledge Curriculum and the process required necessitates cooperation between teachers, administrators, and parents. Implementation often occurs over a two- to three- year period, with schools phasing in topics subject-by-subject or adding additional grade levels each year. There are three levels of Core Knowledge schools based on the level of implementation and excellence achieved by the school‚ÄîFriends of Core Knowledge, Official Core Knowledge Schools, and Official Core Knowledge Visitation Sites. Friends of Core Knowledge are schools implementing Core Knowledge at any level, beginning on the first day of implementation. Official Core Knowledge Schools implement 80% or more of the Core Knowledge Sequence and have an eventual goal of 100% implementation. They submit curriculum plans, alignment with state standards, and sample lessons for review by the Foundation. Official Core Knowledge Visitation Sites are schools visited by representatives of the Foundation deemed to be model schools for Core Knowledge implementation. The Core Knowledge Foundation reports that there were 1,260 schools in the US (across 46 states and District of Columbia) using all or part of the Core Knowledge Sequence. As of April 2006, Core Knowledge schools were 44% public, 35% charter, 15% private, and 6% parochial. Additionally, they were 39% urban, 39% suburban, and 22% rural. Criticisms The Core Knowledge system of education has been accused of not encouraging students to think deeply, compose meaningful questions, or develop reasoning skills. =Failing to Teach Creativity= It is argued that creativity can be hindered by the type of information taught. The Core Knowledge model focuses on clear facts with right or wrong answers. This type of information is easy to teach and test, but does not prepare students to be able to think ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù in the way of the real world, which is a messy place without concrete answers. This method keeps the teacher in the active, ‚Äúexpert‚Äù role, and the student remains passive. A passive role does not encourage creative thought. Research has shown that the Core Knowledge Curriculum does not necessarily depress creativity, and may even have a positive impact in increasing students' creativity in some areas.Study Finds Core Knowledge and Creativity Not Mutually Exclusive (January, 2004) http://www.coreknowledge.org/mimik/mimik_uploads/documents/30/CK_Creativity_2004.pdf =Biased curriculum= The curriculum has also received criticism because one group has decided what is ‚Äúbest‚Äù for all students which could end up leaving minorities at a disadvantage (Oliva, 2009). However, Core Knowledge resources and educational materials are particularly effective in reducing educational inequalities,Core Knowledge UKCore Knowledge http://www.coreknowledge.org and research has shown that the fact that Core Knowledge \\"schools with higher percentages of non-Caucasian students consistently scored well above the national average (at or above the 60th percentile) sets these schools apart from their non-Core Knowledge counterparts\\".Core Knowledge Curriculum and School Performance: A National Study (Sept., 2004) http://www.coreknowledge.org/mimik/mimik_uploads/documents/31/CK_National_Study_2004.pdf There is also an argument that by using this method of teaching, the main focus of education becomes creating students that can simply reproduce the culture of the day; this method simply ‚Äúpreserves the status quo‚Äù.

S. Rama Rao under the Creative Commercials banner in Telugu, and by Mukesh Bhatt under the Vishesh Films banner in Hindi, directed by Mahesh Bhatt. It stars Akkineni Nagarjuna, Ramya Krishna, Manisha Koirala in lead roles and music composed by M. M. Keeravani (also known as MM Kreem). both versions were simultaneously shot in Telugu and Hindi and most of the scenes and artists are the same in both versions. The film was inspired by the English film, The Fugitive (1993). This is the last film of the famous Bollywood actor Ajit Khan.  Plot  After witnessing the unfortunate death of a woman, who was unable to afford hospital treatment, Dr. Ajay Kumar (Akkineni Nagarjuna) cancels his planned immigration to the U.S. and instead sets out to develop a plan to open a hospital that will be accessible to people who cannot afford treatment in regular hospitals, called \\"Amma Hospital\\". This draws quite a lot of attention, and he becomes popular, especially with two young women, Dr. Swetha (Manisha Koirala) and ACP Ramya (Ramya Krishna). He falls in love with Swetha and both get married, breaking Ramya's heart in the process. Shortly thereafter, much to their delight, Swetha becomes pregnant. When Swetha discovers a frightening organ-smuggling operation in her hospital while going through a friend's diagnostic report, she calls Ramya. Soon after, Swetha is attacked by a killer and rings the police. Ajay enters their home to find Swetha who soon succumbs to her injuries. The police arrive to find her dead body and arrest Ajay for murder. They deduce that Ajay's motive for killing Swetha was money, as Swetha was a wealthy heiress. Furthermore, she shouted Ajay's name as she was on the phone to the police. The court finds Ajay guilty and is sentenced to death. While being transported to the jail for the sentence to be carried out, the police bus meets with an accident as the other prisoners have staged a riot. Ajay escapes and changes his appearance. The police launch a manhunt for him but are unable to catch him. Ajay goes to Ramya's house to prove his innocence, meanwhile, he used to know Ramya had a crush on him. Ajay catches the real killer and discovers the man behind everything - including the smuggling - was Ajay's friend Dr. Pratap (Sarath Babu). Finally, he reopens the hospital and puts garland on Swetha's picture. He and Ramya remain as friends.  Cast  = Telugu version = * Akkineni Nagarjuna as Dr. Ajay Kumar * Ramya Krishna as A.C.P.

The original series aired for 13 seasons between 1974 and 1985; a new series of seasons began in 2003, with the latest (Season 11) starting in April 2018, each presented in high-definition with surround sound. Some performances have been made available on DVD. The performances are taped on stage at the WTTW television studio in Chicago, as well as large venues throughout the United States. Airing nationally on PBS, MTV Live, CMT, Rave HD, and GAC, as well as internationally in over 20 countries, the program features intimate performances by well established as well as up-and-coming artists. Initial series The series originated in 1972 as Made in Chicago, also taped at and broadcast by WTTW. It presented a dramatic contrast to the way music had been televised until that point; variety shows (such as The Ed Sullivan Show) and lip-synched cabaret shows (such as The Andy Williams Show) were the norm. Made in Chicago (originated by Ken Ehrlich, who had previously produced The Marty Faye Show) foregrounded the music and emphasized live performance and, at times, improvisation. In 1974, the show's name was changed to Soundstage, and it became more widely distributed by PBS.personal interview with Ken Ehrlich, January 2008 Artists who appeared in the early years of the show included figures from rock (Bob Dylan, Tom Waits), pop (the Bee Gees), blues (Bonnie Raitt and Muddy Waters), jazz (Professor Longhair, Dizzy Gillespie, and Benny Goodman, as well as specials dedicated to the Down Beat Readers Poll Award winners) folk (Jim Croce, Janis Ian, Arlo Guthrie, and Harry Chapin), and gospel/soul/R&B; (Al Green and Aretha Franklin).

The first American Basketball Association played from 1967 through the 1975‚Äì76 season and included a team called the Kentucky Colonels. Both versions of the Colonels played in Louisville, Kentucky. Since the departure of the original Colonels in 1976, Louisville had hosted a handful of professional basketball teams including the Louisville Catbirds of the Continental Basketball Association in the 1980s and the Louisville Shooters of the United States Basketball League. Unsuccessful efforts were made to bring the NBA's relocating Charlotte Hornets and Vancouver Grizzlies to Louisville, along with the Houston Rockets at a time that they were demanding a new arena. Then, the ABA 2000 was formed and brought professional basketball back to Louisville. In 2004, the New ABA brought back the Kentucky Colonels to Louisville during the 2004 season. The roster included such names as former Kentucky Wildcats Anthony Epps and Antwain Barbour, former University of Louisville standout Luke Whitehead and Syracuse University alum Jeremy McNeil. In the front office, former NBA veteran Tree Rollins was the general manager and all-time ABA great Lou Dampier was director of player personnel. Henry Bacon was initially named head coach, but after a 2‚Äì5 start to the season, he was replaced by assistant coach Kevin Keathley. Coach Keathley would guide the team to a 19‚àí12 finish overall and a second round playoff loss to the eventual ABA champion Arkansas Rimrockers. Antwain Barbour was named All-ABA for the 2004‚Äì05 season and Coach Kevin Keathley was named an ABA Coach of the Year. The Colonels played three exhibition games in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in the summer of 2005. In 2006, the Colonels finished the season 2‚àí14. On January 4, 2007, the ABA announced that a team called the Kentucky Colonels was going to resume play in 2007‚Äì08, but they will be located in Murray, Kentucky. However, later the Murray team decided to change their name to the Kentucky Retros in deference to the tradition associated with the Colonels name.

History of Badhan  Overview of a residential area in Badhan, Maakhir, Somalia Old Badhan is about 150 years old. The town used to be located in the settlement of Hubeera, which is now located in lowland. It was always in danger of flooding during the raining seasons. About 40 years ago, the town was re-located near a borewell called Badhan and it has assumed the name ever since. The area was first settled in the 14th century by Somali herdsmen from the Warsangali subclan of the Darod clan, as there was water available for their flocks. Badhan is also famous for being the stage of battles between the dervishes of Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and the Sultanate of Warsangeli. Hassan, the leader of dervishes, ordered the construction of a new grand fort in the city. Nowadays, the fort is in need of restoration, as time has worn it down. In July 2007, the district became the capital city of the autonomous Maakhir (Maakhir has rejoined Puntland since January 2009) region of Somalia. Since the start of the Somali civil war, the city has grown to include, among other things, a hospital, three secondary schools, as well as a university in the works since the Maakhir regional authorities was planning to open another university in Buraan, another city towards the East of Sanaag, however that has never happened. Badhan consists of five main neighbourhoods‚Äîgolis, horseed, iftiin waaberi and geeldoora. Local government Women Council members in Badhan district, Somalia On 20 March 2011, a new council District Members and District commissioner, Mr Abdirizak Ahmed Isse and new deputy commissioner, Ms Zainab Abdi Mohamed, was elected on 20 March 2011, the election was observed by the local elders and Puntland interior minister, Abdullahi Ahmed Jama ‚ÄòIlkajir‚Äô, the members of the council districts includes 9 womenhttp://laasqoray.net/news-in-english/year-of-women- in-badhan-womens-leadership-in-local-government-%E2%80%93-badhan-city-sanaag- puntland-somalia and therefore the District of Badhan became the first Somali district to elect this significant elected women council members. In 2006, the local clan elders have chosen Mr Ahmed Muse Suldan as the District Commissioner of Badhan but it has functioned with limited mandate as far as defining and enforcing city Ordinances and the legal responsibility of its members or sub-committee. This is bound to change, hopefully The local Clan elders whom facilitated the current elected district members and district commissioner will served in partnership with Local Government and the community in all matters relating to disputes in trade, property, crime and land distribution. Generally districts in Somalia, the DC positions used to be powerful in local affairs but this has declined since the civil war, therefore, the commissioner's level of powers are limited in terms of the scope of his position given the current Somali political situation. Education Scene of Alfurqan High School in Badhan Since 1997, Badhan has experienced educational revolution, there are three primary and elementary schools in Badhan and three high schools and another one is to be opened soon probably by mid-2009 school year. There are also plans for building Technical College which will provide a much-needed training for both the local residents and high school graduates from other cities and towns of Sanaag Region in order to enhance their employability or the skills to generate income for themselves. Exclusively funded by the Minneapolis chapter of Maakhir diaspora, the current university dean, Dr. Abdirahman Hersi, is convinced that the school will proceed with two undergraduate programs: Education and Computer of Information Science. It will then expand into other essential programs like Health, Business and Finance later on. Horn Relief has its main office in the city and it also runs, among other essential services, a Pastoralist Youth Leadership program for the local pastoralist community around the environs of Badhan City. As of 2008, there are about 5 linguistic private schools which mostly teach Arabic and English. The most well-known language schools operating in Badhan are Lafoole English School and Tawakal English learning centre. Maakhir University Situated in Badhan, the Maakhir University was established in 2009 with the purpose of providing affordable higher education to residents of the province and elsewhere in the nation. According to the institution's website, Maakhir University offers undergraduate degrees with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of Somali society. In 2014, the government of Puntland signed an agreement in Dubai with a Kuwaiti company for the development of facilities at Maakhir University as well as the Garowe International Airport. The deal was valued at US$10 million and was financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. Speaking at the ceremony held for the deal, Puntland Finance Minister Farah thanked Kuwait for helping Somalia stand on its feet again, adding that the flagship projects would boost the local economy and education sector.https://web.archive.org/web/20140416090203/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia- Kuwaiti-Company-to-construct-Airport-University-in-Puntland.shtml In 2017, Puntland debuted newly constructed Maakhir University.https://twitter.com/abdirashidmd/status/904006198566912000 Primary to high school *Alfurqan Primary and Elementary School *Alnour Primary and Elementary School *tayo Primary and Elementary School *Sinai Primary and Elementary School *Alfurqan High School *Alnour High School *Badhan High School Total number of students in Badhan stands at 2994, with the broader Badhan district boasting 5,590 students. Post-secondary institutions * Lafole School of Languages * Tawakal School of Languages * Haji Ayan Community College * Iqra Institute for Higher Education * Maakhir University Transportation =Land= Badhan-Laasqoray road Local people in Badhan District use basic modes of transportation. Small percentage of the district residents own motor vehicles. Since Badhan lies in the centre of Sanaag Region, there are roads from Bosaso to Erigavo that goes through the city, also another road comes from Laasqoray and passes through the city to Laas-Anod in Sool Region, however, these roads are unpaved and travelers go through very harsh terrains. The road that links Badhan to Laasqoray which locals called Geeldora Road is 95 km away. Approximately 60 km of the road traverses the hilly terrains that form Cal Madow Mountains. The existing road is an earth road which is in poor state and especially on the mountainous areas where traffic is ‚Äòone way'. On the flat sections, the road crosses several dry river beds on the first few kilometers after Badhan and just before Laasqoray. The drainage structures / run-off water channels are either poorly formed or collapsed in most of the areas. Condition of the road Main road in the city of Badhan The road is on flat terrain for the first 10 km coming from Badhan though it meanders quite a bit probably brought about by traffic trying to run on the smoothest possible surface. There are no specific obstacles that could be said to cause the wavy traffic movement. After the 50th kilometer, from Badhan, the terrain is mostly downhill. One noticeable feature is that there is an increasingly large number of turns that are much tighter when going downhill compared to the general uphill section from 19 to 50 km when coming from Badhan. Again, cut slope angles need to be improved throughout the section. The downhill terrain continues until 72.5 km from Badhan where the terrain is flat and with loose stones on approaching a dry river bed at 73 km, the upstream edge of the road at that section had some protective gabions which built by the former Somali government. When leaving the river bed, the approach going up was noted to be narrow. Between 77.2 and 77.3 km, again coming from Badhan, the road crosses 3 other river beds. From the last dry river bed crossing on that section, the road route runs almost parallel to the river all the way to Laasqoray. The terrain thereon to Laasqoray is flat. =Air= Landing strip in BadhanBadhan has a landing strip which used to serve as a major airport during the 1980s for oil companies that were exploring oil deposits in the area, However, of the post-government collapse, regular and scheduled flights in or out of Badhan have diminished to a great extent. The nearest airport or landing strip is in Laasqoray. Erigavo airport is also used for Badhan destination. Just after the civil war started in Somalia the UNDP chartered flights used to land the unpaved airstrip on the Southeast of the city which was carrying Warsangeli refugees from Southern Somalia. The airstrip is located within the centre of the city and runs on the South-eastern bound. It is 2 km long and 65 m wide. The grade along the runway rises evenly at approximately 3% and slopes across the runway towards the right at approximately 1.5%. There is a storage / parking / re-fuelling area midway along the runway but no buildings / offices. The airstrip has no storm drain system and most of the edge marker stones are either covered with grass or missing. The runway wearing course is made of in-situ gravel material. Most of the runway surface is covered in silt and overgrown with grass. The underlying rock layer has been exposed on approximately 20% of the entire runway surface. The landing strip was the hub for UN and operations during 1993‚Äì1996 but had fallen into despair since then, however local NGOs are planning to renovate and rebuild it. Conditions of the airport Uniquely designed house in BadhanSince the runway has not been used for nearly 13 years ago. Lack of use and maintenance has led to grass growing all over the runway and generally the airstrip location. The lack of a storm drainage system on either side of the runway has led surface water to form rills / gulleys on the edges of the runway. There are a few edge markers made of well placed stones but those have been covered by the grass overgrowth. The airstrip was constructed by stripping the ground of grass and overburden material and compacting the surface. There are also two access roads that cut across the airstrip leading to dwellings. Repair Overview of Qudloho neighbourhoods in BadhanWithin the airstrip locality, there are no borrow pits nearby only sites where the locals ‚Äòharvest' stones and sand for building purposes. Water is readily available, a grader and roller are the only machines that will be required to rehabilitate the airstrip. With no borrow pits near-by, the best approach to rehabilitating the airstrip would be to strip the runway surface of grass and silt, scarify 100‚Äì150 mm, shape and compact the surface. A side drain should be excavated for on the LHS with scour checks provided at 50m intervals while mitre drains should be provided on the RHS at 100m intervals. The water mains cutting across the runway should be protected; by providing a plastic (PVC) sleeve and haunching (surround) the sleeve with concrete. The PVC pipe size should be reasonable enough so as to act as a service duct for further use in future. Edge markers should also be provided on both edges of the runway. Well arranged stones should be placed at 10 m intervals and painted red every 50 m. The access roads should also be diverted to a single service road on either side of the runway / airstrip area to avoid vehicular traffic going across the airstrip. At some point, an office building will be required at the very least to house communication equipment and maintain records. Public services Badhan has the largest hospital in Sanaag region, built by the Diaspora of the Region, sadly the hospital is closed since February 2009 due lack of funding and now the local community is left to face the daunting task of taking their sick to Bosaso in Bari region. The hospital used to offer all the basic medical needs and it has a Maternity ward but that now is closed too. The local MCH is serving the locals and the city has also many pharmacies which offer first aid and other light medical attention.  Business in Badhan  Overview of a new hotel in Badhan Badhan is a city that is experiencing a period of rapid growth. Similar to any other small town in Somalia, it used to count a population of less than 5,000 residents. However, in the wake of the Somali civil war, Somalis from various different clans who had been victimized in other unsafe parts in Somalia started migrating safe areas of the country including Sanaag region. Badhan, being a save haven for many Somalis, subsequently ballooned in size from a city to a population of over 20,000 and counting. Some small scale business ventures started flourishing, mainly because the location of the city in the middle of Sanaag region and growing local inhabitant, business such as small market for fresh milk, meat and locally produced vegetables have become commonly available in the town. as well in badhan city its also based Construction and contractor Business of Sanaag Construction Company the and participating the rebuilding and growth of the countries developments.

The best period to visit this city is during September‚ÄìMay during the rain season as the heat in the summer is unbearable for outsiders. On the outskirts of the city are rock mountains, grassland with wildlife and unique trees‚Äîa panoramic view.

Wilma's destructive journey began in the second week of October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea and gradually organized to the southeast of Jamaica. By late on October 15, the system was sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center to designate it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four. The depression drifted southwestward, and under favorable conditions, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17. Initially, development was slow due to its large size, though convection steadily organized. From October 18, and through the following day, Wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean; in a 30-hour period, the system's central atmospheric pressure dropped from 982 mbar (29.00 inHg) to the record-low value of 882 mbar (26.05 inHg), while the winds increased to . At its peak intensity, the eye of Wilma was about in diameter, the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane. After the inner eye dissipated due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Hurricane Wilma weakened to Category 4 status, and on October 21, it made landfall on Cozumel and on the Mexican mainland with winds of about . Wilma weakened over the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and reached the southern Gulf of Mexico before accelerating northeastward. Despite increasing amounts of vertical wind shear, the hurricane re-strengthened to hit Cape Romano, Florida, as a major hurricane. Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state, and entered the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida. The hurricane again re-intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. By October 26, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada. Formation Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 16 During the second week of October, an unusually large, monsoon-like lower-level circulation and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the Caribbean Sea. The system was enhanced by diffluence from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic. By October 13, a broad area of low pressure developed and persisted about southeast of Jamaica, possibly aided by the passage of tropical waves through the area at the time. Convection increased and became slightly better organized, though upper-level wind shear initially prevented development. The system drifted westward, and early on October 14 the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper- level wind shear lessened slightly. Later on October 14, the system became much better defined, with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the National Hurricane Center first indicated that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area. Dvorak classifications were initiated on October 15. The system continued to organize, with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane. By late on October 15, the surface circulation became defined well enough, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while it was located about east-southeast of Grand Cayman. The depression tracked slowly westward, a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a high pressure area to its north across the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core; forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, \\"The area of minimum pressure could [have been] anywhere within of its [initial advisory position].\\" Initially, the tropical depression was forecast to drift west-southwestward before turning to the north; within five days of the forecast's issuance, the system was predicted to be located about south of the Isle of Youth as a hurricane. However, the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were \\"all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days.\\" This was due to the depression being located within an environment very conducive for development, specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm water temperatures. As Tropical Depression Twenty-Four drifted southwestward, it steadily organized; by early on October 16, rainbands began to gradually consolidate with well-established outflow, and a large upper-level anticyclone developed over the depression. Although deep convection and banding features increased, mid-level dry air from the north prevented significant organization, and the convection was split into two primary areas. Surface buoy reports indicated that, due to its large size, the system failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression status, even though it received tropical storm strength Dvorak classifications from The National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Satellite Analysis Branch. Continued reconnaissance flights reported peak winds of about . Peak strength Eye of Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity By early on October 17, the outer rainbands, which had previously dominated the structure of the cyclone, dissipated, while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center. Computer models predicted steady strengthening as the depression tracked westward before turning to the north. Of the intensity models, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted an intensity of within 36 hours, with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions. Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600 UTC on October 17, while located about southeast of Grand Cayman. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center predicted Wilma to track west-northwestward, reaching winds of before striking the northeastern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The storm continued to the southwest while deep convection persisted near the center. National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin remarked, \\"Confidence at the later ranges [of the forecast track] was unusually low\\", due to wide divergences between computer models. Late on October 17, a Hurricane Hunters flight into Wilma recorded winds of , but an unusually low pressure of 989 mbar (29.21 inHg), which would be more typical of a minimal hurricane. This was due to unusually low pressures across the region, which resulted in a lesser pressure gradient and thus lighter winds. Convection continued to develop near the center and became much more symmetrical. Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity Tropical Storm Wilma began to turn to the west-northwest on October 18, during which the storm developed a small, intermittent and ragged eye feature. It continued to intensify, and at 1200 UTC on October 18, Wilma attained hurricane status while located about south-southeast of Grand Cayman. Shortly after reaching hurricane strength, the hurricane began undergoing explosive deepening, after the development of a \\"pinhole\\" eye in diameter. This small eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection, with cloud-top temperatures of about . Early on October 19, Wilma attained major hurricane status while continuing to rapidly intensify, and by 0600 UTC, the storm's maximum sustained winds increased to , making Wilma a dangerous Category 5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the span of just 24 hours, Wilma had intensified from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane, an unprecedented event for an Atlantic hurricane. The eye continued to contract to a diameter of about , the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane, and at 1200 UTC on October 19, Wilma attained peak winds of . The central pressure rapidly dropped 54 mbar (1.65 inHg) from 0000 to 0600 UTC, and at 0800 UTC, a Hurricane Hunters flight recorded a minimum central pressure of 884 mbar (26.10 inHg) in a dropsonde near the center of the extremely small eye. As the dropsonde did not reach the calm winds in the center, the pressure was estimated at 882 mbar (26.05 inHg), the lowest pressure in an Atlantic hurricane on record. The pressure continued to fall as the Hurricane Hunters left the hurricane, and it is possible the pressure was slightly lower. Operationally, the peak intensity was estimated at . It is estimated by Dr. Eric Uhlhorn of NOAA's Hurricane Research Division that the winds may have peaked at between 209 and 229 mph rounded to 210 and 230 mph respectively following that Hurricane Hunter mission. At the time of its peak intensity, hurricane-force winds extended only from the small center of Wilma, with tropical storm force winds extending only about . First landfall Radar image of Wilma over Mexico Shortly after peaking in intensity, the coldest cloud tops surrounding the eye warmed slightly and an outer eyewall began to develop, signifying an eyewall replacement cycle was occurring. By late on October 19, the winds in Hurricane Wilma decreased to as the inner wide eye weakened and the wind field expanded. Early on October 20 the hurricane weakened to Category 4 status after the small, inner eye dissipated and the wide outer eyewall became the dominant eye. At the time, the pressure measured 892 mbar (26.34 inHg), the second-lowest known pressure for a Category 4 hurricane (Super Typhoon Judy had an 887 mb pressure at peak intensity), and Wilma retained the large eyewall as it turned northwestward. Initially, the hurricane was forecast to re-intensify into a Category 5 hurricane, with one forecast predicting it to make landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula with winds of , though Wilma remained a strong Category 4 hurricane as it tracked northwestward. Steering currents remained weak, though a series of troughs eroded the high pressure system across the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a turn towards the north-northwest. Environmental conditions remained favorable, with the eye becoming more distinct early on October 21. At about 2145 UTC on October 21, Wilma made landfall on the island of Cozumel with winds of . It weakened slightly as it continued northwestward, and struck the Mexican mainland near Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, at 0330 UTC on October 22, with winds of and gusts of up to . Second landfall and demise On October 22, the mid-level ridge to the north of Wilma essentially dissipated, leaving the hurricane drifting northward across the northeastern Yucat√°n Peninsula. As the hurricane moved further inland, the eye became cloud-filled as the deepest convection began to warm, and the winds gradually weakened during its passage over land. About 26 hours after making landfall on Cozumel, Wilma emerged into the southern Gulf of Mexico near Cabo Catoche with winds of about . Upon reaching open waters, Reconnaissance Aircraft reported the remains of an inner eyewall and an outer eyewall oscillating between in diameter. Convection deepened around the eyewalls, and the inner core of convection, which had previously become disrupted over land, became slightly better defined. Wilma after leaving Florida for the waters of the Atlantic Ocean A powerful eastward-moving mid-level trough across the central United States turned the hurricane northeastward and caused it to gradually accelerate. Vertical wind shear increased as strong upper-level southwesterly flow increased, though in spite of the shear Wilma continued to intensify. Early on October 24, Wilma attained major hurricane status while located about west-southwest of Key West, Florida. It gradually became better organized, with the large eye becoming very distinct on satellite and radar imagery. Wilma was able to retain its strength because large eyes in tropical cyclones are more stable and more resistant to vertical wind shear. Despite wind shear values of about , Wilma strengthened further to reach winds of . It weakened slightly as it approached Florida, and made landfall at Cape Romano with winds of at around 1030 UTC on October 24. Hurricane Wilma crossed the Florida peninsula in about 4.5 hours while continuing to accelerate northeastward, and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened hurricane near Jupiter. A vigorous cold front associated with the mid-level trough moved across the area to the west of Wilma, yet the cooler and drier air behind the front could not fully penetrate the inner core of the hurricane to weaken it. Shortly after exiting the Florida coastline, Wilma began to re-intensify, believed to be due to a reduction of friction of the eyewall and warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Early on October 25, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of while located about east of Jacksonville, Florida. During the time, the large circulation of Wilma absorbed the much smaller Tropical Depression Alpha over the Bahamas. Shortly after its secondary peak intensity, the wind shear, combined with its rapid forward motion of , resulted in a steady weakening trend. The overall cloud pattern began to deteriorate, with the eye becoming less distinct and the convection less symmetric. By 1117 UTC on October 25, the center was located to the northwest of the primary convection as cold air from the southwest entrained the circulation. The remaining convection continued to diminish, and by late on October 25 Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and still at Category 1 intensity. The weakening extratropical remnant turned to the east-northeast before being absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada on October 27.

He was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1976 season, during which he caught 43 passes and led the NFL in both receiving yardage with 1,112 yards, and yards per catch, at 25.9 YPC. College Having played basketball briefly in high school, along with track and field, Carr was discovered by Louisiana Tech track coach Jim Mize. Carr did play on the school's football team, but as a guard and punter. It was his kicking abilities that first brought him to the attention of Louisiana Tech football coach Maxie Lambright, even though he was a few years removed from playing football. Carr was able to overcome homesickness to become a college football star. In 1971, he helped the program win the league title in the Southland Conference. After catching 29 passes for 738 yards and 8 scores his first season, Carr became a bigger part of the Tech offense. In his final two season, Tech only lost one gane and won two Division II national titles. He had a clutch catch for 21 yards for a score with 12 seconds left that helped Tech beat Boise State 38-34 in the semi-finals. Louisiana Tech would go one to beat Western Kentucky 34-0 to win their second national title. Roger Carr was named to the All-American team in both 1972 and 1973. Pro career In 1974, the Baltimore Colts selected Carr with the 24th pick in the first round, making him the second receiver selected behind Lynn Swann of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Colts, which had played in Super Bowl III just a few season earlier, were in a rebuild mode. long time quarterback Johnny Unitas was playing in San Diego for the Chargers and the quarterbacks the Colts had were Bert Jones, a rookie, and Marty Domres, a once highly touted quarterback who'd failed to live up to expectations in San Diego. Carr only started in 8 games in his rookie season, but he caught 21 passes for 405 yards. He made his NFL debut on October 6, 1974. In a 42-38 home loss to the New England Patriots, Carr caught just one pass. In the rematch in week 11, Carr caught 2 passes for 87 yards. His best performance came in the final game of the season. Though the Colts lost to the New York Jets 45-38, Carr caught 6 passes for 91 yards. During the 1975 season, Carr scored the first touchdown of his NFL career, an 89 yard strike from Bert Jones in Buffalo. The Colts, despite giving up three rushing touchdowns to O.J. Simpson, won the game 42-35. In 1976, he had his only 1,000 season of his career, catching 43 passes for 1,112 yards, and averaging 25.9 yards per catch. 1976 was also the only year he was selected to the pro bowl. Carr helped the Colts win the AFC East Division from 1975 to 1977. In 1977, Carr missed several games due to a knee injury. Carr had several quality years but was never able to duplicate the success of the 1976 season. The closest he'd come to the 1,000 yard mark again was 1980, when he finished with 926 yards. On July 23, 1982, Carr was suspended by the Colts for three games due to his remarks and actions towards then new head coach Frank Kush. Carr, who struggled to get used to the discipline requirements in college, found himself having the same issue with Kush. Kush, who coached at Arizona State for 22 seasons before landing the Colts job, ran his practices the way a drill sargeant would run his troops. The Colts were once again in rebuild mode. Quarterback Bert Jones was gone, having been released. Bruce Laird jumped from the NFL to the USFL. Mike Barnes, a starting defensive tackle, was also gone from the team. Though Kush and Colts G.M. Ernie Accorsi both said that trading carr wasn't an option, citing Carr had one year left on his contract, Carr's teammates supported him, including long time teammate Ken Huff. Carr also stated that at that stage of his career, he had no desire to go through another rebuilding project with yet another new head coach. Shortly before the 1982 season was set to begin, the Colts gave Carr his wish. He was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Though Carr wasn't a starter for Seattle, which already had Steve Largent and Paul Johns entrenched at wide receiver, he still managed to catch 15 passes for 265 yards. Also working against Carr that season was the fact that half of the season was canceled due to an NFLPA strike. He retired in 1983 after playing his final season for the San Diego Chargers. Previously, he played for the Seattle Seahawks in the 1982 season, when he caught 15 passes for 265 yards and two touchdowns and helped to provide the winning score against the Denver Broncos. His salary that year was $225,000. Post NFL career Carr was born in Seminole, Oklahoma, and reared in Cotton Valley in Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where he still maintained his residence in 1983 at the time of his retirement as a professional player.Joey White, \\"Carr says he's not retired\\", Minden Press- Herald, July 28, 1983, p. 10 Carr returned as a graduate assistant to his alma mater, Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, where he played for the Bulldogs. From 2003 to 2005, he coached at the Roman Catholic-affiliated St. Frederick High School in Monroe, Louisiana. Since 2009, he has been the offensive coordinator for the Providence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1974, Carr was honored for his athletic success by the citizens of Cotton Valley with a special day of ceremonies.\\"Roger Carr honored,\\" Minden Press- Herald, March 14, 1974, p. 1. Carr was inducted into the Louisiana Tech University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007. After his career was over, and as well as many years of reflection, Carr admitted that he could have handed his final years in Baltimore a little better. He admitted that much of his discontent stemmed from the Colts trading away Bert Jones. Carr said he'd never had the chemistry with any one quarterback. He also admitted that during their time with the Colts, Jones, who had his pilots license, would fly to Carr's hometown during the offseason. The two friends would then fly off to some other location for a workout. This was something that Carr admitted the Colts were completely unaware of.

Its importance grew significantly with the development of the Barapukuria coal mine and the Madhyapara hardrock mine, both located within a few kilometres from the town. The government was working in 2006 with Asia Energy (now Global Coal Resources PLc - GCR) on a plan to develop an open-pit mine in Fulbari, Dinajpur. Opponents have protested the plans because of adverse environmental and social effects. An estimated 120,000 people may be displaced, including indigenous groups. Protesters have said such a mine would endanger an important food-producing region, as well as the quality of the water supply depended on by tens of thousands of people. There were major protests in Bangladesh in 2006, and the government closed the mine. As talks began again on the project, protesters conducted a week-long march from Fulbari to Dhaka in October 2010.

Geography Ghoraghat is located at . It has 17535 house holds and a total area of 148.67 km¬≤.  Administration  Ghoraghat thana was established in 1895 and was turned into an upazila in 1984. The upazila consists of 4 union parishads, One Paurashava, 115 mouzas and 111 villages. Member of parliament: Md. Shibli Sadique.  History  Ghoraghat was established in the time of Bakhtlar Khilji (see Blochmanu's Contr., J.A.S,1873, p. 215, Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, p. 156, Ain-i-Akbari, Vol. II, p. 135 and Vol. I, p. 370). After the historical conquest of Nabadwip from Lakshman Sen in 1203 and the conquest of principal city Gaur, Ikhtiyar al-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Khalji left the town of Devkot in 1206 to attack Tibet, leaving Ali Mardan Khalji in Ghoraghat. The old Musalman military outpost of Deocote or Devkot near Gangarampur was in this Sarkar. As soon as the Muslims had made themselves masters of Gaur, they established two frontier posts, one at Dumdumma, on the bank of river Punarbhaba and another at Ghoraghat. A mosque in Dumdumma bears an inscription recording that it was built by Zafar Khan Bahram Iztin in the reign of Kai Kaos Shah in the year 697 A.H.(1297 AD). Ghoraghat was one of the 19 sarkars of Bengal. Sarkar was the administrative unit in the Mughal Empire of India. Raja Todar Mal, the Finance Minister of the Mughal empire during Akbar's reign divided Bengal into 19 sarkars to make the revenue collection easier. Ghoraghat Sarkar comprised South Rangpur, South-East Dinajpur and North Bogra. It had 84 mahals in its territory. Later it became Chakla of Ghoraghat.The Sarkar produced much raw silk, revenue Rs.202,077. After the battle of Patna, 982 A.H.(1574 AD), when Daud retired to Orissa, (Badaoni, p. 184, Vol. II), his generals Kalapahar and Babu Mankli proceeded to Ghoraghat, (Badaoni, p. 192). Akbar's general, Majnun Khan, died at Ghoraghat. Being the northern frontier district skirting Koch-Behar, numerous colonies of Afghan and Mughal chiefs were planted there under the feudal system, with large jagir lands under each. Bhim Narain, Rajah of Kuch Behar used to regularly pay tribute to the Emperor Shah Jahan, but that during the chaos which arose owing to Emperor's illness, and after the death of Sultan Shuja in February 1661 there was anarchy in the region. Bhim Narain became daring and refused to pay tribute and with a large force attacked Ghoraghat. In the same year (on 17th Rabiul-Awwal 1072 A.H) the Khan-i-Khinan (Muazzam Khan) set out from Khizapur (which has been identified to be a place close to Narayanganj) with war-vessels, for the conquest of Koch-Behar. The Rajah (Bhim Narain) fled to Bhutan, his minister Bholanath fled to the Murang, and the Imperialists stormed Kuch-Behar town, and named it Alamgirnagar.  Archaeological Heritage  The shrine of Shah Ismail Ghazi is at Ghoraghat. He was a saint-warrior of the time of Ruknuddin Barbak Shah (1459-1474 AD). Shah Ismail Ghazi was first appointed to deal with the aggressive designs of the Orissan king Gajapati in the southern frontier of Bengal. He defeated Gajapati and wrested from him Mandaran, the frontier outpost. The successful general was then sent against Kamrup king Kameshwar, who was defeated and forced to pay tribute to the sultan. But soon, Bhandsi Rai, a commander of the frontier post of Ghoraghat, got jealous over the popularity and fame of Shah Ismail and sent a false report to the sultan that Ismail Ghazi, in collusion with the Kamrup king, was mediating to set up an independent kingdom for himself. The enraged sultan ordered the saint to be beheaded. Sura Masjid, Ghoraghat, Dinajpur The Sura Mosque is situated in Ghoraghat-Panchbibi road. There is no inscription tablet at the mosque, but it has been dated to the early sixteenth century in the light of its close links with dated monuments of similar style. An inscription from the time of Alauddin Hussain Shah, dated at 910 A. H./1504 A. D. was discovered in the village Champatali, a few miles away from the place. It records the construction of a mosque, and if this inscription describes the mosque at Sura, the year 1504 A. D. is the date of its construction. Ghoraghat Fort Mosque situated in the southeastern corner of the Ghoraghat Fort, which is located on the right side of the river Karatoya in the southeastern part of the district of Dinajpur. Within the fort area were erected a number of religious and secular buildings, of which only a mosque in ruinous condition and a few scattered mounds have survived.

Castner's Cutthroats fought during World War II and were instrumental in defeating the Japanese during the Aleutian Islands Campaign. The unit was composed of just sixty-five men selected to perform reconnaissance missions in the Aleutian Islands during the war. Background The brainchild of Colonel Lawrence Varsi Castner (1902‚Äì49), an Army intelligence officer serving in General Simon Bolivar Buckner's Alaskan Defense Command, the band was organized in order to create a unit that was fully functional with only minimal outfitting. Castner chose men skilled at flourishing in the tough conditions of the Alaskan wilderness including the native Aleuts and Eskimos, sourdough prospectors, hunters, trappers and fishermen. Their background in survival and hunting made them ideal scouts. Hard and dangerous men, they often had names in keeping with their unit's nickname, such as Bad Whiskey Red, Aleut Pete and Waterbucket Ben. Appreciating their unique talents, Col. Castner did not enforce standard military procedures on his unit. They were given a great deal of freedom in order to get the job done. The name \\"Castner's Cutthroats\\" was given by the military press during the war, but the name preferred by the men was Alaska Scouts. The commanding officer chosen to lead Castner's Cutthroats was Captain Robert H. Thompson, a Montana State University football star from Moccasin, Montana. Thompson was hugely popular with his men and developed a deep love of Alaska. After leaving the Castner's Cutthroats, he stayed in Alaska as a guide, hunter and bush pilot until his accidental death in 1955. He was joined in early 1942 by Lt. Earl C. Acuff, a University of Idaho graduate and rival football player. Acuff had been stationed on a remote Aleutian island to spy on Japanese planes. After several months went by without hearing from him, the army charged Castner's Cutthroats with recovery of his body. When they found him alive and well, he was quickly transferred to the Alaskan Scouts. Mission In June 1942, the Japanese bombed Dutch Harbor and landed troops on the western Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu, which were quickly occupied within a few days. Reacting to the Japanese occupation, Ephriam D. Dickson III of the Field Museums Branch for the U.S. Army Center of Military History wrote that the American public and leaders were \\"[c]oncerned that Japan might use these islands to launch air raids against the Pacific Northwest, especially targeting the Boeing bomber plant and Bremerton Navy Yard in Seattle\\". Castner's Cutthroats was selected to head reconnaissance missions and helped plan landing zones for amphibious assaults on the Japanese-held occupied islands. During the American counterattack, Castner's Cutthroats main mission was to serve as guides and messengers for the U.S. Army. However, when battle preparations were being made to invade Attu and Kiska, they warned the Army that wheeled vehicles would not function on the permafrost and the soldiers would need to be outfitted with warm gear and plenty of food, a warning that was largely ignored. Consequently, many soldiers owed their lives to Castner's Cutthroats for protecting them from the weather and providing them with food. =Adak Island landing strip= One of the major successes of Castner's Cutthroats was the building of an airfield on Adak Island. The U.S. Army Air Forces had lost several planes, not to the Japanese, but to Alaskan weather. In order to shorten the distance between the Japanese and American air bases, an airfield on Adak Island was proposed and Castner's Cutthroats were sent in to scout for a suitable location. Due to the mountainous terrain of the area, no acceptable site was available. Instead, Castner's Cutthroats dammed a lagoon and drained it to use the sandy bottom floor as a temporary landing strip. Engineers later came in and improved the area. Equipment Standard issue for Castner's Cutthroats was a Trapper Nelson pack, hunting knife, .22LR caliber target pistol and a sniper rifle, instead of the standard issue Springfield rifle, or M1 Garand. However, when it came to firearms, personal preference was the deciding factor. Al Brattain, a crack shot, preferred the M1 Garand because its reduced recoil did not spoil his aim. Trapper Nelson packs held all their supplies for their long mountainous treks. They lived off the land, which allowed them to stay light, unlike most military units of the time. To move from island to island, the men used canoes, from which they fished for salmon. The salmon was dried and stored for the winter, furthering the unit's ability to stay out in the field. Memorial In Kuluk Bay, Alaska, the Cutthroats staged a reconnaissance mission. At the spot on the beach where they first came ashore, a plaque has been erected which reads: > On August 28, 1942, the U.S. Naval submarines, USS Triton and USS Tuna, > surfaced 4 miles due east of this beach and disembarked a 37-man U.S. Army > intelligence-gathering unit led by Colonel Lawrence V. Castner. The unit was > known as \\"The Alaska Scouts\\", or more affectionately as \\"Castner's > Cutthroats.\\" Their mission was to gather information about the Japanese > troop strength on Adak and to report their findings to the landing force > already on its way from Dutch Harbor. No enemy troops were found, and on > August 30, a 17-ship landing force with 4,500 men and tons of heavy > equipment arrived. Their mission: to build an airstrip and troop staging > area in preparation for the retaking of the enemy-occupied Aleutian Islands > of Attu and Kiska.\\" Aftermath Castner retired from the military towards the end of World War II and remained in Alaska. After spending a year as a vice-president of the fledgling Alaska Airlines, he founded a cold storage and wholesaling business in Anchorage, and was regarded as an up-and-coming leader of the local business community. This would prove to be short-lived, as Castner died in December 1949. A short street in Anchorage, located near the KENI Radio Building, is named for him. William \\"Billy\\" Buck, one of the last three surviving members of Castner's Cutthroats, died on 1 August 2011 in Anchorage, Alaska at the age of 90. Ed Walker died shortly after Buck on 28 October 2011, at the age of 94, also in Anchorage, Alaska. Earl C. Acuff was the last surviving member of the Cutthroats. He died on 13 February 2013, at the age of 94 in Blacksburg, Virginia.

History The predecessor of the central bank was the Currency Board which was established on 19 May 1973. This followed the creation of the UAE as an independent state in 1971. The original purpose of the UAE Currency Board was to issue an independent currency for the new state to replace the existing currencies in use: the Qatari riyal and the Bahraini Dinar. The new UAE dirham entered circulation on the same day the Currency Board was established. At this time, the Currency Board of the UAE did not have full central bank powers. It was mandated to manage the currency and the country's gold and foreign exchange reserves, but did not have regulatory authority and was not empowered to manage the UAE's monetary policy. The Union Law No (10) of 1980 saw the establishment of the Central Bank of the UAE as a public institution. The Law No (10) also augmented the functions of the Central Bank (previously assigned to the Currency Board) ‚Äì H.E. Abdul Malik Yousef Al Hamar appointed Governor.

The landscapes and cityscapes that he painted were not painted with literal realism but rather with freedom and spontaneity in an attempt to capture the essence of the scene. David Aldrich - Lesconil (1961) Early life Born in 1907 to John Gladding Aldrich and Margaret Putnam Calder. Aldrich‚Äôs love of art began in his childhood home in Providence, Rhode Island, where his parents both painted and were influential in the creation of the Providence Art Club. The family often took painting vacations to Glocester, Rhode Island and to Little Compton, Rhode Island where they painted with their good friends, the Burleighs (local artist Sydney Burleigh was known to Aldrich as Uncle Tid). Later the Aldriches traveled to Europe and the Caribbean, taking every opportunity to stop by the side of the road to paint when coming upon an inspiring view. He attended and graduated from the Gordon School, the Moses Brown School. And then went on to college at Brown University, graduating in 1929 with a bachelors in philosophy and Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation graduating in 1933 with a masters in architecture. During World War II he served in the Army Air Corps in North Africa and Iran, using his architectural training. Work Aldrich's artistic career began as an architect in New York City, New York in 1933 with his uncle, Chester Holmes Aldrich, at Delano & Aldrich. After his time in New York, he spent two years in Washington DC at the US Treasury Department. In 1937 he became a partner in the architectural firm of Kent & Aldrich in Providence, RI. He later opened a private architectural firm and became the head city planner for the City of Providence. He retained his interest in watercolor painting throughout his life, studying at the O‚ÄôHara School, the Positano Workshop, the Rhode Island School of Design and attending figure study classes every week at the Providence Art Club, where he was a life member. In the 1960s he was owner and director of Art Unlimited, a gallery on Thayer Street in Providence, Rhode Island that exhibited contemporary art from artists such as Hazel Belvo, Lawrence Kupferman, and Baburao Sadwelkar. Aldrich had numerous one-man exhibitions, notably at the Providence Art Club, the Rhode Island Watercolor Society, and the Gallery on the Commons in Little Compton, Rhode Island. He also exhibited in many group shows in those galleries as well as the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Rhode Island Arts Festival, DeCordova Museum, Virginia Lynch Gallery, Wheeler Gallery and others. His work received many awards and is represented in numerous private and corporate collections. A watercolor he did of the Gordon School's campus still graces that school's diplomas. Up until his death he devoted himself entirely to his painting. As one critic wrote: ‚ÄúHis view is always fresh and unhackneyed, his brush is deft, his strokes swift and colors translucent and unmuddied ‚Äì the paper often does the majority of the work‚Ä¶a sort of artistic shorthand that can make water color really exciting.‚Äù Aldrich said that his work was ‚Äúan expression of the essence of my feelings toward the subject in color, line, and space.‚Äù References External links * Art League of Rhode Island 2003 Publication Category:1907 births Category:2002 deaths Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Architects from Rhode Island Category:People from Little Compton, Rhode Island Category:Artists from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Brown University alumni Category:Painters from Rhode Island Category:Rhode Island School of Design alumni Category:Burials in Rhode Island Category:Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation alumni Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:Moses Brown School alumni ","title":"David Aldrich"},{"id":"9513810","text":"Gobindaganj () is an Upazila of Gaibandha District and the Division of Rangpur.
