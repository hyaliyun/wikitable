It interpolates musical ideas from the songs \\"Nasty\\", \\"Funky Drummer\\" and \\"South Bronx\\". The song was reportedly re- recorded in 1993 to promote the film The Meteor Man. It was also released as the album's promo single. The song is about a failing relationship between Michael and his lover. He does everything to satisfy his lover but to no avail, she breaks up with him. Michael is battling within himself throughout the song and he finally decides that he can’t let her get away. According to the producer of the track Teddy Riley: > “This was mostly from a sample CD that I just put together myself, and it > kind of reminded me of the James Brown sound. I could feel it.

PACE stands for Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency. https://medium.com/firewatch-solutions/emergency-communications-what-is-a- pace-plan-694f14250bd2 The PACE method requires the designer to determine the different parties that need to communicate, what information or media needs to be communicated, and then determine the best (ideally four) forms of communication between each of those parties. Each method must be completely separate and independent of the other systems of communication. PACE also designates the order in which an element will move through available communications systems until contact can be established with the desired distant element(s). For each method, the receiver must first sense which one the sender is using, receive the message, and then respond. A PACE-based Communication Plan exists for a specific mission or task, not a specific unit, because the plan must consider both intra- and inter-unit sharing of information. An organization may have multiple plans for different situations, activities, and/or partners. PACE elements are only those that group has control over. For example, a personally owned cellphones should not be included in a corporate of government PACE plan.https://cradlepoint.com/resources/blog/pace-planning-prepares-first- responders-effective-communication/ Per the US Army, the PACE plan system is expressed as an order of communication precedence list; primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency. The plan designates the order in which a group will move through available communications systems until contact can be established. The plan does not designate such things as the exact radio channel or talk group to be used if you are using a radio but the order in which you would plan to user the radio and agreed upon method of communications between groups. A PACE plan is not a frequency plan (which details frequency allocation and radio spectrum characteristics) or band plan (to avoid interference) or channel plan (which details which channels users listen/talk upon)https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/nifog-v1-4-resized-for- pda-viewing.pdf or deployment plan (which details the users' radios types and locations). One cannot use the same device (e.g. radio) nor network (e.g. cellular internet) nor service (e.g. SMS messages) to achieve PACE. One could achieve two parts of PACE by using, for example, an iPhone using Verizon Wireless for Gmail and an Android tablet using AT&T; Wireless for text messages. Two more parts could be achieved by mailing a letter via local postal service and reflecting sunlight via a signal mirror and Morse code. PACE elements may be connected (e.g. the Alternate's audio is also available on Primary's microphone and speaker) but must not be dependent (e.g. Alternate's device has its own microphone and speaker for each user). Equally important as users having multiple PACE devices is user training and awareness. Users must know when to switch between methods and also know how to effectively use each means. Emergency Management and Communications Managers should coordinate the development of PACE plans for the many different functions and departments within your organization to insure that Incident Command can maintain critical communication links. Departmental PACE plans should be coordinated with Emergency Management and the Communications Team. It is critical that individual departments nest their plan within the larger Emergency Plan to ensure that the organization has the resources to execute the plan and reduce unnecessary duplication of assets. Developing comprehensive PACE plans will not ensure perfect communications in a disaster, but may help to clear one more layer in the fog and friction found in every emergency situation.https://cradlepoint.com/resources/blog/pace-planning- prepares-first-responders-effective-communication/ The PACE model applies to other thing where a single failure will result in mission/task failure. For example, an infantry soldier may carry a rifle, pistol, grenade, and knife for combathttps://sofrep.com/gear/think-like-a-green-beret-the-pace-plan/. For example, a tourist may have a rail pass, credit cards, local currency, and hiking boots to move across a country.

He was executed for treason after it was discovered that he had been selling State secrets to the French. The affair gravely damaged Harley politically, as he was rightly criticised for facilitating Gregg's treason through his lax security arrangements, although it is generally accepted that he had no knowledge of the treason itself. Life James Vernon, Secretary of State 1697-1702, had known Gregg's father, also named William Gregg, who was a diplomat. No doubt on his father's account, Vernon took the young Gregg into his service as his secretary, but had to dismiss him 'for his ill qualities', according to Gilbert Burnet. Gregg was indeed an unsuitable choice for such a position, as he had a criminal record and had narrowly escaped being found guilty of counterfeiting in 1697. His wife, who attempted to take all the blame on herself, was found guilty and, despite being pregnant, was sentenced to being branded on the hand. Nevertheless, when Robert Harley became secretary of state in 1706, he appointed Gregg to an underclerkship in his office, and even extended to him an exceptional amount of confidence. That, at any rate, was one explanation for the disaster which ensued; another, which has the authority of the celebrated author Daniel Defoe, then Gregg's fellow secretary, was that Harley's office was always in a state of the most complete disorder, and that papers of the gravest import were open to the inspection of every clerk, doorkeeper, or laundress in the establishment. Antagonism was at its height between Godolphin and Harley at the close of 1707, and the Whigs were plotting to exclude Harley from the Privy Council. Intelligence came from the postmaster at Brussels that a packet of letters had been opened from the secretary's office and addressed to French minister Michel Chamillart, and they contained copies of important state papers; a covering note indicated that the copies were sent by Gregg. Gregg was arrested on 1 Jan. 1708, was examined by Sunderland on 3 January, and forthwith committed to Newgate. He was tried at the Old Bailey on 9 January for treasonable correspondence with France, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to death. The culprit pleaded in extenuation of his crime his poverty and heavy debts, but swore positively that he had no accomplice in his crime. He seems to have felt a strong sense of loyalty to Harley, despite his previous betrayal of him, and refused steadfastly to implicate him. The Whig leaders, however, were eager to obtain evidence against Harley, and were in great hopes that the unfortunate man would say something to convict his chief of complicity. The House of Lords formed a committee of seven to examine Gregg, and placed upon it Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset and two other dukes, besides Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton , Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, and John Somers, 1st Baron Somers. The committee went to Newgate on 7 February and informed Gregg that, if he would make a full confession, he might rely upon the intercession of the house. In spite of the temptation thus dangled before him, the poor fellow adhered manfully to the truth of his first statement. The committee had the cruelty to keep the condemned man in suspense for three months. At length, they sent Queen Anne a recommendation that the execution should take place, bitterly disappointed at making no other discovery than that the business of the secretary's office was conducted in a strangely lax manner. Gregg was hanged and quartered at Tyburn on 28 April 1708, and his head was placed on Westminster Hall. Before he met his fate, he delivered a paper to the ordinary in which he solemnly exculpated Harley from all participation in his offence. He also left a letter, the contrite tenor of which was warmly commended by Hearne. Harley found it necessary during the second week in February 1708 to resign his secretaryship, but he had the generosity to allow Gregg's widow a pension of fifty pounds annually out of his private purse.

He served as Clerk of the House of Commons from 1954 to 1961. Early life Fellowes was born in London, England, on 23 June 1895. He was the eldest son of William Gordon Fellowes, a barrister, and his wife, Marian Augusta Fellowes (née Hamilton). He was educated at Marlborough College, then a boys independent school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. In 1914, he was offered a place at Merton College, Oxford. However, with the outbreak of World War I, he joined the British Army rather than attend the University of Oxford. Career =Military service= On 19 November 1914, he was granted a commission as a temporary second lieutenant. On 15 March 1917, he was transferred to the training reserve and granted seniority in the rank of temporary lieutenant from 27 December 1915. On 4 May 1917, he was transferred from the training reserve to the Royal West Surrey Regiment. On 2 June 1917, he was promoted to temporary captain. On 6 September 1918, he was appointed adjutant of a service battalion of the Royal West Surrey Regiment. During World War I, Fellowes saw active service with the British Army on the Western Front. As was common for those serving in the trenches, he spent some time in hospital being treated for gas poisoning following a mustard gas attack. =Parliamentary career= Fellowes Fellowes returned from the war a decorated officer but did not take up his university place. Instead, in 1919, he joined the clerkship of the House of Commons. He held the appointment of Assistant Clerk to the House from 1919 to 1937. On 31 July 1937, he was appointed Second Clerk Assistant of the House of Commons. On 3 August 1954, he was appointed Clerk of the House of Commons, succeeding Sir Frederic Metcalfe. Honours and decorations In September 1917, Fellowes was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for service during World War I. He was also a recipient of the \\"Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\\" service medals; the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. In the 1945 New Year Honours, Fellowes was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in recognition of his service as Second Clerk Assistant. In 1953, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG).

It was proposed in 2005 by Fathali M. Moghaddam in his paper \\"The Staircase to Terrorism\\". The model involves a metaphorical staircase, where each step is influenced by a specific psychological process. It is proposed that the higher an individual moves up the staircase, the fewer alternatives to violence they will see, ultimately resulting in the destruction of themselves, others, or both. Background Moghaddam observed that societal-level variables, such as lack of democratic processes, social inequality, availability of weapons and rapid demographic changes, do not explain why only a small percentage of people living under the same adverse conditions end up committing acts of violence against innocent targets. He proposed the staircase model to explain this phenomenon, describing the pathway to terrorism as a narrowing staircase, that very few people reach the top of. Model The model involves six floors. Diagram of the staircase model =Ground floor= The ground floor is inhabited by all members of society. All members of society evaluate their living conditions in terms of fairness. People will remain on the ground floor as long as they consider their living conditions to be fair. Those who perceive injustice move onto the first floor. =First floor= On the first floor, people consider their options for improving their situation. People who find options to improve their individual situation and influence decision-makers leave the staircase at this floor in order to pursue non-violent paths. People who are unsatisfied with their available options move onto the second floor. =Second floor= It is here that feelings of both anger and frustration over not being able to improve the situation instigate a search for a target to blame. This target can either be a direct opponent, such as a government, or a third party to whom aggression is displaced, such as an ethnic or religious group. People who are persuaded that they have an enemy toward whom they can direct their aggression, will proceed to the third floor. =Third floor= People who arrive here have already developed a readiness towards violence. These feelings can be capitalised on by a violent organisation that is offering a sense of 'moral engagement' to potential recruits. Within these organisations violent actions against a perceived enemy are regarded as acceptable or even as one's duty. Potential recruits are offered a new social identity as members of a selective ingroup who aim to bring justice to the world. People who find this offer appealing will move on to the fourth floor. =Fourth floor= It is here that thinking such as 'us' versus 'them' is promoted. Recruits are isolated from friends and family, strict secrecy is imposed and the legitimacy of the organisation is emphasised. People who reach this floor will rarely withdraw and exit the staircase alive. They will move onto the fifth floor if an opportunity to do so presents. =Fifth floor= It is here that the violent act is carried out. In order to be as effective as possible, any inhibition about killing innocent people must be overcome. This is done via two means. Categorisation stresses the differentiation between ingroup and out group, and distancing exaggerates the differences between the ingroup and the perceived enemy. Implications Moghaddam states the model is not a formal one, but rather a metaphor for the purpose of providing general framework in order to organise current psychological knowledge regarding terrorism. Nevertheless, the model is cited as useful for conceptualising the process that results in only a small number of individuals from a large group of disgruntled people will commit acts of violence against the innocent. Moghaddam states that it is not enough to simply try and identify and stop potential terrorists, as this will only make room for new people to step forward, and instead proposes that the only way to end terrorism is by reforming the condition on the ground floor so that it is no longer perceived as unjust and hopeless by a large portion of society. The empirical basis of the model has been evaluated by an article in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology. The findings state that whilst most of the processes in the model are supported by empirical evidence, the quantity and quality of said evidence varies. Whilst praising Moghaddam's model for emphasising potential mechanisms for future study, the review concludes that the staircase model may not be the right metaphor for summarising the phenomena of terrorism, citing a lack of evidence for transition between the floors, and the possibility that some floors and corresponding processes from the model could be removed entirely due to a lack of empirical evidence.

It consists of two once- identical four-story brick factory buildings which face each other across Silver Street. Built in the 1890s, they housed the city's largest shoe manufacturer, an industry that gained in significance as its textile industry declined. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The former Hoyt Shoe Factory complex is located about southeast of downtown Manchester, on either side of Silver Street at its junction with Lincoln Street. Both are four stories in height, built out of brick. They are typical of Manchester's mill construction, with segmented-arch windows in a parade of bays on the long side. The northern building has large ells extending to its north, giving it a modified U shape, while the southern one has two smaller additions. A third building built for Hoyt stands further west, but is not included in the National Register listing because alterations made to it have compromised its historic integrity. One of the two buildings was built in 1892, the other in 1895, and both have had additions made to them in the early 20th century. They were designed by industrial architect Augustus G. Stevens for Francis M. Hoyt, and, along with other nearby buildings, were the city's largest shoe manufactory. Located outside the city's main mill district, which was operated by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, shoe production gained in economic importance as the textile industry declined, and the Hoyt Company operated here until 1971. Much of the space was taken over by other manufacturing concerns after the 1930s.

History Ambronite bag Ambronite was introduced in 2014 by five Finnish men with the intention of supplying all the nutrients necessary without the time and effort that usually goes into preparing food and is promoted as the world's first organic drinkable meal. A commercial distribution of Ambronite was funded by a crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo. It met its $50,000 funding goal after one week, and went on to raise over $100,000. The first shipments of the crowdfunded Ambronite version 1 started in early October 2014 and finished in December. In early 2015, Ambronite v2 was released that added oats for better water solubility to lessen clumping at the bottom of the glass, that is common in similar powder- mixed foods. In June 2015, v3 was released that added flaxseed and removed walnuts for an improved taste.Ambronite v3 - new recipe launched! Retrieved 23 June 2015. In February 2016, v4 was released that sweetened the taste by adding more berries. In October 2016, v5 was released that sweetened the taste more by adding additional berries and agave syrup. Later, a newer version was released that replaced agave syrup with coconut sugar.

Originally a small chapel in 1785 when the Sabtang mission first opened by the Dominicans, the church underwent few modifications until 1984. A short distance to the right of the church's façade stands a pedestal with a stone statue of Saint Vincent Ferrer, the patron saint of the parish and of the municipality. The church, convent and site of the beaterio was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in 2008.  History  San Vicente Ferrer Church Sabtang was recognized as a mission vicariate in 1844, Note: In 1844, the mission of San Vicente Ferrer was established. more than a century after the forced evacuation of the Isabtangs following the execution of the local datu Aman Dangat of Malacdang for alleged murder of the Cagayano agents sent by the Spaniards to the island in 1791 to procure supplies. When the Isabtangs transferred to Ivana, the church was left neglected. Father Antonio Vicente became the first vicar of the resettlement when Sabtang was re-established in 1844 and he began the construction of a church made of lime and stone together with the attached convent in that same year. Between 1869 and 1876, many constructions took place not only in the church but also in its immediate surroundings. Under Father Rafael Cano, the side altar of Our Lady of the Rosary was created, a guest room was added inside the convent, a school house for children was constructed, and a seawall fronting the seaport was made. In October 1956, the belfry, described as “curvaceous” and “original”, was blown down by a hurricane.Hornedo, Florentino. “Sketch History of Sabtang and St. Vincent Ferrer’s Patronage”, in 170th Sabtang Town Fiesta Brochure. 2014 A new one was later put in place under Fr. Gumersindo Hernandez in that same year. In 1983 to 1984, the cogon roofing of the church was replaced by galvanized iron sheets by Father Rafael Carpintero, OP. The same roofing modification was applied to the convent the following year. The following year, red brick tiles forming the flooring of the sanctuary was replaced by cement.  Architectural features  Like other old churches in Batanes, Sabtang Church was modeled after Basco Church both on its floor plan and façade.Hornedo, Florentino. “The Church of San Vicente Ferrer in Sabtang”, in 170th Sabtang Town Fiesta Brochure. 2014 The church bell crowns the top of the church, in espadaña style. It has four massive and broad pilasters and heavy set finials, with the façade projecting a heaviness of appearance. Thick walls made of stone and lime enclose the nave, with buttresses on the outside. At the back of the façade are four round pillars supporting the choir loft. Below the choir loft is the baptistery. The original baroque retablo was made of polychrome and gilded woodwork. It is located above the high altar and in place are niches for statues of saints. It underwent renovations under Father Carpintero in 1983 and 1984, with the deteriorated originals replaced by close copies.

At the time of its nomination it was one of six covered railroad bridges in the state; it and at least one other (the Goffstown Covered Railroad Bridge) were destroyed by the actions of arsonists. Description and history The bridge was located in the main village of Hillsborough, a short way west (upriver) of the road bridge carrying New Hampshire Route 149. The bridge was a two-span Town lattice truss span, mounted on granite abutments and a central wooden pier, the latter having replaced a granite pier washed away in 1938. It had a total length of , with a gabled roof and exterior finished in vertical board siding. Although the bridge had two spans, the truss was a single element, running continuously across the central pier. Portions of the truss were reinforced by the placement of iron bolts, and there was a sidewalk cantilevered off one side. The bridge was built in 1903 by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;), and was at least the second bridge on the site. The track leading to the bridge had been laid about 1878 by the Peterborough and Hillsborough Railroad Company, for service between Hillsborough and Peterborough. The company was not on good financial footing, and the line was soon taken over by the B&M.; See also *Contoocook River Railroad *Contoocook Mills Industrial District, nearby *List of New Hampshire covered bridges *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire References Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Bridges completed in 1903 Category:Bridges in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Hillsborough, New Hampshire Category:Railroad bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Wooden bridges in New Hampshire Category:Covered bridges in the United States destroyed by arson Category:Lattice truss bridges in the United States ","title":"Hillsborough Railroad Bridge"},{"id":"42842786","text":"is a significant case from the Supreme Court of Canada in the area of Canadian administrative law, focusing on whether the standard of review framework set out in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick applies to decisions of the Governor in Council of Canada (i.e., the Cabinet of Canada), and whether it has authority to vary or rescind an administrative tribunal decision on questions of law or jurisdiction. Background =Appeals to the Governor in Council= Under various statutes passed by the Parliament of Canada since 1888,SCC Appellant's Factum, p. 16 the Governor in Council has been authorized to vary or rescind decisions taken by certain administrative tribunals of the Government of Canada. Current authority to do so is conferred under the following Acts:SCC, par. 56 { class = \\"wikitable\\" - !Act !Scope - valign = \\"top\\"  Either on petition of a party or an interested person or of the Governor in Council's own motion, vary or rescind any decision, order, rule or regulation of the Canadian Transportation Agency. - valign = \\"top\\"  On petition in writing presented to the Governor in Council within ninety days after the decision, or on the Governor in Council's own motion within one year after the decision, by order, vary or rescind the decision or refer it back to the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission for reconsideration of all or a portion of it. - valign = \\"top\\"  Where the CRTC makes a decision to issue, amend or renew a licence, on petition in writing of any person received within forty-five days after that date or on the Governor in Council's own motion within ninety days after that date, by order, set aside the decision or refer the decision back to the Commission for reconsideration and hearing of the matter by the Commission, if the Governor in Council is satisfied that the decision derogates from the attainment of the objectives of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1). - valign = \\"top\\"  s. 40 of the CTA applies, mutatis mutandis - valign = \\"top\\"  s. 40 of the CTA applies, mutatis mutandis - valign = \\"top\\"  s. 40 of the CTA applies, mutatis mutandis - valign = \\"top\\"  At any time, in his discretion, either on petition of any interested person or of his own motion, vary or rescind any decision or order of the Oil and Gas Committee made under the Act, whether the order is made between parties or otherwise. } Similar authority has been granted by provincial statutes to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council (i.e., the provincial cabinet). Such power has been described as \\"legislative in nature and ... no hearing is required in such cases.\\" The procedure is seen to be a significant barrier to participation in regulatory decision-making., focusing on the decision in Although there have been calls to abolish such routes of appeal as they constitute policy appeals subject to lobbying efforts, subsequent federal Acts have retained them. =The case at hand= At the beginning of 2008, Peace River Coal Inc. (a subsidiary of Anglo American plc) entered into a 30-month contract with CN to ship coal from its facilities at Trend, British Columbia Within the contract, it was stated that \\"CN fuel surcharge tariff 7402 will apply for the duration of this contract.\\"FC, par. 13 In February 2008, CN introduced a reduced fuel surcharge through tariff 7403 effective that April, but advised present contractholders that \\"Contractual agreements currently subject to fuel surcharge 7402 will remain in effect until those agreements expire, at which time we expect 7403 to be applied.\\"FC, par. 21 Peace River Coal applied to the Canadian Transportation Agency for an order establishing a reasonable surcharge with respect to its shipments by substitution of the newer tariff. The Agency declined, stating that the contract fell within an exemption for \\"rates for the movement of traffic.\\"Decision No. 392-R-2008, citing Canada Transportation Act, s. 120.1(7) While PRC did not appeal, the Canadian Industrial Transportation Association (of which PRC was a member) petitioned the Governor in Council to rescind the CTA decision. In June 2010, an order in council was issued rescinding the decision. In so doing, the order declared: CN applied to the Federal Court for an order in the nature of certiorari, quashing the order in council and restoring the CTA decision. The courts below =Federal Court= The order was granted. In his decision, Hughes J declared: #as a matter of law, \\"the fuel surcharge as expressed in Tariff 7402 was part of the 'rate' charged to the shipper as contemplated by that Act,\\"FC, par. 18 #PRC sought to vary its contract with CN in order to incorporate the reduced fuel surcharge,FC, par. 45 #the Agency found that it lacked jurisdiction since it was being asked to consider and amend a contract,FC, par. 48 #CITA's petition to the Governor in Council asked it to ignore PRC's request that the Agency vary the contract and to simply ask the Agency to review the Tariff for \\"reasonableness\\" without regard to it,FC, par. 53 #the Order-in-Council expressly did not direct that the Agency require that PRC and CN amend their contract to reflect the amended Tariff,FC, par. 55 #s. 41 of the Act (which provides for appeals to the Federal Court of Appeal) does not remove from the Governor-in-Council the power to vary or rescind a decision of the Agency, even in respect of questions of law or jurisdiction,FC, par. 61 #the Governor- in-Council, in deciding matters of pure jurisdiction such as the issue here, must be subject to the Dunsmuir correctness standard on review, as there was no issue of public policy involved,FC, par. 68 and #the Agency was correct in dismissing the Application for lack of jurisdiction, and the Governor-in- Council was not correct in rescinding that decision.FC, par. 71 and 75 =Federal Court of Appeal= On appeal, the order was set aside. In a unanimous ruling, Dawson JA stated: #The Federal Court was correct in characterizing that the Governor in Council's decision did not decide the legal question of whether the existence of the confidential contract precluded Peace River from benefiting from any finding that CN Tariff 7402 was unreasonable.FCA, par. 43 #Following the FCA's current jurisprudence, the Dunsmuir reasonableness standard of review applies to decisions made by the Governor in Council with respect to questions of mixed fact, policy and law.FCA, par. 4648 #The decision was reasonable, as it falls within the range of outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and law.FCA, par. 50 #No decision is taken as to the Federal Court's finding that the fuel surcharge formed part of CN's transportation rate, as the issue is still live at the Agency.FCA, par. 55 At the Supreme Court The appeal was dismissed, with costs to the Attorney General of Canada and one set of costs to PRC and CITA.SCC, par. 69 In a unanimous decision, Rothstein J declared: :* Policy considerations may be at the root of the Governor in Council's interest in the statutory interpretation issue, but that does not transform the nature of the question to one of policy or fact. The question of whether a party to a confidential contract can bring a complaint under s. 120.1 of the CTA is one of law.SCC, par. 33 :* Under current jurisprudence, the only inherent limitation is that the Governor in Council is not empowered to address issues arising under the CTA ab initio: \\"Cabinet's authority is restricted to matters already dealt with by the Commission, and such matters must be orders, decisions, rules or regulations ...\\", citing , at 628SCC, par. 40 :* Petitions to the Governor in Council are not restricted to issues of fact or policy. The Governor in Council has the authority to answer legal questions, which is properly supervised by the courts in the course of judicial review.SCC, par. 49 :* The precedents instruct that the Dunsmuir framework applies to administrative decision-makers generally and not just to administrative tribunals, and is thus applicable to adjudicative decisions of the Governor in Council.SCC, par. 54 :* In this case, the Governor in Council was interpreting the CTA. As the question of statutory interpretation involved the issue of whether the s. 120.1 complaint mechanism was available to certain parties, it did not fall within any of the categories of questions to which a correctness review applies. As such, the applicable standard of review is reasonableness.SCC, par. 60 :* As the Governor in Council's decision was supported by the facts and the wording of s. 120.1(1), and it is consistent with Parliament's intention, it was held to be reasonable.SCC, par. 67 :* The Federal Court of Appeal's observation that the issue of fuel surcharges constituted part of transportation rates was still a live one before the Agency was held to be correct.SCC, par. 68 Impact CN has been welcomed as a clarification of the extent to which the Dunsmuir framework applies to all administrative decision-makers, thus building on its decision in Catalyst Paper, and distinguishing it from Katz Group, which focused on the vires of regulation. It is an open question as to whether the \\"legislative capacity\\" review test originating in Inuit Taparisat may be overruled or confined to its own special facts as a result.

(1999, 2009) Dizionario di pronuncia italiana . Bologna, Zanichelli. 16 May 1718 – 9 January 1799) was an Italian mathematician, philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian. She was the first woman to write a mathematics handbook and the first woman appointed as a mathematics professor at a university.WOMEN'S HISTORY CATEGORIES (archived from the original), About Education She is credited with writing the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus and was a member of the faculty at the University of Bologna, although she never served. She devoted the last four decades of her life to studying theology (especially patristics) and to charitable work and serving the poor. She was a devout Catholic and wrote extensively on the marriage between intellectual pursuit and mystical contemplation, most notably in her essay Il cielo mistico (The Mystic Heaven). She saw the rational contemplation of God as a complement to prayer and contemplation of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.Mazzotti, Massimo. \\"Maria Gaetana Agnesi: Mathematics and the Making of the Catholic Enlightenment.\\" Isis, Vol. 92, No. 4 (Dec. 2001), 657-683). http://history.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Maria%20Gaetana%20Agnesi.pdf Maria Teresa Agnesi Pinottini, clavicembalist and composer, was her sister. Early life Maria Gaetana Agnesi was born in Milan, to a wealthy and literate family. Her father Pietro Agnesi, a wealthy silk merchant,Findlen, Paula, Calculations of faith: mathematics, philosophy, and sanctity in 18th- century Italy (new work on Maria Gaetana Agnesi) Historia Mathematica 38 (2011), 248-291. wanted to elevate his family into the Milanese nobility. In order to achieve his goal, he had married Anna Fortunato Brivio of the Brivius de Brokles family in 1717. Her mother's death provided her the excuse to retire from public life. She took over management of the household. She was one of 21 children. Agnesi's diploma from Università di Bologna Maria was recognized early on as a child prodigy; she could speak both Italian and French at five years of age. By her eleventh birthday, she had also learned Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, German, and Latin, and was referred to as the \\"Seven- Tongued Orator\\". Agnesi suffered a mysterious illness at the age of twelve that was attributed to her excessive studying and reading, so she was prescribed vigorous dancing and horseback riding. This treatment did not work; she began to experience extreme convulsions, after which she was encouraged to pursue moderation. By age fourteen, she was studying ballistics and geometry. When she was fifteen, her father began to regularly gather in his house a circle of the most learned men in Bologna, before whom she read and maintained a series of theses on the most abstruse philosophical questions. Records of these meetings are given in Charles de Brosses' Lettres sur l'Italie and in the Propositiones Philosophicae, which her father had published in 1738 as an account of her final performance, where she defended 190 philosophical theses. Her father remarried twice after Maria's mother died, and Maria Agnesi ended up the eldest of 21 children, including her half-siblings. Her father agreed with her that if she were to continue her research into mathematics, then she would be permitted to do all the charity work she wanted. In addition to her performances and lessons, her responsibility was to teach her siblings. This task kept her from her own goal of entering a convent, as she had become strongly religious. Although her father refused to grant this wish, he agreed to let her live from that time on in an almost conventual semi-retirement, avoiding all interactions with society and devoting herself entirely to the study of mathematics. After having read in 1739 the Traité analytique des sections coniques of the Marquis Guillaume de l'Hôpital, she was fully introduced into the field in 1740 by Ramiro Rampinelli, an Olivetan monk who was one of the most notable Italian mathematicians of that time. During that time, Maria studied with him both differential and integral calculus. Her family was recognized as one of the wealthiest in Milan. Contributions to mathematics =Instituzioni analitiche= First page of Instituzioni analitiche (1748) According to Britannica, she is \\"considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics\\". The most valuable result of her labours was the Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana, (Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth) which was published in Milan in 1748 and \\"was regarded as the best introduction extant to the works of Euler\\". The goal of this work was, according to Agnesi herself, to give a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of infinitesimal calculus. The model for her treatise was Le calcul différentiel et intégral dans l’Analyse by Charles René Reyneau. In this treatise, she worked on integrating mathematical analysis with algebra. The first volume treats of the analysis of finite quantities and the second of the analysis of infinitesimals. A French translation of the second volume by P. T. d'Antelmy, with additions by Charles Bossut (1730–1814), was published in Paris in 1775; and Analytical Institutions, an English translation of the whole work by John Colson (1680–1760), the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, \\"inspected\\" by John Hellins, was published in 1801 at the expense of Baron Maseres.Analytical institutions... (four volumes), London, 1801 The work was dedicated to Empress Maria Theresa, who thanked Agnesi with the gift of a diamond ring, a personal letter, and a diamond and crystal case. Many others praised her work, including Pope Benedict XIV, who wrote her a complimentary letter and sent her a gold wreath and a gold medal. In writing this work, Agnesi was advised and helped by two distinguished mathematicians: her former teacher Ramiro Rampinelli and Jacopo Riccati. Witch of Agnesi The Instituzioni analitiche..., among other things, discussed a curve earlier studied and constructed by Pierre de Fermat and Guido Grandi. Grandi called the curve versoria in Latin and suggested the term versiera for Italian,C. Truesdell, \\"Correction and Additions for 'Maria Gaetana Agnesi'\\", Archive for History of Exact Science 43 (1991), 385–386. *Per Grandi: \\"...nata da' seni versi, che da me suole chiamarsi la Versiera in latino pero Versoria...\\" possibly as a pun:S.M.Stigler, \\"Cauchy and the witch of Agnesi: An historical note on the Cauchy distribution\\", Biometrika, 1974, vol. 61, no.2 p. 375–380 'versoria' is a nautical term, \\"sheet\\", while versiera/aversiera is \\"she-devil\\", \\"witch\\", from Latin Adversarius, an alias for \\"devil\\" (Adversary of God). For whatever reasons, after translations and publications of the Instituzioni analitiche... the curve has become known as the \\"Witch of Agnesi\\". =Other= Bust of Maria Gaetana Agnesi in Milan Agnesi also wrote a commentary on the Traité analytique des sections coniques du marquis de l'Hôpital which, though highly praised by those who saw it in manuscript, was never published.Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911, p. 378 Later life In 1750, on the illness of her father, she was appointed by Pope Benedict XIV to the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy and physics at Bologna, though she never served. She was the second woman ever to be granted professorship at a university, Laura Bassi being the first.Pickover, Clifford. The Math Book. Sterling Publishing, 2009, p. 180. In 1751, she became ill again and was told not to study by her doctors. After the death of her father in 1752 she carried out a long-cherished purpose by giving herself to the study of theology, and especially of the Fathers and devoted herself to the poor, homeless, and sick, giving away the gifts she had received and begging for money to continue her work with the poor. In 1783, she founded and became the director of the Opera Pia Trivulzio, a home for Milan's elderly, where she lived as the nuns of the institution did. On 9 January 1799, Maria Agnesi died poor and was buried in a mass grave for the poor with fifteen other bodies. In popular culture In 1996, an asteroid, 16765 Agnesi, was named after Agnesi. There is also a crater on Venus named after her,Atlas of Venus, by Peter John Cattermole, Patrick Moore, 1997, , p. 112 as well as a mathematical curve named the Witch of Agnesi. In 2017, the Family Coppola released a brandy named after Agnesi.

A portion of the plateau is protected by the Rondo Forest Reserve. It is one of a group of dissected plateaus lying between the Mbwemburu and Lukuledi rivers. It is approximately 60 km inland from Lindi, and is situated 15 km north of the Masasi road. It was revealed as an important biodiversity site in studies conducted since the 1980s. Climate The plateaus rise behind a narrow coastal plain. They receive considerable orographic precipitation, making the plateaus cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowlands. The average annual rainfall is 1088 mm (1951-1979), recorded at the Rondo Forest station. The highest rainfall occurs between November and January, and March to May.Perkin, Andrew; Charles Leonard and Nike Doggart (2008). \\"Landscape Profile: Rondo/Noto\\". Tanzania Forest Conservation Group, July 2008. Flora It is an important stand of primary coastal forest in Tanzania, but also contains elements of montane forest, as it reaches 900 metres in altitude. The higher slopes are covered in extensive semi-deciduous hardwood forest, constituting over 18 square km of closed canopy forest. The plateau vegetation is diverse, with areas of scrub forest, dry evergreen forest, riverine forest, miombo (Brachystegia) woodland, and thicket. Some 100 species of plant are endemic to the area. The plateau was once covered by extensive forests of Mvule or African teak (Milicia excelsa), but the forests were heavily logged from the 1950s onwards. Logging stopped in the 1980s, and since then the forests have regrown, and some areas were planted with Milicia excelsa. Milicia excelsa is still one of the dominant species in the 25 m high canopy within the Rondo Forest Reserve. Other dominant canopy species are Albizia gummifera, Dombeya sp., Ricinodendron heudelotii, and Dialium holtzii.Perkin, Andrew; Charles Leonard and Nike Doggart (2008). \\"Landscape Profile: Rondo/Noto\\". Tanzania Forest Conservation Group, July 2008. The forest reserve also has areas of forest plantation, mostly Pinus sp. with small trial plots of Milicia excelsa, Teak (Tectona grandis) and Maesopsis eminii. Fauna The plateau is home to various species of monkey and small mammals. The Rondo dwarf galago was discovered here in the 1990s by Simon Bearder. Conservation Though a forest reserve since colonial times, much wood was harvested in the 1950s, when some 20 square km of forest was cleared to establish exotic plantations, chiefly pine.

Description The remote creek flows through Churchill River Upland portion of the Midwestern Canadian Shield forests and is surrounded by mixed forest with stands of black spruce, white spruce, jack pine, and trembling aspen. The shoreline is characterized by steeply sloping irregular rock ridges and poorly drained areas of muskeg. Vamp Creek area is difficult to access and largely pristine. It is home to moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, and beaver. It is part of the range of the Naosap woodland caribou herd. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle and hawk owl. The creek is only accessible by canoe or snowmobile, but there is some trapping, and hunting activity. Etymology Vamp Creek was named during a 1920 expedition of the Dominion Land Survey.

Originally known as the First National Bank Building, it opened in 1960 as a six-story bank building. The tall mid-rise contains of space, with retail on the ground floor. From 1995 to 2016 the primary retail tenant was Camera World. History First National Bank of Oregon announced it would build a new headquarters building in 1957, with the contract to build the structure going to Hoffman Construction Company. The planned $3.5 million, five-story building was designed by Stanton, Boles, Maguire & Church and was to have of space. The building was to be on the site of the Century Theater and Lafayette Building, and would also require the demolition of part of the bank's existing headquarters. Construction began in December 1957 on what was to be a two-phase project, in which an initial five- story building would be built to allow the bank to move before its existing 1923 structure was demolished. A second five-story building would then be built in the footprint of the old bank building at SW 6th and Stark. In March 1958, erection of the steel frame began, with plans to have the entire project completed in August 1960. The curtain wall began going up in November 1958, and consisted of glass mosaic squares, becoming the first building in the Northwest to use this new type of panel. In September 1959, the first of the two buildings opened. The exterior mosaic squares were Italian blue and mounted in wall sections made of aluminum. The interior utilized walnut and light marble trim, and included what was believed to be the largest piece of carpet ever laid in the Pacific Northwest at that time, which was installed by Meier & Frank. Construction then commenced on the second structure, and the combined building opened in September 1960. On the ground floor, the plans called for the new building to be connected to First National's former headquarters building, a three-story structure built in 1916, which continued to house the main public branch, facing SW 5th Avenue. That building still stands and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the First National Bank. In 1972, First National Bank of Oregon moved its headquarters to a new building located elsewhere in downtown, the First National Bank Tower, but retained a bank branch in the old building on 6th Avenue. Over time, First National became First Interstate Bank and then Wells Fargo through a series of mergers and acquisitions. First National sold the old headquarters building in October 1972 for $3.1 million to Schnitzer Investment Company. The building was then sold by Schnitzer in 1976 to First Farwest Life Insurance Company to serve as its headquarters, with the building renamed as the First Farwest Life Building. The building was expanded by in 1983 with Hoffman Construction again as the contractor. First Farwest Corp. sold the building, which had served as the insurer's headquarters, to United Trust Fund Inc. in 1987 for $25 million, though Farwest remained a tenant. United Trust then sold the building in August 1988 for $30.5 million to Almaden Plaza Associates, which included the lease with Farwest. In February 1989, Farwest became insolvent and was seized by regulators, including then insurance commissioner Ted Kulongoski, with later liquidation. After the bankruptcy of Farwest, Almaden Plaza Associates could no longer pay the mortgage, and the building was deeded to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company by Almaden in 1990, who then sued United Trust over misrepresentations concerning Farwest. In 1992, the building was raised to eleven stories, with the exterior changed to aluminum and stainless steel. Camera World opened its flagship store on the ground floor in 1995. The building was purchased by the Louis Dreyfus Property Group (LDPG) in 1999 from John Hancock. LDPG sold the building to Felton Properties and Newmark & Co. Real Estate Inc. in 2004 for $30.25 million. UTi Worldwide Inc. became a major tenant in 2011 with leased over several floors. In late 2017 the building was purchased by investors for $68 million. Details 400 Sixth is of modernist design and stands tall. The building has both ground floor retail space and office space for a combined of gross leasable space. The eleven-story structure has an exterior clad in aluminum and stainless steel. Inside, there are marble floors, woodwork in the lobbies and the elevators, and more aluminum touches. The building also has underground parking with 70 spaces and 50-person conference room. Harland Financial Solutions and UTi Worldwide Inc. are two of the largest tenants in the building.

The oldest buildings of the brick mill complex were built in 1866 as a carpet- making operation. This business failed in 1874, but the complex was acquired by other textile interests, and eventual saw success producing carpet yarns, and blankets for horses and bedding. The mills were closed in 1970, and have since been adapted for other uses. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Hillsborough Mills are located on about of land, bounded on the south by Wilton Road (New Hampshire Route 101), North River Road, and the Souhegan River. The main building is a long rectangular three-story brick structure, with a projecting four-story tower near the center of its long facade. The building's Italianate character is demonstrated by windows set in segmented- arch openings, bands of brick corbelling in the eave, and round-arch windows in the top floor of the tower. Smaller one and two-story brick additions were made to this building's east end in the early 20th century. The building was historically powered by water delivered through a canal from a dam located in Wilton; the canal has been filled over, its function now replaced by an underground penstock that powers a hydroelectric facility in the mill basement. The dam was rebuilt in 1986. The main mill was built in 1866 by the Pine Valley Company, and went into operation the same year. Its dam was breached by flooding in 1869 but rebuilt. The company did not do well financially, and failed in 1874. Its assets were acquired by the Hillsborough Mills Company. That company manufactured carpet wool and blankets, employing about 200 people, and survived until 1901, when it was closed due to increasing competition from higher-volume manufacturers elsewhere. The mill was purchased by a new group of investors, among them William Abbott. Abbott would ultimately run three different industrial operations in the Wilton- Milford area, and was a major economic force in the region, employing nearly 500 workers. The Abbotts closed the mill in 1970, and sold the building in 1979. It has since been adapted for multiple light industrial uses.

This property was acquired in 2007 and 2008 under the Florida Forever program, with additional money from Marion County and help from The Nature Conservancy, Silver Springs Working Group, and the Department of Environmental Protection.  Natural Features  In addition to sandhills dotted with sinkholes, natural community types found on the forest include depression marshes and mesic flatwoods. Driving down State Road 326 you can see a mix of longleaf pines, sand post oaks and turkey oaks in some of the nicer sandhills on this land. A mix of wildflower color and wiregrass is also visible here, especially the fall after a prescribed fire. A visitor might see gopher tortoises, fox squirrels, kestrels or turkeys. Another feature is Indian Lake, the deep sinkhole lake that is located east of Baseline Road and drains Indian Lake Prairie. Scientific studies traced out the areas of water recharge that feed Silver Springs. These areas include the land now known as Indian Lake State Forest. As a result of the studies, Indian Lake State Forest was purchased under the Florida Forever springs initiative. Rolling sandhills on a sinkhole-rich karst topography dominate the property, although most of the sandhills have been converted to till agriculture or improved pasture. The land uses prior to acquisition have allowed exotic plant invasion, and exotic plants have replaced or displaced historic vegetation in many areas. One of the main goals of the Florida Forever purchase was to restore these altered areas and eliminate any adverse impacts these alterations might have had on the Silver Springs system for water flow and water quality. Planting longleaf pine seedlings is an important step to meet this goal. When you drive down Baseline Road, you can see some of the recently planted longleaf pine seedlings starting to pop out of the grass stage and grow into a young forest. Since the acquisition of Indian Lake State Forest, the Florida Forest Service has built trailheads, posted boundaries, installed gates, controlled exotic plants, planted longleaf pine seedlings, and implemented a prescribed burning program. State forest managers use prescribed burning to mimic the natural occurrence of fire. Periodic fire is necessary to maintain the forest's unique plant and animal diversity.  Recreation  Recreational opportunities in the forest include hiking, bird-watching and horseback riding. The main trailhead and parking area for the Bear-N-Oak hiking trail are located 2.1 miles north of the stoplight at the intersection of and County Road 35 (also known as Baseline Road) on the east side of County Road 35. There are 11 miles of designated horse trails.

Health information and a description of events prior to death are acquired from conversations or interviews with a person or persons familiar with the deceased and analyzed by health professionals or computer algorithms to assign likely cause(s) of death. Verbal autopsy is used in settings where most deaths are otherwise undocumented, which typically means in low- and middle-income countries. Estimates suggest a majority of the 60 million annual global deaths occur without medical attention or official medical certification of the cause of death. VA attempts to establish causes of death for otherwise undocumented subjects, allowing scientists to analyze disease patterns and direct public health policy decisions. Noteworthy large-scale uses of the verbal autopsy method include the Million Death Study in India, China's national program to document causes of death in rural areas, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, and the INDEPTH Network multi-site study. VA is increasingly recognised as an important component of national CRVS (civil registration and vital statistics) systems. Origins The term verbal autopsy was first coined in a project of the Department of International Health of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health which ran from 1965 to 1973 in Punjab, India. Two research projects were located in villages near Ludhiana, with headquarters in Narangwal village. Objectives of the projects were # to assess the relationships between nutrition, infection and child development, and # the acceptance of family planning services by rural communities in response to maternal and early child care service packages. Main providers of health care were Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) resident in each of the study villages in the nutrition- and population studies, respectively. All had received a six-week training prior to onset of the program, followed by monthly reviews, re-training and feed-back on service aspects specific to their group of villages. Input services in the Nutrition villages originally consisted of “feeding centres” and health care for under-5s, and on maternal and newborn health care services in the population cells. Early in 1971, results from the nutrition villages showed no significant decrease in child mortality, and causes and circumstances of child deaths had remained largely unknown. In response, an information system was established, wherein all child deaths in the villages had to be reported to the Narangwal Project Office by the resident health worker within five days. One of the project physicians then went to the concerned family and through intense questioning of close relatives as to the signs and symptoms of the process leading to death, review of the child's health records, supplemented by visits to the external health care provider if such was the case, established possible reasons for, and a most likely cause of death. Using this method and following an analysis of the initial 45 deaths, diarrheal disease, lower respiratory tract infections and malnutrition were identified as the three principal causes among the 8 days to 3-year-old children. Among the 45, one had died from neonatal tetanus. Shortly thereafter, the same process was extended to all villages of the two projects featuring childcare as one of the service inputs. In response to the results, intervention methodologies specific to identified health care priorities were elaborated and introduced in both projects. In 1972, results from the investigation were presented for 124 child deaths during the first seven days of life, and 117 deaths from 8 days to 5 years of age at a conference in Srinagar, Kashmir. The term Verbal Autopsy was used ‘in irony’ by a visiting medical dignitary who not only questioned the results but also the method, labelling it ”unscientific”. The term was retained by the then director of the two projects, Carl E. Taylor, chairman of the Department of International Health who also chaired the conference. Through introduction of specific service packages specifically for the control of DD, ARI, and Neonatal Tetanus, child mortality dropped significantly in the study villages of both the Nutrition and Population projects. Seven years later (1980), the Ministry of Health of Egypt conducted an investigation for prevention of child mortality from DD using a variety of intervention methods for a total population of 200,000, including 29000 children below the age of 5 in three different districts. The VA method as originally developed in Narangwal was slightly modified to the Egyptian setting and again used to identify prevailing mortality patterns among preschoolers. Following implementation of different treatment schedules, child mortality rates dropped significantly in specific input villages over the period of study. The project site was re-visited six years following completion of the investigation confirming utility and effectiveness of the VA method, and applied intervention modalities respectively.  Development  Many iterations and variations of the questionnaires used in VA have been developed by health professionals and researchers. The World Health Organization (WHO), exercising its global mandate to set norms and standards for health, published a book outlining VA standards in 2007. At that time, the emphasis was primarily on standard paper questionnaires that could subsequently be evaluated by physicians to assign causes of death. However, work was already underway in parallel to develop methods for automatically processing VA interview material, because the time, cost and consistency with which physicians were able to assign causes of death to VA interview material were major constraints on the overall process, particularly for large-scale approaches. Additionally, the reason that many deaths were not certified routinely in resource-challenged settings was often associated with a lack of available physicians. Tentative versions of automatic methods were tested in Vietnam in 2003 and in Ethiopia in 2006. Methodological development was led by Prof. Peter Byass at the Umeå Centre for Global Health Research in Sweden, and the name InterVA (for Interpreting Verbal Autopsy) was coined. As it became increasingly clear that automated interpretation of VA was a promising approach, WHO gave further attention to the structure of the VA interview from the perspective that the interview material might be automatically processed. In 2012 WHO published the first VA standard that was specifically designed for automated processing, defining both interview questions and cause of death categories linked to ICD-10. This was followed by the release of the InterVA-4 model which directly corresponded to the 2012 WHO standard. The open-access InterVA-4 knowledge base was also incorporated into the related InsilicoVA model, which set out to analyse standard VA data using a more complex statistical method. Around the same time, the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) were undertaking an empirical study based at several tertiary hospitals to collect a reference database linking clinically investigated final illnesses to subsequent VA interviews. This was envisaged as a knowledge base for building automated VA models, and several possible strategies were proposed at a conference in Indonesia in 2011. The reference database was subsequently made publicly available. However, it was not fully compliant with the 2012 WHO VA standard for VA interviews or cause of death categories. An automated model called SmartVA-Analyze, based on the content of the PHMRC reference database and using the Tariff model, was subsequently released. On October 1, 2019, Bloomberg Philanthropies announced it would spend $120 million over the next four years to develop verbal autopsies in 25 countries.  Current status  In order to harmonize the various VA standards and approaches in use, WHO undertook further revisions and generated a 2016 WHO VA standard. This 2016 WHO standard included all the items from the 2012 WHO version plus all the items from the SmartVA tool as an important strategy for the revision. On the same principle that the 2016 WHO standard was intended to harmonise and unify available VA resources, InterVA-5 was released during 2018 as an integrating model which has the capacity to process input data in the 2012 WHO, SmartVA or 2016 WHO formats and generate causes of death according to the 2016 WHO standard.

Until 2009, it was considered as the same species as the golden palm civet, but proposed to be given specific rank. Taxonomy The scientific name Paradoxurus montanus was proposed by Edward Frederick Kelaart in 1852 for a fulvous brown palm civet form the mountains of Sri Lanka. It used to be considered a synonym of the golden palm civet P. zeylonensis. It was proposed to be reclassified as a distinct species by Colin Groves in 2009 based on coat colour and skull measurements of zoological specimens. Genetic analysis indicates that specimens of P. montanus, P. aureus and P. stenocephalus share the same haplotype. Because of their low genetic difference, they should neither be considered distinct species nor subspecies, but junior synonyms of the golden palm civet. Characteristics The body color of the Sri Lankan brown palm civet is dark, slightly greyish-toned wood- brown, and paler on the underside. The tip of the tail is yellowish-white. It differs from Paradoxurus aureus. All the other morphological appearances is equal to P. aureus , by having large eyes with vertical pupils, round prominent ears and furry skin and tail. Its feet have retractable claws. A remarkable feature of this species is its scent. This civet is known to emit a very pleasant odour from anal glands, where other palm civets emit an unpleasant odour.http://wizzley.com/sri-lankan-brown-palm-civets-paradoxurus- montanus-non-ringtails-of-sri-lanka/ This scent is reminiscent of Michelia champaca flowers, known colloquially as sapumal in Sinahala language.

Early life  He was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, west of Detroit. He attended Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts and Harvard College (now University), where he studied under Charles Eliot Norton, Harvard’s first professor of art history. Norton emphasized the moral value of art and the equivalence of architecture with the other arts, and these ideas provided a lasting inspiration for Moore. During his college years Moore was editor of the Harvard Crimson and also wrote weekly columns for a couple of Detroit papers.Lohr  Early career  After graduation from Harvard in 1878, Moore spent ten years as a journalist in Detroit, eventually becoming Washington correspondent for the Detroit Evening Journal. He became acquainted with Detroit businessman and Republican politician James McMillan, and when McMillan was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1889, Moore accompanied him to Washington as his personal secretary. McMillan was appointed chairman of the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia and, as clerk, Moore drafted many committee reports outlining progressive policies to improve utilities, social services, transportation, and recreation in the city. In 1900 Moore completed a Ph.D. in history at Columbian College (now George Washington University).Lessoff, Lohr  McMillan Commission  In 1901, Moore played a key role in securing passage of a bill to establish the Senate Park Commission, also known as the McMillan Commission, convened to formulate a plan for the future growth of Washington that would recapture the aims of the 1791 L’Enfant plan for the city and create a monumental appearance for the National Mall. The commission was composed of four men—architects Daniel Burnham and Charles Follen McKim, sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.—all of whom had been intimately involved with the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, in Chicago. The fair’s classical buildings embodied the ideals of the City Beautiful movement, a revival of classical architecture in the Victorian era as a means of encouraging civic betterment through unified groupings of buildings that integrated typically allegorical sculpture, painting, and landscape with architecture. Burnham had been the fair’s director and was currently president of the American Institute of Architects. Moore served as the McMillan Commission’s secretary, and in the summer of 1901 accompanied the commission on a seven-week visit to European cities and estates that had influenced the L’Enfant Plan. With Olmsted, he wrote the 1901 Report of the Senate Park Commission, also known as the McMillan Report or McMillan Plan, still used as a template for the growth of Washington’s central area. Moore promoted adoption of the plan as the legitimate successor to the L’Enfant Plan, sharing its principles concerning the reciprocal relation of key sites and the need for an overall unity. Moore believed deeply in the symbolic importance of Washington as the capital of the nation.Pamela Scott, “Charles Moore” in Luebke, ed., \\"Civic Art,\\" p. 87 James McMillan died in 1902 and Moore returned to Michigan the next year. He worked for more than a decade in various banks and businesses in Detroit and Boston.  U.S. Commission of Fine Arts  In 1910, he was a founding member of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), in Washington, a presidentially appointed federal commission of seven nationally recognized experts on the arts and architecture charged with overseeing design on federal property in the city; Moore remained a member for almost 30 years, serving as chairman from 1915 to 1937. The first major project reviewed by the CFA was the Lincoln Memorial, which anchored the western end of the Mall and established its central design theme of national unity. During Moore’s tenure the commission reviewed the design of the U.S. Supreme Court, the extension of the U.S. Capitol Grounds, the Federal Triangle complex, and the redesign of the Mall as a tree-lined greensward creating an unbroken vista between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument. Through skillful maneuvers, Moore ensured that the route of Arlington Memorial Bridge ran between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery. As CFA chairman in the 1930s, Moore witnessed the gradual waning of historically based classicism and its replacement by a historic modernism. After an epic battle over the appropriate form of the national memorial to Thomas Jefferson, Moore resigned his chairmanship in September 1937 and retired to a son’s home in Washington state, where he died in 1942 at the age of 86.Luebke, Tompkins  Other accomplishments  In addition to his work with the CFA, Moore also served as director of the Detroit Museum of Art (1914–17) and as acting chief of the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress (1918–27). For the library, he acquired the papers of notable Americans, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. Moore was the author of numerous essays, articles, and histories, many related to city planning and architecture, and biographies of Daniel Burnham, Charles McKim, and George Washington. He was active in the restoration of Wakefield, George Washington’s birthplace in Virginia, and other activities marking the 1932 centennial of Washington’s birth.Obituary, Washington Evening Star  Associations  Moore was a member of the American Academy in Rome, the National Conference on City Planning, the American Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Detroit City Plan and Improvement Commission, as well as the New York Architectural League and the Michigan Historical Commission. Affable and politically adroit, Moore was a friend of presidents, including McKinley and Coolidge, and was skilled at working behind the scenes to gather support for the CFA’s planning goals. Moore was a member of many private clubs, including the Cosmos Club in Washington and the Century Club in New York. During his long career he received numerous awards and honors, including honorary membership in the American Institute of Architects and the American Society of Landscape Architects, and he was named a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor in 1924. He was married to Alice Williams Merriam from 1878 until her death in 1914. They had two sons.

The law requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to exempt motor carriers that transport home heating oil from certain federal regulations if the Governor of a state declares a state of emergency caused by a shortage of residential heating fuel. It would also require the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to notify states if certain petroleum reserves fall below historical averages. The bill became law during the 113th United States Congress. Background Due to the extreme cold during the 2013–14 North American cold wave, Congress had authorized more heating fuels to be transported than usual because several states were running out of home heating fuel. Thirty-six states were under emergency orders that provided regulatory relief from the FMCSA during January 2014. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Reliable Home Heating Act would direct the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to recognize any 30-day emergency period declared by a state governor due to a shortage of residential heating fuel (and up to two additional 30-day periods) as one during which FMCSA federal motor carrier safety regulations shall not apply to any motor carrier or driver operating a commercial motor vehicle providing residential heating fuel in a geographic area designated as under a state of emergency. The bill would define the term \\"residential heating fuel\\" to include heating oil, natural gas, and propane. The bill would direct the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, using data compiled from the Administration's Weekly Petroleum Status Reports, to notify the governor of each state in a Petroleum Administration for Defense District if that district's inventory of residential heating fuel has been below the most recent five-year average for more than three consecutive weeks. The bill would declare that a covered emergency exemption from FMCSA federal motor carrier safety regulations shall remain in effect until May 31, 2014, unless the United States Secretary of Transportation (DOT) determines that the emergency for which the exemption was provided ends before that date. The bill would define \\"covered emergency exemption\\" as one issued or extended between February 5, 2014, and the date of enactment of this Act to effect regulatory relief for commercial motor vehicle operations directly assisting the delivery of propane and home heating fuels. The bill would state that nothing in this Act may be construed to prohibit the FMCSA from issuing or extending a covered emergency exemption beyond May 31, 2014, under other federal law. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on April 9, 2014. This is a public domain source. S. 2086 would require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to exempt motor carriers that transport home heating oil from certain federal regulations if the Governor of a state declares a state of emergency caused by a shortage of residential heating fuel. The bill also would require the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to notify states if certain petroleum reserves fall below historical averages. Based on information from the affected agencies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting S. 2086 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. S. 2086 would require FMCSA to exempt commercial motor carriers that transport home heating oil from some federal regulations for up to 90 days in states where the Governor has declared a state of emergency caused by a shortage of residential heating fuel. Under current law, FMCSA may make such exemptions for up to 30 days. The bill also would require FMSCA to complete a rulemaking implementing the new authority and to study the effects of extending the regulatory exemptions. EIA would be required to notify states if certain petroleum reserves fall below the most recent five-year average for more than three consecutive weeks. Based on information from the agencies involved, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would not have any significant costs. S. 2086 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Reliable Home Heating Act was introduced into the United States Senate on March 6, 2014 by Sen. John Thune (R, SD). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and then reported alongside Senate report 113-162. The Senate voted on May 21, 2014 to pass the bill by unanimous consent. It was received in the United States House of Representatives on May 22, 2014 and referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On June 23, 2014, the House voted in a voice vote to pass the bill. President Barack Obama signed it into law on June 30, 2014. Debate and discussion The National Governors Association (NGA) was in favor of the bill, arguing that it \\"would substantially improve the ability of governors to effectively address critical home heating fuel shortages in their states.\\" The NGA argued that \\"it is critical that (the governors) are empowered with the resources they need to continue to provide such robust responses,\\" such as their response to shortages after Hurricane Sandy. Senator Thune, who introduced the bill said that he was \\"hopeful that this legislation will eliminate red tape for governors to better meet the needs of their residents and businesses during what can be very dangerous conditions.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 2086 *beta.congress.gov S. 2086 *GovTrack.us S. 2086 *OpenCongress.org S. 2086 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 2086 *Congressional Budget Office's report on S. 2086 *Senate Report 113-162 on S. 2086 Category:United States federal transportation legislation Category:Acts of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States federal labor legislation Category:United States federal energy legislation Category:United States federal commerce legislation ","title":"Reliable Home Heating Act"},{"id":"42843440","text":"Bruno Franz Kaulbach (1880-1963) was an Austrian lawyer and a member of the Kohn family from Bennisch whose descendants include the former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.  Early life and education  Dr. Bruno Franz Kaulbach was born Bruno Franz Kohn on 29 December 1880, the first son of Bernard Kohn (1854-1915) and Hermine Kolban (1861-1939). The Kohn family was part of a small Jewish community in the town of Bennisch (now Horni Benesov, Czech Republic) which was then part of Austria-Hungary. Bruno and his three brothers; Alfred, Richard and Oskar changed their surnames to 'Kaulbach' in the early 1900s. At about the same time they renounced the Jewish faith and converted to Roman Catholicism. Bruno completed his law studies at the University of Vienna in 1912. In the same year he married Maria Theresia Hinterholzer Meyer (1886-1972) who came from a prominent business and political family in Innsbruck and whose uncle was the painter and political activist Edgar Meyer (painter).  Career  During the First World War Bruno served as a first lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Army. For a time Bruno and Maria lived in Graz where Bruno worked as a lawyer and where their children Martin and Eva were born. Bruno was also a regular contributor to magazines and newspapers. By 1935 Bruno and his family were living in Hall in Tirol. With the rise of National Socialism and because of his Jewish heritage, Bruno realized his children would be in danger. He was instrumental in re- settling them in England where they eventually became British citizens. On 12 August 1943 Bruno Kaulbach was arrested by the Gestapo in Innsbruck. He was transferred to Dachau Concentration Camp and held there as a political prisoner until the camp was liberated on 29 April 1945. His three brothers, together with members of their families, were murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Only Richard Kaulbach's daughter, Ilse, escaped - to the U.S.. In December 1948 Bruno spoke at the American War Crimes Court, Dachau. He cited the hardship and suffering inflicted on the people of Tirol by the Nazi Gauleiter, Franz Hofer, and suggested that American complicity was to blame for Hofer's escape from internment camp Bruno Kaulbach died in 1963 at Hall in Tirol. In 1979 he was posthumously awarded the medal Ehrenzeichen für Verdienste um die Befreiung Österreichs, \\"for active service in the Resistance to National Socialism\\", by the Austrian government.  Connection with the Kerry Family  When John Forbes Kerry ran for the United States Presidency in 2004, little was known about his paternal ancestry. Researchers, hired by the Boston Globe newspaper, discovered that Kerry's great grandfather was a Jewish brewer named Benedikt Kohn (1824-1876) from the Austrian town of Bennisch (now Horni Benesov, Czech Republic). One of Benedikt's sons, Fritz, adopted the family name of 'Kerry'. In 1904 Fritz Kerry (John Kerry's grandfather) and his family left Austria for a new life in the United States. Another son of Benedikt Kohn was Bernard Kohn, Bruno Kaulbach's father; John Kerry and Bruno Kaulbach were first cousins once removed. The trajectory of the Kaulbach strand of the family, previously unknown because of the name change, was revealed by the Boston Globe newspaper in the fall of 2013  References  Category:1880 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Austrian lawyers Category:Austrian people of Czech-Jewish descent Category:John Kerry Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:People from Graz Category:People from Innsbruck-Land District Category:People from Hall in Tirol Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Bruno Franz Kaulbach"},{"id":"42843445","text":"John Benedict (February 6, 1649 – November 11, 1729) was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from Norwalk, Connecticut Colony in the sessions of May 1722 and May 1725.

He was known for his promotion of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana. Background The son of Dr. Armand L. Brinkhaus and the former Juliet Thoms, Brinkhaus graduated from Sunset High School, the Roman Catholic Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then the University of Southwestern Louisiana at Lafayette, from which in 1958 he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1960, he received his Juris Doctor from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. He was a member of the American and St. Landry Parish bar associations, the American Judicature Society, and the American Trial Lawyers Association. He was the first law clerk at the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit in Lake Charles, working under Judges Albert Tate, Jr. and Cleveland Fruge. He practiced law with Judge Kaliste Saloom in Lafayette and became a partner in the law firm of Olivier and Brinkhaus in Sunset, at which he continued to practice until his death. Brinkhaus served on the boards of St. Landry Homestead Federal Savings Bank, the Opelousas-St. Landry Chamber of Commerce, Doctor's Hospital of Opelousas, and the South St. Landry Community Library. Brinkhaus was affiliated with the Southwest Rehabilitation Center, the American Red Cross, the Boy Scouts of America, Lions International, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Woodmen of the World, the National Rifle Association, the Louisiana Cattleman's Association, and the Roman Catholic men's organization, the Knights of Columbus.\\"Louisiana: Brinkhaus, Armand\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008 (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2007), pp. 652 Brinkhaus and his wife, the former Margaret Bellemin, had seven children. Margaret Brinkhaus is a native of Grand Coteau, a small town in St. Landry Parish. Like her husband, she graduated from nearby Sunset High School and subsequently received a degree from Maryville College in St. Louis, Missouri. In recent years, she has operated a bed and breakfast in a restored railroad complex and has been involved in the canning of jellies, jams, and relishes as well as numerous arts and crafts enterprises. The Brinkhauses attended St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Grand Coteau in St. Landry Parish, where his funeral service was held. Brinkhaus also managed two family farms and played the piano, saxophone, and clarinet. He died of a short illness on February 12, 2017, at the age of eighty-one at Lafayette General Hospital in Lafayette. Political career In the state House under the administrations of Governors John McKeithen and Edwin Edwards, Brinkhaus served on CODOFIL, in which capacity he received the L'Ordre de la Pleiade for his work in promoting French language and culture. On August 19, 1972, having earlier in the year taken the oath of office for his second term in the Louisiana state House, Brinkhaus ran in the Democratic closed primary, prior to the establishment of the Louisiana nonpartisan blanket primary system, for Louisiana's 8th congressional district seat, since disbanded. He polled 31,934 votes (28.2 percent), but victory went to former U.S. Representative Gillis William Long of Alexandria, who finished with 61,452 votes (52.2 percent). Another contender was Democratic state Senator J. E. Jumonville, Sr., of Ventress in Pointe Coupee Parish. Long then reclaimed the seat by defeating in the general election held on November 7, 1972, the American Independent Party choice, Dr. S. R. Abramson of Marksville in Avoyelles Parish and the Republican Roy C. Strickland, then of Gonzales in Ascension Parish. Brinkhaus chaired the Senate Education Committee and was a major promoter of his alma mater, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He authored legislation to establish special protection for school teachers facing acts of violence from their unruly pupils. His law created the crime of assault of a school teacher with an enhanced penalty. Brinkhaus worked to provide low interest loans for the purchase of school buses and greater operational allowances for bus drivers. He worked for increases in pay for teachers and support personnel as well as for additional supplements to retired educators. He led the effort to require that a teacher evaluation plan be developed by local school boards, rather than the Louisiana Department of Education. Senator Brinkhaus also served at various times on the Senate Finance, Judiciary, and Agriculture committees. He sponsored legislation to halt the distribution of campaign contributions to legislators within the Louisiana State Capitol, the governor’s mansion, or any other state office building. He voted to require the disclosure of certain expenditures by persons who lobby the legislature and to require that individual legislators disclose the receipt of gifts of transportation, food, lodging, or entertainment. After five terms in the state Senate, Brinkhaus lost his bid for reelection in 1995 to the Republican Tommy Casanova, a Louisiana State University football legend. Casanova polled 21,543 votes (57.7 percent) to Brinkhaus's 15,793 (42.3 percent). Casanova then vacated the seat after one term. In addition to his legal practice, Brinkhaus was affiliated with Marta C Turksel Educational Consulting, location not specified. Brinkhaus created the Dr. Armand L. and Julia Thoms Brinkhaus Fund to benefit the Dupre Library at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. On November 7, 2009, the Acadian Museum in Erath inducted Brinkhaus into the \\"Order of Living Legends.\\" One of Brinkhaus' brother-in-law was the Republican state Representative Roderick Miller of Lafayette, whose term extended from 1966 to 1968, when Miller was defeated by Edgar G. \\"Sonny\\" Mouton, Jr., for a seat in the state Senate. Miller's second wife was Brinkhaus' sister, Anna Jane Gaiennie Miller.

The order was named after the first large diamond to be found in South Africa, the Star of South Africa, which was found on the banks of the Orange River in 1869 and which sparked the New Rush, leading to the establishment of Kimberley. The Order of the Star of South Africa was expanded on 17 October 1978, when a non-military division, with decorations in five classes, was instituted for conferment on civilians and, from 1988, on senior police, prisons service and intelligence service officers, as well as foreign military attachés. The second of these five non-military decorations, the Star of South Africa, Grand Officer, ranks on par with the Star of South Africa, Silver. Award criteria The Star of South Africa, Silver was awarded to general and flag officers for exceptionally meritorious service of major military significance.

It was built in 1874 and is the highest-located tower in the mountain range of the Palatinate Forest.  Location  The tower is located in the east of the Palatinate Forest, within the nature park itself, on the Steigerkopf (), whose summit, including the tower site, belongs to an exclave of the municipality of Gommersheim.  Architecture  The octagonal tower is 13 metres high and was built of hewn bunter sandstone. The body of the structure is in two parts. The massive lower section has a perron that leads to a platform about 5 metres above the ground. Inside the narrower upper section of the tower, which is accessed from the platform from a door and has narrow, embrasure-like windows, is an internal staircase. The observation platform on the roof of the tower is protected by railings. Depending on the height of the surrounding trees, the views may be restricted.  History  The Schänzel Tower was erected in 1874 a result of Germany's nationalistic fervour after her victory in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870/71. In 1894 it was dedicated to the Prussian soldiers who suffered a defeat at this location during the Battle of Trippstadt on 13 July 1794, a hundred years earlier, including the death of the Prussian commander, General : When French Revolutionary troops conquered that part of Electoral Palatine on the left bank of the Rhine, a contingent of Prussian soldiers opposed them without success on the slopes of the Steigerkopf. Because the Prussians had built a small fieldwork (Schanze) on the mountainside, the Steigerkopf became known locally as the Schänzel; whence the name of the tower.

Her self-titled debut album was released in 2011 via Birth Records, a record label founded by Darker My Love and White Fence songwriter Tim Presley to release Pratt's music. She is often associated with the freak folk movement. Early life Pratt was raised by her mother, who exposed her to a broad range of artists, including Tim Buckley, X, and the Gun Club. She learned to play the guitar around the age of 15, after her older brother gave up playing his Stratocaster. She took his guitar and started practising with the T. Rex album, Electric Warrior. She was soon able to play the guitar parts of the whole record. She eventually began recording songs at the age of 16, using her mother's Fender guitar amp and microphone. Musical career After she moved to San Francisco, she was introduced to Tim Presley's solo project, White Fence, through Presley's brother, who was her roommate for three years. In the following years, Presley heard Pratt's demo songs through her then-boyfriend, who had posted her songs on Facebook. He eventually contacted her to release her music. Pratt's self-titled debut album was released in 2012 through Presley's label, Birth Records. Produced by Craig Gotsill, the album featured the songs that were originally recorded in 2007 over analogue tape. The initial 500 pressings of the album sold out in less than two weeks. It received attention from many music websites and magazines, including Pitchfork (website), Consequence of Sound and PopMatters. In January 2014, she revealed the studio version of a new track, \\"Game That I Play.\\" In October 2014, Pratt announced her sophomore album, On Your Own Love Again. In October 2018, she announced her third album, Quiet Signs, and released a video for a new track, \\"This Time Around.\\" Pitchfork reviewed the song, giving it the Best New Music designation and noting a stylistic shift, comparing it to \\"a Tropicalia version of a Christmas song, or a ’60s jukebox standard playing in a beach town diner during the off-season.\\" The album was released in February 2019 on the Brooklyn independent label Mexican Summer. It was the first one recorded in a proper studio which provided a crystalline sound. The Pitchfork review states the album \\"warps the typically direct, observational role of a singer-songwriter into something altogether more mystifying\\". Musical style According to Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound, Pratt's music \\"displays a lyrical and musical range without straying from a palette of picked acoustic guitar and raw, bending vocals\\" and nods to \\"60s folk, California classic rock, and the early 2000s freak folk.\\" She is compared to various folk artists, including Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Sibylle Baier, David Crosby and Karen Dalton. She also expressed admiration for Ariel Pink. Pratt dislikes the Joan Baez comparisons, and is hesitant about being classified strictly as \\"folk\\" or \\"freak-folk.\\" In an interview with Impose magazine, she stated on the freak folk comparisons: Discography Studio albums * Jessica Pratt (2012, Birth Records) * On Your Own Love Again (2015, Drag City) * Quiet Signs (2019, Mexican Summer/City Slang) References External links * Category:Living people Category:1987 births Category:Guitarists from San Francisco Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American folk singers Category:American folk guitarists Category:Freak folk Category:Singers from San Francisco Category:Songwriters from San Francisco Category:21st-century American women singers Category:21st-century American women guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists ","title":"Jessica Pratt (musician)"},{"id":"42844077","text":"The Floodgate is a fantasy novel by Elaine Cunningham, set in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and based on the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.

It was founded on 26 January 2004 by Thomas Eastes and nine associates invited by him, Abios Khoele, Charl van Wyk, Pieter van Wyk, Juan de greeff, Martin Hedington, Dr. Richard Wesson, Peter Moss, Brett Nortje and Dick Boothroyd. Because resources were limited to the voluntary efforts of its ten founders, it functioned as an advocacy group and no attempt was made to make it a membership based organisation. That became possible only when the founders handed control to the present executive in 2015. Membership has since grown rapidly and GOSA is now the biggest organisation of its kind and thus able to defend firearm ownership rights more effectively. GOSA is the most diverse firearms group in South Africa, on levels ranging from race, gender, and religion, to political affiliation and income levels. GOSA’s membership is on public display on its Facebook page. One of the founding members of GOSA, Charl van Wyk, was a congregant at the St. James Church in Cape Town when the St. James Church Massacre happened. Azanian People’s Liberation Army (APLA) militants attacked the church with automatic rifles and a grenade. Van Wyk was armed with a five-shot snub nosed revolver at the time, and returned fire, prompting the attackers to flee. The death toll stood at eleven, and an injured count of fifty-eight when the chaos ended. Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, spoke at a GOSA conference at the time of GOSA's founding, and publicly criticized the South African police chief who opposed the group.  History  A photo taken at the founding of Gun Owners South Africa at the Parow Civic Centre in Cape Town, attended by Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.Left to right: T.F. Eastes, P. van Wyk, A. Khoele, W. de Waal, L. Pratt, R. Boothroyd, C. van Wyk Gun Owners South Africa was founded in 2004 in response to disillusionment with the other established firearm rights group, the South African Gun Owners Association (SAGA). SAGA has been in existence since 1985, and is still active to present day. In the years 2004 until 2015, because GOSA was a very small organisation it was not well known to the general public. But it used its limited resources to best effect via the media which was, and still is, the best way to reach the public. In 2011, the South African homicide rate started a gradual climbing trend, and in 2013, revelations of the bad state of affairs and corruption at the Central Firearms Registry had emerged. By 2015, the GOSA leadership had realised that disillusionment with SAGA was not going to change any time soon, and started to slowly put in place the necessary mechanisms of moving towards a professionally organised organisation, including a paid membership structure and benefits such as legal financial insurance against firearm discharge under legal circumstances. Other changes included a more inclusive and simplified brand name (changing from the old English and Afrikaans abbreviations \\"Wapeneienaars Suid Africa / Gun Owners South Africa\\" (WESA/GOSA), to just the English abbreviation, and a logo update. Additionally, GOSA also contributed a significant amount of funding to Dr. David Klatzow's work on the validity of ballistic fingerprinting, which delivered a scathing rebuke of the 'science' in his article \\"Defective Science: An Inquiry into the Valaidity of Ballistic Fingerprinting as a Reliable Tool and into the Feasibility of Establishing an Effective national Ballistic Imaging Database\\". Towards the end of 2015 and start of 2016, it became clear that paid membership structures in their current form were inefficient and putting the finances at a deficit. They were unbundled and simplified, with the insurance offering being moved to Gunsure (a now discontinued firearm insurance firm), and the membership offerings instead reflecting discount legal services for firearm administrative matters pertaining to firearm licensing. With the collapse of Gunsure, GOSA started to look back at bundling a reformed insurance membership option for firearm owners in January 2018. With the start to 2017, the reformed membership structures had started turning significant profits for the organisation, and this afforded the ability to hire a small complement of full time staff, allow the funding of more travelling expenses for official business (such as flights between Pretoria and Cape Town, where the capital and parliamentary precinct are based respectively), a new website, and put a presence with a permanent stand at the Huntex firearms and hunting expo in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape. The investment in a Huntex presence dealt a negative drag to GOSA, and the leadership quickly culled the initiative before the 2018 Huntex expos went ahead. By November 2017, GOSA had stabilized the financial flows again. In the year from January 2016 until December 2017, Facebook membership had grown from just shy of 21 000 members, to 35 000. Paid membership growth was slower, rising from zero in late 2015, to over three thousand at the end of 2017. In a country of between 2.5 million to 3.0 million firearm owners, these numbers are very low, and GOSA faces an uphill battle in mobilising as many as possible. In February 2018, Jonathan Wright lodged a complaint on behalf of GOSA with the Press Council of South Africa against Jacaranda 94.2 FM after an article on the latter's website claimed that research shows people are four times more likely to have their own firearms used against them; and that having a firearm in one's home \\"has been proven to increase the risk of a firearm homicide or firearm suicide in the home\\" unless it is kept in a safe. GOSA argued that the first claim was unsubstantiated and the second was biased, and asked for Jacaranda FM to publicly retract the statements. The article was pulled once controversy surrounding the claims came about, but no reason for taking the piece down was given. The Press Ombud, Johan Retief, ruled that Jacaranda had \\"to publish a retraction, correction or explanation as to why the story was pulled\\", which is required by section 1.10 of the Press Code.  Political activity  GOSA is not associated with any political parties or candidates, and opts instead to engage and lobby directly with political entities willing to engage. On the other hand, within this Sphere GOSA is diametrically opposed to the disarmament of law abiding citizens and organizations, such as Gun Free South Africa, which promote that agenda.  Programs  GOSA currently runs the GOSA Girls on Fire campaign, which was started in 2015 to coincide with the 16 Days of Activism, which is aimed at teaching and increasing female participation in firearm related activities.

The ferry was also referred to as East Ferry of Erskine as there was another ferry to Dumbarton a few miles down river, known as West Ferry. It is reputed to be the oldest ferry crossing of the Clyde. The crossing was part of the A740 route from Paisley to Old Kilpatrick. It was established in 1777 and replaced by the Erskine Bridge in 1971. History At Erskine, the Clyde was shallow enough to ford on foot and had been used for this purpose in past centuries. The river was then dredged to allow large ships to sail upriver to Glasgow. This brought a requirement of a ferry service between Erskine and Old Kilpatrick. Initially, a passenger-only service was available. The Clyde Navigation Trust acquired the service in 1907 and added a vehicle ferry boat to the crossing. The previous owner was the 12th Lord Blantyre. Boats There have been many different types of boats used throughout the years. Initially a punt pushed along by poles was used prior to 1832. From 1832 to 1860 a chain ferry replaced the punt; ferry operators pulled on chains to cross the river. A steam-powered ferry was then used until closure. Between 1856–57, Thomas Wingate constructed the first steam-powered ferry called Urania. It was used until the early 1900s. In February 1903, the Paisley and Renfrewshire Gazette newspaper reported on an order placed with Messrs John Reid and Co shipbuilders for a new ferry steamer for the crossing. A third ferry was launched on 16 July 193 which was in service until the Erskine Bridge opened in 1971. It was built by Messrs Fleming and Ferguson. Service The service ran from 6am to 10 or 11pm in the summer. During the winter months and on Sundays the service started at 10am. The fare in 1937 was 9d for a car and driver; this had increased to 2s by 1963. The journey over the Clyde took less than 5 minutes. At one point, connecting ferries from Greenock and Glasgow stopped at Erskine Ferry on an hourly basis. A Paisley holiday in March 1912 saw 251 cycles, 75 motor cars and 2,073 foot passengers cross on the ferry. Accidents On 18 June 1963, an accident killing two ex- servicemen visiting the Erskine Hospital occurred at the ferry. The driver of a motor vehicle put his foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, this resulted in the car smashing through the safety barriers on the ferry and into the Clyde, killing the driver and passenger. The two men and car were recovered from the Clyde. One of the men is buried in Erskine, just outside the hospital grounds. A bus full of passengers also crashed through the barriers on 26 July 1946. The vehicle was pulled back on to the ferry and nobody was injured. A man was rescued from the Clyde on 18 January 1953 by the ferry-master. He had cycled down the slipway at Old Kilpatrick and missed the boat, resulting in him ending up in the water. Ferry Lodge Ferry Lodge is a category B listed building used by the ferry operators. The ticket office for foot passengers was on the Old Kilpatrick side: passengers from OK went through a turnstile to the right of the office (looking towards the ferry), those coming from the Erskine side passed through a turnstile to the left. Renfrewshire Council sold the building in 1983. Ferry Lodge, which is now a house, was designed by Sir Robert Smirke, the architect of the British Museum. There was also an inn nearby. This building is no longer here.

It memorializes the 1881 loss of while exploring the Arctic ice. Jeannette, with a crew of 33, collapsed and sank under surging ice in the summer of 1881. Her crew, commanded by George W. DeLong, took to the ice dragging three small boats. When open water was found, the boats were used to sail to the Lena Delta of Siberia, 700 miles distant. DeLong commanded a boat of 14 total crew members, Executive Officer Charles W. Chipp's boat's crew was 8 total crew members, and Engineer Officer George W. Melville's boat had 11. Chipp's boat was lost at sea with all hands. Engineer Melville's boat landed in the southern delta, and DeLong's boat came ashore farther to the north on 17 September 1881. Melville quickly found aid, as did the two hardiest sailors of DeLong's crew soon after. The 12 remaining, including DeLong, perished from starvation or exposure. Thus 20 of the original 33 did not survive the expedition. Monument description Ten of the lost twelve from DeLong's boat were discovered by Melville on 23 March 1882, and interred on the Lena Delta. Their bodies were marked by a stone cairn constructed locally, then later to be returned to the United States in 1884. The Jeanette Monument is evocative of the cairn erected by Melville in 1882. It was designed by George Partridge Colvocoresses, drawing instructor at the Academy. It has caked ice draped on the cross, and an antique anchor at the cross's base. The monument is situated near the cemetery's shore with Dorsey Creek, and near the mouth of the creek into the Severn River. Of the twenty names thought to be inscribed, only eleven appear. The monument was unveiled 30 October 1890, nine years exactly from the last entry in DeLong's journal of the expedition. There are no bodies interred under the monument.

He treated his crew mates for starvation and exposure in the northern Lena Delta. Ambler was one of the last three to perish, sometime after 30 October 1881. *George W. Melville was an Arctic explorer both before and after his time on Jeannette. A famous naval engineer, Melville rose to the rank of rear admiral. He died in 1912. *Raymond Lee Newcomb was the naturalist, artist, and astronomer on Jeannette, and a member of Melville's boat crew. He died in 1918. *William Dunbar was the ice pilot on Jeannette, and a member of Chipp's boat crew. He died, lost at sea, 12 September 1881. *Jerome J.

It is centered on the return of dead people to the living world and their impact on the daily lives of the people around them. The TV adaptation Resurrection was produced by ABC Studios and aired on March 9, 2014.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2647586/  Plot  The series follows the residents of Arcadia, North Carolina, in particular the Hargrave family, whose lives are upended when their loved ones return from the dead, unaged since their deaths. Among the returned is Jacob Hargrave, an eight-year-old boy who drowned 32 years earlier. Having been found alive, Jacob is brought back by the Bureau, which investigates the phenomenon of the Returned. The military agent Bellamy returns Jacob to his parents, Harold and Lucille Hargrave, who must deal with his return. The novel also occasionally looks at the phenomenon from the viewpoint of the Returned, who appear to have no knowledge of or explanation for their return, and only want to live their lives. The Returned are described as being largely identical to their pre-death selves except for strange quirks that are frequently described as odd or unnerving by people who formerly knew them. Harold initially refuses to see the Returned Jacob as his son, as he had been the one to pull Jacob's body out of the river, but Lucille fully embraces his return as a miracle. As the novel progresses Harold slowly softens to Jacob's presence, even going so far as to willingly accompany the boy when the military imprisons all of the Returned at an Arcadian schoolhouse. While imprisoned Harold is made the temporary caretaker of an elderly woman with dementia, Patricia - a woman he later discovers is Bellamy's mother, as the agent knew that Harold would treat her with consideration. The imprisonment is met with some controversy on both sides, as the Returned resent being caged like animals, while a movement called the \\"True Living\\" see the Returned as beings that need to be destroyed. This movement strikes a particular chord with Fred Green, a local widower who grows resentful towards the Returned when his wife does not come back. Fred leads other locals in a series of protests that eventually grow violent and result in a riot at the schoolhouse where the Returned are tear gassed. After the riot the entire town is put in lockdown and used as a containment facility for the Returned, which only causes the townspeople to grow more resentful. During all of this Lucille is left alone at her house trying to make sense of everything, and she takes in a Returned family, the Wilsons. After they are abducted she begins to believe that she is supposed to help defend the Returned, leading her to stage a revolt that results in the Returned's taking control of the town. She manages to save Harold, Jacob, and most of the Wilsons, although Jim Wilson is killed in the process. They make it home, only Fred follows them and threatens to burn down their home if they do not surrender all of the Returned. Harold tries to trick Fred into believing that he's killed the Returned Wilsons and Jacob, but Fred sees through this and proceeds to burn the house down. The Wilsons manage to escape, but Lucille dies trying to protect Jacob. Fred nearly kills Jacob and Harold, but is moved to sympathy after Jacob states that he doesn't know the reason why he returned instead of his wife. After the fire Harold rebuilds the house, but Jacob has grown quiet and withdrawn, spending his days at Lucille's grave. Bellamy occasionally visits them and on one visit informs them that the Returned are slowly vanishing. Harold finds a letter left by Lucille wherein she admits that she's always known that Returned Jacob wasn't their son, but advises Harold to love Jacob and let them go, as this is the proper order of things. As he goes outside, Harold finds that Jacob has vanished and realizes that while Lucille never believed that the Returned Jacob was her son, Harold always knew.  Reception  The novel received positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews stated, \\"Poet and debut author Mott has written a breathtaking novel that navigates emotional minefields with realism and grace.\\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jason-mott/the-returned/ Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Toward the end, the plot veers into standard thriller territory, with hints of Nicholas Sparks-level mawkishness.

This was on the same day as other United Kingdom local elections. Labour won all 51 seats on the council in 2010, but by the time of this election had only 44 councillors due to defections with Robert Douglas, Dorothy Hunt, Graham Letchford and Tariq Saeed defecting to the UK Independence Party, and James McDermott, Barry Poulton and Gerald Vincent defecting to the Socialist Labour Party. All of these councillors stood for re-election in the borough representing their new parties (aside from Letchford, who stood in the Enfield Council election), but none retained their seats, with Labour candidates winning all 51 seats for the second consecutive election. The only ward where Labour faced any real challenge was Mayesbrook, where the borough's former Labour mayor Dorothy Hunt, now representing UKIP, failed to win a seat by 12 votes. UKIP stood candidates in every ward for the first time, and finished as runners-up to Labour in every ward except Longbridge. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats remained on the fringes in the borough. The British National Party, who won 12 seats on the council in 2006, all of which they lost in 2010, declined even further at this election, only standing candidates in three wards and picking up a total of 1,137 votes, placing them sixth overall.

It takes place in the same fictional setting as the stories in the collection Tales from the White Hart. Plot The tale is told through a narrator that Clarke often uses, Harry Purvis, one of the regulars at the White Hart pub. He intervenes in a discussion of the depiction of \\"death rays\\" in pulp science fiction. Most science fiction pictures show a visible beam but visible light is harmless. However, Harry insists he knows of a death ray that was quite visible. Harry relates the tale of Edgar Burton, a stockbroker who retires to the Yorkshire moors with his younger wife, who quickly tires of country life. Edgar soon realizes that she is having an affair, but he is content to carry on with his hobby of astronomy. However, he eventually feels that he is being made a fool, and is irritated that her midnight returns from her trysts are ruining his observing sessions as her car headlights shine on the house from a sharp bend in the road. Edgar concocts a scheme to kill his wife by building a searchlight and blinding her with it as she makes the bend, which is next to a cliff. In due course, he carries out the plan and sees the car plunge over the cliff. Edgar is shocked to learn that he has killed the lover instead of his wife. The couple were about to elope, and the man was on his way to break the news. Edgar goes insane with guilt and is institutionalized, leaving his wife in charge of his considerable fortune.

The same three ships also captured Jeune Emilie and Recovery, though they shared the capture of Recovery with HMS Unite, and . Scourges next capture occurred a few days later, on 21 February. Scourge chased a French privateer for three hours before catching up with her five or six leagues off the coast. The privateer was Furet, pierced for 14 guns. She had 10 mounted; the other four were in her hold. She also had a crew of 50 men, as well as 22 English prisoners, seven of whom were wounded. Under the command of Benoish Giron she was 20 days out of Lorient. Glynn described Furet as being coppered and a fast sailer. Commander Samuel Warren replaced Glynn and sailed Scourge to the Leeward Islands on 7 June. On 28 September Scourge captured the French privateer schooner Sarazine off Marie-Galante. Sarazine, of Guadaloupe, was armed with six guns and had a crew of 58 men; Warren sent them into Port Royal, Martinique. Sarazine had been out 10 days but had not captured anything. Next, Scourge detained on 4 December the schooner Amazon, of 90 tons (bm), which had been sailing with provisions from Baltimore to Surinam. The capture took place too windward of Dominique and Scourge sent Amazon into Saint Pierre, Martinique. Amazon had been a prize to the French privateer Hannibal. On 23 January 1798, Scourge captured Neustra Segniora de la Providentia; the vessel and cargo were condemned at Tortola. Two weeks later, on 8 February, Scourge and Roebuck captured the schooner Betsey, which too was condemned at Tortola. Scourge and Aimable captured the French privateer Triomphe (Triumph) on 6 April. Two days later they captured the French privateer Chasseur. Both captures took place off Porto Rico. Triomphe was a brig of 14 guns and 88 men; Chasseur was a schooner of two guns and 18 men. On 1 May Scourge chased a French 14-gun privateer brig on shore at St. Martin's. The privateer's crew escaped after setting fire to the brig, which blew up before boats from Scourge could reach it. On 20 January 1799, Scourge captured a Spanish brig from Cadiz bound to La Guira with a cargo of wine, brandy, and merchandise. Scourge brought the prize into Trinidad. In early to mid-July July 1800 Scourge, which had been out in the West Indies since 13 April 1997, returned to Great Britain as part of the escort of the about 91 sail of the West India fleet. On 20 August, she passed up the Bristol Channel with 11 vessels out of a convoy of 41 vessels that was taking to the Thames, the rest of the vessels being destined for Liverpool and Glasgow.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.248. Scourge arrived at Portsmouth two days later.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.246. On 14 September Scourge was paid off, and her crew turned over to .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.253. Fate The Commissioners of the Navy offered Scourge for sale at Portsmouth on 11 August 1802. She sold that month.

The Monastery of the Mother of God in Berta or Bertay is first mentioned by the 10th-century Georgian author Giorgi Merchule as a part of Georgian monastic communities operating under the guidance of Grigol of Khandzta (759–861) in what then was the Georgian Bagratid principality of Klarjeti. The monastery sat on a hill overlooking what is now the village of Ortaköy and consisted of several structures, of which the main church was a domed structure faced with smoothly finished small blocks. After the Ottoman takeover of the area in the 16th century, the church was abandoned. In the 19th century, the remaining edifice was converted into a mosque and a minaret was added to it. The ruins of a large rectangular refectory have survived to the north of the former church.  Berta manuscripts  The monastery also functioned as a center for literary activities. Two important Georgian manuscripts known as the Berta Gospels have survived. One, dating from 988, is preserved at the Museum of Andover Newton Theological School in the United States; the other (Q-906) dates from the 12th century and is kept at the National Center for Manuscripts in Tbilisi, Georgia.

The building consists of three main sections: the original building, completed in 1884, and additions constructed in the 1920s and 1980s. The newer addition currently houses the National Assembly (the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of South Africa), and the original building houses the National Council of Provinces (the upper house of Parliament). The original parliament building was designed in a Neoclassical style, incorporating features of Cape Dutch architecture. The later additions have been so designed as to blend with the original building. The Houses of Parliament have been declared a National Heritage Site by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) and given grade 1 national heritage status, the highest grade set by SAHRA.http://www.sahra.org.za/sahris/about/news/sa-parliament-declared- national-heritage-site History The Masonic Lodge which served as the venue of the first Cape Parliament. Queen Victoria granted permission for the establishment of a parliament in the Cape Colony in 1853. The first sittings were held in the Governor's residence, the Tuynhuys, after which sittings were held in the Goede Hoop Masonic Lodge. This building was used by the South African Freemasons. (Their Lodge were called de Goede Hoop) The then upper house was housed in the old supreme court building, which itself had been the slave lodge under VOC rule. The new parliament building Freeman's original elaborate plan for the new Parliament. The final Parliament building as constructed (without statues, dome or fountains) MPs noted that the masonic lodge building was unimposing, and did not command any respect. Although opposed by then Prime Minister Molteno due to financial considerations, a committee was set up to receive designs for a new parliament building. The committee selected an elaborate design by architect Charles Freeman, and construction began on 12 May 1875, with the then Governor of the Cape Colony, Henry Barkly, laying the cornerstone. Almost immediately it was discovered that Freeman's plans were faulty. Freeman's errors were compounded by the presence of groundwater, and a recalculation of the budget revealed that the actual costs would be many times the original figure that the government had allowed for. For his incompetence, Freeman was fired, and Henry Greaves was appointed architect in 1876. Freeman's plans were altered to exclude seemingly unnecessarily expensive features such as a central dome, statues, parapets and fountains. Building re-commenced, but was delayed – this time by the British overthrow of the Cape government in 1878, the ensuing Confederation Wars, and finally by the building company going bankrupt in 1883. Greaves tenaciously completed the job however, and the large, stately, but relatively unpretentious building was finally opened in 1884.Phyllis Lewsen: The First Crises in Responsible Government in the Cape Colony. University of The Witwatersrand / Argief-jaarboek vir Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis. 1940/3.

The old Assembly chamber became the Parliamentary Dining Room, run by the catering department of South African Railways & Harbours. A further extension was created in the 1980s, when the 1910 constitution was replaced with the awkward & novel tricameral constitution which provided a parliamentary house each for Whites, Coloureds, and Indians. Further constitutional changes moved the centre of power away from the old building and towards the newer wing.http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/11/03/die-parlementsgebou/ See also *Union Buildings *Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa References Category:Parliament of South Africa Category:Buildings and structures in Cape Town Category:Seats of national legislatures ","title":"Houses of Parliament, Cape Town"},{"id":"42844419","text":"Map of Havering electoral wards.

It was one of the most prominent cemeteries in the city until the 1860s. Burials there tapered significantly after Oak Hill Cemetery was founded nearby in 1848. The Presbyterian Burying Ground closed to new burials in 1887, and about 500 to 700 bodies were disinterred after 1891 when an attempt was made to demolish the cemetery and use the land for housing. The remaining graves fell into extensive disrepair. After a decade of effort, the District of Columbia purchased the cemetery in 1909 and built Volta Park there, leaving nearly 2,000 bodies buried at the site. Occasional human remains and tombstones have been discovered at the park since its construction. A number of figures important in the early history of Georgetown and Washington, D.C., military figures, politicians, merchants, and others were buried at Presbyterian Burying Ground. Founding the cemetery In 1780, Reverend Stephen Bloomer Balch established the Presbyterian Congregation in Georgetown (now known as Georgetown Presbyterian Church). The new Presbyterian congregation originally met in a local home, but in 1782 it built its first church home on the southeast corner of 30th and M Streets NW. It was the only Protestant church in the District of Columbia until 1805. The congregation grew swiftly, and the church was enlarged in 1793 and 1802. Originally, a small parish graveyard existed alongside the church, but it quickly filled to capacity. The Presbyterian Burying Ground was established by Georgetown Presbyterian Church on August 22, 1802, in an area now bounded by 4th, 5th, Market and Frederick Streets (now Volta Place NW and P, 33rd, and 34th Streets NW). Land for both the cemetery and a new Georgetown Presbyterian Church were donated by Dr. Charles Beatty, who provided a building lot of on the block. Beatty required that the property be used for either a church or a cemetery, and that the property should revert to Beatty's heirs if not used for either purpose. (Furthermore, the act of Congress of March 28, 1806, under which Georgetown Presbyterian Church was incorporated stipulated that the graveyard could not be used for any other purpose or disposed of.) Dr. Beatty also donated a building lot on the block to the Methodist Episcopal Church, but this land became an annex of cemetery when the Methodists declined to build there. Dr. Beatty soon donated six more lots to Georgetown Presbyterian for use as a cemetery, giving the grounds a little over . The burying ground (the term \\"cemetery\\" did not come into use until mid-century) was located in a middle- class neighborhood. On the south side of 4th Street in the southeast corner were the \\"20 Buildings\\"—two-story brick rowhouses constructed by Scottish workers who labored on the construction of the United States Capitol. Presbyterian Burying Ground was laid out simply, similar to most cemeteries of the day. The cemetery had two gravel paths, lined with fir trees, one which bisected the grounds east-west and another which extended from 4th Street north to the center of the block. The main entrance was in the east on Market Street. Black locust trees were planted about the grounds. A winding, somewhat circular path occupied the intersection of the two fir-lined gravel walkways. No other footpaths were laid out, however, and access to most graves, vaults, and mausoleums were via informal dirt ruts in the lawn. Vandals and children were kept out by a high wooden fence. A church was erected in 1855 on the east side of the property in the middle of the block. Sources differ as to its height (one or two stories) and its adornment (play or Gothic Revival). It contained high-back pews and a high pulpit, and served as Georgetown Presbyterian Church's primary place of worship. After the congregation erected a new church home in 1821, this small brick structure served as the cemetery chapel. According to the Washington Federalist newspaper, \\"lots at present will be sold low for cash in order to defray present expenses, but when these are discharged they will rise much higher in price.\\" Interments began almost immediately, due to the low prices the church offered, and the cemetery was instantly popular. Most of the graves were in the northern half of the cemetery, which sloped gently downward to Q Street. Families erected small headstones and, later, large funerary monuments. Some private brick mausoleums were constructed, and the church itself built a burial vault (for those who wanted above-ground burial but without the cost of erecting their own tomb) \\"near a corner\\" of the cemetery. (The exact location of this \\"public vault\\" is not known.) The largest mausoleums in the cemetery were erected by the Kincaids, a large and wealthy Georgetown family, and the Kurtzes, a banking and insurance family. The burying ground attracted most of Georgetown's aristocratic families, including the Campbells and Morfeats (families who founded the town) and the Eastburns. By some counts, there were more than 70 above-ground mausoleums. But the Presbyterian Burying Ground wasn't just for the wealthy. It became the primary cemetery for all Georgetown residents. Many middle-class families built vaults for their loved ones. These were single or double-wide graves, usually lined with brick, into which one or more bodies were interred. The vault had a marble or brick lid, usually raised up off the ground by three or four courses. Many vaults were high, and surrounded by brick walls high. At the cemetery's height, there were more than 100 vaults at Presbyterian Burying Ground. The Presbyterian Burying Ground was, in its prime, considered beautiful and a socially desirable place for interment. The cemetery \\"was one of the prettiest to be found anywhere\\", said The Washington Post. In the 1840s and 1850s, it was considered the equal of Oak Hill or Glenwood in terms of its beauty and social standing. \\"During its day the cemetery was [also] looked upon as the most select in the District.\\" The Reverend Thomas Bloomer Balch said that the cemetery was, from its inception into the 1860s, a symbol of \\"the pride and wealth and glory of aristocratic Georgetown\\". Operational history of the cemetery Burials began at the cemetery in 1806. In January 1812, lots in the northwest corner of the cemetery were set aside for the burial of African Americans. Although Presbyterian Burying Ground was beautiful, it did not retain its popularity for long. In 1807, the Congressional Cemetery was established on the east side of the city on the shores of the Anacostia River. Despite being one of the largest cemeteries in the District of Columbia, Presbyterian Burying Ground quickly came to be seen as too small and crowded to permit the construction of the large funerary monuments favored by Americans in the Victorian era. Large, open Congressional Cemetery, however, provided ample land for memorials. As Congressional Cemetery grew in popularity, the Presbyterian Burying Ground fell into disrepair. By 1847, thickets of weeds and shrubs had taken over the cemetery. The cemetery's large public vault, never adequately sealed, reeked of decay. A fire at the Balch's home destroyed many of cemetery's burial records in 1831. Another blow to the Presbyterian Burying Ground occurred in 1848, when Oak Hill Cemetery opened just five blocks to the northwest. This garden cemetery with beautiful landscaping, terraces, spacious grounds, and magnificent chapel—created and financed by the city's richest businessman, William Wilson Corcoran—deeply appealed to the residents of Georgetown and Washington. Over the next several years, Oak Hill became not only the cemetery of choice for new burials, but many families disinterred their loved ones at the Presbyterian Burying Ground and reburied them at Oak Hill. Oak Hill quickly expanded, and by 1867 had more than of space for burials. Bounded by city streets and existing homes, Presbyterian Burying Ground was limited in size. A large increase in burials at Presbyterian Burying Ground occurred during a cholera epidemic of 1834. Georgetown resident Charles H. Trunnel, who lived during the period, said that the dead were brought to the cemetery in cartloads. The dead arrived in such numbers so quickly that cemetery officials did not keep accurate records as to where corpses were buried. Many bodies were buried in the middle of the streets surrounding the cemetery, because church officials worried about filling the cemetery with cholera victims. Another upsurge in burials occurred during the American Civil War, as they did at all regional cemeteries, but otherwise the number of burials at the cemetery remained fairly constant and low. The cemetery was only gradually enclosed after 1811. Although the fence was repaired in 1840, by 1849 the fence had almost completely collapsed and the cemetery was in a significant state of disrepair. A fire at the sexton's home destroyed the cemetery's burial records in 1860. The cemetery remained in general disrepair during the 1850s. But in 1860, a letter appeared in a local Georgetown newspaper which attacked the state of the graveyard. Fences were down, the gates open, cattle grazed on the property, and many of the funerary monuments and headstones vandalized. Women at Georgetown Presbyterian Church were scandalized. They formed a committee, led by Miss Mary Thomas, and asked that the cemetery be given into their care. The church leaders agreed, and the Thomas committee quickly made major repairs to the fences and walkways. The grounds were cleared of weeds and sod planted where the earth was bare. Until Thomas' death in 1890, the cemetery remained in good repair. The neighborhood surrounding Presbyterian Burying Ground, however, deteriorated after the American Civil War. Once home to upper-middle-class families, by 1891 it was surrounded mostly by homes leased by poor African Americans, and crime, vandalism, public drunkenness, and violence were common in the area. Closure and 1891 attempt at demolition Sextons' records showed that between 1860 and 1887, more than 1,200 burial plots were sold at Presbyterian Burying Ground. Each plot could hold as many as three people. The cemetery, however, was in deteriorating condition. A number of bodies were buried in the public burial vault (described as on Market Street adjoining the chapel). But the odor of these decomposing bodies was so strong that the D.C. Board of Public Health declared the vault a nuisance and ordered it closed on April 10, 1874. On January 27, 1876, workmen digging the foundation of a house near the corner of 5th and Market (the northwest corner of the cemetery) discovered between eight and 10 skeletons. These were bodies buried during the 1834 cholera epidemic, and they were reburied further back on the lot. It is not clear when the last interment was made at Presbyterian Burying Ground. The Washington Post reported it was a six-year-old child, buried in 1886, but D.C. public health records show it may have been a one-year-old child named Charles Frederick Watkins, bured on July 11, 1887. Presbyterian Burying Ground closed to new burials in 1887, at which time it contained an estimated 2,700 bodies. The closure significantly impacted the cemetery's finances. For thirty years, the cemetery had used the income generated by the sale of lots to keep the graveyard in good repair. Excess income, however, was not placed in a trust but rather used for other charitable purposes. The cemetery's sexton died about 1887 as well, and the church—with little incentive to appoint a new one—allowed the ground to once more fall into disrepair. On August 1, 1891, trustees of the cemetery agreed to close it. The president of the board of trustees, S. Thomas Brown, said that Georgetown Presbyterian Church had no funds for the upkeep of the cemetery. The board agreed to revoke the burial permits of all those who had been buried in the cemetery. The buyers of burials plots thought they held fee simple title to their plots. But the trustees discovered that the cemetery had actually issued revocable permits. To revoke the permits, the trustees needed to publicize the cemetery's closure, and then ensure that unclaimed bodies were \\"decently interred\\". The trustees said it would advertise in regional newspapers to ask families to remove their loved ones' remains from the Presbyterian Burying Ground. The deadline for removal of bodies was November 1891, after which all remaining bodies would be disinterred and buried in a mass grave elsewhere. The District of Columbia's public health officer, Dr. O.M. Hammett, quickly issued authorizations to families to permit disinterments—with most of the reburials, he said, happening at Oak Hill Cemetery. A few other reburials occurred at The Methodist Cemetery in the Tenleytown neighborhood or at Congressional Cemetery. One hundred and fifty permits were issued by October 30, and another 50 by November 7. A local undertaker offered to disinter and rebury any unclaimed body found in the cemetery, if someone purchased a burial plot for the body some place else in the city. The first disinterment was the six-year-old child buried in 1886. J.E. Libbey applied to remove about a dozen bodies from his family's crypt, and Mrs. Jean Gibson asked to remove 10 of her relatives. There was concern, however, because of the cemetery's age. The trustees believed that the majority of those interred at Presbyterian Burying Ground had no living relatives. Some graves were rediscovered during the disinterments. On October 21, 1891, workers found the grave of Mary Stevens Livingston, wife of Robert R. Livingston (Founding Father, the former U.S. Minister to France, and the former Chancellor of New York [the highest judicial officer in that state]). Other discoveries were about who was not buried at the cemetery. Originally, it was believed that eight to 10 soldiers of the Union Army had been buried at the graveyard during the American Civil War. An anonymous donor pledged to pay for their disinterment, and offered 16 burial plots at Graceland Cemetery. But officials with the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union Army veterans organization, said they examined war-time records and found no evidence that any Union soldiers had been buried there. (The Washington Post claimed in 1896 that the organization exhumed the bodies of all Civil War soldiers buried there.) Winter weather delayed most of the disinterments, and by spring 1892 at least 200 graves remained to be opened, with about 660 bodies to be removed. In May, undertaker Joseph F. Birch removed 34 pre-Civil War soldiers from the cemetery. Approximately another 120 disinterments occurred by the end of June, and cemetery officials that all removals would be completed in time to meet the fall deadline. A few disinterments occurred in September. By October, however, these had almost all stopped. By the end of the year, no more disinterment orders from living relatives remained to be fulfilled. The abandoned Presbyterian Burying Ground became something of a tourist destination, with curiosity-seekers coming by every day to see the open graves and scattered tombstones. A portion of the cemetery remained in use, however. The chapel continued to be used by Georgetown Presbyterian Church as a classroom and choir facility for African American children attending the church's segregated \\"Mission Church\\". Post-1891 deterioration A child plays on a tombstone in the Presbyterian Burying Ground in 1903. Presbyterian Burying Ground deteriorated significantly after the 1891 disinterments. By mid-1893, it had become densely overgrown with grass, weeds, bushes, and sapling trees. Sporadic disinterments continued, but nearly all the former graves were left open rather than filled in, leaving sunken pits all over the area. Some graves had been opened by mistaken and not recovered, while other human remains were scattered over the ground. The entire place reeked of decomposition. On July 8, 1893, the District of Columbia Health Department ordered that no more removals occur for at least three months. It demanded that the cemetery's trustees remove all bodies from open graves and have them interred elsewhere, and that the entire cemetery grounds be disinfected. Twelve months later, the cemetery's wooden outer fence had almost completely fallen to the ground, the weeds and brush were so thick the grounds could not be traversed, and the grounds still reeked of decomposition. Local citizens attempted to contact the trustees to demand that they do something, but they could not be reached. When the cemetery reopened, disinterments continued to occur sporadically. The Campbells and Morfeats were removed from their respective family vaults in May 1894. Yet, the Washington Evening Star reported that only 200 bodies had been removed from the site, and nearly 2,000 corpses still remained. Three bodies belonging to the Tenney family (a famous Georgetown banking and construction supply family) were removed in January 1895. The tomb of Benjamin Homans was dismantled in August 1895, and his body reinterred elsewhere. Georgetown Presbyterian Church abandoned upkeep of the cemetery in 1895. The lack of a fence and the despoiled look of the cemetery led to widespread desecrations of the remaining tombs and graves. Poverty- stricken local citizens ripped down mausoleums for their bricks. On November 2, 1895, the large Kincaid family vault was torn apart in the space of just a few hours. Only three smaller mausoleums remained. In August 1895, human remains were found at the site. Workmen were digging a trench to lay water pipes, and uncovered bones belonging to a large number of human bodies. The remains were reburied deep below the ground in the middle of an adjacent street. The incident angered local residents, who demanded that Congress appropriate funds to buy the cemetery and clear the land. But the heirs of Dr. Charles Beatty (the donor of the cemetery land) claimed that the land much revert to them if not actively used as a church or cemetery. They threatened to sue if the cemetery were sold. In February 1896, Georgetown Presbyterian Church established a \\"committee on church property\\" to dispose of the cemetery. The church agreed to advertise Presbyterian Burying Ground's closure once more, and to demand that all remains be claimed by September 1, 1896. The church agreed that all bodies which went unclaimed would be reinterred at another cemetery at church expense. The church said the property would be subdivided into housing lots and sold. The deterioration of Presbyterian Burying Ground continued into 1896. Local people began using the cemetery as a garbage dump, throwing old wire, pieces of metal, tin cans, carcasses, and household ashes onto the grounds. There were open graves everywhere, and in some cases coffins protruded from the ground. In May 1896, a strong storm blew the roof off the cemetery chapel. Georgetown Presbyterian Church had appointed Andrew Goldsmith sexton of the cemetery, but he was unable to deal with the cemetery's many problems. On September 5, 1896, the Presbyterian Burying Ground trustees announced that, the removal deadline having passed, all remaining bodies at the cemetery would be disinterred and moved to Beechment Cemetery in Montgomery County, Maryland. But no disinterments occurred. The cemetery further deteriorated in 1897. By April, the high wooden fence on R Street had been torn down by residents of the area, while the fence on 34th Street had fallen in places. In the past year, looters had town down the brick walls surrounding all the vaults, and removed the brick courses supporting vault lids. (Bricks from cemetery mausoleums and vaults, The Washington Post reported, were used as building materials in nearly all the nearby homes.) Almost all the marble vault lids were shattered, and vandals had toppled or broken funerary monuments, tossed pieces into open graves, and thrown headstones around. Of the cemetery's large mausoleums, only the Eastburn structure remained standing. Since almost none of the graves opened for disinterments had been filled in, large holes existed all over the cemetery. Local residents filled them with trash, animal caracasses, and ashes. Children using the cemetery as a playground had trampled grave mounds so that it was no longer possible to distinguish graves from lawn. By the fall of 1898, conditions at Presbyterian Burying Ground had no improved. Georgetown Presbyterian Church no longer had a sexton appointed to oversee the grounds, and a rank odor was coming out of many of the open graves. In September 1898, at the behest of Georgetown residents, the City Commissioners of the District of Columbia introduced legislation to make it a crime to allow property to become a public nuisance. Whether the legislation passed or not is unclear, but little was done to rectify the problems at the cemetery. On December 9, 1898, a road crew working on a street adjacent to Presbyterian Burying Ground unearthed four skeletons. The Washington Post reported that these were likely victims of the 1834 cholera epidemic. Since the street had been regraded, many of these bodies were now very close to the surface. 1909 demolition Map of the Presbyterian Burying Ground in 1903. Beginning in 1899, a second attempt was made to demolish Presbyterian Burying Ground and turn the land into usable space. This process took a decade, but was eventually successful. The second demolition effort began in March 1899, when parishioners at Georgetown Presbyterian Church indicated they would be willing to turn title to the land over to someone else provided the church received funds in return. By May, the Georgetown Citizens Association (GCA) was working on a plan to achieve the graveyard's closure. Members of the GCA attempted to meet with the cemetery trustees to work out a deal, but the negotiations were quickly terminated. The Washington Evening Star reported that church members were suddenly \\"sentimental\\" about the cemetery and did not wish to part with it, although later it was learned that a local realtor had attempted to purchase the land instead and that this sudden interest made parishioners reluctant to sell. Unable to purchase the cemetery outright, the GCA began working on a plan to have Congress pass legislation condemning the land and turning it over to the District of Columbia for some public use. On May 7, 1899, a GCA subcommittee formed to handle cemetery issues issued a report requesting that Presbyterian Burying Ground be turned into a public playground, and that the City Commissioners be prevailed upon to push this legislation in Congress. But despite the GCA's efforts, no action was taken on this legislative initiative. Georgetown Presybeterian Church sold the chapel to the West Washington Methodist Episcopal Church South (an all-black congregation) in 1901. The cemetery's condition in 1901 was very poor. More than 100 vaults had been broken open, all the mausoleums had been looted of their brick and torn down, and headstones scattered widely. Only about 500 to 700 of the 2,700 people buried there had been removed, and half of all burials could not be located because the markers were gone. Some relatives secured a disinterment permit, only to discover that the grave of their loved ones could not be identified. Those who remained belonged to both wealthy and poor families. A great number of remains had been unearthed, and bone fragments lay on the surface of the cemetery. Although The Washington Post reported in May 1901 that a settlement with the Beatty heirs was expected soon, no settlement was forthcoming. In April 1903, the GCA formed a committee to again investigate the possibility of obtaining a condemnation law from Congress. These efforts were spearheaded by the Reverend Zed H. Copp, a nationally known Presbyterian author and evangelist. Copp determined that Georgetown Presbyterian Church members were willing to part with the cemetery provided that the bodies were reinterred elsewhere, and that church members preferred to have the land condemned rather than sold. To win the support of the City Commissioners for the legislative effort, the GCA submitted a 2,000-signature petition asking the city to condemn the land and have it turned into a public park.; To bolster their case, several citizens of Georgetown formally complained to the Metropolitan Police Department, asserting that the cemetery was not only unsightly but that it had become a garbage dump and that the numerous bodies there were creating health problems. A city investigation concluded that unburied bodies were not problem, but agreed that local residents were using the cemetery for trash disposal. The investigation also noted that most of the vaults were in a state of collapse; numerous memorials and headstones had been broken, vandalized, or fallen over; and that the cemetery was heavily overgrown. The city commissioners agreed to contact Georgetown Presbyterian Church to urge them to maintain the property, but little else could be done. Although the City Commissioners gave the GCA a hearing in April, the following months the commissioners expressed concern that if the cemetery were removed, title to the land would revert to the Beatty heirs. The heirs, however, were demanding a large sum of money for the land, and the GCA urged the city to pursue condemnation. Although negotiations continued between 1903 and 1907, the Beattys continued to object to any sale of the land. Three generations of Beattys were still buried at Presbyterian Burying Ground, and the family wanted the land back. In 1906, Congress appropriated $75,000 for playgrounds in the District of Columbia. After making the expenditures required by Congress, $30,000 remained which the City Commissioners agreed to spend in acquiring Presbyterian Burying Ground for a municipal playground. In May 1907, Allen W. Mallery, agent for the church, agreed to sell the cemetery to the city, but the Beatty family objected and the sale cancelled. For reasons which are not clear, the sale was consummated on June 20, 1907, for $27,969.25. The city, however, required the church to provide clear title and title insurance, and to clear the property of all bodies. The city was forced to spend $14,000 of the $30,000, however, leaving just $16,000 to pay the church. The 15 Beatty heirs continued to object to the sale, however, and the City Commissioners asked the city's legal counsel to investigate the Beattys' claim. The city's legal counsel determined in October 1907 that the Beattys had a proper claim on the Presbyterian Burying Ground. So the city began condemnation proceedings, and that same month Georgetown Presbyterian Church began removing trees and tombstones from the property. (The underbrush by now was high.) The Beattys opposed the condemnation proceedings. Their attorney, William H. Monogue, claimed in November that the church had conducted no search for graves, had destroyed monuments and memorials, and had scattered human remains. He also claimed bones had been carted off-site to hide evidence of their desecration. Monogue further alleged that in grading the cemetery, the church had destroyed grave-mounds and obliterated any evidence of burials. The City Commissioners held a meeting to discuss Monogue's accusations, but determined that most of them were inaccurate. Undertaker Isaac Birch, however, estimated that at least undertaker Burch said at least 300 bodies still remained on the cemetery's northern half. Mallery denied that any remains had been scattered during grading, but did admit that some graves had been uncovered. One grave was found and opened, but no bones remained in the coffin. A vault was discovered, and when opened two skulls were found. The relatives were contacted, and a permit secured from the city to disinter the skulls and release them to the family. The vault of Valentine Reintzell, former Master Mason of Potomac Lodge No. 5 and head of Grand Lodge of District of Columbia, was rediscovered by workmen and his remains disinterred. The grave of Joseph Carleton, an officer in the American Revolutionary War, was also rediscovered and his remains removed. Charles Beatty and 11 other Beatty family heirs sued Georgetown Presbyterian Church on November 24, 1907, to prevent the sale of the cemetery. The suit was heard by Ashley M. Gould, sitting as Associate Justice in Equity Court No. 2 of the Supreme Court of the District of Columba on January 20, 1908.; ; ; The outcome of Charles A. Beatty et al. vs. Trustees of the Presbyterian Congregation of Georgetown is not known. It is unclear whether the Beatty heirs won their suit, whether the city won its condemnation effort, or whether the heirs lost their suit and the church sold the property. However, on September 29, 1908, the City Commissioners recommended the purchase of the Presbyterian Burying Ground for $32,000. Some time in late June or early July 1909, the sale finally was consummated for $30,000. The city paid $20,000, while private donations came up with the remaining $10,000. During preparation of the area for conversion to a playground, 30 more bodies were uncovered. These were sent to an undertaker for cremation and burial. But more than 2,000 corpses remained buried at the site. Noted D.C. historian John Proctor Clagett claimed in 1942 that most of the bodies near 34th Street NW had probably all been removed, but the central, southern, and southeastern portions remained untouched. The total cost of the Georgetown Municipal Playground (now named Volta Park) was cost playground $35,000, of which $30,000 was needed for the land and $5,000 for equipment. The new playground opened on October 30, 1909, and proved immediately popular. Post-conversion issues With so many bodies still lying in the earth at Volta Park, it is not uncommon for additional remains or for funerary monuments to be uncovered. About 1920, the Eden family living at 3311 Q Street NW uncovered nine bodies buried in the dirt floor of their basement. The family reburied them in the local street (at the time, a dirt road). Workmen digging a ditch for new fresh water lines uncovered human remains at the playground in September 1942. The bones were placed into boxes and interred at Blue Plains, a pauper's burial ground maintained by the city. About 1944, workmen digging a trench to lay sewer pipes across the southern part of the park exposed a brick burial vault. A large number of bones were removed from the vault, and taken away. Local residents often found tombstones or pieces of funerary monuments in the park. Carl Ernst, whose home was located at 1522 33rd Street NW, found numerous headstones in the 1930s and 1940s, some dating as far back as 1790. The Washington Post reported in 1949 that he embedded them in a cement wall on his property. In the early 1950s, workmen at the park unearthed the skeleton of a girl with long red hair and still wearing her funeral dress. In 1957, diggers constructing a basement near the corner of 33rd and Q Streets NW unearthed six headstones. Not realizing their importance, they broke them up and disposed of them. Nonetheless, at the same time, some local boys found an intact small brown tombstone in the park close to where the men were digging. The tombstone, inscribed \\"E. S. 1825\\", was donated to the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. In March 1958, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) placed a commemorative marker in Volta Park to recognize those American Revolutionary War soldiers whose remains had never been disinterred from Presbyterian Burying Ground. While at least 13 Revolutionary War soldiers had been buried in the cemetery, historian Selden M. Ely said that six had never been disinterred. That same year, workers constructing an addition to 3317 Q Street NW found a skull while excavating the foundations. The family buried the remains in their back yard. Remains continued to be found nearly a century after the cemetery was demolished. In 2005, workers rebuilding the foundation of a home at 3319 Q Street NW found a jawbone with most of the teeth intact, a few joints, and some ribs buried behind boards in the foundation wall. The remains turned over to city authorities. In September 2012, workers regrading a driveway between 3333 and 3329 Q Street NW uncovered a wooden coffin and intact skeleton. Forensic scientists from the Smithsonian Institution said the bones were likely those of a 35-year-old adult male. Archeologists from the D.C. Historic Preservation Office determined that the bones belonged to those of a 25-to-35-year-old African-American man. Additional archeological digging in the property's back yard uncovered several more \\"cemetery shafts\\". The archeologists discovered pine boxes containing the remains of four African- Americans.

Early life and education Paradise has said that he learned to program at age 7 by hacking a video game with a hex editor and later wrote his first game in Pascal. Career After spending a few years working for venture capital and private equity firms, Paradise left in 2008 to found his first business, Double Picture, a web 2.0 digital media and advertising company. While at Double Picture, Paradise created patent-pending advertising technologies, forged business development partnerships with companies such as Apple, and led the eventual sale of Double Picture to a publicly traded company, MPA, Inc. In 2010, Paradise then founded AisleBuyer, a virtual shopping assistant which enabled retail customers to bypass checkout lines by allowing them to pay for purchases directly through their mobile devices. The software allowed shoppers to scan bar codes on products, which subsequently enabled them to read product details and customer reviews directly from their smartphones. Shoppers could then purchase the products on the spot, choosing between an in-store purchase or home delivery. Paradise sold the company to Intuit for a reported price of $80 to $100 million in April 2012. The technology eventually became Intuit GoPayment. In 2012, Paradise, along with fellow AisleBuyer veteran Casey Chafkin, founded Skillz in stealth mode under the name Lookout Gaming. Skillz provides an SDK for mobile game developers that allows users to compete against each other. As of October 2018, Skillz reported hosting 2 million tournaments every day.

He was briefly followed by his son Thomas Ivory. Biography James Ivory was a very prominent watchmaker and clockmaker in Dundee, Scotland during the mid-to-late 18th century. Born in Liberton, near Edinburgh in 1729, he worked as an apprentice in London, England (years unknown). There he married Jane Brown on 27 January 1761 at St. Clement Danes Church in London.Person Page - 49543, ThePeerage.com. In late 1762 he returned to Scotland to work in Dundee, where he lived until his death in 1793. On 17 February 1765 his first son Sir James Ivory was born in Dundee. His wife Jane however died shortly after child birth. He went on to marry Margaret Cook on 16 September 1768. James Ivory had 3 sons and 2 daughters through his two marriages including his stepchildren. James's second son Thomas who was born on 5 April 1770, followed after his father and became a watchmaker in 1795 in his own right after apprenticing under his father. He later gave up the trade in 1800 to work in publishing until his death in 1825. Thomas in turn named his son James who later become known as Lord Ivory. James Ivory rose to considerable eminence as a renowned clockmaker in Dundee and throughout the United Kingdom.Old Scottish clockmakers from 1453 to 1850; by John Smith, page 205 He was entrusted with the making of the clock for the steeple of St. Andrew's Parish Church in the Cowgate area of Dundee in 1774 which is still in use today. He also served as a Dundee Town Councillor from 1768 until 1789. It was while acting in this capacity that his eldest son, mathematician Sir James Ivory, was appointed one of the teachers at the Dundee Academy. After completing his apprenticeship in London, he opened a workshop there prior to moving to Dundee after marriage. His extremely rare early pieces thus have \\"London\\" engraved onto them rather than \\"Dundee\\". During his time as an active clockmaker and watchmaker between the mid 1750s and 1793, he made pocket watches, hall clocks, wall clocks, etc., all of which were of the verge escapement fusee type of movement. Most if not all of his pocket watches would have had \\"beetle and poker\\"-style hands, white enamel faces, and baluster-style pillars. Many of his pieces have been sold at auction for tens of thousands of dollars and are regarded as \\"the best that money could buy in London at the time\\" by auction houses even today.\\"the best that money could buy in London at the time\\" Craig Barefoot Clocks 260x260px Output Based upon engraved serial numbers on his pocket watch movements from 1762 through 1768, he produced somewhere between only 12 to 15 a year during that time. Between 1770 and 1772 that number increased to an average of 53. By comparison, others were putting out hundreds, sometimes thousands, of movements per year from their workshops. This just goes to show that much of the work was in fact done by him personally rather than with the help of several apprentices like many other makers of the time. Being an engraver himself, he created most if not all of the work on his movements vs. sourcing parts from other suppliers as was common practice by others. By and large, most other makers whose signatures were engraved on their movements, may not even have touched it themselves at all as parts came from other sources and apprentices performed most of the remaining assembly. Ivory's only known apprentice was his son Thomas at only the last few years of his life. His works of craftsmanship are highly sought after by collectors, most especially his first works from the early 1760s. The extensively intricate engravings and ornamentation on his movements are very finely detailed and elegant in design. During the time of his career, most other watchmakers were reducing the amount of aesthetic detailing put into the decorations and engravings on their movements. Most of this was due in part to the introduction of dust covers being used on pocket watch movements in the late 18th century. This also coincided with the adoption of duplex escapements in the UK which had been patented in 1782 and were in wide use by 1790. Pocket watch movements which utilized dust covers and newer types of escapements simply lacked the same artistic adornment for which the movements of the prior 100 years had become so well known and sought after. The works of James Ivory carried on the grand style of this tradition up until the end of his life in 1793. 298x298px  References  * Book: Old Scottish clockmakers from 1453 to 1850; by John Smith, page 205 * Book: The Universal British directory of trade, commerce, and manufacture, Volume 4; by Peter Barfoot, John Wilkes * School of Mathematics and Statistics @ University of St Andrews, Scotland http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Ivory.html * Leisure and Culture Dundee: http://www.leisureandculturedundee.com/library/ivory * Notes and Records: The Royal Society journal of the history of science http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/56/2/187.full.pdf * Friends of Dundee City Archives: http://www.fdca.org.uk/pdf%20files/LockitI.pdf * Dundee City: http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/dundeecity/uploaded_publications/publication_1840.pdf Category:1729 births Category:1793 deaths Category:People from Dundee Category:Scottish clockmakers Category:18th-century Scottish people Category:Scottish watchmakers (people) Category:Scottish engravers Category:Businesspeople from Dundee Category:People from Edinburgh ","title":"James Ivory (watchmaker)"},{"id":"42844612","text":"The 2014 Warrington Borough Council election took place on 22 May 2014 to elect 19 of the 57 members of the Warrington Borough Council in England.

Life Victor Mapes was born in New York City on 10 March 1870. He belonged to an old New York Family. He attended Columbia University, where he proved an excellent athlete and graduated in 1891 at the head of his class. He became a journalist, and the next year spent time in Paris, France, where he studied drama at the Sorbonne. He lived in Paris from 1892 to 1896. In May 1895 his play La Comtesse de Lisne was staged at the Theatre Mondaine. He was Paris correspondent for The New York Sun. After returning to the USA Mapes became stage manager at the Lyceum Theatre in New York for Daniel Frohman in 1897. Later that year he resigned to become drama critic for the New York World. He wrote under the pseudonym of \\"Sidney Sharp\\". When his first American play, A Flower of Yeddo, was produced Mapes resigned from the World. A Flower of Yeddo was staged at the Empire Theater of New York in 1898. His play The Tory's Guest was produced at the same theater in 1900. While writing plays, Mapes became general stage director of Daly's Theater in New York, and in 1904 became manager at the Globe Theater in Boston. In 1906 he became director of the New Theater in Chicago, which opened in October that year. The theater was founded by a group of leading Chicago citizens with the aim of producing worthwhile plays for limited runs without elaborate scenery or costumes, and without promoting stars. The high-minded formula was not successful. Mapes resigned at the end of 1906. Mapes's best known works are The Boomerang (1915), and two plays written in collaboration, The New Henrietta (1913) and The Hottentot (1920). The Boomerang, produced by David Belasco and starring Arthur Byron and Martha Hedman, ran at the Belasco Theatre for 522 performances. It has been called a \\"sunny, youthful, spirited play\\", with excellent performances by the leader actors. Boomerang was written in collaboration with Winchell Smith, The farce Hottentot was written in collaboration with William Collier Sr. Victor Mapes died in Cannes, France on 27 September 1943 during World War II.

Appleton lived much of his life in Ipswich, Massachusetts and nearby Marblehead, Massachusetts prior to moving to Maine. =Massachusetts General Court= In 1813 and 1814, at the age of 28, Appleton, a practicing lawyer, was elected to represent Gloucester as a Federalist to the Massachusetts legislature where he was an outspoken critic of the Missouri Compromise. In 1824, he was the official escort of the Marquis de Lafayette upon his visit to Boston. In 1832, he presented a petition to the Massachusetts legislature prohibiting sales of liquor in fewer quantities than thirty gallons. =Maine politics= In 1833, he moved to Portland, Maine, and was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1836. The following year, he was chairman of a committee to consider the license system. In 1837, he submitted a report on the evils of liquor that became the basis of the Maine Temperance Law of 1846. The report was considered by Neal Dow to be the first official document in the history of Maine prohibiting the liquor traffic. In 1839 and 1840, he was vice president of the American Anti-Slavery Society. In the 1842, 1843, and 1844 gubernatorial elections, Appleton ran for Governor of Maine with the Liberty Party, an abolitionist political party. In 1848, he was a Free Soil presidential elector supporting Martin Van Buren. In 1861, during the Civil War, James gave patriotic speeches defending the Union and in support of abolition.

A Smart Cell may transmit multiple frequencies and technologies which are controlled by the software and not the hardware (antenna). Smart Cells are currently in the research and development stage but support software-defined networks which are proliferating the current mobile network structure, led by AT&T;'s adoption. According to John Donovan (AT&T;), \\"This is the way we will build our network.\\". Smart Cells are expected to lower capital and operational costs due to reduced equipment and manual manipulations needed to modify cell site coverage. The term Smart Cell is also used to identify other technologically enhanced cell sites where technology has reduced the need to manually manipulate radio access equipment or add additional carriers at a radio access node. Similar to Software-defined networking, Smart Cells may replace the existing static technologies with a dynamic, more efficient solution.

It has been continually inhabited for at least 2,000 years by the Cahuilla tribe of Native Americans.http://www.aguacaliente.org/content/History%20&%20Culture/ It is one of many canyons of cultural significance to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Legend of Tahquitz Tahquitz Canyon is an important location in the creation myths of the Agua Caliente band. Although the legend comes in many versions, most regard Tahquitz as a powerful nukatam, roughly \\"Shaman,\\" who was created directly by the creator of the world, Mukat. He became obsessed with a young woman whom he kidnapped and took to Tahquitz canyon, where they lived for several years. Due to her continued unhappiness, Tahquitz allowed her to leave on the condition that she not tell her people what had transpired. She disregarded this warning and was consequently struck dead by Tahquitz' power. The legend states that Tahquitz himself is immortal, that he still imparts power to worthy nukatam, and that he steals the souls of those who venture too far into his canyon at night. He is said to be the cause of the earthquakes in the area, and to reveal himself as a bright ball of green light or a meteor. Other versions of the legend report that Tahquitz was a normal man who gained his powers when he fled his people, as opposed to being directly created by Mukat. History of human occupation In the late Quaternary period, the Colorado river had at times discharged its waters into the Salton Basin, rather than the Gulf of California as it does today. This resulted in the formation of a large lake named Lake Cahuilla. The lake was a major food source for the indigenous people of the area, supporting large populations of fish and migratory birds. The Salton Sea currently occupies the lowest level of the former Lake Cahuilla. At some point, in the past few thousand years, the Colorado River stopped replenishing Lake Cahuilla, and the lake slowly dissipated. Easy access to fresh water, fish, and fowl went away with the lake. This forced the Cahuilla Indians in the area to relocate to new sources of water. Along with Andreas Canyon, Palm Canyon, and Murray Canyon, Tahquitz Canyon was one such location. Indians living in the canyon created various petroglyphs, most of which are lost today. Stone artifacts were discovered in the canyon including arrow shaft straighteners made from soapstones (steatites) and heated to steam and shape arrows. Fragments of broken ceramic ollas were also found in the canyon, used to store water, seeds and to bury the cremated remains of the dead. Irrigation ditches in the canyon were used by the Agua Caliente people to carry water to crops before the arrival of outsiders.  Flood control  Flood control channels were laid in order to manage the threat of devastating flooding occurring during years of heavy rain and snow fall in the mountains of the Tahquitz Canyon. As a consequence of the project, the Tahquitz creek was channeled with the least impact to the resources of the canyon. An excavation project preceded the flood control project.  Archaeological project  Between 1988 and 1994 an extensive program conducted excavations and retrieval of artifacts and archaeological data in the Canyon. The project produced the largest collection of artifacts and features of any site in the southern California desert and constitutes the most extensive research on the history of the inhabitants of Tahuqitz Canyon, the Kauisiktum clan of the Agua Caliente. The project was conducted prior to the Tahquitz Creek Flood Control Program. Reintroduced wildlife In 2010, researchers from the San Diego Zoo, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and California Department of Fish and Game reintroduced the endangered Mountain yellow-legged frog into Tahquitz Creek after it had been rediscovered in 2009.USGS Newsroom: Mountain yellow-legged frogs reintroduced to wild (April 16, 2010); USGS Newsroom: Biologist Rediscover Endangered Frog Population (July 24, 2009) Desert Plays From 1921 through 1930 the canyon was used for outdoor plays. The series of three Desert Plays featured Fire and The Arrow Maker by Mary Hunter Austin and one based on the legend of Tahquitz, written by Garnet Holme. In film The Tahquitz Falls were used as a scene in Frank Capra's 1937 film, Lost Horizon. Visitor's Center and hiking trail The Agua Caliente Band maintains a visitor's center and hiking trail for the canyon. The trail is a two-mile loop which leads to Tahquitz Falls and back.

The district of Santa Bárbara is commonly referred to as Santa Bárbara de Heredia, and is the seat of the municipality of Santa Bárbara, and therefore awarded the title of city. It is an important commercial and transportation hub, approximately seven miles from the provincial capital of Heredia and five miles from the provincial capital of Alajuela. History Before the Spanish settlers came, Santa Bárbara was originally occupied by the Huetares, an indigenous tribe. The Huetare King, Cacique Garabito, dominated the area. When the Spanish arrived, they originally called the area Churruca or Surruco. Heredia, Barva, and Alajuela, three neighboring cities, were populated and settled in the late 1700s. As trade increased between the three cities, Santa Bárbara developed as a waypoint. Though still commonly referred to as Churruca or Surruco, the name for the municipality and canton of Santa Bárbara was first mentioned in documents from 1821. The area of the current plaza in Santa Bárbara was the approximate center of the four districts in the region and a small hermitage was built there in 1837. By 1846, 1,500 people lived with the Santa Bárbara canton. With a priest visiting every Sunday, San Pedro de Santa Bárbara resident Pedro Saborío suggested the construction of a Catholic church near the current plaza in 1852. In 1859, Monseñor Joaquín Anselmo Llorente y Lafuente, the bishop of San José, began construction of a cathedral in its current location. The district of Santa Bárbara was officially formed in December 1848 as a church parish, recognized by the national government. In 1855, Florentino Cortés became the first mayor of the district. In September 1889, the city of Santa Bárbara was officially founded. It was first classified as a villa, but became a city as the population grew. Santa Bárbara's first public school opened in 1860 with cobbler Tomás Redondo giving the first lessons. The first official teacher was Diego Trejos. In 1896, the first electric lighting arrived in the district. A hydroelectric plant was built along the Porrosatí River, on the border of the districts of Santa Bárbara and San Juan in 1914. In 1911, running water pipes were installed in Santa Bárbara. Economy and politics As the center of commerce for the canton, there are many commercial businesses in the municipality. Larger businesses include a supermarket and appliance store. Several banks are within a few blocks of Santa Bárbara's central plaza, including Banco Popular, Grupo Mutual Alajuela, and Banco Nacional. The municipality of Santa Bárbara is considered a bedroom community. Most residents go to Alajuela, Heredia, Belén and San José for work. Among other goals, in 2010 the Santa Bárbara canton planned to shore up Santa Bárbara 's infrastructure. There are plans to improve the district's agricultural market, located two blocks north of the central plaza. There are also plans to create a \\"Casa de Arte y Cultura\\" (House of Art and Culture). In 2013, the city council called on Mayor Melvin Alfaro Salas to step down. Citing problems with water distribution, \\"unacceptable\\" labor practices, poor budgeting, and failure to attend council meetings, each member of the council asked for Alfaro Salas' resignation. Alfaro Salas did not resign. In 2014, municipal workers went on strike Albino Vargas, president of the Asociación Nacional de Empleados Públicos (National Association of Public Employees) joined the strike, saying that workers had been abandoned by Alfaro Salas, a charge he denied. Culture Santa Bárbara de Heredia Cemetery There is a chapter of the Consejo de la Persona Joven (Council of Young People) in Santa Bárbara. The Council of Young People organizes activities and groups, such as the United Canton Band. The municipality maintains two cemeteries. The cemetery on the western outskirts contain both tombs and burial plots. Many of the tombs have neo-classical monuments. A popular attraction near the town is Ark Herb Farm, a botanical garden with a focus on medicinal herbs. Education The elementary school in the municipality of Santa Bárbara is named after former head of state Juan Mora Fernández. It was built in 1951 on the west side of the plaza. The high school, Liceo de Santa Bárbara, was established in 1973 using the facilities at Juan Mora Fernández, but it later moved to a location 800 meters from the central plaza. The library in Santa Bárbara opened in 1981.Ministerio de Cultura y Juventud: MCJ, Retrieved: 22 May 2014 Due to budgetary reasons, it closed in 1995, but reopened in 2001 in the Salón Comunal.

Karl Ludwig Manzel (3 June 1858, Neu Kosenow – 20 June 1936, Berlin) was a German sculptor, painter and graphic artist.  Life  His father was a tailor and his mother was a midwife. The family moved twice, first to Boldekow then, in 1867, to Anklam where he attended the Gymnasium. It was there that he first expressed a desire to study art, but this was not supported by his parents. In 1875, at the age of seventeen, he arrived in Berlin, penniless, with the intention of enrolling at the Prussian Academy of Arts. Frederick I from the Siegesallee, now in the Spandau Citadel He supported his education by teaching drawing at a commercial art school and providing illustrations to the magazines Ulk (Joke, or Spoof) and Lustige Blätter (The Funny Papers). Among his teachers at the Academy were Albert Wolff and Fritz Schaper.Androom Archives: Brief biography Under the aegis of a sculptor's association called \\"Am Wege\\" (On the Way), he had his first successes and obtained a one-year scholarship to Paris, where he actually remained for three years, working in a major art studio. =Successes in Berlin= In 1889, he returned to Berlin, became a free-lance artist and developed a standing contract with the Imperial Family to produce busts and reliefs. His true breakthrough came in 1894, when he was commissioned to do figures for the Berlin Cathedral and the Reichstag. In 1895, he became a member of the Academy and, the following year, a Professor at the Museum of Applied Arts. In 1903, he succeeded Reinhold Begas as head of the Masters Studio, a position he held until 1925. Perhaps his best-known student was Josef Thorak, one of the \\"official sculptors\\" of the Third Reich. He served two terms as President of the Academy; from 1912 to 1915 and from 1918 to 1920. In 1914, he was one of the signatories to the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, a document supporting Germany's invasion of Belgium. \\"Manzelbrunnen\\" (Manzel's Fountain); a postcard from c.1899-1913 He was a friend of both Kaiser Wilhelm II and Georg Wertheim. When the Kaiser renovated an old manor for use as a summer residence in Cadinen, he contracted with Manzel to help modernize the earthenware factory there, as well as produce new Jugendstil designs for pitchers, vases and jars. When the project was completed in 1905, the Wertheim Department Store obtained exclusive rights to sell the new products. In his final years, he turned to painting, producing altarpieces for several churches in Charlottenburg. One of his last works was a bronze medallion of Joseph Goebbels. His grave is decorated with a female head he sculpted at an early stage of his career.  Selected major works  * 1894: Figures of the Apostles for the Berlin Cathedral. * 1898: A figure named \\"Sedina\\" (a symbolic embodiment of the city of Stettin), in a fountain which came to be known as the \\"Manzelbrunnen\\". It was dismantled and melted for the copper in 1942. The fountain was later reconstructed with an anchor as the centerpiece. In 2012, the Szczecin City Council approved the re-establishment of a Sedina figure there. * 1900: Group 15 in the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue), consisting of Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg as the central figure, flanked by side figures of the knight Johannes von Hohenlohe (1370-1412) and the Landeshauptmann Wend von Ileburg. * 1906: Statue representing \\"Labor\\", on the first floor landing of Wertheim's department store, Leipziger Platz. * 1912-1924: A monumental Christ-relief on the theme \\"Come unto me, all ye who labor...\\", with 24 figures.

He went on to play non-league football for Spennymoor United. Life and career Siddle was born in Darlington, County Durham, in 1906. He was the youngest child of Ann Siddle and her husband Reuben, an engine fitter with the North Eastern Railway, who died when Reg was 18 months old. Siddle played local football for Albert Hill before signing amateur forms with Darlington of the Football League Third Division North. He made his senior debut on 15 March 1930 at home to Barrow, coming in at inside right after Paddy Wrightson's departure for Manchester City. The Athletic News reported that he improved after an uncertain start, and he scored as Darlington won 4–0. He played in the remaining eight matches of the season and scored three more goals, including one in a 3–3 draw with South Shields F.C. and the second goal in a 2–1 win away to Crewe Alexandra. He began the 1930–31 season in the North-Eastern League team, had a run of four matches in the league side standing in for Francis Wallace at inside left, and another six matches late on in which he scored twice. Siddle began the following season in the league side: he scored in each of the first three matchesthe first was later expunged when opponents Wigan Borough foldedbut was dropped after five goalless appearances. He signed on again for 1932–33, but played much more for the reserves than the first team, to the extent that he was selected for a North- Eastern League team to face a Durham Amateur XI in April 1933 as part of the Durham FA's jubilee celebrations. He was released by Darlington and signed for North-Eastern League club Spennymoor United, where he played regularly at right half, sometimes covering at right back. He was a member of the Spennymoor team that began their 1936–37 FA Cup campaign in the preliminary round and progressed through four qualifying rounds and two rounds proper before losing heavily to First Division club West Bromwich Albion in the third round proper. The team also finished as North-Eastern League runners up, behind Sunderland Reserves. At the end of the season, when manager Charles Sutton moved on to North-Eastern League rivals Horden Colliery Welfare, Siddle was reported to be among a group of Spennymoor players who followed suit; he was also reported to be the only professional to remain with Spennymoor after their switch to the Football League. It is unclear with whom (or whether) his career continued. The 1939 Register finds Siddle working as a heating engineer and living with his wife, Edith née Green, whom he married in 1931, and a young child in Geneva Gardens, Darlington. He died in Northampton, Northamptonshire, in 1995 at the age of 88.

It contains a single species, Mercuriceratops gemini. Discovery In 2007, Triebold Paleontology Inc found frill elements in Fergus County, Montana. In 2014, the type species Mercuriceratops gemini was named and described by Michael Ryan, David Evans, Philip John Currie and Mark Loewen. The generic name combines the name of the Roman god Mercury, a reference to the similarity of the neck shield to the winged helmet of the messenger of the gods, with ~ceratops, \\"horn face\\", a usual suffix in ceratopian names. The specific name is that of the constellation Gemini, named after the twins Castor and Pollux, in reference to the similar specimens the species is based on. The species is represented only by two squamosal bones collected from approximately time-equivalent sections of the upper Judith River Formation and the lower Dinosaur Park Formation. The holotype, ROM 64222, was found by Triebold, in layer of the Judith River Formation dating from the middle Campanian, about seventy-seven million years old. It consists of a partial right squamosal, possibly of a subadult individual. It was acquired by the Royal Ontario Museum. The second specimen, UALVP 54559, was referred. It too is a partial right squamosal but slightly larger and probably of an older individual. It was found by Susan Owen-Kagen, a preparator at the University of Alberta, at a distance of 380 kilometres from the holotype, in Alberta in the Dinosaur Provincial Park, on the north bank of the Red Deer River, one kilometre east of Happy Jack's Cabin, in a layer of the lower Dinosaur Park Formation, two metres above the Oldman Formation. Associated with UALVP 54559, remains of a brow horn core were discovered but these were not referred because the connection with the squamosal was considered too uncertain. Description Restoration The describers estimated that Mercuriceratops was about the same size as Chasmosaurus. The holotype squamosal has a length of . Ryan et al. (2014) established a single autapomorphy, unique derived trait, of Mercuriceratops. The squamosal possesses a rear branch that is narrowed and rod-shaped instead of being blunt, triangular and tapering, the normal chasmosaurine form, or broadly rounded as with Triceratops. The narrowing is caused by an indentation of the outer rim of the squamosal. The squamosal carries at least six, and perhaps as many as eight, episquamosals, osteoderms on the frill rim. Based on the narrow form of the squamosal, it was deduced that the inner shield bones, the parietals, were very wide and pierced by enormous parietal fenestrae. Mercuriceratops was placed in the Chasmosaurinae. It is the oldest chasmosaurine known from Canada, and the first pre-Maastrichtian ceratopsid to have been collected on both sides of the Canada–US border. Though the profile of the Mercuriceratops squamosal suggests it was a transitional form between older rectangular squamosals of centrosaurine shape and later triangular squamosals, the describers rejected this hypothesis because juvenile centrosaurines do not show such a transitional phase during their ontogeny.

The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background Algal blooms can present problems for ecosystems and human society. An algal bloom is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of algae (typically microscopic) in an aquatic system. Algal blooms may occur in freshwater as well as marine environments. Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an excess of nutrients, particularly some phosphates. Harmful algal blooms are algal bloom events involving toxic or otherwise harmful phytoplankton such as dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium and Karenia or diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical damage to other organisms, or by other means. HABs are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events and have been associated with various types of shellfish poisonings. Such blooms often take on a red or brown hue and are known colloquially as red tides. It is unclear what causes HABs; their occurrence in some locations appears to be entirely natural, while in others they appear to be a result of human activities. The program created by the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act \\"has served as the federal government's research and response framework for harmful algal blooms.\\" A report by the NOAA indicated that \\"U.S. seafood and tourism industries suffer annual losses of $82 million due to economic impacts of HABs.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2014 would, in section 3, amend the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 to revise the membership requirements for the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to require the Task Force to have a representative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Section 4 would require the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, acting through the Task Force, to: (1) establish maintain, and periodically review a national harmful algal bloom and hypoxia program, and (2) develop and submit to Congress a comprehensive research plan and action strategy to address marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The bill would establish additional Task Force functions, including: (1) expediting the interagency review process; and (2) promoting the development of new technologies for predicting, monitoring, and mitigating harmful algal bloom and hypoxia conditions. The bill would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to have primary responsibility in administering the Program. The bill would establish the Under Secretary's duties, including administering merit-based, competitive grant funding to: (1) maintain and enhance baseline monitoring programs established by the Program, (2) support the Program's projects, and (3) address the research and management needs and the Action Strategy's priorities. The bill would require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) research the ecology and impacts of freshwater harmful algal blooms; (2) forecast and monitor event response to freshwater harmful algal blooms in lakes, rivers, estuaries, and reservoirs; and (3) ensure that activities carried under this Act focus on new approaches to addressing freshwater harmful algal blooms and are not duplicative of existing research and development programs authorized by this Act or any other law. The bill would require the collection of monitoring and observation data under this Act to comply with all data standards and protocols developed pursuant to the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2009. Section 7 would require the Administrator, through the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force, to report to appropriate congressional committees and the President on the progress made by activities directed by the Task Force and carried out or funded by EPA and other state and federal partners toward attainment of the goals of the Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan 2008 within 12 months after this Act's enactment and biennially thereafter. Section 8 would require the Task Force to: (1) submit within 18 months to Congress and the President an integrated assessment that examines the causes, consequences, and approaches to reduce hypoxia and harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes; and (2) develop and submit to Congress a plan, based on such assessment, for reducing, mitigating, and controlling such hypoxia and blooms. Section 11 would authorize the departments and agencies represented on the Task Force to participate in interagency financing and share, transfer, receive, obligate, and expend funds appropriated to any member of the Task Force for the purposes of carrying out the Act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on May 21, 2014. This is a public domain source. S. 1254 would reauthorize and modify the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998. The act would authorize the appropriation of $20.5 million annually through 2018 period for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to mitigate the harmful effects of algal blooms and hypoxia (reduced oxygen level) in certain bodies of water. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $78 million over the 2015-2019 period and $4 million after 2019. Enacting S. 1254 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. S. 1254 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on June 27, 2013 by Sen. Bill Nelson (D, FL). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The Senate passed the bill on February 12, 2014 by unanimous consent. It was received in the United States House of Representatives on February 18, 2014 and referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Science Subcommittee on Environment, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. It was reported (amended) by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology on June 5, 2014 alongside Report 113-471 part 1. The House passed the bill on June 9, 2014 in a voice vote. The United States Senate voted with unanimous consent to agree to the House amendments to the bill on June 17, 2014. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on June 30, 2014. Debate and discussion Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), who co- sponsored the bill, supported it by saying that \\"this legislation takes critical steps toward protecting Lake Erie and grand Lake St. Marys from harmful algae that has become a tremendous problem for our state... we cannot afford to let this threat to our tourism, fishing industries, and health go unchecked.\\" Portman described the changes this legislation would make to the existing law, saying that \\"it's changed to provide more funding than has been provided in previous appropriations, but also to prioritize freshwater, and specifically talks about the Great Lakes, which it did not previously.\\" Lake Erie, which Portman's state of Ohio borders, experienced a harmful algal bloom in 2011 and continues to have smaller ones. The environmental organization Ocean Champions supported legislation that would address the problem of harmful algal blooms.

It was found in the Serapeum of Saqqara by Auguste Mariette and later moved to The Louvre, where it is still. The stela was intended to commemorate the death of an Apis bull occurred in this year and its author, the Priest of Ptah and Prophet of Neith, Pasenhor (B), was the performer of the funerary rites. Despite the commemorative nature of the stela, Pasenhor took the opportunity to inscribe his own genealogy on it. The first part of the stela reflects its original purpose:Breasted, op. cit., § 791. > This god (i.e. the Apis) was introduced to his father Ptah (i.e. was > \\"enthroned\\"), in the Year 12, fourth month of the second season, fourth day, > of King Aakheperre Shoshenq (V), given life. He was born in the year 11 of > his majesty; he rested in his place in Tazoser (i.e. was buried in the > cemetery) in the year 37, third month of the first season, day 27, of his > majesty. May he grant life, prosperity, health, and joy of heart to his > beloved son, the prophet of Neith, Pasenhor. After that, Pasenhor begins to trace back along his genealogy for sixteen generations, until about the end of the 20th Dynasty:Kitchen, op. cit., table 19.

Thanks to the stela, we know more about the dynasty's origin and chronology, as well as the name of some otherwise unattested royal wives such as Karomama A, Tashedkhonsu and Kapes.

Life  Erica Conrat came from a prominent Jewish family in Vienna, which had converted to Protestantism. She was the youngest of three sisters, and the oldest, Ilse Conrat was a sculptor. The father Hugo Conrat (also known as Hugo Cohn) was an avid music lover and friends of Johannes Brahms. Erica was highly musical, played the piano and was among others friends with Alexander von Zemlinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, through which they met Karl Kraus. They also shared a long-standing friendship with Alma Mahler. Erica Conrat studied art history at the University of Vienna from 1902 until 1905 under Franz Wickhoff and Alois Riegl and in 1905 received her doctorate with dissertation contributions to the history of Georg Raphael Donner. She was the first woman who completed the study of art history at the University of Vienna with a doctorate. In the same year Erica married fellow student Hans Tietze, he was also studying art history during the same time. This was the first \\"Vienna School\\" art history program. Europe lacked significant teaching positions for women at the time, so frequently Erica would assist her husband in research and eventually they became a research team. Between 1908 and 1910 the Tietzes had four children. Erica and Hans Tietze were friends with many contemporary artists including Oskar Kokoschka who was commissioned to paint them in 1909, the portrait is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The sculptor Georg Ehrlich created two bronze busts of Hans and Erica Tietze which are now in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, as well as numerous portrait drawings of Erica Tietze. In 1938 the couple emigrated to the U.S. for political reasons during World War II, Erica Tietze worked as a researcher, academic lecturer at Columbia University and published art historical publications on Renaissance artists as well as contemporary Vienna artists until her death. In 1970, a room at the Austrian Museum of Baroque Art was named in Erica Tietze-Conrat’s honor for her contributions to the study of Austrian artists. In the fall of 2004 the International Hans Tietze and Erica Tietze-Conrat society founded in Vienna, which has taken the care of the complete works of art historian-married couple to the task.

He was regarded as being on the radical wing of the party and was popular with working-class electors. Defeated by Sir John Llewelyn in 1895 he was rejected as a candidate for the constituency in 1900 due to his opposition to the South African War. Early life Burnie was born in 1842 at Dawlish in South Devon where his father, John Dickson Burnie, was a builder and contractor. The family came originally from Dumfriesshire. As a young man, Burnie worked in the railway trade and came to Swansea in 1870 when Shacklefgord, Ford & Co., the works at Cheltenham, where he was general manager, were re-located. He became general manager of the firm in 1876. Public life Burnie was elected to the Sweansea Town Council in 1877 and became active in the municipal life of the town, serving as Mayor and Chairman of the Harbour Trust. In 1889, however, the year Swansea became a County Borough, he chose to stand down. Political career By the 1890s, Burnie was building a political reputation beyond his adopted town. In 1890 he was nominated to be Liberal candidate for the vacancy in East Carmarthenshire following the death of David Pugh but he withdrew before the selection conference. He became treasurer of the Welsh Farmer's Defence Fund, which was formed in light of tithe agitation, and in early 1892 he made a tour through the counties of South Wales where protests had taken place. He came close to winning the Liberal nomination at Chelsea and also at Mid Glamorgan where he was narrowly defeated in 1890 by Samuel Thomas Evans largely. it was stated, due to Evans being a Welsh-speaking Welshman. =Member of Parliament for Swansea= The death of the siting member of Swansea Town, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, shortly before the 1892 General Election led to Burnie being selected as candidate. Burnie launched his campaign at a public meeting at the Albert Hall, Swansea, where Sir Hussey Vivian presided and endorsed Burnie's campaign in a speech resonating with references to his own father's time as MP for Swansea. Vivian's intervention may have been calculated to counter the impact of the Conservatives' decision to adopt Sir John Llewelyn, a very popular figure locally and nephew of the late member, Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn. Having been defeated in 1895, Burnie was again adopted as candidate in 1900. However, he withdrew over his opposition to the South African War.

It was the site of a Roman fort, which was originally built in timber and rebuilt in stone.The name is known from the Ravenna Cosmography. See There was also a civilian settlement (vicus). A major Roman road linked Derventio to Old Carlisle near Wigton and Carlisle itself (Luguvalium) to the northeast, whilst a separate road led northwest to the coastal fort of Alauna just north of Maryport. In the 12th century the Normans removed Roman stonework from the site and used it to build Cockermouth Castle. Conservation and excavation The fort was known to antiquarians from William Camden onwards; \\\\- reviews all antiquarian descriptions and Collingwood's investigation of 1912 the first modern excavation was by R. G. Collingwood in 1912. A further dig in 1961-1962 led to the immediate designation of the site of the forts and part of the vicus as an ancient monument. These excavations suggested Papcastle was occupied from the late first century to ca. 120AD, and then from ca. 160AD to the late fourth century. The first fort had timber barracks and was smaller than the second fort which extended slightly west and south of it (and had stone barracks). The barracks were rebuilt around the end of the 3rd century; a commander's house dated to the fourth century was also uncovered in the 1961-2 excavations. =Recent excavations= An excavation of sites in the vicus, between the fort and the river Derwent, was featured in an episode of the television programme Time Team (Series 6, episode 2) broadcast in 1999. During floods in 2009, floodwater cut across various loops of the Derwent; south of the Derwent, opposite Papcastle, this led to the erosion of up to a metre of topsoil, and the exposure of pottery and other Roman material. Roman activity at Papcastle had not previously been thought to extend south of the Derwent. Further archaeological digs were undertaken in 2010 - 2015 which indicate that the Roman settlement was far greater than previously thought. Excavations south of the river in 2010 discovered a large Roman water mill with monumental masonry (one of the most complete yet excavated in Britain) and its associated mill race. Further digs were then carried out north of the river, a substantial mansio and bathhouse being revealed during the 2012 campaign. The indications were that Derventio had been at its peak (and possibly of similar importance to Carlisle or Corbridge) in the late 1st and early 2nd century AD. has draft reports for pre-2014 excavations - an overall report on the project in the Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society was envisaged, but (as of December 2017) has yet to appear However, further excavation south of the river in 2014 found the foundations of a bridge abutment, and of a bridge pier (the Derwent in Roman times had evidently flowed slightly to the south of its present course). The surviving foundations contained significant amounts of worked stone (funerary monuments and statue fragments), which would suggest the bridge to post-date much of the other construction activity.

The Institute of Aerodynamics had five wind tunnels, while the Institute of Gas Dynamics had its own high-speed tunnel; both were at the southern end of the campus.Christopher, p.40. The static testing station of the Institute of Strength Properties was to the west;Christopher, pp.40-1. the Institute of Engine Research, the east.Christopher, p.41. Weapons research was done by the Institute of Kinematics in a -long tunnel in the northwest corner.Christopher, p.41. These were accompanied by administration buildings, a canteen, a telephone exchange, guard houses, generators, and other facilities. To help reduce the risk of detection, there were no railway lines in, nor overhead power lines, nor any chimneys; and uniquely for an aviation research facility of its time in Germany, no runways, taxiways or hardstands for active aviation operations; just about all of the facilitiy's infrastructure needs were supplied underground from Braunschweig, including steam heat.Christopher, p.41. In addition, there were four hundred houses in Völkenrode for the 1,500 or so workers and scientists.Christopher, p.41. Each of the wind tunnels at LFA was given an \\"A\\" number. A1 had a circular nozzle in diameter, producing a maximum speed of ; it entered service in 1937, the year after construction began on facilities.Christopher, p.42. A2 measured long and had a test section in diameter (coated with Keratylene to keep the flow smooth),Christopher, p.43. capable of generating test speeds (depending on the model's scale) of between Mach 1 and 1.2.Christopher, p.43. It was driven by a pair of DC motors, and fitted with interferometer and striation gear for study of flow patterns. Begun in 1937, it first ran in 1939.Christopher, p.43. It did, however, suffer with problems of vibration,Christopher, p.43. leading the research teams to rely on a Rheinmetall-Börsig F25 free-flight research rocket with models mounted in the nose.Christopher, p.44. The A3 tunnel, largest at the LFA site, had an test section with a maximum speed of and a working length of , enough to accommodate a Messerschmitt Bf 109's fuselage.Christopher, p.44. It was powered by a pair of .Christopher, p.44. The A9 building housed a pair of supersonic wind tunnels, each driven by a motor, with a maximum speed of Mach 1.5, but a test section diameter of only .Christopher, p.47. Along with direct aerodynamic research, LFA did testing on materials (though not, apparently, of parts) and on aircraft engines.Christopher, pp.52-3. The engine work included testing of turbine and turbine blade shapes, ceramic turbine blades, cooling of turbine blades (including liquid cooling), bearings, detonation, and several types of heat exchangers, among other things.Christopher, p.53. The test centre assisted the BMW firm in developing the factory-produced forward cowling — which had the engine's oil cooler integrated into it from the beginning — for the Bavarian firm's BMW 801 fourteen-cylinder radial engine used in many German Luftwaffe military aircraft, most importantly the Fw 190A;Christopher, pp.47-8. trials indicated it was possible to reduce drag enough to save ,Christopher, p.80. as well as to maximize pressure build-up to assist cooling.Christopher, p.81. It also helped in development of the pioneering Argus As 014 pulsejet used in the V-1. In collaboration with Göttingen and DVL (Berlin-Adlershof), it also contributed to the development of the swept wing (what Germans called Pfeilflüge, or \\"arrow wing\\").Christopher, pp.47-8. Among the engine projects worked on at LFA was a toroidal (swing-piston) design by Otto Lutz of Büssing, a concept akin to the Wankel; work was also done by Junkers and Bosch.Christopher, p.85. LFA remained so secret, the Allied air forces never bombed it.Christopher, pp.42 and 91. Postwar, the site was visited by a Ministry of Aircraft Production team led by Roy Fedden.Christopher, passim.

He has also founded the educational activist organisations Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti and Shiksha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas. Batra has been criticized for his school textbooks, where he has written racist, superstitious, religious, nationalistic statements. Personal life Dinanath Batra was born in 1932 in Dera Gazi Khan in Punjab, in present-day Pakistan in a Punjabi Hindu family . He worked as the headmaster of the Dayananda Anglo- Vedic School at Dera Bassi in Patiala district, Indian Punjab. In 1966, he was appointed headmaster of the Geeta Senior School in Kurukshetra, the first school set up by the RSS. He is an RSS pracharak. Activism =Vidya Bharati= He was appointed as the full-time general secretary of the RSS schools network Vidya Bharati in 1990. =Notice to Sonia Gandhi= On 30 May 2001, Batra served a legal notice to Sonia Gandhi, president of the Indian National Congress. Batra stated that a resolution passed by the All India Congress Committee at its plenary session included statements that were defamatory towards Vidya Bharati. According to Batra, the resolution had stated that textbooks used by Vidya Bharati promoted negative attitude and violence towards minorities, justified the caste system, sati and child marriage as being a part of Indian culture, and contained superstitions and concocted facts inimical to scientific temper. =Litigation against NCERT= In 2006, Batra filed a Public Interest Litigation against the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), in which he raised 70 objections about the contents of secondary school history and social science textbooks. Some objections were based on the argument that Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Aurobindo Ghosh, and Bhagat Singh had been wrongly described as \\"militants\\". Another objection was to statements that Indo Aryans, including Brahmins, had consumed beef as a part of their diet in ancient times. Batra stated that this was a falsehood, and that cows had been worshiped in India since Vedic times. The Delhi High Court directed NCERT to form a committee to study the objections. A three-member committee concluded that of the 70 pieces of content that had been objected to, 37 had already been replaced by that year, 29 were to remain unchanged, and 4 were to be modified. The committee declined to modify the statement about Indo-aryans eating beef, stating that it was factual. However, this statement was later removed from the textbooks, as a result of a decision taken by the NCERT under the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005. The process has been started by Jagmohan Singh Rajput, once an RSS member, in 2003 but it took longer than expected. =Opposition to sex education= On 15 May 2007, acting on the advice of Batra, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chouhan removed sex education from the state curriculum on the grounds that it offended Indian values. Batra suggested that yoga be added to the curriculum instead of sex education. This view was criticised by S. Anandhi, a scholar of gender issues, who wrote that sex-education was aimed at combating child sexual abuse, and controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS by encouraging safe sexual practices. She also stated that fundamentalist organisations were attempting to repress sexuality. Later that year, Batra wrote a letter on behalf of the Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti, which stated that parents can possibly book instructors on the charge of \\"outraging the modesty of a woman or dishonouring a person.\\" =Petition against Ramanujan's essay= In 2008, Batra petitioned the Delhi High Court on behalf of Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti, seeking the removal of A.K. Ramanujan's essay, Three Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation, from the Delhi University's history syllabus. The essay discusses the many texts and presentations of the Ramayana that appear across the globe. In response to the petition, the university set up a committee of experts to study the essay. The committee found nothing controversial about the work, and this sentiment was echoed by outside scholars. However, the university's academic council decided to remove the essay from the syllabus, in a move that was widely criticised by scholars, but welcomed by a narrow section academics in Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti. =Legal notices to authors= On 3 March 2010, Batra sent a legal notice to Wendy Doniger, Penguin Group USA and the Penguin India subsidiary, raising several objections on the book The Hindus: An Alternative History by Doniger. In 2011, Batra filed suit against Doniger and Penguin Publishing under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code, which punishes acts intended to cause outrage or offend the sentiments of religious communities. In February 2014, pursuant to a settlement agreement, Penguin India withdrew all unsold copies of the book and pulped them, leading to sharp criticism. Later, that year he also sent a legal notice to N. Ram, the editor of Frontline magazine, for printing a cover article titled Shortcut to Hindu Rashtra. On 3 March 2014, Batra sent a legal notice to the Aleph Book Company demanding that another book by Wendy Doniger, On Hinduism, be withdrawn. In May 2014, academic publisher Orient Blackswan halted the release of a book, Communalism and Sexual Violence: Ahmedabad since 1969 by Megha Kumar, after it received a legal notice from Batra claiming the book is defamatory and derogatory to the RSS. The publisher in a letter to the author explained that it was assessing the book before the release. The publisher also put another book, From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India by Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, under review after his notice. =Textbook authorship= On 30 June 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party government of Gujarat issued a circular, declaring six text books written by Batra to be part of the state education curriculum as supplementary literature. Originally written in Hindi, the books were translated into Gujarati, and were released by Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the state education minister, who stated that they were compulsory. Batra has indicated that the initiative for using the books came from the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat, and the books carry a foreword from Modi. The books among other things, asserted that cars were invented in ancient India and urged students to draw the geographic map of an Akhand Bharat, that includes countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. They received severe criticism from historians as well as the popular press. Historian Romila Thapar stated that the books contained \\"not history, but fantasy.\\" Irfan Habib, another prominent historian, described them as \\"hilarious but scary\\". He said that the books were being introduced as part of a political program, and also stated that \\"The point here is whether the person has any semblance of scholarship, any track record.\\" On 1 August, the local Congress division in Vadodara protested the books by burning their covers. The city's BJP unit criticized the act and called it an insult to the national leaders as the covers had pictures of some national leaders. =Appointment to Haryana education committee= On 12 November 2014, the newly elected BJP government of Haryana state announced that Batra would be appointed to a new committee of educationalists. The committee would consist of retired teachers and professors from the state. = NCERT Textbook objections = In July 2017, he submitted another list of objections against the NCERT textbooks on various subjects.

At the end of the 2015 season, at his exit meeting with head coach Jason Garrett, Smith was told he was being converted into a fullback based on his work with the scout team, in order to give him a better chance to make the roster. 2016 season After the team chose not to re-sign Tyler Clutts, he entered OTAs competing with Rod Smith for the starting position. Although they both made the team, Keith was named the starting fullback at the end of training camp. Smith had his first career carry for a three-yard gain in the Cowboys' season-opening loss to the New York Giants. The next game, he made his first career reception on a five-yard pass from quarterback Dak Prescott during a 27–23 victory over the Washington Redskins. On October 2, Smith had one rushing attempt for a two-yard gain and caught one pass for a 14-yard gain in a 24–17 win over the San Francisco 49ers. On January 1, 2017, he earned his first career start during a 27–14 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. He contributed to rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott winning the NFL rushing title, while finishing his first season as a fullback with two carries for five-yards and three receptions for 20 receiving yards in 16 games and one start. He also was a core special teams player. 2017 season Smith remained as the team´s starting fullback, playing in 16 games, while blocking for Elliott and Alfred Morris. He was tied for the team lead with 10 special teams tackles and also forced 2 fumbles. He entered the 2018 offseason as a restricted free agent. The Cowboys gambled by not extending him a tender offer, looking to bring him back at a lower salary. =Oakland Raiders= On March 15, 2018, Smith signed a two-year contract with the Oakland Raiders, reuniting with Rich Bisaccia who was his special teams coach with the Cowboys. On August 31, 2019, Smith was released by the Raiders. =Atlanta Falcons= On September 2, 2019, Smith was signed by the Atlanta Falcons. He appeared in all 16 games, of which he started five, in the 2019 season. On March 14, 2020, Smith signed a three-year contract extension with the Falcons. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Falcons on July 29, 2020. He was activated on August 15, 2020.

WateReuse's main focus is reclaimed water and desalination. The promotion of such methods is the central purpose for WateReuse. With this as the core for the organization, WateReuse is able to concentrate their efforts into finding the right process and technology that goes into purifying water. WateReuse's goal is to find high-quality water in abnormal water sources through supporting water projects, with safety as a key factor in mind. WateReuse consists of two sectors, WateReuse Association and WateReuse Research Foundation, that makes these goals possible. Both have separate Board of Directors, but share the same goal. This nonprofit organization is located across the United States. WateReuse Association has seven state sections and an international division. Overview and History WateReuse was founded in 1990. On August 1, 2000, G. Wade Miller was named the first full-time executive director, with an office established in Washington D.C. Under Miller's control, the WateReuse Association accumulated about 400 organizational leaders and sponsored legislation. The WateReuse Research Foundation has been given federal funding and has built a network full of scientists and technicians, developing knowledge to the success of recycling and desalinating water. In August 2013, G. Wade Miller declared his resignation from WateReuse. On March 25, 2014, Melissa L. Meeker was named executive director on WateReuse by the Board of Directors. With this new position, Meeker will guide the two organizations in strategic growth. She will also lead the operational programs, their staff, and the execution of these missions. Meeker has over 20 years of experience as a seasoned water executive, with expertise ranging in policy development as well as executive management. WateReuse Association =Overview= WateReuse focuses on taking water from sources such as seawater and wastewater and turning them into usable water. The Association part of WateReuse is one of the two branches of the organization that centralizes their efforts into supporting water projects that are finding ways to generate high-quality water from sources such as storm water and seawater. WateReuse Association is a nonprofit trade association that engages in advocacy through legislation and conducts education providing new opportunities for other water reuse communities. WateReuse also focuses on taking wastewater and transforming that into high- quality reclaimed water that can potentially be used for everyday uses such as landscaping and irrigation, as well as drinking water. WateReuse Association highly emphasizes their priorities on educating the public about why reclaimed water should be used, what their benefits are, and reassuring that problems with reclaimed water, such as contamination, will not occur. =WateReuse California= WateReuse Association's California section states their mission as: \\"To promote responsible stewardship of California's water resources by maximizing the safe, practical and beneficial use of recycled water and by supporting the efforts of the WateReuse Association.\\" WateReuse California worked with Water Education Foundation to create a 16-page booklet that teaches elementary students about what recycled water really is. With the help of the Los Angeles County Chapter, WateReuse California created an irrigation user's manual on how to use recycled water on their irrigations. =Advocacy= WateReuse has been very effective in California by successfully getting more than 35 legislations enacted over a span of twenty years. In the National level, WateReuse has focused its efforts on obtaining fund for their Research Foundation through Congress. They were successfully able to secure $17.3 million in Federal funding. WateReuse also reauthorized the Water Desalination Act of 1996. WateReuse has taken a controversial stance against labeling the 'forever chemicals' per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous waste, or regulating these as a family of chemicals with similar biological activity, stating that the point source pollution via water reuse is not the primary responsibility of municipal treatment plants. WateReuse Research Foundation =Overview= WateReuse Research Foundation has a mission of conducting and promoting applied research on reclaiming and desalinating water. This nonprofit corporation conducts research on behalf of communities that include water and wastewater. Their goal is to advance the science and technology of this process. WateReuse researches different issues that are possible within the recycling and desalination process, and makes sure no contaminants will escape into this new source of water. WateReuse Research Foundation hope to be the voice for research on the reuse of water. It is a public benefit corporation that focuses on applied research of issues. =Research= WateReuse Research Foundation gets its funding from its Subscribers and funding partners such as the Bureau of Reclamation, the California Department of Water Resources and more. The research that this foundation conducts includes issues concerning contaminants and bacteria. It also focuses on researching ways to benefit the communities that will fulfill their needs for water.

It was written by Ray Davies. Recording The initial demo of \\"How Are You\\" was recorded in January 1986 at Konk Studios. Ray Davies liked his vocals on the demo so much that he transferred the vocals from the demo to Konk Studios' 24-track machine. He then worked on the instrumental to center around the demo's vocal. Lyrics and music In \\"How Are You\\", the singer reminisces with an old friend he has run into. \\"It's been a while, I haven't seen you for at least a year or more, or is it less? I can't be sure,\\" the singer says. He then asks, \\"How are you?\\" The singer continues to question his friend, asking \\"Are you still dreaming and making big plans? How are the nights are they still lonely? Are you still struggling the way that I am?\\" However, the meeting begins to turn sour, with the singer saying, \\"I know you're making all the same mistakes\\", but then adds, \\"Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment. No harm was ever felt or ever meant.\\" He then realizes that he has to leave, as he's \\"gotta thousand little things I better do. Ah, but it was really good to talk to you. Be on my way, I'm bound to see you on the street again someday, and when I do I'll say How are you?\\" The reuniting theme of \\"How Are You\\" is also apparent in its follow- up single, \\"Lost and Found\\". \\"How Are You\\", like most Kinks tracks, is sung by Ray Davies. The track also, like many others on Think Visual, makes use of synthesizers. Release and reception \\"How Are You\\" was first released in November 1986 on the Think Visual LP. However, one month later, \\"How Are You\\" was released as the debut U.K. single from said album, backed with \\"Killing Time\\". It was a moderate success, peaking at #86 on the U.K. Singles Chart. This would be the last time that a Kinks single charted in Britain. Although the Dave Davies-penned \\"Rock 'n' Roll Cities\\" was chosen to be the lead Think Visual single in America, \\"How Are You\\" was eventually released as its follow- up, this time backed with \\"Working at the Factory\\". In the U.S., AOR disc jockeys flipped the single over and played \\"Working At The Factory\\" as though it was the second single. It reached #16 on Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart. On his review of Think Visual, David Wild of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"the melancholy \\"How Are You\\" is another of Ray's well-crafted songs of love and loss.\\" The track also appeared on the compilation album, Picture Book. =Music video= Like many other Kinks singles of the 1980s, a promotional video for \\"How Are You\\" was filmed, featuring Ray Davies. Unusually, the video \\"How Are You\\" (as well as those for the two other singles from Think Visual) was not directed by Julien Temple, who had directed all of their music videos since \\"Predictable\\".

Kip explained Cutmouth John had previously lived near the Whitman mission prior to the massacre and been disfigured during a fight with Snake warriors in 1850 while hunting Marcus Whitman's killers. During the Yakima War, Cutmouth John accompanied American troops at the Battle of Union Gap, during which it is believed he inflicted the only fatality on the Yakama forces during the encounter. Though occasionally popular among the Americans, Philip Sheridan reports that - in the aftermath of that battle - Cutmouth John paraded through the U.S. camp waving the scalp of the Yakama he'd killed and dressed in the Catholic vestments of Father Pandoza, the priest of St. Joseph's Mission which had been ransacked by territorial militia the day before.

He is also a board member of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. Martin is a former chairman of the Texas State University System Board of Regents and has served on the LBJ Foundation's board of trustees. The foundation supports the LBJ Presidential Library and LBJ School of Public Affairs. Early life Jack Martin was born in Taylor, Texas and grew up in San Antonio, Texas. He attended Texas State University (then known as Southwest Texas State University), where he studied political science. While at the Southwest Texas State, he became involved with the school's student senate. He later became chairman of the student senate and met former President Lyndon B. Johnson, a prominent alumnus of the school, through that office. Career Martin began serving as an assistant sergeant at arms at the Texas Capitol while studying at Southwest Texas State. Shortly thereafter, two years following his meeting Johnson, a Johnson aide introduced Martin to then-United States Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Martin left school to take a job as travel aide during Bentsen's campaign for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Following Bentsen's 1976 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Martin helped direct the campaign of then-state Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial nominee John Luke Hill during the 1978 Democratic primary and Texas gubernatorial general election. John Hill beat incumbent Governor Dolph Briscoe in the Democratic primary by running a progressive campaign, but lost in the general election to Republican Bill Clements. The 1978 election was the first time since Reconstruction that a Republican won the governorship of Texas. In 1982, the 28-year-old Martin led the Democratic coordinated campaign for all state elections while also heading Bentsen's successful reelection campaign for the United States Senate. That year Democrats swept statewide offices and incumbent Republican Governor Bill Clements lost in the general election to Democrat Mark White. Other Democrats who won office that year include Jim Maddox for attorney general, Ann Richards for state treasurer, Garry Mauro for land commissioner, and Jim Hightower for agriculture commissioner. Governor Mark White appointed Martin to a six-year term on the Texas State University System Board of Regents in 1985. The board of regents oversaw the system's member institutions, which at the time were Angelo State University, Sam Houston State University, Sul Ross State University, and Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University), Martin's alma mater. Martin became chairman of the board in 1988 and served on the board in that capacity until his term expired in 1991. Martin received the Southwest Texas State University Distinguished Alumni award following his regency. In 1988, Martin led Bentsen's successful reelection campaign for the United States Senate. Later that year Martin founded Public Strategies, a public affairs and communication firm, with the help of Matthew Dowd, who served as company president and oversaw its day-to-day operations. The firm was financed with a small loan Martin secured on farmland that he had inherited from his father. He purchased the name Public Strategies from James Johnson and Richard Holbrooke for $1. Johnson and Holbrooke had previously owned a consultancy of the same name, which they sold to Lehman Brothers in the early 1980s. The two later served as members of Public Strategies' advisory board. Public Strategies' first client was Southwest Airlines, whose co-founder, Herb Kelleher, was a friend of Bentsen. The firm continued to work in Democratic politics during the early 1990s. Public Strategies worked on the campaigns of Democratic candidates during the 1990 Texas election cycle, including winners Governor Ann Richards, Lt. Governor Bob Bullock, and Attorney General Dan Morales. Martin chaired Richards' gubernatorial transition team following her election. The firm also advised national Democratic leadership, with Martin serving as an adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. By 1994, the firm decided to move away from partisan politics and concentrate solely on corporations and business groups. Martin remained chairman of the Public Strategies following its 2006 acquisition by the WPP Group.

He was a brother of Luis Ferré, who served as Governor of Puerto Rico, and Isolina Ferré, the \\"Mother Teresa of Puerto Rico\\". Ferré was also the father of Maurice Ferré, a former six-term mayor of Miami, Florida. Early life and education Ferré was born in Ponce and the son of Cuban born Antonio Ferré Bacallao. After attending Morristown-School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey, he earned his bachelor's degree in business administration at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts in 1924. Ferré later served on the Board of Trustees of the school alongside Edward Kennedy. \\"Edward M. Kennedy, youngest brother of President Kennedy, was one of three persons elected today to the Board of Trustees of Boston University. Other elected were Stephen P. Mugar of Belmont, President of the Star Market Company, and Jose A. Ferre, industrialist.\\" He earned his master's degree in business administration from the University of Miami. Industrial development During the years following World War II, Ferré grew his wealth by purchasing bankrupt glass, cement, and carton factories. At one point, his family empire owned 80 corporations in Puerto Rico, the United States, Venezuela, and Panama. In 1965, Ferré's real estate company, the Ferré Florida Corporation, financed the construction of the 30-story New World Tower in the Central Business District in Miami. At the time, the building, which cost $6 million to construct, stood as the tallest in Florida. Its construction represented part of a broader effort to revitalize Miami. Legacy In 1990, U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida's 27th congressional district honored the legacy and impact of Ferré during remarks on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Zerlett and starring Hannes Stelzer, Hansi Knoteck, and Paul Dahlke. The film was part of the Nazis' campaign against 'degenerate art', and depicts the trial of a young artist who has resisted the trend towards it.Hake p. 59–60 The film was made by Bavaria Film at their Emelka Studios in Munich. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Max Seefelder, Hans Sohnle and Wilhelm Vorwerg.  Plot  The film is set in the 1920s. Peter Brake, a sculptor, believes modern art to be decadent. He creates a neoclassical-style statue of Venus, which he then buries in a Bavarian field in order to protect the identity of Charlotte, the woman who modelled for it. When it is dug up, experts believe that Venus vom Acker ('Venus of the Fields') is an ancient statue made by Praxiteles. Peter is unable to prove that he is the creator of the statue, as the only person able to verify his claim is the model. He tries to keep her out of the matter, as she is now a respectable housewife. Ultimately, however, she decides to come forward as a witness. Cast  Role as propaganda  The character of Peter Brake may be loosely based on Arno Breker, whose work was endorsed by the Nazi authorities. The filmmakers used sculptures that had been seized by the government, including Ernst Kirchner's Das Paar ('The Couple'), Otto Freundlich's Kopf (Head), and Marg Moll's Tanzerin (Dancer), as props. The art experts who misidentify Brake's sculpture are all coded as effete, homosexual or Jewish, etc. Susan Felleman suggests that the film's attempt at propaganda were weak, finding that its portrayals of a 'decadent' Berlin nightlife and the character of Benjamin Hecht (a Jewish art dealer) significantly more interesting than those Brake and his circle.

The area was said to be the \\"Switzerland of Maine\\", an isolated alpine area with great views and skiing. It consisted of eight runs (2 beginner and 6 intermediate/expert) using a double chairlift, a T-bar lift, and a Poma. The remnants of the ski area remain on the southward facing slope of Coburn Mountain (el. ), in Upper Enchanted Township where it got its namesake. History Enchanted Mountain was designed by E.H. Lord-Wood Associates and built in 1965 by North Haven Construction Company on land that was reportedly leased from Scott Paper Company, who would later become owner of nearby Big Squaw Mountain Resort. The ski area first opened in February 1966 with two lifts: a T-bar that would serve only two trails above the base lodge that season and a baby poma lift to serve the beginner ski area below the lodge. The following year a 4,200 ft. Poma double chairlift was constructed to the summit, increasing the trail count to seven. One wide open slope was located underneath the lift with six narrower, winding trails fanning out from the top. The vertical drop was only about 1000 ft. but some brochures and guidebooks exaggerated it to as much as 1800 ft. The area boasted that it had the deepest snow and shortest lift lines. In 1968 the lifts operated daily and an adult lift ticket was only $5.50. Ski lift on Enchanted Mountain. In 1971 the ski area had grown to include a ski school, shop, lodge, snack bar, nursery, and ski patrol, and by 1974 it had added a restaurant, rental & repair shop, warming huts and parking for up to 600 cars. It was said that the surrounding area had lodging available for over 300 people. There was no snowmaking or night skiing. Long term plans included three more trail pods, a tramway and six more double chairlifts to cover some 14,000 acres, but after financial troubles put the ski area out of business and on the auction block in 1969, it was sold by the Small Business Administration to three private owners: Willis & Robert LeFavour and Terry Tyler, founder of Maple Valley Ski Area in Vermont. The mountain opened under the new ownership in February 1970 hoping that unique offerings such as nighttime snowshoe tours and free board for anyone with a sleeping bag would finally bring in enough business to make the area successful. Weekend Full Day Lift Tickets were only $6.00 1970-1972. Closure Unfortunately, competition from other developing resorts such as Sugarloaf and Saddleback, along with the mountain's isolation and strong wind conditions, led to its demise in the mid 1970s. The last known season of operation was 1972-1973 after which the area was advertised for sale in an industry publication of ″Ski Area Management″. With no buyer found by 1974, the area was liquidated, allowed to grow in, and the lodge and lifts were torn down. Today you can still hike the mountain on a trail that goes all the way to the Coburn summit. The scar of the resort area remains but has further diminished due to logging projects commenced in the area in the early 2010s. The hiking trail can be reached from the old Enchanted Mountain parking lot located on Enchanted Mountain Road off of U.S. Route 201.

He is the proprietor of Desert Oracle, a self- published periodical and radio program exploring themes related to the Mojave Desert and the Southwestern United States. Career =Early career= After graduating from a San Diego, California magnet high school focused on broadcast journalism, Layne began his career in the mid-1980s reporting for Southern California newspapers before moving to Europe, where he worked for television, radio, and print journalism outlets in Macedonia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. In the late 1990s, Layne returned to the United States and turned to online journalism exclusively. In April 1997, Layne co-founded Tabloid.net, an online publication in the \\"brassy style of tabloid newspapers\\", with $50,000 in savings. While unprofitable as a company, Tabloid.net attained notoriety as an \\"unabashed scandal-monger\\" and for suing a Florida advertising company for appropriating its intellectual property, \\"a talking ham sandwich that gives advice\\". Layne's next venture was LAExaminer.com, co-founded in 2001 with future Reason editor-in-chief Matt Welch, focused in part on criticism of Los Angeles' last remaining daily newspaper, the Los Angeles Times. The \\"Examiner\\" name was intended as homage to the defunct Los Angeles Herald Examiner. In early 2003, former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan announced his intentions to publish a full-color, 52-page, tabloid-format print edition called Los Angeles Examiner, with Layne as editor, intended to improve on the Times local reporting. A prototype was produced and circulated among potential investors and advertisers, however the project was shelved after Riordan delayed its launch in May 2003. During this time period, Layne also received attention for blogging at his personal website, KenLayne.com, and became known in the early 2000s American political and technology blogosphere for a quote directed at the mainstream media: \\"We can fact-check your ass\\". Another Layne project of the era was called Highways West, a travel website about the Western United States, announced in January 2005. =Gawker Media and Wonkette= In April 2005, Layne joined with former Gawker editor Choire Sicha to launch Sploid, a Drudge Report-inspired, \\"tabloid-emulating\\" website for Gawker Media, devoted to breaking news. He later became \\"national correspondent\\" for the flagship Gawker website. Layne became the West Coast writer for Gawker Media's \\"absurdist\\" and \\"vicious\\" political humor site Wonkette in 2006, and later its managing editor. Gawker owner Nick Denton spun off Wonkette in 2008, along with two other websites, and Layne became Wonkette owner. In 2009, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann named Layne and Wonkette in his \\"Worst Person in the World\\" segment for allegedly mischaracterizing a temporary absence from his television program. In 2011, Wonkette faced media criticism and desertion by advertisers after a writer mocked Trig Palin, the child of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who has Down syndrome. Layne deleted the post after several advertisers, including Papa John's Pizza, pulled their advertising from the site. Layne sold Wonkette to Los Angeles journalist Rebecca Schoenkopf in 2012. Of his career writing for the Gawker Media sites, Layne said in 2018: \\"All of that I did from the desert, and no one knew\\". =Desert Oracle= In February 2015, Layne created Desert Oracle: The Voice of the Desert, a quarterly periodical focused on the \\"weirdness of the desert\\" in the Southwestern United States. Each edition runs 44 pages, most of which is written and designed by Layne, entirely in black-and-white, inside a yellow and black cover. Typical content includes \\"adventurers' journal entries, railroad ad copy, and ... naturalists' musings\\", as well as stories on \\"alien sightings\\" and other paranormal phenomena. Inspiration for Desert Oracle came from Randall Henderson's Desert Magazine and Harry Oliver's Desert Rat Scrap Book. Published from Joshua Tree, California, Layne distributes the publications to bookstores and cafes across the desert southwest. As of 2018, Desert Oracle is available in five states and reaches the majority of its readership through the mail via paid subscription. Desert Oracle became the basis of a weekly half-hour radio show, The Desert Oracle Radio, hosted by Layne for the community radio station KCDZ in June 2017. With subject matter similar to the print version, Layne's radio show features \\"chilling tales of Bigfoot sightings, secret military UFO programs, missing hikers, and any number of myths and conspiracies\\" centered in the Mojave desert and the American Southwest. The Desert Oracle Radio reaches Joshua Tree National Park and nearby towns including Pioneertown, Twentynine Palms and Yucca Valley by terrestrial broadcast; the show is also available as a podcast. Other writing Layne is the author of two novels, Dot.con, published in 2001, and Dignity, an epistolary novel about a group of Los Angelenos creating a new community within abandoned desert housing developments following an economic collapse, in 2011. He formerly was a columnist for USC Annenberg School's Online Journalism Review, and wrote a column called \\"Desert Rattler\\" for LA CityBeat, both now defunct. Other writing by Layne has appeared in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Awl. Personal life Layne was born in Louisiana, where he lived in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans as a child. He moved to the Phoenix, Arizona suburbs for middle school, and later to San Diego, where he first began visiting the Mojave desert. Layne records his own music, and formerly played with Southern California rock musicians Country Dick Montana and Buddy Blue Seigal. He has cited Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey as an influence, whom he met and corresponded with before Abbey's death in 1989. Further reading *The Rise and Fall of the L.A.

Part of the Shell Presents series of one-off television dramas and comedies, it was produced in Melbourne, but first shown in Sydney on 9 January 1960. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. It was an original Australian TV play which was even rarer. Plot An Australian woman, Gwennie, and a man of Greek descent, Tony, intend to marry.

Cast *Margaret Browne as Gwennie *Robin Ramsay as Tony *Peter Aanensen as Mr Sweeney *Marjorie Archibald as Mrs Sweeney *Nina Black as Mrs Demetrius *Carol Armstrong as Greek girl *Bruce Archer Production The drama was written by Barbara Vernon, best known at the time for writing the play The Multi-Coloured Umbrella (adapted for television in 1958), and who had previously written the ABC TV comedy one-off The Passionate Pianist in 1957. It was filmed at GTV-9 studios and on location in Melbourne. Margaret Brown filmed the role during a two week break from her regular job. Duration was 60 minutes including commercials (running time excluding commercials is not known. Homicide episodes from the mid-1960s typically run 45–47 minutes, while some early locally produced hour-long programming on commercial television could run as long as 51 minutes).

He is currently serving as assistant coach of the Swiss women's national team.  Playing career  Muller spent most of his playing career at EV Zug. In 1986-87, his first year at EVZ, he contributed to the team earning promotion to the Swiss top-flight National League A (NLA). Muller would win the Swiss championship with Zug in 1998 and moved to HC Fribourg-Gottéron in 1999 before calling it a career in 2000. He played a total of 544 NLA contests, scoring 203 goals.  Coaching career  Muller formed a coaching duo with Hans Kossmann at HC Fribourg-Gottéron at the beginning of his career behind the bench. He then joined the coaching staff of SC Rapperswil-Jona for the 2000-01 campaign and accepted another head coaching position in 2002, again signing with HC Fribourg-Gottéron. He was relieved of his duties in January 2003. From 2003 to 2008, Muller served as assistant coach at EV Zug, before he signed with the ZSC Lions, also as an assistant. At both clubs, he worked under Sean Simpson. At ZSC, he was promoted to head coach in 2010, replacing Simpson, who took over the Swiss national team. However, Muller's head coaching tenure with the Lions lasted only 16 games, in which the Lions collected 20 points. He was dismissed in October 2010. Muller was named head coach of NLB side EHC Olten prior to the 2011-12 campaign. After four straight defeats and following a 2-8 loss to rivals SC Langenthal, he was sacked in December 2011. After serving as assistant coach of the Swiss national team during the 2011 World Championship, Muller was handed further responsibilities by the Swiss ice hockey federation: He coached the under-20 squad, while continuing as assistant of the men's team, again working under Sean Simpson during the 2013 (silver medal) and 2014 World Championships as well as at the 2014 Winter Olympics.http://www.sochi2014.com/en/ice-hockey-teams-switzerland-gender-men He also served as Simpson's assistant during the short stint at Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League in the 2014–15 and was named assistant coach of the Kloten Flyers, when Simpson became head coach of the club in December 2014. After the club had announced budget cuts and was taken over by a new owner, Muller's contract was terminated by mutual consent in May 2016. Later that month, he was named assistant coach of Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany, again serving under Sean Simpson. Muller, Simpson and general manager Teal Fowler were sacked on December 4, 2017 due to the team's underwhelming start to the season. In early February 2019, he was named assistant coach of the Swiss women's national team.

He was born in Southborough, Kent and died at Winchester, Hampshire. Hone- Goldney was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He played in a lot of minor matches at Cambridge, but had appeared in only one first-class game when picked for the University match in 1873: in this game, he batted at No 11 and bowled only two overs, without success. He made a similarly scant impression in his third and final first-class match in 1876, though the game itself, between a team called The Gentlemen of the Marylebone Cricket Club and Kent, was rendered notable by the feat of W. G. Grace in scoring 344, the highest first-class score to that point and the first innings of more than 300. Family, name and career Hone-Goldney was educated at Eton College and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was a lawyer admitted to the Inner Temple in 1873 and called to the bar in 1877; he practised on the Oxford circuit. His name throughout his adult life was \\"Hone- Goldney\\". His father, George Goldney, who also played some first-class cricket at Cambridge, at some point hyphenated his middle and family names and became known as \\"George Hone-Goldney\\"; this happened after George Hone Hone-Goldney's birth (hence the strange dittograph in his name) but before the son's arrival at Cambridge.

By the time the fire was extinguished the following afternoon, it had destroyed between 300,000 and 400,000 books of the total 12 million housed. About 3.5 million volumes initially became damp due to firefighting foam. Many of the lost books were foreign scientific works. Extinguishment The first fire engines arrived eight minutes after the fire alarm went off. However, it took nearly two hours for the firefighters to reach the fire itself. The fire was initially tackled by the Ninth Fire Company that was joined by the crews of seven other fire engines. Book salvage The damp books damaged by fire extinguishment were initially frozen. Then a radio appeal was broadcast for citizens to dry the damp books in their homes. By late March 1988 93% of the damp books had been dried in that way and returned to the library.

Cohan. It was published on April 8, 2014, by Scribner. Summary The Price of Silence is a new account of the 2006 Duke lacrosse case scandal that details the pressures faced by America's elite colleges and universities and addresses the issues of sexual misconduct, underage drinking, and bad-boy behavior. The 2006 Duke lacrosse case was front-page news nationwide. Cohan feels that the true story of the alleged team rape case has never been told in its entirety and was more complex than all the reportage would indicate. The Price of Silence elaborated on what happened when the most combustible forces in American culture—unbridled ambition, intellectual elitism, athletic prowess, aggressive sexual behavior, racial bias, and absolute prosecutorial authority collided and then exploded on a powerful university campus, in the justice system, and in the media.Cohan interview Controversy There have been positive reviews of the book, as well as mixed reviews, and negative reviews. Cohan has also been criticized for not providing endnotes of definitively sourced material, or a list of interview subjects. Cohan has justified this omission in the \\"A note on sources\\" section of the book: \\"In an era when digital access to documents of all stripes is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, the idea of providing page after page of notes on the sources of my research—as I did in my previous three books—seems somewhat superfluous, especially when writing about events that started to unfold primarily in 2006 ... Throughout the narrative, my reliance on these articles and blogs is indicated clearly, and the vast majority of them are easily accessible to anyone online, often at little or no cost.\\" (p. 619). Two other issues that were discussed in detail by people who had a negative view of the book were Cohan's giving Mike Nifong long stretches to present rambling, factually-bereft defenses of his conduct and revisionist views of the case, and the fact that numerous allegations by Cohan were A) not supported with any hard facts and B) refuted by principals in the case who publicly stated that Cohan never spoke them and had fabricated his stories. In the most visible example of this, Cohan stated in his book that Governor Roy Cooper had acted against the wishes of North Carolina investigators when he dropped all charges against the Duke lacrosse players, but the investigators stated that Cooper's decision was completely correct and that Cohan's views were fiction. =Publication history= *2014, United States, Scribner, , Pub date: April 2014, Hardback =Explanation of the book's title= The \\"price\\" in the book's title refers to the alleged $60 million that Duke University paid to the three accused lacrosse players ($20 million each) with confidential terms and apparent silence provisions. The sum of money has been disputed to be actually about ⅓ that total ($18 million). Cohan has said several times in public interviews: \\"That's a lot of money for a party. They bought a lot of silence with that 100 million dollars.\\" References Further reading * Stuart Taylor Jr. and KC Johnson (2008).

Jaylene's death led to extensive public criticism regarding the monitoring of vulnerable children in Canada.  Background  Nicole Redhead herself came from an extremely troubled background. As a child she saw her own mother murder her father. In the aftermath she was shuttled around through five foster homes, sexually assaulted, and later became addicted to crack cocaine, taking up prostitution in order to supplement her addiction. Like Jaylene, Redhead was born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Redhead's first two children were taken from her by Manitoba Child and Family Services. Jaylene Redhead- Sanderson Redhead gave birth to her third child, Jaylene, in 2007. Jaylene was born going through drug withdrawal, and also had fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Social workers removed Jaylene after she was born, due to concerns about her wellbeing if left in her mother's care. In late 2008, social workers agreed a supervision plan to have Jaylene returned to her mother on condition that the pair live at the Native Women’s Transition Centre (also known as Awasis) in Winnipeg, so that they could be monitored. The judge who oversaw the inquest into Jaylene's death questioned the wisdom of this decision, particularly given that Redhead had previously failed to show sufficient progress to have her first two children returned to her custody. After moving into the shelter with her daughter, Redhead began to consume large amounts of crack cocaine and beat Jaylene. The inquest report into Jaylene's death found that the pair were poorly monitored by social workers and centre staff, none of whom noticed what was happening. Redhead was given leave to her community, to live with her mother, which gave her free access to drugs with no supervision. In June 2009, just six months after being reunited with her daughter, and after having inflicted repeated sustained beatings upon her during that period, Redhead killed Jaylene by smothering her. She refused to inform police, but once her boyfriend, Preston Tran (then an inmate at Headingley Correctional Institution) discovered what she had done, he alerted the Winnipeg Police Service. Jaylene Sanderson-Redhead was documented as the 14th homicide in Winnipeg of 2009. Conviction and Aftermath Redhead pleaded guilty to manslaughter, admitting she killed her daughter in a fit of rage. The defence attorney asked for leniency on the grounds of Redhead's traumatic upbringing, and stated that she was prone to violent behaviour since she had seen her mother kill her father at a drinking party at the age of nine. However, the prosecution emphasised to the jury that Jaylene had suffered more than 30 injuries in the days prior to her death, including bites on her legs, swollen genitalia and kicks. Redhead was convicted and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, which is what the prosecution had requested. Due to credit for time already served, this equated to a further eight years and eight months imprisonment. The trial caused such an uproar in Canada that it was debated in the provincial legislature, and an inquest found 14 recommendations in order to prevent another tragedy like this from happening. The Office of the Children's Advocate of Manitoba was involved in the inquest and provided the Special Investigative Report. The panel lambasted the Native Women's Transition Centre in Winnipeg, with Justice Larry Allen stating that \\"there does not appear to be any point to sending drug/alcohol addicted mothers to supposed 'safe houses' if these people are going to have free access to the community without making sure that their sobriety is tested\\". The paternal grandmother of Jaylene Redhead stated that her life will never be the same after the murder, stating \\"God gave us these kids to look after them, not destroy them\\".

He began in 1910 in San Francisco and eventually moved across the bay to Oakland where he remained for the rest of his life. Morgan is known for his illustrations of sheet music covers by publishers mostly in the San Francisco Bay area.  Career  At age 17, Morgan graduated from the California Business College in San Francisco in December 1903. In 1930, Morgan began teaching Fashion Art and Commercial Art at the Fox Art Institute and School of Commercial Art, founded in 1921 in Oakland by Elton Villers Frederick Fox (1893–1970). In 1930, when he began teaching there, they renamed it the Fox-Morgan Art Institute and Commercial Art School. Fox returned to his native home in Victoria, Australia, in 1935, and Ruel Curtis Dean became associated with the school for two years. In 1937, the school was renamed Art Institute on the 3rd floor at 339 15th Street, Oakland, and Morgan became its head. Notable alumni of the Fox-Morgan School include Dong Kingman.

In 1956 she became a lecturer at University of Vienna and in the same year married historian Walter Wagner. In 1964 she presented to the International Congress of Art History in Bonn her research on early gothic architecture in Italy and a paper on historicism which brought her to international attention. In 1971 Renate Wagner-Rieger was appointed full professor at University of Vienna, she was the first woman in the history department to hold this position. Wagner-Rieger paid particular attention to previously neglected and partially devalued era of Historicism in architecture (the breakdown in romantic historicism, strict historicism and late historicism stems from it) and important contributions towards the study of Gründerzeit. In 1968 she initiated the large-scale research project called \\"Wiener Ringstraße\\", also known as \\"The Ringstraße: Image of an Era: the expansion of the inner city of Vienna under Emperor Franz Joseph\\" which studied the ring road in the historic center of Vienna.

In 1964 he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam to study literature, and began writing for the newspaper Het Parool; he never attained his degree. In 1970 he was hired by Elsevier, where he worked as the assistant of Wim Zaal, and in 1973 moved to Vrij Nederland (where he still works) and started their literary supplement, which in 1982 earned him an award from the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, the Dutch trade organization for booksellers and publishers. From 1987 to 1992 he was a professor of literature at the University of Amsterdam. Peeters published more than a dozen collections of essays, and was awarded the Dr. Wijnaendts Francken award for essays and literary criticism in 1985, and in 2008 the Jacobson Award, awarded to \\"elderly\\" literati. As a literary critic, Peeters, whose allegiance is with the writers and critics associated with Forum from the 1930s and the De Revisor from the 1980s, is well known as an opponent of postmodernism; he published a pamphlet on the subject in 1986 and the following year participated in a well-publicized public debate with Christel van Boheemen.

They were revised in the 1980s and in 1986 a Chancery of Orders was established in the Office of the State President, after 1994 the Presidency, to administer most of them. Most of these honours remained in use after 1994, until an entirely new honours system was introduced in December 2002. Institution The military Order of the Star of South Africa, established in 1975 and conferred on general and flag officers in two classes, was named after the first large diamond to be found in South Africa, the Star of South Africa that was found on the banks of the Orange River in 1869 and that sparked the New Rush, leading to the establishment of Kimberley. The Order was expanded on 17 October 1978 with the institution of five non-military classes of the Order. Award criteria The Star of South Africa, Grand Cross, post-nominal letters SSA, is the senior decoration of these five civil honours. It was bestowed on civilians in defence-related industries and organisations and, from 1988, on general officers of the South African Police, South African Railways Police, South African Prisons Service and South African Intelligence Service for excellent meritorious service which made a lasting contribution to the security and general national interest of South Africa.

McDonald Nudibranch Systematic Index (2nd ed.), University of California Santa Cruz University of California Santa Cruz in Institute of Marine Sciences, (2009). Taxonomy Previously some authors synonymised Antiopella with Janolus and assigned the genus Janolus to the Janolidae family (see ITIS.govIT IS Report or AnimalDiversityIT IS Report Animal Diversity), others (see Seaslug ForumThe Sea Slug Forum Australian Museum) to the family of Zephyrinidae, and these were synonymised names of Proctonotidae (see WoRMS).Proctonotidae at WoRMS In 2019 an integrated taxonomic study reinstated Antiopella and Janolus as separate genera and placed them in the family Janolidae.Pola M., Hallas J.M. & Gosliner T.M.

Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research. 57(2): 345-368., page(s): 356, figs 4d, 6a-c, 7 Description This species is semi-transparent and has an oval-shaped outline. It is cream or light brown in colour, and grows to approximately 7.5 cm in length. The head has oral tentacles that are short. The lateral cerata are numerous, have a smooth surface and an inflated appearance. The central digestive gland lobe is thin and brown in colour and can be seen through each ceras. These gland lobes divide at the tip of the cerata into numerous terminal branches, distinguishing Janolids from Aeolid nudibranchs. The tips of the cerata are bluish-white and iridescent. The white surface colouration that is present on the cerata also appears in patches or lines along the bare central dorsum, as well as around the lamellate rhinophores and on the metapodium. The rhinophores are joined together at their bases with a swollen and wrinkled accessory caruncle. Both the rhinophores and median sensory caruncle are somewhat darker in colour than the rest of the body. Distribution Antiopella cristata has been found as far north as Norway down through the British Isles and the French Atlantic coast.Thomas E. Thompson et G.H.

Habitat It is found at depths of up to 40 metres, only in calm, clean water, on hard substrata in the sublittoral zone. Biology Antiopella cristata eats erect bryozoans of the species Alcyonidium gelatinosum, Bicellariella ciliata and in the genus Bugula, such as B. turbinata, B. plumosa, B. neritina and possibly species in the genus Cellaria.Gary R.

Why Women Should Care is a book written by Pulitzer Prize winner\\"Washington Post Leads in Pulitzers\\". The Wall Street Journal. 2010-04-13. Kathleen Parker, and was published in 2008 by Random House. The book's main theme is based around the premise that modern feminism isn't what it used to be; in the past, this movement was fighting for the equality of the genders.  Contents  Parker claims \\"as feminism has reached most of the goals of equality... women have become hostile toward men and maleness in what seems to be a spirit of retributive justice.\\"Lopez, Kathryn Jean (June 13, 2008). \\"Hail the Male\\". National Review Online. There are arguments for the idea that feminism has transformed from being something that was supposed to help women gain power in society. Instead it has become a tool for modern women to put men down. Using references to popular culture such as Murphy Brown and The Vagina Monologues, Parker points out how the media has slowly begun to portray men as brutish idiots or sexual predators, and the manners in which men are often portrayed today are doing more harm to families than many people realize. Murphy Brown and other shows that glorify the idea of being a single mother are doing a large amount of damage to the idea of the father as a possible caregiver. Ideas like this are used to support the argument that a more progressive, and male inclusive fourth-wave of feminism is in order. = Other topics = * No-fault divorce – Parker argues that due to the common portrayals of men, it is easier to file for divorce and win custody of children as a woman. * Sperm donation – Due to the recession toward the end of the 2000s sperm donations have been on the rise.,WCBD: Well-paid sperm donations up during slumping economy Published: April 6, 2009. sperm banks have made it possible to turn single motherhood into a \\"sophisticated act of self-fulfillment\\".

Her pithy one- liners and sharp-witted observations often make for laughs, but they take away from the serious discussion her book seeks to become a part of. At times, the book comes across like a string of op-ed columns...

From 1999 to 2008, he represented District 14 in Morehouse and Ouachita parishes. Political career On April 20, 1991, McDonald won a special election to the state House, called when Republican John C. Ensminger was elected to the Louisiana State Senate. McDonald defeated another Republican, Sonny G. Panzico (born c. 1940) of West Monroe, 3,052 (56.2 percent) to 2,377 (43.8 percent). Later in the year, McDonald faced two Democratic opponents in the regular nonpartisan blanket primary but failed to gain a required majority. He therefore was placed in a general election, popularly called the runoff on November 16 with Democrat Jess Smith, whom he defeated, 9,997 (56.2 percent) to 7,799 (43.8 percent). Thereafter, McDonald was unopposed for reelection in 1995, 1999, and 2003. In 1997, McDonald joined in a bipartisan fashion with Republican Governor Murphy J. Foster, Jr., to procure passage of Act 1375, a plan which opened the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS) scholarship program to all with a 2.5 grade point average and at least a score of 19 on the ACT. Family income was removed as a consideration for eligibility. Those with higher grades received $400 to $800 in extra funding to help meet the costs of other college expenses. McDonald's legislation was approved unanimously in both the House and Senate. TOPS is named for the late oilman Patrick F. Taylor of New Orleans, who in 1988 conceived the program. TOPS has benefited more than 616,000 students since it was launched in 1999 at an accumulative cost of almost $1.8 billion, funds which have put the state budget in shortfall. TOPS is expected to cost more than $354 million in fiscal year 2018–2019 alone. Term-limited in the House in the primary election held on October 20, 2007, McDonald instead ran for the state Senate from District 33, which includes Ouachita, Morehouse, Claiborne, Union, and West Carroll parishes. In that race to succeed the term-limited Republican Senator Robert J. Barham of Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish, McDonald received 16,058 votes (48.3 percent). He was defeated by the Republican candidate, the outgoing District 15 State Representative Mike Walsworth, a real estate developer from West Monroe who finished with 17,292 votes (51.7 percent) and still holds the seat. McDonald's House seat was narrowly won in the general election held on November 17, 2007, by a Republican, Sam Little, a retired farmer from Bastrop. Little was unseated in a reconfigured district in 2011, and the position is now held by the Republican Jay Morris, a recent candidate in the special election for Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat.

It was originally published under the pen name Ennis Graham and reissued in 1882 as by Mrs. Molesworth,Mary Louisa Molesworth at Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present, University of Cambridge. the name by which she is widely known. Both of those editions and many later ones were illustrated by Walter Crane; an 1893 uniform edition is available online at the University of Pennsylvania. An edition illustrated by Maria L. Kirk was published in 1914; it is available online at HathiTrust Digital Library.. A short story is appended, \\"The Castle in the Lough\\".Edition: Philadelphia, London, J.B. Lippincott Co., 1914 at WorldCat.  Plot summary  A small child and a cuckoo from a cuckoo clock become unlikely friends. At night the clock transports her to magical places.  Genre and style  Her writing style is known to be very plain in context, and it has been criticized for this. But the plain text was most likely used so that the work was more accessible to children. Nothing she writes is too complicated for the readers, and there is an air of conversation in the text.The Cuckoo Clock reviewed at Fantasy Reads  Themes  =Love and friendship= Throughout the novel Griselda struggles with her new place of residence. She quickly finds that what she needs most is friendship. She finds these friends first in the Cuckoo, then her maids, and finally she finds a real friend in Master Phil. It is also realized at the end that throughout the novel her aunts have been showing her examples of real love all along. =Magic in fiction= This particular use of magic is through an enchanted object. The plot is furthered easily with the assumption that the object has no bounds of possibility. Children readers are also led to use their imagination to see all of the images the writer has concocted. =Sacrifices bring reward= Throughout the story Griselda struggles to finish her lessons during the day. The Cuckoo helps her to learn that with hard work there is eventually a reward. He rewards her greatly when she has improved in her lessons. 19th century children's literature The second half of the 19th century is called the Golden age of children’s literature, because of the publication of so many notable stories that also appear in modern times. The fantasy novel for children was becoming very popular at this time. The Moral Didactic tale also continued with the popularity of the fantasy story. Often overlapping.\\"The Rise of Children's Fantasy Literature: The Fate of Moral Tales\\" by Siobhan Lam, 2008 at The Victorian Web =The didactic tale= The character of Griselda, has many interesting qualities. She is seen as a real child, who throws fits and is unhappy when she does not get her way. The Cuckoo, through these stories, teaches young Griselda how to control her feelings and urges. Learning the proper way to act is a major theme in many British children's books. Many books written in that age were meant for the betterment of the children reading them. Critical reception In the back of a copy of Mrs. Molesworth's The Tapestry Room there is a short review for The Cuckoo Clock: \\"A beautiful little story... It will be read with delight by every child into whose hands it is placed... Ennis Graham deserves all that praise that has been, is, and will be, bestowed on The Cuckoo Clock.

Biography  Manuel María Paz Delgado was born June 6, 1820 in the town of Almaguer, Cauca, Colombia. His parents were Domingo de Paz and Baltazara Delgado, and his siblings were José Miguel de Paz and Carmen de Paz. After studying literature in his native Amaguer and still being quite young, he moved to Popayán to serve as a soldier in the Guardia Nacional, joining December 29, 1839. As a private he participated in several of the civil wars of the Republic of New Granada, and distinguished himself for his bravery. As the years passed, he rose through the military ranks, obtaining the rank of Colonel in 1848. At the same time, along with his military career, he was also developing a career as a painter and cartographer, participating in an 1848 artistic exhibition with the \\"Mesa Revuelta\\", a work highly admired by the exhibition's selection jury. Watercolor of the Lagunas de Siecha, in Chingaza Natural National Park, painted by Manuel María Paz in 1855 during the Comisión Corográfica. In 1852 he was married to Felisa Castro. Six children resulted from this union, José Domingo, Felisa, Francisco, María, Ana María y Julián. In 1853 he joined the Comisión Corográfica to work as an artist with Henry Price, who later retired from the project for reasons of health. Between 1853 and 1858 he painted 127 lithographed watercolors,52 lithographed watercolors in 1853 during the fourth corográfic expedition, 16 in 1855 during the sixth expedition, 11 in 1856 during the seventh expedition, 16 in 1857 during the eighth expedition, and more than 32 illustrations of the San Agustín culture, executed by Agustín Codazzi. which not only served to illustrate the work of the Comisión, but also included other works published separately under the auspices of Agustín Codazzi. During these years, María Paz also assisted the celebrated geographer in creating maps of the different regions of the country. Codazzi died in 1859, in the arms of his friend Manuel María Paz. As a result, the work of the Comisión came to a complete stop. Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera did not want the work to be lost, so he contracted with María Paz and Manuel Ponce de León to finish the works begun under the direction of General Codazzi, and to publish them. As a result of this effort, the Atlas de los Estados Unidos de Colombia appeared in 1865, followed by the Atlas Geográfico e Histórico de la República de Colombia in 1889. The French Société de géographie conferred membership on Paz on December 6, 1889 based on the second of the two publications. In the period between the publication of the two works, he also participated in various artistic expositions, such as an 1871 exhibition commemorating celebrating the fiestas patrias (patriotic national holidays), and in 1883, as a part of the celebrations commemorating the birth of Simón Bolívar the liberator. After an exhausting but productive life, Manual María Paz Delgado died on September 16, 1902, in the parish of San Victorino in Bogotá.

Legardeur died at sea during a return trip to Canada from France in spring 1648 after an epidemic broke out on his ship. He had married Marie Favery. His daughter Marie- Madeleine married Jean-Paul Godefroy and his daughter Catherine married Charles Joseph d'Ailleboust des Muceaux.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Verdun, Quebec. Her name was altered to prevent confusion with other Allied warships named Verdun. Dunver was ordered as VerdunReferred to as Verdun of Canada in some sources. in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 5 May 1942 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 10 November later that year. At some point during 1942, her name was changed to Dunver. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 11 December 1943 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After commissioning, Dunver escorted a Sydney - Halifax convoy while making her way to Halifax. The vessel performed her workups at Pictou. Following that she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-5. In July 1944, she was the Senior Officer's Ship while escorting the largest convoy of the war, HX 300. She remained as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort until October 1944. Following the war, and Dunver were credited with sinking . That has since been credited to other ships by some sources while other sources continue to give these ships credit. In October 1944, Dunver returned to Canada to undergo a refit at Pictou. This was completed on 27 December 1944. After working up she joined escort group EG 27 based out of Halifax. She remained with this group until the end of hostilities in Europe. In June 1945 she was sent to the west coast to undergo a tropicalization refit for possible service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water-cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. However the refit was not completed, being cancelled in August due to the surrender of Japan. Dunver was laid up at Esquimalt, British Columbia until being paid off 23 January 1946. She remained there until 1948 when she was sold to Wagner Stein & Greene to be stripped. The remaining hulk was then sent to Royston, British Columbia to be used as part of the breakwater. References ;Notes ;Footnotes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

The style is Hijazi script. The codex Parisino-petropolitanus is one of the very oldest extant manuscripts of the Quran, dated to the 10th or 11th century. The largest part of the fragmentary manuscript are held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, as BnF Arabe 328(ab), with 70 folia. Another 46 folia are kept in the National Library of Russia in Saint-Petersburg. Two additional folia have been preserved, one kept in the Vatican Library (Vat. Ar. 1605/1) and the other in the Khalili Collections in London (KFQ 60). The manuscript BnF Arabe 328 consists of six parts, labelled a-f. Of these, parts (a) and (b) were later recognized as having formed part of a single original manuscript. *BnF Arabe 328(a), 56 leaves (foll. 1-56), with additional leaves held by the Vatican Library, the Khalili Collections and the National Library of Russia. This portion accounts for about 26% of the text of the Quran. *BnF Arabe 328(b), 14 leaves (foll. 57-70).

The manuscript Arabe 328(ab) is fragmentary. Originally it contained an estimated 210 to 220 leaves, of which 118 are extant (70 in Paris, 46 in Saint-Petersburg, and one each in Rome and London). The preserved text spans Quran 2:275 to Q72:2, with lacunae in between. Overall, it contains about 45% of the Quranic text. It was produced by five scribes, probably working concurrently in order to meet demand for a fast production. All of the hands use the Hijazi script. François Déroche says that the production of codex Parisino-petropolitanus could be dated as far back as the late 7th century CE (third quarter of the 1st century AH). David S. Powers agrees with this early date. Others agree with a date in the early 8th century CE, which Déroche also advocated in some of his earlier work. Still some suggest significantly later dates. Déroche writes of many mere orthographic differences between the text of the codex Parisino-petropolitanus and the standard text of today. Overall, the contents of the text are not hugely different from those of today's Quran. Orthography does not explain all of the differences, however. Some remaining differences can be explained as copyist mistakes. A few others are substantive variants according to Déroche, including some non-canonical variants. Powers says that some of these substantive variants show that the text of the Quran remained \\"fluid\\" and open to change until the end of the 7th century. History The manuscript had been stored with other Quranic manuscripts in the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Fustat, Egypt. During the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt in 1798/99, French Arabist Jean-Joseph Marcel (1776-1856) acquired a first lot of folios. A few more pages were bought by Jean-Louis Asselin de Cherville (1772-1822) when served as vice-consul in Cairo some years later. Cherville's collection of Arabic manuscripts were sold to the Bibliothèque nationale after his death in 1822. The portion bought by Jean-Joseph Marcel was sold by his heiress to the Russian government and in 1864 became part of the collection of the Public Imperial Library (now National Library of Russia) in Saint-Petersburg. Besides the portions bought by Marcel and de Cherville, two additional folia reached Europe separately, one is now in the Vatican Library (Vat. Ar. 1605/1) and the other in the Khalili Collection in London (KFQ 60). Deroche (2009:171) In the 1983 catalogue of the BnF, foll. 1-56 were described as a separate entity, Arabe 328(a), from foll. 57-70, Arabe 328(b). It was only later realised that the two parts once formed part of the same manuscript.

It runs through the state's high desert country from the town of Burns to the unincorporated community of Fields. It was designated as an Oregon Scenic Byway in 2003. The highway is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). There are a number of points of interest along the route including several that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Route description  Starting from Burns, travel east on Oregon Route 78 for . At the junction with Oregon Route 205, turn south onto the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway. Travel south across the Harney Basin to reach the Narrows interpretive site near the bridge between Malheur and Harney lakes. Continue south on Route 205 through the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge extends from just south of the Narrows to the small unincorporated community of Frenchglen, Oregon. The Diamond Loop Tour Route turnoff is north of Frenchglen. The main byway route continues south, arriving at Frenchglen, south of Burns. The Steens Loop Tour Route begins at Frenchglen. In addition, the P Ranch Historic District is located approximately east of the community center. From Frenchglen, the Discovery byway heads west and then southwest over a low pass into the Catlow Valley, west of Steens Mountain. Shortly after entering the valley, there is a turnoff for the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge to the west. However, the Discovery byway continues to follow Route 205. It passes by the Roaring Springs Ranch, running parallel with Catlow Rim just east of the highway. After following the rim for approximately , the byway turns southeast and begins to claim over Steens Mountain. On its last leg, the byway passes over Long Hollow Summit and descends into the Pueblo Valley. The High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway ends at the small unincorporated community of Fields. The entire scenic byway trip covers . = Alternate tour routes = The Diamond Loop Tour Route and the Steens Loop Tour Route are side trips from the main byway. The Diamond Loop Tour Route begins north of Frenchglen, heading east from the main byway. It is a loop. The tour route offers the opportunity to see interesting geologic formations including the Diamond Craters volcanic area and the historic Pete French Round Barn. The Peter French barn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also a modern visitor center located at the barn site. The Steens Loop Tour Route begins at Frenchglen. It is a loop that climbs to the top of Steens Mountain and then descends, re-connects with the main byway south of Frenchglen. From the East Rim Overlook, travelers can see the Alvord Desert below. The route passes Kiger Gorge Overlook, a viewpoint above a deep U-shaped glacier cut valley. The route passes several other viewpoints along the crest of Steen Mountain as well. The tour provides an opportunity to spot Bighorn sheep on the mountain’s rocky cliffs. The Steen Mountain loop road is closed during the winter months. = Points of interest = The goal of the Oregon state byway program is to preserve the state's most outstanding scenic highway corridors. It is also designed to provide interesting tourist opportunities for the traveling public. Oregon byways highlight the scenic, historic, recreational, and cultural features found along the routes. All of Oregon’s byways must met road standards that accommodate most travelers and are maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation. thumbThere are a number of interesting sights and places along the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway route. These include: * Harney Basin * Wright Point * Narrows interpretive site * Buena Vista Station * Malheur National Wildlife Refuge * Diamond Loop Tour Route * Frenchglen Hotel (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) * P Ranch Historic District (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) * Steen Mountain Tour Route * Catlow Valley * Roaring Springs Ranch * Catlow Rim * Long Hollow Summit Viewpoint In addition to the fixed points of interest, the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway provides the opportunity to spot high desert wildlife along the route. A number of large mammal species inhabit the area along the byway and can sometime be seen from the roadway. These include pronghorn, mule deer, elk, and wild horses. Hawks and Golden eagles can be seen along the byway route as well. Sandhill cranes, Canada geese, tundra swans, and many species of ducks and shorebirds are common along the Malheur refuge section of the byway. = Byway highlights = File:Wright's Point near Burns, Oregon.jpgWright's Point File:Buena Vista Overlook, Jeff Sorn (5352564568).jpgBuena Vista File:Frenchglen Hotel (Harney County, Oregon scenic images) (harDA0011).jpgFrenchglen Hotel File:Catlow Rim, Harney County, Oregon.jpgCatlow Rim File:Pronghorn in Catlow Valley, Oregon.jpgCatlow area pronghorn  History  In 1991, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act established the National Scenic Byways Program. Congress put the Federal Highway Administration in charge of managing the program. The program is intends to promote economic development and tourism by protecting scenic highway routes, often in less-traveled areas of the country. To be designated as a scenic byway, the road must have unique natural, archaeological, cultural, historic, scenic, or recreational value. In the early 1990s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management proposed a scenic byway between New Princeton and Lakeview. The proposed route ran through Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, and Warner Wetlands. The plan included the construction of three visitor centers along the route plus 24 interpretive waysides. However, a national byway was never established. In 2003, the state of Oregon designated a portion of Oregon Route 205 as the High Desert Discovery Scenic Byway. It was a shorter route than the one proposed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management, and did not include any visitor centers along the way. In addition to the main byway, the state also approved the Diamond Loop and Steens Loop scenic tour routes that year.

Diversity of tactics may promote nonviolent tactics, or armed resistance, or a range of methods in between, depending on the level of repression the political movement is facing. It sometimes claims to advocate for \\"forms of resistance that maximize respect for life\\".\\"Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (updated at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)\\"  Development of concept  The first clear articulation of diversity of tactics appears to have emerged from Malcolm X and other radical leaders in the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s. Shortly after Malcolm announced his departure from the Nation of Islam, he gave a speech entitled \\"The Black Revolution\\" where he promoted solidarity between those who practiced armed resistance against racism, and those who practiced nonviolence. He stated: ::Our people have made the mistake of confusing the methods with the objectives. As long as we agree on objectives, we should never fall out with each other just because we believe in different methods or tactics or strategy to reach a common goal.Malcolm X Speaks, George Breitman, ed. (Grove Press, 1994 edition), 46-49. In March 1964, Gloria Richardson, leader of the Cambridge Maryland chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), took Malcolm X up on his offer to join forces with civil rights organizations. Richardson (who'd recently been honored on stage at the March on Washington) told The Baltimore Afro-American that \\"Malcolm is being very practical…The federal government has moved into conflict situations only when matters approach the level of insurrection. Self-defense may force Washington to intervene sooner.\\"\\"Mrs. Richardson OKs Malcolm X\\", The Baltimore Afro-American, March 10, 1964. In the same year, Howard Zinn (then on SNCC’s Board of Advisers) published his essay \\"The Limits of Nonviolence,\\" in the influential civil rights journal Freedomways. In the article, the historian concluded that nonviolent direct action would not be sufficient to break Jim Crow in the South.Howard Zinn “The Limits of Nonviolence”, Freedomways, 1st quarter, 1964. In his 1965 book, SNCC: The New Abolitionists, Zinn explained the philosophy that dominated the movement: ::The members of SNCC—and indeed the whole civil rights movement—have faced in action that dilemma which confounds man in society: that he cannot always have both peace and justice. To insist on perfect tranquility with an absolute rejection of violence may mean surrendering the right to change an unjust social order. On the other hand, to seek justice at any cost may result in bloodshed so great that its evil overshadows everything else and splatters the goal beyond recognition. The problem is to weigh carefully the alternatives, so as to achieve the maximum of social progress with a minimum of pain. Society has been guilty of much quick and careless weighing in the past…on the other hand, it has permitted the most monstrous injustices which it might have eliminated with a bit of trouble.Howard Zinn, SNCC: The New Abolitionists (South End Press, 2002 edition), p. 223. = Zinn's Disobedience and Democracy = In 1968, Zinn elaborated further on tactical diversity with his book Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order. The text was published in response to liberal Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, who'd recently written (in his book Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience) that he supported Gandhian forms of direct action, but not tactics that involved resisting arrest; Fortas also rejected campaigns involving the strategic violation of normally just laws, or the destruction of another party’s property, or the injury to an oppressive party, including in direct self- defense (All of these tactics were becoming widespread in the Civil Rights Movement, Black Power movement and in the campaign against the Vietnam War). Zinn produced an extended rebuttal to Fortas’ position; Regarding resisting arrest and judgment, Zinn countered that Gandhi had accepted the bad influence of Plato, who in his Crito dialogue, portrayed Socrates as cheerfully accepting his death sentence on the grounds that the citizen is obligated to abide by the final decision of the government, which is like a master to the people. Zinn points out that these are \\"the arguments of the Legalist, of the statist, not the libertarian,\\" and notes that Plato disdained democracy. In the face of Plato’s concern that sustained defiance of the law could topple the foundations of government, Zinn argues: \\"When unjust decisions become the rule, then the government and its officials should be toppled.\\" On the breaking of normally just laws and conventions for the purpose of protest, Zinn notes that some of society’s worst problems—\\"like hunger, or poor housing, or lack of medical care\\"—are not the result of discrete laws, but of system-wide conditions; therefore targets cannot always be precise: \\"Our most deep-rooted troubles are not represented by specific laws, but are so woven into the American society that the only way to get at them is to attack the fabric at any vulnerable point.\\"Howard Zinn, Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order (South End Press edition, 2002), pp. 5-6, 28-30, 37. Zinn rejects the liberal’s \\"easy and righteous dismissal of violence,\\" noting that Henry Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of John Brown. Zinn acknowledges that \\"nonviolence is more desirable than violence as a means\\" but also posits that: ::…in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a nonviolent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and nonviolence does not suffice as a guide...the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change. In particular, Zinn rejects moralizing over property destruction as historically ignorant and ethically shortsighted. He contends that in response to the massive violence of the state, the smashing of windows is a mercifully restrained disruption: ::The degree of disorder in civil disobedience should not be weighed against a false ‘peace’ presumed to exist in the status quo, but against the real disorder and violence that are part of daily life, overtly expressed internationally in wars, but hidden locally under that facade of ‘order’ which obscures the injustice of contemporary society. Zinn then addresses the claim that violence does irreparable harm to a movement’s cause, countering that history repeatedly shows both the limitations of nonviolence and the efficacy of combative means: \\"Not until Negro demonstrations resulted in violence did the national government begin to work seriously on civil rights,\\" the historian notes, using the Birmingham riot of 1963 as an example. Peaceful methods \\"were enough to raise the issue, but not to resolve it.\\" At the same time, Zinn proposes \\"a moral code on violence in civil disobedience,\\" which would \\"consider whether the disorder or violence is controlled or indiscriminate…\\" This would engender a partially violent, yet predominantly non-lethal insurrection, which would be preferable to the alternative of a fully militarized, bloody civil war. Ultimately, Zinn comes down squarely for diversity of tactics: ::Each situation in the world is unique and requires unique combinations of tactics…all the vast range of possible tactics beyond strict nonviolence.*Zinn, Disobedience, pp. 39-41, 121-122, 51-61, 47, 52.

When the anti-nuclear power movement made progress after the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island, a rigorously nonviolent strategy—promoted by Bill Moyer and the Movement for a New Society, and embodied in the Clamshell Alliance—was often credited for the advance, and these methods came to dominate the social justice community.Julie Cristol and T. L. Hill, \\"Review of Oppose and Propose! by Andrew Cornell\\", Theory in Action, Vol. 4, No. 4, October 2011.Chris Rossdale, “Review of Oppose and Propose: Lessons from a Movement for a New Society”, Peacenews, May 2012.

These currents largely constrained disruptive protest until the 1999 demonstrations against the World Trade Organization. In an unprecedented success for post-Vietnam era civil disobedience, the WTO Ministerial Conference opening ceremonies were shut down completely, host city Seattle declared a state of emergency for nearly a week, multilateral trade negotiations between the wealthy and developing nations collapsed, and all of this was done without fatalities. This occurred in the midst of mass rioting which had been set off by militant anarchists (some of them in a black bloc formation), nonviolent civil disobedience organized by various NGOs (including Public Citizen and Global Exchange) and the Seattle Direct Action Network (DAN), and a mass permitted march organized by the AFL-CIO.\\"Day 2- November 30, 1999\\", WTO History Project, University of Washington.“Seattle Declares Civil Emergency”, BBC News, December 1, 1999.John Vidal, \\"The real battle of Seattle\\", The Guardian, December 5, 1999. In the lead up to the shutdown, local group Seattle Anarchist Response (SAR) had circulated Ward Churchill’s text Pacifism as Pathology freely among protesters. SAR actively promoted diversity of tactics among the rank-and-file of DAN and criticized NGO hegemony of the protests. They often found an enthusiastic response.Seattle Anarchist Response Bulletin, November 15, 1999. One DAN organizer told The Seattle Weekly that \\"I'm emerging with a less strong opinion of what is right and wrong, and using different tactics so long as they're used well. That's not where I was a year ago.\\" The call for the Seattle protest had originally come from Peoples Global Action (a network co-founded by the Zapatistas) which supported diversity of tactics and a highly flexible definition of nonviolence.Geov Parrish, \\"Beyond Gandhi\\", The Seattle Weekly, November 17, 1999. In the aftermath of the shutdown, however, various NGO spokespeople associated with Seattle DAN claimed that the riotous aspect of the WTO protests was counterproductive and undemocratic. They also asserted that it was only an insignificantly small group from Eugene, Oregon that engaged in property destruction. Medea Benjamin told The New York Times that \\"These anarchists should have been arrested,\\"Alexander Cockburn and our readers, “WTO: Workers of the World United?” The Nation, February 14, 2000.Timothy Egan, “Black masks lead to pointed fingers in Seattle”, The New York Times, December 2, 1999. while Lori Wallach of Public Citizen stated that she had instructed Teamsters to assault black bloc participants.\\"Lori’s War\\" , Foreign Policy, Spring 2000, p. 49. In response five academics including Christian Parenti, Robin Hahnel, and Ward Churchill signed an open letter denouncing the \\"tide of reaction\\" that the NGO sector was organizing against militant protesters. \\"Those who belittle and distance themselves from the actions of ‘the Anarchists from Eugene’ have either ignored or simply did not realize the level of contributions anarchists—black-clad and otherwise—made towards bringing the November 30th Festival of Resistance into reality.\\" They also asserted that the established left, by advocating violence against certain protesters in order to protect corporate property, was fostering \\"an uncritical acceptance of the dominant value system of American consumer society: private property has a higher value than life.\\" Daniel Burton-Rose, Ward Churchill, Robin Hahnel, Kent Jewell, George Katsiaficis, Christian Parenti, and Robert Perkinson, “WTO Protester Organizers: Don’t Throw the Radicals Overboard”, December 2, 1999. In her own response to the controversy, Barbara Ehrenreich decried the NGO leaders as \\"hypocrites,\\" and wrote that nonviolent activists ought to be \\"treating the young rock-throwers like sisters and brothers in the struggle.\\" She also criticized the dominant nonviolent paradigm as \\"absurdly ritualized,\\" as well as elitist for presuming to reject any protester who hadn't gone through nonviolence training \\"for hours or even days.\\" Ehrenreich concluded: \\"The people at Direct Action Network, Global Exchange, and other groups were smart enough to comprehend the workings of the WTO, IMF, and World Bank. Now it's time for them to figure out how large numbers of people can protest the international capitalist cabal without getting clobbered—or trashed by their fellow demonstrators—in the process.\\"Barbara Ehrenreich, \\"Anarkids and Hyprocrites\\", The Progressive, June 2000. The solution to Ehrenreich’s impasse was the growing acceptance of diversity of tactics in the anti-globalization movement.Janet Conway, \\"Civil Resistance and the Diversity of Tactics in the Anti-Globalization Movement: Problems of Violence, Silence, and Solidarity in Activist Politics\\", Osgoode Hall Law Journal, Vol. 41, Number 2/3 (Summer/Fall 2003). The first major indication was in April 2000, when the NGO coalition involved in demonstrations against the World Bank in Washington DC resisted calls by the media to denounce protesters who did not practice strict nonviolence. Spokesperson Nadine Bloch told the press that: \\"What there was among the protesters [in Seattle] was alternative tactics. Property destruction is something done to things, not to people. I don‘t think that property destruction in the context of [this Washington protest] would be something very constructive. But when we look at what happened in Seattle, we have to say that all of that contributed to the media coverage we got, including those who you might say pushed the envelope.\\"Marc Cooper, \\"After Seattle\\", LA Weekly, March 22, 2000. In the lead up to the protests for the 2001 Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) summit in Quebec City, a major direct action organization known as SalAMI suffered a mass defection due to its intolerance of diversity of tactics. Numerous participants (including Jaggi Singh) criticized SalAMI for its \\"dogmatism on nonviolence\\" as well as perceived hierarchies within the organization. Out of this schism emerged le Convergence des luttes Anti-Capitalistes (CLAC). CLAC's \\"Basis of Unity\\" stated: \\"Respecting a diversity of tactics, the CLAC supports the use of a variety of creative initiatives, ranging from popular education to direct action.\\" The anti-FTAA demonstrations were massive, involving sixty thousand people at its peak, and received largely positive media coverage, even as they included widespread clashes with police and destruction of government property. Cindy Milstein observed that CLACs success in Quebec City sprang from using a broad repertoire that encompassed community organizing, international outreach and forceful confrontationCindy Milstein, \\"Something Did Start in Quebec City: North America’s Revolutionary Anti-Capitalist Movement\\", Institute for Social Ecology, June 13, 2001. (CLAC continue to be active in Quebec to this day, and composed part of the radical flank of the successful tuition-freeze protests of 2012).Jonathan Montpetit and Peter Rakobowchuk, \\"Quebec Student Protest: Montreal Formula One Grand Prix Braces For Disruption\\", Huffington Post Canada, June 7, 2012.Brian Daly, \\"Suspicious packages target Quebec politicians, Quebecor Media\\", Toronto Sun, June 6, 2012. Peoples Global Action solidified its support for diversity of tactics at this time by dropping the word \\"non-violent\\" from its hallmark on civil disobedience. They explained that: ::The problem with the old formulation was first that the word \\"non-violence\\" has very different meanings in India (where it means respect for life) and in the West (where it means also respect for private property). This basic misunderstanding has proved quite impossible to correct in media—or indeed in the movement itself. The North American movement felt that the term could be understood to not allow for a diversity of tactics or even contribute to the criminalisation of part of the movement. The Latin American organisations had also objected to the term in their regional conference, saying that a \\"call to civil disobedience \\" was clear enough, whereas \\" non-violence \\" seemed to imply a rejection of huge parts of the history of resistance of these peoples and was as such badly taken by large parts of the movement… ::In fact, there was always an understanding in PGA that non-violence has to be understood as a guiding principle or ideal which must always be understood relative to the particular political and cultural situation. Actions which are perfectly legitimate in one context can be unnecessarily violent (contributing to brutalise social relations) in another. And vice versa. Precisely to make this clear, the Zapatista army (EZLN) was invited to be among the first generation of convenors. The wording finally found seemed to respect this fundamental stance, since it explicitly advocates MAXIMISING respect for life.“Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (amended at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)”. Teamsters Local 574 battle police in the Minneapolis General Strike of 1934 = Recent scholarship = In recent years, numerous academics have addressed diversity of tactics. Eminent sociologist Francis Fox Piven, in analyzing strategies of disruptive protest, wrote that: ::Protest movements may or may not engage in violence against property or persons. Students of American social movements have been very timid about this issue. They tend to ignore episodes of violence that do occur, excluding them by fiat from their definition of social movements. I suspect that they are influenced by their sympathy for…the much-proclaimed \\"nonviolence\\" of the civil rights movement… Just as nonviolence can be strategic, so can violence be used strategically, and often defensively to permit the disruptive action, the withdrawal of cooperation, to continue.Francis Fox Piven, Challenging Authority: How Ordinary People Change America (Rowman & Littlefield, 2006), pp. 23-25. Piven’s findings affirm that of other social movement scholars, such as William Gamson and Pamela Oliver. Oliver wrote that, \\"Today’s young people are generally taught a celebratory history of the civil rights movement…Our young are rarely taught about the riots, and even many academic sources on the Black movement ignore or downplay the riots. It seems as if those who are old enough to remember the riots are trying to forget them.\\"Pamela E. Oliver-“Political Repression and Crime Control”, Mobilization 13(1): 1-24. Within the sociology field itself, however, positive results from the \\"radical flank effect\\" are widely acknowledged. The radical flank effect was first named by Herbert H. Haines in his book Black Radicalism and the Civil Rights Mainstream, where he states that \\"the turmoil which the militants created was indispensable to black progress and indeed, black radicalization had the net effect of enhancing the bargaining position of mainstream civil rights groups and hastening many of their goals…[this finding] has implications for any social movement which is composed of moderate and radical factions…\\"Herbert H. Haines, Black Radicals and the Civil Rights Mainstream, 1954-1970 (University of Tennessee Press, January 1, 1995), 2. In recent years, academic historians have become more forthright about the role of force in the civil rights movement. Scholars such as Charles M. Payne, Akinyele Umoja, and Timothy Tyson explicated on the utility of militant activity (ranging from armed deterrence to mass rioting) in ending formal segregation in the United States. In his book I’ve Got the Light of Freedom, Payne reflected on the way in which black militancy co- existed with nonviolent ideals: ::At one level, there is something inconsistent about Medgar Evers contemplating guerilla warfare against whites in the Delta and simultaneously believing that he can talk to [whites] long enough to be able to change them. The inconsistency is only apparent, a function of the breadth of social vision some Southern blacks developed. They could, like Malcolm X, contemplate the broadest range of oppositional tactics, but like MLK, they never lost a larger sense of common humanity.Charles M. Payne, I’ve Got the Light of Freedom:The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle (University of California Press, 1995), pp. 313–314. Historian Robin Kelley has written that \\"armed self-defense actually saved lives, reduced terrorist attacks on African American communities, and laid the foundation for unparalleled community solidarity.\\"“We Will Shoot Back – Reviews” , NYU Press website. Although this scholarship has been highly acclaimed, virtually none of its findings have been used in the popular depictions of the movement thus far.Emilye J. Crosby, \\"‘This Nonviolent Stuff Aint No Good. It’ll Get You Killed.’: Teaching About Self-Defense in the African-American Freedom Struggle\\" , in Teaching the American Civil Rights Movement, Julie Buckner Armstrong et al, eds. (Routledge, 2002). = Recent writing = In the influential anti-capitalist text The Coming Insurrection, the authors prescribe an armed resistance that nonetheless avoids militarization: \\"Weapons are necessary: it’s a question of doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary…the prospect of Iraq-style urban guerilla warfare, dragging on with no possibility of taking the offensive, is more to be feared than to be desired. The militarization of civil war is the defeat of insurrection.\\" Numerous commentators consider the Ferguson and Baltimore rioting associated with the Black Lives Matter movement to have been productive forms of protest.Jeffrey Q. McCune Jr. \\"A Revolt Against Violence\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August 12, 2014.George Ciccariello-Maher, \\"Riots work: Wolf Blitzer and the Washington Post completely missed the real lesson from Baltimore\\", Salon.com, May 15, 2015.

Successful examples  = Suffragettes = The woman’s rights movement in Britain became increasingly militant in the years leading up to the passage of suffrage. The primary instigator of this tendency was Emmeline Pankhurst. Pankhurst’s organization, the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), began disrupting political meetings and practicing nonviolent civil disobedience in 1904. The mainstream media made a distinction between the legalist suffragists and the law-breaking \\"suffragettes\\"; Pankhurst and her followers nonetheless accepted the latter label.Kira Cochrane, “Nine Inspiring Lessons the Suffragettes Can Teach Feminists Today”, The Guardian, May 29, 2013. Beginning in 1908, WSPU engaged in violent protests: smashing windows, fighting police officers, and eventually committing non-lethal bombings.“Suffragettes-Winifred Mayo: A Smashing Time in Pall Mall”, BBC Archives.\\"MRS. PANKHURST FOR MORE VIOLENCE; Tells a Meeting of Suffragettes to 'Smash Everything,' but to Respect Human Life\\", The New York Times, October 18, 1912. Pankhurst famously said that a \\"broken pane of glass is the most valuable argument in modern politics,\\" and considered suffragette struggle a form of \\"civil war.\\"Laurie Penny “The Power of the Broken Window Pane at Millbank”, The New Statesman, November 14, 2010.Emmeline Pankhurst, “Freedom or Death- Hartford, Connecticut on November 13 1913”, The Guardian, April 27, 2007. When imprisoned, suffragettes often engaged in hunger-strikes, and were the first high-profile group to systematically engage in this tactic, preceding Mohandas Gandhi by a decade.“Hunger Strikes: What Can They Achieve?” BBC News, August 16, 2011. Historian Trevor Lloyd wrote that \\"by [1913] the suffragettes were no longer looking for opportunities for martyrdom. They wanted to fight against society.\\"Trevor Lloyd, Suffragettes International: The Worldwide Campaign for Women’s Rights (American Heritage Press, 1971), 89. These activities drove away some of their sympathizers, but Pankhurst was unwavering, stating that: ::…if you really want to get anything done, it is not so much a matter of whether you alienate sympathy; sympathy is a very unsatisfactory thing if it is not practical sympathy. It does not matter to the practical suffragist whether she alienates sympathy that was never of any use to her. What she wants is to get something practical done, and whether it is done out of sympathy or whether it is done out of fear…doesn't particularly matter so long as you get it. We had enough of sympathy for fifty years; it never brought us anything, and we would rather have an angry man going to the government and saying, my business is interfered with and I won't submit to its being interfered with any longer because you won't give women the vote, than to have a gentleman come onto our platforms year in and year out and talk about his ardent sympathy with woman’s suffrage.Pankhurst, “Freedom or Death- Hartford, Connecticut on November 13 1913”. American feminist Alice Paul began her activism with WSPU in Britain and participated in destructive protests there, breaking over forty windows by her own account.“Alice Paul Biography-Militant Suffragettes” Alice Paul Institute Returning to the US, Paul began introducing some suffragette tactics to the feminist movement in her home country. Paul’s organization, the National Women’s Party, was predominantly nonviolent in its activities, but Paul worked in close solidarity with Emmeline Pankhurst until the passage of suffrage, and hosted appearances by Pankhurst in the US on multiple occasions.“Detailed Chronology of National Women’s Party”, Library of Congress. In 1912, Harriot Stanton Blanch changed the name of her organization from the Equality League to the Women’s Political Union in order to demonstrate solidarity with the now-violent WSPU.Ellen Carroll Dubois, Harriot Stanton Blanch and the Winning of Women’s Suffrage (Yale University Press, 1997), pp. 119-120, 138-140. In the months prior to the Nineteenth Amendment’s passage, American suffragists experimented with more militant tactics, breaking a window in a struggle with a police officer in October 1918,Katherine H. Adams, Michael L. Keene, Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign (University of Illinois Press, 2008), p. 33. and burning the president in effigy in front of the White House in February 1919. In May 1919, President Wilson called a special session of Congress for the suffrage amendment. It passed both houses the following month.Library of Congress chronology. = Civil rights movement = The civil rights movement was not consistently nonviolent in a Gandhian sense; even during the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955–1956, most activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., kept arms in their homes. Under the influence of pacifists Bayard Rustin and Glen Smiley, a stricter code of nonviolence took hold in the late 1950s.Clayborne Carson, “The Unexpected Emergence of Martin Luther King Jr”, Martin Luther King Jr Research and Education Institute website. The period of 1957–1959 was a nadir for the movement: fewer schools were desegregated in the three years following the bus boycott than in the three years prior, and black voter registration and bus desegregation remained stagnant. Activism fell to one of its lowest points of the post-war era, as most African-Americans in the South were terrorized into submission by the Ku Klux Klan.Michael J. Klarman, “How Brown Changed Race Relations: The Backlash Thesis”, The Journal of American History, Vol. 81, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 89-91.William H. Chafe, The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II (Oxford University Press, 2003), 152–154. In 1959, Robert F. Williams, president of the Monroe, North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, made national headlines when he told the press that his chapter was armed and prepared to \\"meet violence with violence.\\"Timothy B. Tyson, “Robert Franklin Williams: A Warrior For Freedom, 1925-1996” , Investigating U.S. History (City University of New York). North Carolina activists had been having successful armed stand-offs against the Klan for several months beforehand, including a Native American action at \\"The Battle of Hayes Pond.\\"Nicholas Graham, \\"January 1958: The Lumbees face the Klan\\", This Month in North Carolina History. Williams was suspended for his militancy by NAACP chairman Roy Wilkins, but his policy became nationally popular among the rank-and-file, and the NAACP delegate assembly passed a resolution stating that \\"We do not deny, but reaffirm the right of individual and collective self-defense against unlawful assaults.\\" Williams continued to promote armed resistance with his publication The Crusader and eventually resumed leadership of the Monroe NAACP chapter.Timothy B. Tyson, Radio Free Dixie: Robert F. Williams and the Roots of “Black Power” (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 159–164. The national student sit-in movement began with the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina several months later. Although initiated as a nonviolent campaign which would not respond to white violence, in some locations, including Portsmouth Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee, blacks forcefully defended themselves against assaults.Clayborne Carson, In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s (Harvard University Press, 1981), 11. Robert F. Williams led a successful sit-in campaign in Monroe where, he reported, no racists dared to attack his group because it was well- known his use of nonviolence was strictly conditional.Timothy B. Tyson, “Robert F. Williams, ‘Black Power,’ and the Roots of the African American Freedom Struggle”, Journal of American History 85, No. 2 (September 1998): 540–570. In Jacksonville, Florida, the local NAACP made preparations to defend nonviolent activists by enlisting a local street gang to respond to any attacks.Rodney L. Hurst, “It Was Never About a Hot Dog and a Coke”, Civil Rights Movement Veterans website. This led to a citywide clash covered nationally as \\"Axe-handle Saturday\\" where dozens of blacks and whites were injured in August 1960. Lunch counters were desegregated in Jacksonville and many other sites of protest in the following months.“Axe-handle Saturday”, Jacksonville.com (The Florida Times-Union), August 24, 2010. Doug McAdam cited \\"Axe-handle Saturday\\" as an example of the specter of violent crisis that loomed over lunch counter sit-ins generally, finding that the threat of escalating chaos pressured authorities to make concessions.Doug McAdam, \\"Tactical Innovation and the Pace of Insurgency\\" , American Sociological Review, 1983, Vol. 48. The Freedom Rides of 1961 were originally conceived as a Gandhian campaign. After four months without a decision on desegregated busing from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), James Forman, Executive Secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led a delegation of nonviolent picketers to Monroe to work with Robert F. Williams.Timothy Tyson, “Robert F. Williams”, Journal of American History. (Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama, had already benefitted from the protection of an armed group led by Colonel Stone Johnson).“Get on the Bus: Freedom Riders of 1961”, NPR Books [excerpt of Raymond Arsenault’s Freedom Riders.] The Monroe Freedom Riders were brutally assaulted while picketing city hall, but were rescued by Williams and his group, who proceeded to exchange gunfire with white supremacist civilians and police. Numerous Freedom Riders have expressed gratitude to Williams for saving their lives that day.Kwame Toure and Michael Thelwell, Ready for Revolution: The Life and Struggles of Stokely Carmichael (Scribner, 2005), 225–226.Negroes With Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power (film), 2004. The ICC decided in the Freedom Riders’ favor less than one month after the Monroe conflict. In 1962, Freedom Rider John Lowry publicly praised Williams and proclaimed that nonviolent action could not be successful without a \\"threat of violence.\\"\\"Lowry sees ‘threat of violence’ necessary to fight segregation”, The Harvard Crimson, February 13, 1962. Other civil rights figures who praised Robert F. William’s contribution to the movement included Rosa Parks, Julian Bond,http://history.msu.edu/files/2010/04/Timothy-Tyson.pdf Howard Zinn,http://www.akpress.org/robertfwilliamscd.html Stanley Levison,Craig S.

Background  According to the Tang Zhiyan (唐摭言, \\"selected words from Tang\\"), written by Wang Dingbao, Wang was born in 870, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang.Tang Zhiyan (唐摭言), vol. 3. His family was from Nanchang. He passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class in 900, during the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Zhaozong. At some point, he married the daughter of the poet and official Wu Rong (吳融).Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 62. At one point, Wang travelled to the modern Hunan region, but was not treated with respect by the warlord who then ruled the area, Ma Yin the military governor (Jiedushi) of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan). He apparently then travelled further south, to Rong District (容管, headquartered in modern Yulin, Guangxi), and he became a surveyor for Rong District's government. At that time, there was great disturbance in the Central Plains region (which would eventually see Tang's fall and its succession by Later Liang, the first of the Five Dynasties), and Wang was unable to, after his term of service, return to the Central Plains. At that time, the warlord who ruled the Lingnan region, Liu Yin (Southern Han) the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (清海, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), was recruiting members of the intelligentsia to serve on his staff, and at Liu's invitation, Wang went to serve on his staff. (Even though Wang never returned to the Central Plains, his wife Lady Wu remained faithful to him and never remarried.)  Service under Liu Yan  Liu Yin died in 911, and was succeeded by his brother Liu Yan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Wang Dingbao apparently continued to serve on Liu Yan's staff. In or shortly before 917, Liu Yan was considering declaring himself emperor of an independent state (rather than continuing to be Later Liang's vassal), but he was concerned that Wang might publicly oppose the move, and so he sent Wang on a diplomatic mission to Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). While Wang was away, on that mission, Liu Yan declared himself emperor of a new state of Yue (not long later changed to Han, and therefore historically known as Southern Han).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. Upon Wang's return to Southern Han's capital Xingwang (興王), Wang realized the reason he was sent away, but Liu Yan nevertheless treated him with respect, sending the official Ni Shu to meet him outside the city first to welcome him back and to report to him on how Liu Yan had taken the throne. Wang commented: \\"The establishment of a state should be done with propriety. When I entered the south gate [of Liu's palace, apparently converted from Qinghai headquarters], the beam still read, 'Qinghai Circuit.' How would that not be laughable?\\" Upon hearing Wang's comment, Liu himself laughed and responded, \\"I had long been concerned about Wang Dingbao, but I did not think of this. I deserve the scorn.\\" Early in Liu's Dayou era (928-942), Wang was made the military governor of Ningyuan Circuit (寧遠, i.e., the former Rong District, now converted into a circuit). Around the new year 941, after the death of the chancellor Zhao Sun, Liu recalled him from Ningyuan to serve as chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事) as well as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng)). However, it was said that he died less than a year after becoming chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Wang was an accomplished writer. When Liu built a magnificent southern palace, Wang wrote a poem praising the seven particular beautiful portions of the palace, and those who read it were all impressed by the language. He also wrote the 15-volume work Tang Zhiyan, dealing with Tang's imperial examinations and anecdotes about the examinees.

Ewing's shooter on the original Dallas series) that was directed by Michael Pressman and premiered on NBC December 8, 1985. Final Jeopardy was produced by Frank von Zerneck's film production company and distributed by Warner Bros. Plot Marty (Thomas) and Susan (Crosby) Campbell are a small town couple visiting a large, somewhat unfriendly, declining northern city. They accidentally get lost and stranded in a deserted, rundown neighborhood after dark when Marty gets the wrong address for meeting a business client and are both left behind by a cab that drops Susan off after dark from shopping and whose taxi business requires callers to have business names and phone numbers before sending any cabs after dark. The parking lot that their rental car is in is locked between 7:00 P.M. until 6:00 A.M., leaving them unable to retrieve it before then as they didn't come back until after 7:00 P.M.'s closing time. After Marty barely escapes getting hit by a newspaper delivery truck, they both find a nearly deserted apartment building but no phone to use. Marty and Susan go back to the locked parking lot to try to get their rental car to drive back to their hotel. When Marty climbs the fence, two Dobermans attack him and he drops the car keys and barely escapes with his life. Marty calls the police from an outdated payphone that still requires coins to obtain a dial tone for emergency calls to try to get help but is told that since he trespassed on the locked parking lot, he can't file a complaint. Susan wanders away and is seen by a gang in a neighboring alley and runs back to Marty, who the police hung up on. They're chased through another alley and barely escape again. Marty finds another payphone that also needs coins for emergency calls and tries to get help again, but the gang leader catches him, forcing the usually non-violent Marty to fight back and he and Susan barely escape again. They hide in an abandoned theatre but flee when they find a corpse. Then they find a man and try to offer him money to drive them to their hotel, but the man is scared off. Next, they find an unstable derelict (Jeff Corey) who sends Marty on a wild sewer chase to a non existent police station. Marty and Susan leave the derelict and wander down another rundown, empty street, where Marty breaks a store's windows in frustration over the lack of police response, setting off its alarms. They are sent to a subway by an untrustworthy street kid only to find it locked, but also find a burglarized church that was vandalized by the gang and sneak into through its broken door. They find an incapacitated junkie whose also-druggie sister thinks they're inside a hospital and that Marty is a doctor. Another gang member appears, giving the sisters directions to another subway to get home, which Marty and Susan overhear while hiding, meaning that both of these girls are members of this gang. Marty's watch has stopped and they find the subway's revolving gate locked to them but manage to squeeze in just as the gang finds them again and chases them through the subway. Marty drives the E-train while the gang enters the train and pulls the cord to stop it. Marty and Susan abandon the train, Susan is sent to hide while Marty lures the gang into another tunnel, where he knocks a pile of rubble onto three of its members and lures its leader into the boiler room, blinding him with steam and knocking him out with a large wooden board. He goes back above ground and finds Susan telling a policeman (Dennis Farina) about their ordeal, who ironically, says \\"Glad to be of service\\" to a disgusted Marty. They go to their hotel to get cleaned up and change their clothes, return to the parking lot to retrieve their rental car and drive away after paying a $5.00 overnight fee to its attendant that found its keys but has no change if they didn't have the exact amount. The attendant tells them to be more careful next time and Marty and Susan drive off to return the rental car to its agency before going home.

During the troubles in the Low Countries preceding the Flanders Campaign of 1793, Cardon, aged 17 years, went to England, with a letter of introduction to Paul Colnaghi, who gave him employment. He received his early art education at the Royal Academy Schools National Portrait Gallery (UK), Online:https://www.portrait.gov.au/people/anthony-cardon-1772 and studied three years under his friend Luigi Schiavonetti.

This division was unusual in that it was tasked both with the defense, and with the settlement of Hokkaido. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Ōsako participated in the Siege of Port Arthur, under the overall command of General Nogi Maresuke’s Third Army. His forces played a major role in the bloody Battle of 203 Meter Hill, where he also lost his third son. and afterwards fought at the Battle of Mukden. He returned to Japan in March 1906, was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 2nd class in April and was promoted to general in May. In September 1907, he was also elevated from baron to viscount (shishaku)『官報』第7272号「授爵敍任及辞令」September 23, 1907. He entered the reserves in April 1909 and retired from service in April 1914. From November 1911, Ōsako replaced Nogi Maresuke as the principal of the Gakushūin Peer’s School, serving until August 1917. On his death in September 1927, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun.

It typically operates on a frequency of 1.6 MHz, which translates to 96,000,000 pulses or 192,000,000 movements per minute. Ultrasound is defined as a series of acoustic pressure waves generated at a frequency beyond human hearing. Background Electric toothbrushes have been used by the public since the early 1950s. Today, they have evolved and based on the speed of their vibration, can be divided into three categories: electric, sonic and ultrasonic. Electric toothbrushes vibrate in either an up/down direction, or in a circular motion, and sometimes in a combination of the two. Typically, the speed of their vibration is measured in movements per minute, where common electric toothbrushes vibrate at a speed of between a few thousand times a minute to approximately 10,000 to 12,000 times per minute. Sonic toothbrushes are called sonic because the speed or frequency of their vibration, as opposed to the sound of the motor, falls within the average range that is used by people in communication. The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from 85 to 180 Hz (10,200 to 21,000 movements per minute), and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255 Hz (19,800 to 30,600 movements per minute).Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org) (pp. 188), .Baken, R. J. (1987). Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice. London: Taylor and Francis Ltd. (pp. 177), . Ultrasonic toothbrushes work by generating an ultrasonic wave usually from an implanted piezo crystal, the frequency of which technically could begin at 20,000 Hz (2,400,000 movements per minute). The most common frequency however, around which many scientific studies have been conducted, is in the area of approximately 1.6 MHz, which translates to 96,000,000 waves or 192,000,000 movements per minute. History The first ultrasonic toothbrush, initially branded Ultima and later Ultrasonex by Sonex Corporation, was first patented in the USA in 1992 by Robert T. Bock,US Patent number US5247716, August 18, 1992, Robert T. Bock the same year the FDA gave it approval for daily home use. Initially, the Ultima worked only on ultrasound. A few years later, a motor was added to the Ultrasonex brush, which provided additional sonic vibration. Sonex was then sold to Salton, Inc., who began distributing the product in the USA and many other countries. In 2008, Salton Corporation’s new owners decide to exit the oral hygiene market and since then, several new companies started selling ultrasonic toothbrushes such as the Ultreo, Megasonex, and Emmi-Dent brands. In addition, in late 2012, Robert T. Bock created a new Ultrasonic toothbrush, the Smilex Ultrasonic Toothbrush using updated technology. Today, most ultrasonic toothbrushes simultaneously work in the ultrasonic mode together with sonic vibration. , the only Ultrasonic toothbrushes being marketed are the brands Emmi-Dent, Megasonex and Smilex. Effectiveness Ultrasound, in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 MHz is used in some therapeutic medical devices to: increase the speed of bone healing; treating aphthous stomatitis, treating gingival bleeding; and plaque removal. Safety of ultrasound Ultrasound has been used in medicine for close to half a century and its safety has been studied for almost the same period of time. In 1992, the US FDA first allowed the use of ultrasound at a frequency of 1.6 MHz in a toothbrush. In 1993, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM), in conjunction with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) developed the Output Display Standard (ODS), including the thermal index and mechanical index which have been incorporated into the FDA’s new regulations. These regulations limit the power output of these devices to a level low enough to avoid raising surrounding tissue temperature by more than 1 °C.American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM).

This species is light brown in colour and may be between 4 and 9 mm long and 3 to 6 mm wide. It has a stumpy tail, and is shaped somewhat like a round shield. The female and male A. japonicus are phenotypically distinct, categorizing them as a dioecious species. Although they are not drastically different, their transparent skin highlights the minor differences such as the different copulatory accessories.  Distribution  Argulus japonicus is native to Asian countries, where it parasitises carp species such as the Carassius auratus (goldfish) and Cyprinus carpio (common carp). This species is highly invasive, and is now found throughout the world, probably via the pet fish trade. Many fish host this louse, which is probably able to parasitize almost every species of freshwater fish.  Pathogenesis  This parasite can severely damage the host's integument and affect its appetite, sometimes killing it. It attaches itself to the gills, fins or skin of the host using its suckers, and then feeds by injecting a toxin into the host which pre- digests the tissue. It then uses its mandibles to draw the food into its mouth.  Life cycle  Argulus japonicus reproduces sexually, with females laying anywhere from 1-9 strings of 5-226 eggs after mating occurs on the host. These eggs are deposited on hard surfaces, then covered by gelatinous excretions from the female. After eggs hatch in about 2 weeks (or longer at lower temperatures), larvae are only able to survive for 1–2 days before requiring nutrition from a host fish. After attachment to a host, larvae will pass through several stages before maturing into adult form.  Treatment  The insecticide Dipterex is able to kill both adult and larval stages of Argulus japonicus; however, eggs are unaffected by this treatment, meaning an initial application of the compound must be repeated after 2 weeks (after which any eggs laid will have hatched) in order to achieve an effective reduction of the parasite.

He was the younger brother of General Ōsako Naoharu.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 272-273. Biography Ōsako was born to a samurai family in Satsuma Domain (present day Kagoshima Prefecture). He joined the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army in April 1871, and joined the 2nd class of the predecessor of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy from December 1875. While still a cadet, he was called to active service to fight against his fellow Satsuma clansmen in the Satsuma Rebellion. In February 1879, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in artillery. From May 1886, he attended the Army Staff College, specializing in artillery. He was sent to Germany for further training from May 1888. After his return to Japan, Ōsako was assigned to the Koishikawa arsenal. He returned to Germany as a military attache, remaining until July 1893. Ōsako was appointed battalion commander in the IJA 1st Field Artillery Regiment in February 1894. With the start of the First Sino-Japanese War, he was assigned to the staff of the Japanese First Army. After the end of the war, from October 1896, he was chief-of-staff of the IJA 5th Infantry Division and was promoted to colonel in October 1897. In December 1898, he became chief-of-staff of the IJA 4th Infantry Division. In June 1901, Ōsako was promoted to major general and commander of the IJA 2nd Field Artillery Brigade. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Ōsako participated in the Siege of Port Arthur. He was appointed chief-of-staff of the Japanese Second Army from September 1904. After the end of the war, Ōsako was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 2nd class, and was reassigned to the Inspectorate General of Military Training from February 1906. He was promoted to lieutenant general in November 1907 and from November 1910 was the commander of the IJA 18th Infantry Division and from December 1912 was commander of the IJA 4th Infantry Division. In May 1914, Ōsako was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. From February 1915, he served on the Supreme War Council and was promoted to general in August 1915. In November 1918, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class. In July 1919, he transferred to the reserves. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.

He was significantly involved with the trade between Britain and Russia, including the importation of grain (generically called \\"corn\\") to England. He also collected, and had others collect on his behalf, plants from locations throughout the world. He was particularly fond of orchids. Cattley was born in Garlickhythe ('garlic dock'), City of London, to a large merchant family. Many of Cattley's factors were members of his extended family, for example his cousin John Prescott headed up the firm's offices in St. Petersburg from which he ran the Russian side of the trade. Prescott was an enthusiastic collector of plants, and forwarded large numbers back to England for Cattley. In 1818 Cattley was unpacking a shipment that he had received from Brazil. Among the various materials he found un-preposessing tendrils which might be an orchid, so he nurtured it back to health and it turned out to be the beautiful orchid, which Lindley named in Cattley's honour as Cattleya labiata (the \\"corsage orchid\\"). The year previously William Swainson had discovered the orchid in the wild in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco and dispatched a specimen along with other plants to Cattley via the Glasgow Botanic Gardens. To help with his collection Cattley had hired John Lindley to draw, describe and catalog the novel plants in his garden at Barnet. Cattley paid for the publication of Linley's monograph on digitalis, Digitalia Monographia, and later for Lindley’s Collectanea Botanica (1821) a catalogue of Cattley’s plant collection. However, after 1821 due to financial reverses, Cattley was no longer able to pay Lindley a salary. William Cattley died at his home, \\"Cattley Close\\", Wood Street, in Barnet on 8 August 1835.

Rapidly amplifying the target RNA/DNA allows a lab to simultaneously detect multiple pathogenic organisms in a single tube. TMA technology allows a clinical laboratory to perform nucleic acid test (NAT) assays for blood screening with fewer steps, less processing time, and faster results. It is used in molecular biology, forensics, and medicine for the rapid identification and diagnosis of pathogenic organisms, In contrast to similar techniques such as polymerase chain reaction and ligase chain reaction, this method involves RNA transcription (via RNA polymerase) and DNA synthesis (via reverse transcriptase) to produce an RNA amplicon (the source or product of amplification) from a target nucleic acid. This technique can be used to target both RNA and DNA. Transcription-mediated amplification has several advantages compared to other amplification methods including: * TMA is isothermal; a water bath or heat block is used instead of a thermal cycler. * TMA produces RNA amplicon rather than DNA amplicon. Since RNA is more labile in a laboratory environment, this reduces the possibility of carry-over contamination. * TMA produces 100–1000 copies per cycle (PCR and LCR exponentially doubles each cycle). This results in a 10 billion fold increase of DNA (or RNA) copies within about 15–30 minutes.

The novel is about Moinette Antoine, a beautiful and self- educated slave of mixed race living in Louisiana in the early to mid-19th century. Moinette narrates her own story from age 14 when she is taken from her mother to the end of her life when she has become a free woman and business owner. The first-person narration is done in a stream of consciousness style that focuses on Moinette's insightful thoughts and impressions of the strange and brutal world around her. Major themes include the legacy of slavery in America, women as property, and mother-daughter relationships. It is the first novel in a set of three companion novels known as the Rio Seco trilogy. The other books in the trilogy are Take One Candle Light a Room (2010) and Between Heaven and Here (2012). The novel was almost universally praised by critics. It was shortlisted for the 2006 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Fiction. Development history The catalyst for the author, Susan Straight, to write A Million Nightingales was a story told to her by an African American neighbor. He told her that the reason why he had moved from Louisiana to Riverside, California (Straight's hometown) in 1953 was to protect his young, beautiful daughter from an older white man who was going \\"to come and get her.\\" For the next 10 years, Straight thought about how her own three daughters – all young, beautiful, and mixed-race – would have fared growing up in a different time.Bates, K. (Interviewer) & Straight, S. (Interviewee). (2006, August 2). Susan Straight: 'A Million Nightingales' [Interview transcript]. Los Angeles: National Public Radio. Retrieved 2014-05-17. \\"I looked at all three of them and thought, 'If they'd been born in 1800 Louisiana, people would have had one thing in mind. One thing,' \\" Straight said. \\"Can you imagine what their lives would have been like, with their looks and their brains?\\"O'Connor, A. (2006, April 17). Can You Imagine? Novelist Susan Straight explores the life her daughters would have led under slavery. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2014-05-17. To research the novel, Straight traveled to Louisiana's rural Plaquemines Parish. She stayed in Woodland Plantation, which used slave labor in the past. \\"It was very creepy,\\" Straight said. \\"I stayed up all night writing. I wrote a lot of the novel by hand. I could see the slave cabin from my window, and the idea that someone could look at that house all the time was amazing.\\" She also read dozens of books about Louisiana, French trappers and explorers, the treatment of slaves, and other documents about the early 1800s. Details she found in court documents were incorporated into Moinette's story.Lythgoe, D. (2006, April 16). 'Million' Author Calls Writers Eavesdroppers. Deseret News. For example, in 2001, she read an account of a woman named Manon, a free woman of color who traded a slave she owned to buy her own son because he could not be legally freed until he was 21 years old. Straight became obsessed with the story, \\"I couldn't show [my daughter] the piece of paper in my desk, the copy of the sale of Manon. I could only write about a woman like her with a child I imagine who looked like mine.\\"Straight, S. (2006 August 4). Writing A Million Nightingales on History. All Things Considered.

The same line is said by the character Mr. Jonah Greene in Chapter 10 when Moinette is planning how to purchase her own son as a slave. The \\"million nightingales\\" of the title is a metaphor for Moinette and the other slaves living in the United States in the early 19th century, of whom there were over a million. =Companion novels= A Million Nightingales is the first novel in a set of three companion novels known as the Rio Seco trilogy.Hua, V.

The other books in the trilogy are Take One Candle Light a Room (2010) and Between Heaven and Here (2012). Even though the last two novels do not take place in the 19th century – they take place in 2005 and 2000, respectively – all three books are connected by place, family, and kinship. Take One Candle Light a Room is about Fantine \\"FX\\" Antoine, a successful travel writer based in Los Angeles, who is the great-great-great granddaughter of Moinette Antoine. When FX's godson, Victor, gets in trouble with the law, FX travels to Louisiana to help him. FX's given name, Fantine, is the same name of Moinette's friend, a fellow slave at the Rosière plantation. The title of the book is from a phrase that Moinette’s mother, Marie-Thérèse, used to describe Moinette. Between Heaven and Here is about the aftermath of Glorette Picard's death. Glorette, a crack-addicted prostitute, was Victor's mother and FX Antoine's childhood friend. Glorette and FX's families are connected by the story that was the catalyst for A Million Nightingales. In the background story of this novel and the previous one, FX's mother and four other girls escaped from rural Louisiana to live in Riverside, California after the local plantation owner raped three of them in 1958. Glorette's mother joined them a few years later. Plot Moinette Antoine is a young slave at Azure, a sugarcane plantation south of New Orleans owned by the Bordelons, where she lives with her mother, Marie-Thérèse, who is the plantation's laundress. Moinette is the housemaid to Céphaline, the teenage daughter of the Bordelons, who is a scholar and a misfit. Moinette surreptitiously teaches herself how to read by listening to Céphaline's lessons and observing her studies. After Céphaline unexpectedly dies, Moinette is sold to Laurent de la Rosière, the owner of another sugarcane plantation. Soon after she arrives at Rosière, Moinette attempts to escape and return to her mother in Azure, but she is quickly captured and returned to Rosière. Moinette becomes the housemaid of Madame Pélagie who is a relative of the Bordelons. Madame Pélagie is another intelligent and free-spirited woman who promises to bring Moinette to New Orleans where they can run a shop together. Moinette becomes pregnant after she is raped by three men, including the Bordelons' son. She gives birth to a boy, Jean-Paul. Before Madame Pélagie can take Moinette to New Orleans, tragedy strikes again, and Moinette is sold to Julien Antoine, a lawyer from Opelousas. In Opelousas, Moinette discovers that Julien Antoine is a kind person who is willing to help her. She pretends to be his mistress while she runs his boardinghouse. She continues her self-education by reading Antoine's legal papers and learning how to write. Eventually, Antoine helps her to purchase her son and become a free woman. However, even when Moinette is free, her life continues to be marked by brutality and tragedy. Style and structure The first-person narration is done in a stream of consciousness style that focuses on Moinette's insightful thoughts and impressions of the strange and brutal world around her. Bambara, French, and Creole words and phrases are used throughout the novel. The novel consists of twelve chapters, a note about the languages of early 19th century Louisiana, and a glossary that consists of the Bambara, French, and Creole words used in the book.

From 1868 to 1869 he fought during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration on the imperial side, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the early Imperial Japanese Army. In December 1875, he was deputy chief-of-staff of the Tokyo Garrison. During the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, he commanded a battalion. He returned to the Tokyo Garrison after the war, serving in various posts, and was promoted to colonel in April 1887. In April 1889, he was appointed commander of the Guard’s Third Infantry Regiment and in June 1890 was commandant of the Army Staff College. In 1892, Ōshima was promoted to major general and was assigned command of the IJA 5th Infantry Brigade. In November 1893, he took over command of the IJA 6th Infantry Brigade, which he led in combat during the First Sino-Japanese War. After the war, Ōshima served as chief-of-staff of the Taiwan Garrison and in August 1895 was elevated to the kazoku peerage with the title of baron (danshaku), and was also awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 3rd class.

Clark Still (born 1946) is an American organic chemist. As a distinguished professor at Columbia University, Clark Still made significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry, particularly in the areas of natural product synthesis, reaction development, conformational analysis, macrocyclic stereocontrol, and computational chemistry. Still and coworkers also developed the purification technique known as flash column chromatography which is widely used for the purification of organic compounds. Major contributions =Total synthesis= Periplanone B In 1979, Still reported the first total synthesis of periplanone B, the potent sex pheromone of the American cockroach. Although the structural connectivity of this compound had been established spectroscopically, Still's synthesis confirmed the relative stereochemical relationships present in this natural product. A key step in this synthesis makes use of an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement to form the macrocyclic 10-membered ring found in periplanone B. In this transformation, the initial tertiary alcohol was treated with potassium hydride and 18-crown-6 at elevated temperature to induce the rearrangement, and the resulting enolate was trapped with chlorotrimethylsilane to form the macrocyclic silyl enol ether as a single diastereomer. This intermediate was then transformed into a key enone substrate over the course of five steps including Rubottom oxidation, TBS protection of the secondary alcohol, and formation of the exocyclic alkene via a selenoxide rearrangements. 650px These transformations set the stage for the introduction of both epoxide groups, which were formed with high levels of diastereoselectivity based on the principles of macrocyclic stereocontrol. The first epoxide was introduced via nucleophilic epoxidation of the enone using potassium hydride and tert- butylhydroperoxide; this led to the formation of a 4:1 mixture of diastereomeric epoxides, favoring the desired isomer in which attack had occurred from the peripheral face of the enone. At this stage, the ketone was transformed into the second epoxide group using the Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky reaction; notably, the product was formed as a single diastereomer, again due to initial peripheral attack of the dimethylsulfonium methylide nucleophile on the ketone. Subsequent removal of the TBS protecting group and Sarett oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohol completed the total synthesis of racemic periplanone B. Monensin In 1980, Still and coworkers reported the total synthesis of monensin, a complex polyether natural product that acts as an ionophore. One of the key steps in this route is the late-stage union of two advanced fragments via an intermolecular aldol reaction. In this reaction, low-temperature deprotonation of the methyl ketone with lithium diisopropylamide formed the kinetic enolate which then underwent transmetalation upon the addition of magnesium bromide. Subsequent addition of the aldehyde component initiated a diastereoselective aldol reaction, forming the desired beta-hydroxyketone in 75% yield as a 3:1 mixture of diastereomers. Notably, this instance of acyclic stereocontrol is consistent with the Cram- Felkin-Anh model for the addition of nucleophiles to an aldehyde bearing an existing stereocenter in the alpha position. 800px Having united these two complex fragments, Still was able to complete the synthesis of monensin in three additional steps. First, hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group afforded the free primary alcohol under standard conditions. Next, cleavage of the triethylsilyl (TES) protecting groups was achieved in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid; the resulting free secondary alcohols then engaged the ketone in a spontaneous cyclization reaction to form the thermodynamic spiroketal linkage. Finally, hydrolysis of the methyl ester under basic conditions furnished the sodium salt of monensin, completing the synthesis of this challenging natural product. =Method development= Wittig-Still rearrangement The 2,3-Wittig rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond forming reaction that transforms an allyl ether into a homoallylic alcohol. However, a significant limitation of this reaction is the difficulty in forming the alkoxy-substituted carbanion which initiates the 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement. Traditionally, this required the use of a strong base and the presence of a stabilizing group to enable deprotonation of the ether substrate. In 1978, Still dramatically increased the scope of the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement by introducing an organotin-substituted ether as a precursor to the alkoxy-substituted carbanion. In this procedure, transmetalation of the organotin group can be achieved chemoselectively at low temperature using n-butyllithium to form an alpha-lithiated ether that undergoes the desired 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement. This variation of the traditional 2,3-Wittig reaction is known as the Wittig-Still rearrangement. 750px An application of the Wittig-Still rearrangement in the context of natural product synthesis can be seen in Still's 1979 formal synthesis of the Cecropia juvenile hormone. The organotin-substituted ether that serves as the substrate for the rearrangement was readily prepared by bis-alkylation of the corresponding diol with iodomethyltributyltin. Treatment of this compound with two equivalents of n-butyllithium at low temperature resulted in transmetalation, initiating a double 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement to give the bis-homoallylic alcohol product in 79% yield. Notably, this rearrangement is highly stereoselective with regard to the geometry of the trisubstituted olefins, giving exclusively the (Z,Z)-isomer shown. 650px Still-Gennari alkenation The Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction is a widely used olefination reaction in which a phosphonate-stabilized carbanion reacts with an aldehyde or ketone to form an alkene. In the standard HWE reaction, the phosphonate ester contains alkoxy substituents (typically methoxy or ethoxy), producing an E-alkene as the major product. In 1983, Still and Gennari reported that simply substituting the more electron-withdrawing 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy groups on the phosphonate component reversed the stereoselectivity to produce predominantly Z-alkenes. The use of a non- coordinating counterion was also found to be critical for high levels of Z-selectivity; this is typically accomplished by using a base with a potassium counterion in the presence of 18-crown-6. Taken together, this protocol is known as the Still-Gennari modification of the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction or, alternatively, as the Still-Gennari olefination. 600px Although the mechanism of this reaction has not been fully elucidated, it is speculated that the use of an electron-deficient phosphonate accelerates elimination of the oxaphosphatane intermediate. This renders the initial addition of the phosphonate-stabilized carbanion to the aldehyde effectively irreversible, leading to Z-selectivity in analogy to the standard Wittig reaction. =Flash column chromatography= In 1978, Still and coworkers published a highly influential paper reporting a purification technique known as flash column chromatography. Prior to this report, column chromatography using silica gel as a stationary phase had already been established as a valuable method for the separation and purification of organic compounds. However, elution of the solvent by gravity alone was often a tedious process, requiring several hours and leading to poor separations due to band broadening via diffusion. Still's innovation was to apply pressure to the top of the column to increase the speed of solvent elution. Not only did this drastically reduce the time required to run the column, but it also allowed for the routine separation of compounds having an Rf difference of 0.10 or greater. After optimizing this procedure, Still compiled a table correlating column diameter, volume of eluant, amount of sample, and typical fraction size, providing a useful guide for application of this technique in the laboratory. Today, flash column chromatography is one of the most important methods for the purification of organic compounds, especially when working on a small scale (< 50 mg) where the techniques of recrystallization and distillation are impractical. Still's paper describing flash column chromatography remains his most highly cited publication and holds the distinction of being one of the most frequently downloaded papers from the Journal of Organic Chemistry, despite being published over 35 years ago. =Computational chemistry and MacroModel= In addition to his contributions to synthetic organic chemistry, Clark Still was an early pioneer in applying computational methods to the study of organic compounds. Conformational analysis was integral to Still's study of macrocyclic stereocontrol, and there was a general need for a fast and reliable computational method for predicting an organic molecule's lowest energy conformation. In order to address the problem, Still and coworkers reported a simple Monte Carlo method for searching conformational space in 1989. In this procedure, the internal coordinates for an organic molecule were varied at random, and the energy of the lowest energy conformation was determined after structure minimization. After each iteration, the minimum energy was compared to the values obtained previously in order to locate the global minimum; Still referred to this overall process as a Monte Carlo multiple-minimum search. In an effort to make molecular modeling more accessible to practicing organic chemists, Still developed the integrated software program MacroModel in 1986 in association with Columbia University. Dr. Wayne Guida, a senior postdoctoral researcher in Still's group at the time, described the development of this software package in the following way: One particularly notable feature of MacroModel was the inclusion of an implicit solvation model known as GB/SA (generalized Born model augmented with the hydrophobic solvent accessible surface area term). The GB/SA model simulated solvent interactions with organic molecules by incorporating a continuous solvent field instead of including explicit individual solvent molecules in the computation. Still disclosed a full description of MacroModel in the Journal of Computation Chemistry in 1990, and the rights to this software were later acquired by Schrodinger, Inc. in 1998.

It excavates and occupies a burrow in soft sediment from which it emerges, mainly at night, to feed on fish and invertebrate prey. Description Squilla empusa grows to a length of about . The head bears stalked compound eyes which can move separately to scan the surroundings. The head and thorax are fused into a cephalothorax which is protected by a shield- like carapace. The thorax has eight segments each bearing a pair of appendages. The front pair are slender and used for grooming whereas the second pair are large, raptorial claws that can slash and spear prey. The third, fourth and fifth pairs each have a flattened terminal segment. They are known as maxillipeds and are used to move food to the mouth. The sixth, seventh and eighth pairs are unspecialised walking legs known as pereiopods. The abdomen has six segments, the front five each having a pair of pleopods (swimming legs). These are biramous (branched) and bear filamentous gills. The sixth segment bears a pair of large uropods which, together with the flexible, six-spiked telson, forms a broad tailfan. Distribution Squilla empusa is reported from the eastern seaboard of the United States with a range extending from Cape Cod to the Gulf of Mexico. It is also reported from Brazil and the Mediterranean Sea. It lives in a U-shaped burrow in soft sediment on the seabed at depths from the intertidal zone down to about 150 m (500 ft). Behaviour The summer burrow of Squilla empusa consists of a tube with typically two openings connected by a horizontal tunnel some below the surface of the sediment. The horizontal section normally has two bends and a diameter of up to , depending on the size of the occupant. In the more northerly parts of its range, this mantis shrimp excavates a vertical burrow in the winter up to deep. At this depth in the sediment, the oxygen content of the water decreases and the temperature rises. This behavioural adaptation may enable Squilla empusa to inhabit locations where the water temperature falls too low in winter for it otherwise to survive. Two main methods of burrowing are employed. A vigorous fanning action of the pleopods causes particles of sediment to become suspended and the current produced pushes the plume backwards past the telson. Using this method, an animal can create a depression as large as itself within two minutes. It then turns round and use its maxillipeds to form a basket with which it carries lumps of sediment away from the excavation. This is a slower process but sustainable for a longer period. Further burrowing creates the typical tunnel with one or more openings, and this is frequently remodelled, often in the course of a few hours. Squilla empusa can dig to a depth of in less than an hour. When the animal is inside the burrow it sometimes uses its maxillipeds to create a current of water flowing through. This species is territorial and will defend its burrow from other mantis shrimps. Squilla empusa is mainly nocturnal and feeds on fish, shrimps, crabs, krill, worms, molluscs and other mantis shrimps. The raptorial claws are unfolded with great rapidity to spear, slash and immobilise the prey, which is brought back inside the burrow when caught.

The work was first published in hardback on October 26, 2004 through Random House and it won the 2004 Bram Stoker Award for Novel. Straub encountered some difficulties while writing In the Night Room and had written several different passages for the work before growing bored with each version before writing it using the same technique he used for its predecessor in which he \\"reached down inside the book and turned it inside out.\\" Synopsis The novel follows Timothy Underhill, an author. He is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of his sister April and Timothy tries to channel his sorrow and frustrations into a new novel he is writing, without much success. This is all made more difficult by Timothy receiving several e-mails from people he knows to be dead, all of whom insist that they have something very important they need to tell him. At the same time Newberry Award-winning author Willy Patrick is afraid for her own sanity, as she believes that her daughter is being held captive in a warehouse - despite knowing that her daughter is already dead. As the story progresses the stories of Willy and Timothy entwine and the two must find a way to discern what is going on and what they can do to prevent any further misfortunes. Themes Of the themes in the work, professor Gary K. Wolfe wrote that Straub used \\"metatextual and metafictional chapters, anagrams, and coded messages\\" to \\"repeatedly create a feeling of revelatory horror, for both Underhill and the reader\\". He also commented on Straub's narrative techniques in In the Night Room and Lost Boys, Lost Girls, which he felt \\"[called] into question the nature of fantasy and the nature of narrative reality and serve as a meditation on the purposes, methods, and limits of fiction as a way to frame experience, particularly when that experience involves extreme or traumatic events.\\" Reception Critical reception for In the Night Room has been mostly positive, and the Washington Post praised it as being \\"a powerful and arresting foray into the dark fantastic\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that the book was \\"more poignant than frightening\\" and that \\"What makes the story so compelling is the mysterious correlation between Underhill's personal demons and the demonic figures and horrendous events he writes about\\". The New York Times wrote a mixed review as they felt that Straub used many genre cliches and that the character of Underhill was occasionally unappealing while venting about his writing process but also felt that his characterization in the earliest chapters of the book was apt.

Due to the resignation of a councillor elected in 2012, Brighton Hill South had two seats for re-election. The first-placed finisher was elected to a regular four-year term and the second-placed finisher was elected to serve until 2016. Another councillor had stood down in Baughurst and Tadley North, and thus a councillor was elected to fill out the 2011-15 term in that seat. The Conservatives had lost their majority on the council in 2013 due to defections, and since then had operated a minority administration. They lost a single seat (Buckskin) to Labour and continued their minority administration. In Basing, a councillor who had been elected as a Conservative in 2010 was re- elected as an independent.  Election Result  The Conservative Party performed best with a third of the vote share, but lost one seat to an independent. Labour retained their position as the largest opposition party, gaining three seats from the Liberal Democrats (Brookvale and Kings Furlong, Brighton Hill North and Brighton Hill South). As such, both the Conservatives and the Labour party won 8 seats in this election, but the Conservatives remained the largest party overall, with 29 seats compared to Labours 17.

It quickly grew to over 20,000 acres, and by May 23 it had burned over 67,000 acres or about 105 square miles. Tustumena Lake acted as a natural barrier keeping the fire from spreading south. A July 10 overflight found no sign of the fire continuing to burn. It had grown to 195,858 acres. As of May 23, 2014 the entire fire was confined to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. On May 24 the fire had expanded to 96,584 acres or about 151 square miles with 20% containment. The fire grew by almost 29 square miles between 5:00 PM and 11:00 PM on the evening of the 23rd. The fire started approximately where the Funny River Horse Trail intersects the Funny River Road on the Kenai Peninsula at about 7:00 PM and was likely human-caused. The fire had consumed 156,041 acres or 243 square miles as of 4:00 PM Alaska Time of May 25. It jumped the Kenai River in the Torpedo Lake area between Sterling and Skilak Lake due to burning embers that had fallen in the Kenai Keys area, but these were quickly extinguished. There were several evacuation orders in effect including areas of Kasilof, Sterling, and Lower Skilak Lake. While fighting the fire, human remains were found that were later identified as James Beaver of Soldotna, Alaska, who had been missing since 2011. This led to an investigation that eventually revealed errors by the Alaska State Troopers in incorrectly identifying human remains of another missing person and releasing them to the wrong family.

While the location of the stadium is yet to be finalized, the team's ownership group led by David Beckham has expressed a desire to build on the Miami waterfront; other locations elsewhere in Miami have been offered as fallbacks. Shortly after the team was announced in March 2014, the group presented a plan to build a 25,000-seat stadium at PortMiami, but opposition from port businesses led to the May 2014 announcement of a second location, on a reclaimed land at Museum Park, with a reduced capacity of 20,000, but that site was also rejected by the city of Miami. The team has announced its intent to build the stadium with mostly private funds. In December 2015, a private site was located, along with a commitment to purchase adjacent land owned by Miami-Dade Sewer, that would not seek public funds or tax breaks. However, that plan was also abandoned after the ownership group announced a desire for a larger site. The latest site is near Miami International Airport and would be part of a multi-use development. Major League Soccer has stated that a league approval of the Miami's expansion bid was conditional on the team securing a downtown stadium site. Location search =PortMiami (2014)= The initial proposal put the stadium at the southwest corner of Dodge Island. On March 25, 2014, Beckham announced plans to build a 25,000-seat stadium at PortMiami, adjacent to American Airlines Arena in the Downtown area of the city. Under the proposal, the stadium would have been located at the southwest corner of Dodge Island and be accessible by a pedestrian bridge from Biscayne Boulevard and the Miami Heat's American Airlines Arena. On April 8, 2014, Miami-Dade commissioners refused to let PortMiami relocate a fuel-spill facility that would have needed to move in order to accommodate the stadium and entertainment complex. The stadium plan called for a commercial complex where the facility is located. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, who had previously proposed developing on the same site, formed the Miami Seaport Alliance (MSA), a coalition of companies and unions based in the port, and led the opposition to the stadium plan. Political strategist Joe Slade White created an advertising campaign for MSA, which later won a national award for best public affairs advertising, claiming that a stadium would worsen traffic problems and interfere with the port's plans to expand and handle increased cargo. Beckham's real estate adviser argued that Royal Caribbean opposed the stadium plan because it paid below-market rates on its lease at the port. Facing political pressure, Beckham's group announced that the PortMiami site had become \\"Plan B\\", and Miami-Dade County commissioners voted 11–1 against building the stadium at PortMiami on May 20, 2014. On February 3, 2015, in a move that was described as symbolic, county commissioners voted unanimously to recommend FIU Stadium as a temporary home for the expansion team. Commissioner Juan C. Zapata, who sponsored the item, said \\"I think we did [Beckham] a big disservice. I know that when I've met with him, I have apologized, because I think we could have treated him better.\\" =Museum Park (2014)= Under the second proposal, the stadium would have been built in Museum Park, with the boat slip adjacent to American Airlines Arena filled in. On May 5, 2014, with the PortMiami proposal facing fierce opposition, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Giménez proposed an alternate location on the waterfront, by filling a boat slip between American Airlines Arena and Museum Park. Giménez wrote in a letter to Beckham's real estate adviser that \\"Downtown Miami would greatly benefit\\" from a waterfront park that included the stadium and pedestrian walkways. The land, owned by the city of Miami, would have had to be sold or conveyed to the county, and Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado said filling the slip \\"would be a monumental task.\\" Giménez and Regaldo discussed filling the slip in December 2013, but said the land was not being considered for a soccer stadium. Following a meeting with Mayors Regalado and Gimenez, Beckham's group announced on May 19, 2014 that the boat slip location had become \\"Plan A\\". The site required approval from the commissioners of the city and county, who both owned parts of the land needed for the stadium, and the city charter required a public vote. According to plans presented by Beckham's group on May 22, 2014, the 20,000-seat stadium would take up of the park, while adding by filling the deep-water basin. The Miami Marlins had considered the boat slip location for its new stadium, but rejected the plan, as it would have cost millions of dollars to pump out water and transport rocks from elsewhere to fill the slip. Critics warned the stadium would put a strain on area roads and pipes and others criticized using a public parkland for a stadium, and residents of nearby condominiums expressed concerns that the stadium may obstruct the ocean view. After the city reported that the two sides were \\"too far apart\\" in negotiations over rent, Mayor Regalado and City Manager Daniel Alfonso turned down the proposal on June 10, 2014 and the proposal was rejected. =Little Havana (2014–15)= Rendering of the proposed site next to Marlins Park MLS president Mark Abbott said in June 2014 that the league was not interested in building in Little Havana next to Marlins Park (although the initial plans included a soccer stadium to be built alongside it, a plan supported by the league in 2008). In February 2015, Miami-Dade County commissioner Xavier Suárez suggested two previously proposed sites – next to Marlins Park and on the Miami River near Miami International Airport. Suárez told the Miami New Times that he had already discussed the latter location with Beckham's advisor and the developer who owns the land, previously a Bertram Yacht boatyard. Suárez said both locations fit a broad interpretation of the league's insistence on a \\"downtown\\" location and the Marlins Park location's \\"taint\\" had faded. On March 4, 2015, Miami-Dade County commissioners passed a resolution calling on Mayor Gimenez to negotiate with Beckham's group over a county-owned parcel of land on the west side of Marlins Park. On July 17, 2015, Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado announced a tentative deal to build the park on city-owned land next to Marlins Park, pending approval from city commissioners. However, in November 2015, Commissioner Francis Suarez said it was taken off the city commission agenda for December 1, 2015, where approval was required to get the stadium on the March 2016 ballot. Suarez cited Beckham's group's inability to secure deals with private landowners. When the team was announced in March 2014, Miami International Airport, Marlins Park and Florida International University were mentioned as alternative sites should downtown stadium plans fall through. Cities in neighboring Broward County were asked in July 2014 to forward a list of possible locations for a stadium and the county previously offered a county-owned site next to the BB&T; Center in Sunrise as a possible site. Before the team was announced, Palm Beach County Sports Commission contacted Beckham's group and proposed FAU Stadium for the team. The ownership group released a statement saying that a downtown Miami site was still preferred, but added, \\"there are other cities that would welcome an MLS club owned by [Beckham] and his partners.\\" In August 2014, Commissioner Don Garber told Alexi Lalas of ESPN that the league \\"will not expand to Miami unless we have a downtown site for the stadium.\\" In May 2015, University of Miami President Donna Shalala met with Beckham and his group to discuss a possible joint stadium for the MLS team and the Miami Hurricanes football team. Shalala said Sun Life Stadium, the existing home stadium with a capacity of over 65,000, was too big for the Hurricanes, but at the same time their target size of around 44,000 seats was too big for MLS. =Overtown (2015–18)= On December 4, 2015, Beckham's group announced it had secured a contract to purchase a privately owned block in Overtown at 650 NW 8th Street near Culmer station, Interstate 95 and Miami River. It also secured a letter of intent from Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez to negotiate the purchase of the block to the south, owned by the county. The Overtown site was the fourth proposed location announced by Beckham since the expansion team was awarded to Miami, but this was the first time the group dropped its attempt to avoid paying property taxes by having the city or county serve as the stadium's landlord. On December 5, the MLS governing board endorsed the location, and on March 24, 2016, it was reported by the Miami Herald that Beckham's group completed the purchase of the privately owned land portion needed for the soccer stadium. On June 6, 2017, the ownership group acquired the of county land required to begin construction. However, after Jorge Mas, who leads the South Miami construction and engineering firm MasTec with his brother Jose, joined Beckham's team, it announced it planned to abandon the Overtown site for a larger development near Miami International Airport. =Freedom Park (2018–)= In July 2018, Beckham and Mas unveiled plans for a 25,000-seat stadium as part of Freedom Park, a mixed-use complex at the site of the city- owned Melreese Country Club near the airport. The development, to be built on of public land, would include of office, retail and commercial space, 750 hotel rooms, of public soccer fields in addition to the stadium, and the remaining would be a public park. The owners would also make annual installments of $20 million for 30 years for improvements to public parks across the city. City commissioners voted to approve a referendum on the November 2018 ballot that would ask if the city should negotiate a no-bid lease with the investors. The measure passed with 60% of the vote, and will next require four out of five votes from city commissioners. Owing to concerns over the plan, the PGA Tour Latinoamérica moved the Shell Championship season- ending event from Melreese to Trump National Doral Miami Golden Palm in October 2018. Beckham announced in June 2019 that Freedom Park has a proposed launch date 2022. This has been approved by the results of a referendum in which 60% of the voters authorized the stadium. Also Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz's decision, preserved the results of a November referendum in which 60% of Miami voters authorized city administrators to negotiate a 99-year lease with the MLS team's ownership to develop Miami Freedom Park. The $1 billion stadium, hotel, office park and commercial campus is to be built on of city-owned land, currently Melreese golf course. The team would also build an adjacent public park. The MLS team, Club Internacional de Fútbol (Inter Miami) would play 17 home games in the 25,000-seat stadium. On August 20, 2019, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez confirmed a recent report that soil contamination at Melreese golf course, the proposed site for the stadium, was far worse than previously thought. According to CBS Miami, \\"...arsenic contamination levels are more than twice what is allowed by law. Barium and lead levels are also too high and there is debris in the soil that could cause physical hazards.\\" Transportation The Freedom Park site is located near Miami International Airport and the adjoining Miami Intermodal Center, a rail and bus transfer station. It is served by Metrorail trains to Downtown Miami, Tri-Rail commuter rail to the northern suburbs, and Amtrak intercity trains. The intermodal center is located on the north side of the canal that separates the stadium site from the airport.

The pilot revolves around the eponymous character, Kitty Bobo (Dante Basco), as he tries to prove his coolness to his friends. The premise is roughly based on Dunn's life as a Korean adoptee; the main character had previously been featured in a comic strip by Dunn titled Kimchi Girl. The pilot aired in August 17, 2001, on the network as part of their Big Pick competition, a marathon of ten pilots with viewers selecting one to be produced for the network's fall 2002 season. The series lost second place to Codename: Kids Next Door. Synopsis The pilot episode within A Kitty Bobo Show is \\"Cellphones\\". Kitty Bobo is seen riding the subway to Pochee's Diner, where his friends, Paul Dog, Maggie and Monkey Carl, are waiting for him. Paul is wondering if anybody heard from Kitty Bobo, since he was late. He shows up at the window, with his new cell phone, and talks to someone, to make his friends jealous. He hangs up and greets his friends. His friends are wondering when he got the cell phone. He told them he just got it. As his friends looked at it, he snatched out of Maggie's paw, still boasting about his new cell phone, and showing his ringtone, which was \\"The Kitty Bobo Kool Kustom Ringer Song\\", to everybody. Maggie doesn't care, and says that cell phones are so old, and everyone has one. Paul corrects her, and replies, \\"Everyone, except us.\\". Later, Maggie wants everybody to go to the movies with her. Paul and Monkey Carl can't. She is angry, and Kitty Bobo is still on his phone. She tells them that they are leaving, and he just tells them \\"goodbye\\" and reminds them of his cell phone. Maggie, still angry, grabs Kitty Bobo, and drags him into the movie theater, reminding him, that the movie would start soon. While they are at the movies, his mother finds that he has a cell phone, but his father didn't know that. Maggie gets excited for the movie, which is Blood Sucking Babies, as she has been waiting all summer for it. Kitty Bobo's cell phone rings in the theater, and his father calls. Maggie, angry with Kitty Bobo, tells him to turn off the phone, and is wondering what is wrong with him since they are in the theater. He shows her that he could put it on vibrate mode. Since, he puts it in his shirt pocket, during the movie, it vibrates a lot, and he shakes a lot. His phone got out of his pocket, since Maggie slaps him. He runs to the front of the theater to get it, and he answers his father, in front of the screen. Everybody gets angry and throws food at him, and he is kicked out of the theater. That night, Kitty Bobo meets up with Paul, again. Kitty Bobo tries to prove that he is cooler than Garfitti, since he has a phone. So, he calls Paul through the payphone and tells Garfitti, that's his honey. When he thinks Garfitti walked away, he tells Paul that the plan worked, even though Garfitti hears them, and hits Paul away from the phone and calls Paul \\"Honey.\\" He gets on Paul's payphone, and talks to Kitty Bobo, telling that he is there with his Honey. He also tells Kitty Bobo, that he will never be cool, even if he has a cell phone. He wants to try it on Coco, but Paul thinks that this is stupid, so they don't do it. The next morning, he is on his bike. He calls Maggie and tells her that he is downtown, with his cell phone. Maggie tells him to give it a rest, with his cell phone. She also tells him that she has a busy morning, and she will see him later. He tries to call Paul, but he is heading out the door. He said he will see him at Pochee's, later that day. He knows that he can \\"Instant Message\\" his cell phone, so he contacts Monkey Carl. He asks Kitty Bobo if he is at the library, and he tells him what he is doing. Of course, he thinks Kitty Bobo is crazy! He tells him, that he is just being cool, but since isn't looking, he ends up in a construction site, and crashes his bike through the wall. He screams in horror, when his cell phone is broken. He goes to Pochee's Diner and tells them the bad news. He then realizes that his friends, and almost everybody, but him has a cell phone. The story ends up with him, screaming in horror, again, as the camera zooms out to show everybody with cell phones. Characters * Kitty Bobo (voiced by Dante Basco) – A 19–21-year-old brown cat, who is the main character, Kitty Bobo is always trying to be fashionable, act cool before others, and become popular. Nevertheless, his awkward attempts to do so and his lack of consciousness of the world around him, constantly bring embarrassment to him and his friends, mostly for Maggie who considers Kitty Bobo's clueless personality a real nuisance. Despite being a cat, Kitty Bobo was raised by a couple of dogs \\"Mr. and Mrs. Bobo\\" whom he has a typical parents-child relationship. * Maggie (voiced by Lela Lee) – A 19–21-year-old pink cat, who is one of Kitty Bobo's best and closest friends. Maggie is down- to-earth, moody, mature, hard to impress and somehow apathetic. Maggie is constantly annoyed by Kitty Bobo's awkward attempts to become cool and acts as the voice of reason in most of the cases. Nevertheless, despite Kitty's immaturity, Maggie might be somehow interested in kitty Bobo, as Paul suggested by saying \\"You two have a good time\\", before She and kitty Bobo entered in a cinema alone. Maggie works in an office company, she loves horror movies and is a fan of punctuality. * Paul Dog (voiced by Chris Williams) – A 19–21 year old dog, who is one of Kitty Bobo's best and closest friends. Paul is laid back, easy going, he likes to stay in his comfort zone and cares little for what others think of him. Just as Maggie, he is irritated by Kitty Bobo's awkwardness, but in contrast to Maggie he is willing to help Kitty Bobo in his plans to impress others. * Monkey Carl (voiced by Nick Jameson) – A 19–21-year-old monkey, who is one of Kitty Bobo's best and closest friends. Carl is lethargic, dispassionate, and the quietest of the group, but is constantly surprised by Kitty Bobo's lack of judgment. He likes computers and staying at home, he also has a very curious accent. Production Concept art by Meaghan Dunn, featuring the main characters (see image details for character identification). The pilot was created by Kevin Kaliher and Meaghan Dunn; both were married as well as Korean adoptees. Dunn, an adoptee of American-Jewish parents, based the main character on her life experiences as an immigrant. In years prior to making the pilot, she had started a nonprofit organization for helping adopted children locate their biological parents. The character of Kitty Bobo had also been featured a comic strip by Dunn titled Kimchi Girl, which had been published in Korean Quarterly since its inception in 1997. Kaliher felt much of the impetus for the pilot came while searching for his birth family in Korea. However, Dunn later remarked that the pilot \\"had nothing to do with\\" her life. The pilot was optioned by The Walt Disney Company before being turned down. Cartoon Network first approached Dunn in Los Angeles, then a comic shop employee who had just moved in. The network, impressed by her work in independent comics, which had spread through word of mouth, landed her a job at Cartoon Network Studios, and a few years later, she and Kaliher produced the pilot. Broadcast and reception A Kitty Bobo Show aired on August 17, 2001, on Cartoon Network as part of their Big Pick competition, a marathon of ten pilots with viewers selecting one to be produced for the network's fall 2002 season. More than 200,000 votes were cast during the marathon, with 50,000 more being entered online. The pilot earned second place, losing to the pilot episode of Codename: Kids Next Door. Editors of KoreAm reported that Korean-American adoptees would be able to see a reflection of themselves in the pilot. In a retrospective review of the show, Amid Amidi of the animation entertainment blog Cartoon Brew wrote that, relative to pilots produced by the network, Kitty Bobo had \\"some potential\\". He regarded its color styling and \\"appealing design\\" to be most memorable, while recalling it to have \\"decent storytelling\\" as well. Also writing retrospectively, Adam Finley of AOL TV, stated that, while \\"not side-splitting by any means,\\" the pilot contained a few comedic elements. He praised the art style, contrasting it from other Cartoon Network programming. He ultimately opined that the short did not deserve to win, but that it would provide \\"a little more variety in style\\" for the network. Legacy A storyboard for the second episode had been fully produced and completed in 2002, and it was ordered by Cartoon Network itself; in its plot Kitty Bobo is kicked out of his home and moves in with Monkey Carl (he proves to be a poor guest). Had the series been picked up, A Kitty Bobo Show would be the first to have a woman as a creator (before Julie McNally Cahill as co-creator of My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Rebecca Sugar as sole creator of Steven Universe and Julia Pott as the creator of Summer Camp Island). Dunn divorced Kaliher in 2005 and moved to the East Coast along with her daughter to work as creative director for a 3D pharmaceutical studio in Baltimore. In fall of 2005, Kaliher pitched to Walt Disney Television Animation a pilot's revised version, with the characters a bit younger. Kaliher released a 50-page bible in 2006, exploring the Kitty Bobo universe in more depth. Dunn returned in August 2010 to her hometown of Bucks County, Pennsylvania to start her own animation and graphic-design company named Dunnamic. Following a stream of strictly commercial work, she created an idea for another animated series titled Chloe and the Stars. Dunn kept files from her work at Cartoon Network on a hard drive, which needed to be repaired before they could be retrieved. With her company no longer a startup, she and her employees developed the final designs for the characters of Chloe and the Stars and storyboarded its pilot. Upon receiving an animatic of the pilot, Frederator Studios agreed to donate and promote the series on Kickstarter. As a perk for donating $75 or more to the series, backers would have receive the storyboard for the second episode of Kitty Bobo. It was later promoted as a \\"Staff Pick\\" on the website. Unfortunately it only made $11,623 out of its $35,000 goal. Dunn moved the project to Indiegogo but it made even less money than on Kickstarter since it made $831 out of its $10,000 goal.

Martin gets arrested for stealing from a Hindu temple, while his accomplice Geevarghese (Sudhi Koppa) escapes. He is sent to Viyyoor Central Jail near Viyyoor and meets 6 other people who had been arrested in: Narayankutty (Neeraj Madhav), an electronic shop owner arrested for giving a hidden camera in a soap box to 2 people, who used them in a hotel bathroom; Nobelettan (Nedumudi Venu), a chit fund company owner cheated by Pius Matthew (Joy Mathew) and his younger brother, Christo (Irshad), which cost his son's life ; Shabbab (Asif Ali) who beats up his visa provider who had busted him in a jail at Dubai for 10 months; Vasu aka Leaf Vasu (Sudheer Karamana), the former right-hand man of Pius, after a crowbar fell on his head he suffered a mental disorder; Salam (Salam Bukhari), a circus performer arrested for beating up an irritating spectator; and Krishnanunni (Prithviraj Sukumaran), a bank employee, whose wife Sarah (Reenu Mathews) was killed in a car accident after she was harassed by Pius, who had abused her after she got cheated. After they were released, the seven of them planned to steal money from a safe in the charity hospital where Pius and his brothers had kept their money. After they were released, they sought the help of Annamma (Sanusha), Nobelettan's daughter and a nurse at Pius' hospital, for installing spy cameras which was made by Narayankutty there. After finding the exact location of the safe, Krishnanunni found out that the safe can be only unlocked with 3 keys through the safe blueprint, each of them with Pius, Christo and Franko (Mukundhan). For that, the gang planned of making a duplicate of those 3 keys by imprinting the keys onto a soap piece. They found out that Christo had kept his key in a glass cabinet, Pius carried the key on a chain, and Franko had it in his car. After successfully distracting them and getting the key imprints, Krishnanunni planned to do the heist during a festival. That night, he told Leaf Vasu to put fireworks in the sewage tank of the charity hospital, which gave them access to the back of the hospital. He told Annamma to cut off the main supply so that they could get access to the room where the safe is, through the exhaust fan. After successfully getting to the room, they unlocked the safe. What they didn't know was the safe was connected to an alarm, which alerted the three of them. They chased the sewage trucks where they had put the money, but failing. The gang meet up on the side of the road, but Krishnanunni is missing. It is revealed that Krishnanunni had went off with the money. The story comes back to the present, where Martin was explaining his story to the priest. He explained that the gang had searched for Krishnanunni, but they were surprised to see another person with the same name (Indrajith). After some days, each of them from the gang got a box with solar panels on the top. When they opened it, they found the money given as a share by Krishnanunni for the heist, later crying in joy. Then it is revealed that the Krishnanunni who helped them in the heist was actually a con-man. Then he was shown working on a new heist disguised as a business man dealing solar panels.

Thomas Professor of Chinese Literature at Harvard University. A Sinologist, he specialised in pre-20th- century vernacular fiction.Obituary Obituary Memorial.com Career Hanan was born in Morrinsville, New Zealand and raised on a farm in the Waikato where his father retired from a career in dentistry. Hanan studied English at Auckland University before going to England, where he enrolled to study Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies at University of London, taking his undergraduate degree in 1953 and beginning his teaching career there. He spent the academic year 1957–58 in Beijing. Soon after completing his doctoral work and receiving his doctoral degree in 1961, he was recruited to teach on a temporary basis at Stanford University in 1961, then a regular position there in 1963. In 1968, he moved to Harvard, where he taught until his retirement at age 70 in 1997. He was chair of the department of East Asian Languages and Director of the Harvard-Yenching Library, among other services. Research topic From 1950 to 1953, he studied at the University of London, received a bachelor's degree, and, after graduating, admitted to the University of London's Asian-African college. He taught students, and at the same time writing doctoral dissertation. He chose the title of \\" Records of the Grand Historian(Shiji)\\" in the beginning, wanted to study this historical masterpiece from the literary viewpoint. But his supervisor, Simon, reckoned that there are too many people studying this book, suggesting that he study \\"Jin Ping Mei\\", then a Professor of the college, Arther Waley, a famous translator, also thought that \\"Jin Ping Mei \\"is worth studying. He was also interested in the novel, so he chose this subject as his doctoral dissertation. Research about \\"Jin Ping Mei \\"is Patrick Hanan first involved in a sinology research field. He chose \\" Jin Ping Mei \\" to do doctoral dissertation, and finally formed three series of papers which has been formally published. The most famous one is the article he published in the Asian Journal in 1962, \\"The text of the Chin Ping mei\\". This article explores the major editions of Jin Ping Mei, the similarities, differences and their relationship between different versions. Hanan also makes a detailed outline of the relationship between the original and the complement of the book by examining the meaning of the text. The value of this article cannot be ignored. The development of Chinese fiction in the 19th and early 20th centuries was one of his most important concerns. The 19th century has often been considered as a relatively stagnant period when compared to the efflorescence of the 17th and 18th century for Chinese fiction. The development of Chinese fiction in this period got much less attention from literary critics for its lack of innovation and creativity. However, in the monograph \\"Chinese fiction of the Nineteenth and early twenties centuries\\", Patrick Hanan proves that this view is misguided by presenting to readers eleven detailed and insightful critical essays. He indicated that Chinese novelists came into much more frequent contact with western fictions and fictional methods in the 19th and early 20th centuries so that the literary works was actually experiencing constant evolution. He was interested in examining writings in this period from an integrated approach of combining Chinese classical literary tradition as well as the western narratological techniques. He was also concerned that how did western missionaries in Chinese society adapt their religious writing to the taste of Chinese reader in this period. Reactions to his work A state-of-the-field article written by Robert Hegel, of Washington University in 1994 grouped Hanan with scholars who combine Eastern and Western critical approaches, both close reading of texts typical of Western schools and intense scrutiny of Chinese pingdian, or commentator/ editors. Hanan's first book-length monograph, The Chinese Short Story. Studies in Dating, Authorship, and Composition (1973) was a \\"pioneering effort to utilize stylistic analysis to group huaben stories of Yuan and Ming periods that exhibit similar characteristics.\\" Hanan was careful to accommodate evidence from more conventional analysis, the reviewer continued, with the result that \\"his classification scheme is extremely useful in general despite the reservations some have concerning specific details.\\" David Roy, University of Chicago, wrote of Hanan's \\"amazing erudition and fecundity ... one of those rare scholars of whom it may be said that his work has permanently altered the landscape of the field.\\"Journal of Asian Studies 40.4 (August 1981): 764-65 Robert Hegel reviewed Hanan's collection of essays, Chinese Fiction of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries, in the sinologolical journal T'oung Pao, and said \\"Any scholarly writing by Patrick Hanan ... is to be welcomed; regardless of topic, it is sure to be worth our careful consideration. This essay collection marks yet another direction taken in his four-decade long career of distinguished publications, and it is as important as his previous writings.Robert Hegel \\"Review\\", Bulletin of the Academia Sinica 24 As an exceptional translator, Hanan was especially good at identifying Chinese novels deserving translation into English, ones that would make valuable contributions towards the understanding of Chinese society. His translation of Li Yu's The Carnal Prayer Mat (1990) is considered to \\"has caught the author's sardonic tone, the tongue-in-cheek apology for outlandish ideas and practices, and the uproarious or deadpan humor of both speeches and narration.\\" In his A Tower for the Summer Heat (1998), he translated six out of twelve stories from Li Yu's Shi'er lou. This translation is known as \\"highly accurate and very nice stylistically--a truly masterful combination.\\"McMahon, Keith. Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR) 21 (1999): 173-75. His last translation published before his death was Mirage (2016), an anonymous novel about the lives of Guangdong merchants who traded with the West. Posthumously in 2017, his translation of Luo Guanzhong's The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt was published under the title Quelling the Demons’ Revolt.

Chapter two and three discusses the division of Chinese vernacular tales from the early period to the middle period. The following six chapters are specific case study with detailed analysis of the writing of novelist during the late Ming and Qing era, such as Feng Menglong, Langxian, Ling Mengchu, Li Yu, and Aina. 3\\\\.

The later novel is written as the response to the former one. Both of these two novels could be traced to the origin of a tragic ancient Chinese myth, that the daughter of the Fiery Emperor takes the rebirth as a bird after drowns in the Eastern Sea. 5\\\\.

The book was first published on October 1, 2013 through Penguin India and is Saikia's second novel, following his 2007 book Jet City Woman and is his third published book. Synopsis Bok, a guitar player with a Shillong band, has a lot on his mind. His elder brother Kitdor has lost 50 lakh rupees on a trip to Nagaland to purchase arms for a group of militants. Kitdor is given a week to repay the money, and the only person he can turn to is his laid-back younger brother. Bok is helpless until a chance encounter with a beautiful woman provides him with a desperate solution. But fate can’t be cheated and soon the hapless musician is tangled in her web of lies. He must outmaneuver her and the trail of politicians, militants and cops she leaves in her wake, and find the 50 lakhs in time if he is to save his brother. Dark, atmospheric and utterly gripping, The Girl from Nongrim Hills is a superb thriller and a great Shillong novel. Development Saikia came up with the idea for The Girl from Nongrim Hills after coming up with the idea of \\"money changing hands in a hotel room in Shillong\\" and came up with two of the book's characters shortly afterwards. He chose to include elements such as extortion, arms smuggling, and kidnapping as they were \\"only too common in the Northeast\\" and believed that it would \\"provide the basis for a good noir story\\". He chose to set the story in Shillong as he was familiar with the area and saw that several scenes in the book would work well with the city. He based the characters of Bok and Kitdor on several Shillong boys he knew and took Bok's enjoyment of 80s music from Saikia's own enjoyment of the music from that era. It took Saikia ten months to write The Girl from Nongrim Hills and he found the editing and resolution of the novel to be the most challenging aspects of its writing. Reception Critical reception The Girl from Nongrim Hills has been mostly positive. IBNLive noted that while the book did have one inaccuracy, they found the book hard to put down and enjoyed Saikia's writing overall. The New Indian Express and Deccan Herald also gave positive reviews for The Girl from Nongrim Hills, and both papers praised the book for its characters and pacing.

It usurped both Libble Rabble and Toy Pop (the latter of which was released earlier in 1986) as the company's most powerful 8-bit arcade games, was the first game from them to use an analogue (360-degree) joystick, and a 3-D sequel named 3-D Thunder Ceptor II (also known as just Thunder Ceptor II) was released towards the end of the year. In 2011, Namco retconned both games in their \\"U.G.S.F\\" universe. Gameplay and development The player blasting away at enemies in the game's first level. The player must take control of the eponymous Thunder Ceptor, a hyper-way fighter ship developed by the Federal Troops, which is equipped with a rapid-fire zapper cannon, and rocket artillery napalm bombs – it can possess up to five of these bombs at a time, and they will be replenished at the end of each command. It also has a radar (which is displayed in the centre of the screen), and its progress (\\"WAY\\") is displayed up at the top of the screen, along with its energy (\\"POWER\\") and its bomb (\\"ARMS\\"). Its condition is also displayed in the top-left corner of the screen (usually with an image of its blueprints), but shall change to say \\"CAUTION\\" or \\"ENERGY EMPTY\\" when a formation attack is heading towards it (much like the Condition Indicator in Namco's own Bosconian) or it is reduced to four bars of power. Thunder Ceptor was Namco's answer to Space Harrier, a similar arcade game published by rival Sega in 1985. It was one of Namco's most-powerful arcade games, posing custom DAC chips and a 12.2 MHz 68000 processor, the same one used in consoles like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The graphics were designed by Shigeki Toyama, an artist known for his work on games such as Xevious, Point Blank, and Galaxian3: Project Dragoon. Toyama made the graphics through a then-new pixel art program on a consumer-grade computer, which was written in BASIC. He also designed the arcade cabinet, which was a sit-down with a yoke controller and an accelerator pad. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). The game was published in July 1986. Reception The arcade trade publication Game Machine listed Thunder Ceptor as being the fourth most popular arcade game of August 1986. Retrospectively in 2013, Corwin Brence of Hardcore Gaming 101 described its gameplay as a combination of Xevious and Pole Position, and said it made for a unique 3D shooting game. While he said the gameplay wasn't anything amazing, Brence commended the game for its hardware capabilities, commenting on its 3D perspective, custom chips, and multitude of on-screen sprites with little slowdown. Brence expressed disappointment that the game was never included on any Namco video game collections or received any contemporary home releases, writing that: \\"Namco has also not bothered to include Thunder Ceptor on any of its Namco Museum series, deciding to focus instead on their pre-1985 hits like Pac-Man. Thunder Ceptor would remain lost for the years to come, except to a curious few with an emulator and an Internet connection.\\" Retro Gamer, who compared it to Space Harrier and Star Wars, argued that the game had little to offer that made it stand out from other 3D shooters. They complained that the graphics looked rushed and blocky, but that the 3D perspective was unique and done well. Ultimately, they stated that Thunder Ceptor wasn't as refined as Sega and Atari's games, and recommended that readers play those instead.

From 2004 to 2011, a group of Georgian and German scientists carried out large-scale investigations and dated the site to the early 3rd millennium BC or to the second half of the 4th millennium, suggesting that Sakdrisi might be one of the world's oldest known gold mines. In 2013, the government of Georgia deprived the site of a cultural monument status, which had been conferred on it in 2006, and gave permission to the mining company RMG to extract gold in the wider area where Sakdrisi is located, sparking protests from academics and preservationists. RMG launched its works until December 2014, leading to more protests from the political opposition parties and preservationists. It was also condemned by the Georgian Orthodox Church and disapproved by President Giorgi Margvelashvili, but defended by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili. On 25 December 2014, the Parliament of Georgia approved a proposal to establish an ad hoc investigative parliamentary commission to probe into the developments around Sakdrisi, but, on 4 March 2015, the ruling Georgian Dream coalition blocked the probe by refusing to vote for a composition of the commission.

It was built in 1639 by Fr. Alonso Rodriguez to replace a temporary structure built in 1611. The church is home to Our Lady of Caysasay whose feast day is celebrated every December 8. The Shrine Interior of the Shrine The church was first built around 1611 by the Chinese and was made of light materials. This shrine was located near the river where image was usually found, An arch made of coral stone with a bass relief of the Virgin of Caysasay was built later on. On February 24, 1620, Augustinians issued an order to construct a church in Caysasay, as a visita of Taal. It has been verified through serious investigation that the Most Holy Virgin has appeared there and that it be given with the title Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia. In 1639, a new church made out of coral stone was built under the direction of Fr. Alonso Rodriguez, minister of Taal. The church was to serve as the perpetual shrine of the Virgin and to replace the temporary structure set up in 1611. The Sanctuary measures long and wide. Behind the main altar lies the sacristy and a stairwell that leads to the room of the Virgin where devotees could venerate. Adjacent to the church is a convent made of hew stone said to have been built also by Chinese workers. The roof of the church was partly destroyed in 1754 by the boulders and ashes from the Taal Volcano was quickly repaired and serve as the temporary church of Taal, while the latter was under repair. During the earthquake of December 24, 1852, the walls of the church cracked and the towers fell. Fr. Celestino Mayordomo improvised a large makeshift shelter at the town plaza where the image of the Virgin of Caysasay was enshrined temporarily. Fr, Mayordomo also started the reconstruction work which was completed in 1856. The twin towers rose again, the interior was newly painted and the stone fence was completed. The image was again solemnly enthroned in her home Sanctuary. The sanctuary was damaged again by tremors in 1867. Fr. Marcos Anton repaired the minor damages, installed a new altar and a presbytery floor and constructed an iron balustrade around it. The interior was decorated under the direction of Italian decorator Cesar Alberoni. In 1880, Fr. Agapito Aparicio installed an organ bought from the famous organist Don Doroteo Otorelin of Palencia, Spain. Fortunately, the earthquake of 1880 did not cause serious damage to the sanctuary. The church has been renovated ever since, A coat of stucco cement was applied to the front wall and o the towers. The stone and brick wall was scrape clean to reveal it original color. The former convent was converted on May 20, 1962 into an orphanage called Children's Home managed by the Sister Oblates of the Holy Spirit upon the request of Cardinal Rufino Santos. San Lorenzo Ruiz Steps San Lorenzo Ruiz Steps The Hagdan-hagdan is a 125 granite steps from the Caysasay Church which leads up to the center of town. Originally, the steps were made of adobe stone, but these were later replaced with granite or batong song-song in the year 1850 by Fr. Celestino Mayordomo. It is now dedicated to the memory of San Lorenzo Ruiz. Sta. Lucia Wells Sta. Lucia Wells The spring-fed well was where two women saw the reflection of the Virgin of Caysasay, is now known as the Miraculous Well of Sta. Lucia. Since its discovery, many have attested that the spring water has miraculous healing and therapeutic powers. The spot where the well which reflected the image of Our Lady is marked by a coral stone arch with a bas relief image of the Virgin on its façade. It was built in early 1600. The site of the wells is known as \`Banal na Pook' (sacred site) and vestiges of the spring running close to the wells is known as \`Banal na Tubig' (sacred water). The well is accessed from the San Lorenzo Luis Steps. An inconspicuous narrow walkway from the steps takes visitors to the well.

The estimated cost of this project is and is financed by a low-interest loan from Japan.India Said to Pick Japan for High-Speed Rail Project - WSJ Operation is officially targeted to begin in 2023, but India has announced intentions to attempt to bring the line into operation one year earlier. It will transport the passengers from Ahmedabad to Mumbai in just 3 hours and its ticket fare will be cheaper than air planes i.e. ₹2500-₹3000. Current status As of July 2020, NHSRCL has floated almost 60 % of tenders for civil works, and almost 60 % of land is acquired for the first Mumbai-Ahmadabad corridor and the deadline of the project is December 2023. The National High Speed Rail Corperation Limited, the implementing body of the project, has planned 7 routes which are Delhi to Varanasi via Noida, Agra and Lucknow; Varanasi to Howrah via Patna; Delhi to Ahmadabad via Jaipur and Udaipur; Delhi to Amritsar via Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Jalandhar; Mumbai to Nagpur via Nasik; Mumbai to Hyderabad via Pune and Chennai to Mysore via Bangalore. According to reports, the NHAI will soon acquire land to lay tracks for high-speed trains along greenfield expressways for integrated development of the rail transport network in the country. to expedite the project, the Indian Railways along with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will begin the process of acquiring additional land. The decision to acquire additional land was taken during a recent meeting of a group of infrastructure ministers led by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.During the infra sector group meeting, it was decided that the NHAI will take over land acquisition and a 4-member committee was constituted to take this process forward. The four-member task force will work out the modalities for acquiring land and sharing the cost. It may be noted that the Indian Railways is in the process of preparing the blueprint of 7 high-speed rail routes in the country. As per reports, The railway board has also written to the NHAI and given details of seven high-speed rail corridors for running bullet trains for which the detailed project reports are being prepared.

Norway Royal Salmon was established by 34 Norwegian salmon farmers in 1992. The philosophy behind Norway Royal Salmon was to build a totally integrated fish farming chain in order to take full control over quality in all parts of the business. In the years that have passed since the start, the company has stuck to its business plan and has grown by acquiring and taking over various aquaculture companies. Today Norway Royal Salmon is a fully integrated salmon farming company with full control of the process from smolt to the market place. The company is a leading producer of sustainable salmon and is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. It sells about 70,000 tons of salmon every year. This equates to almost 1 million salmon meals per day, all year round. Norway Royal Salmon has always focused on extensive research, development, cooperation and innovation. They continually aim to improve their production and they work hard to ensure that they are at the front edge of development. It was no coincidence that they were awarded most licenses – 9 – when the Norwegian Government awarded new green licenses in 2014. Furthermore, in 2015 they had their first production sites ASC certified and by 2020 all their production sites will be ASC certified The company became publicly listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in March 2011. The IPO valued the company at 832 million NOK. Norway Royal Salmon is a member of the Global Salmon Initiative. The company was criticized in 2011 by the Royal House of Norway for using the word \\"Royal\\" in a company name. CEO of Norway Royal Salmon said that when the company was founded in 1992, he got verbal permission to use \\"Royal\\" in the company name, as long as \\"Royal\\" wasn't the first part of the name. Communications manager Marianne Hagen at the Royal House could not find anything in the archives to support this claim. Green Warriors of Norway reported subsidiary NRS Finnmark to the police after the escape of 3 570 farmed salmon from a facility in Kufjord in Alta. Farmed salmon is a direct threat to the wild salmon in the Alta river system. Accidents *On 3 July 2012, a fishing vessel owned by Norway Royal Salmon sank outside of Store Kufjorden in Finnmark. A mother and daughter were killed. The company was criticized by Accident Investigation Board Norway.

The Scotts sold the property stocked with 2,875 sheep in 1906 to well known pastoralist R. J. M. McBride for £7,000. McBride's son, Thomas, was left to manage the property along with nearby Florieton Station. McBride senior died in 1921, at age 91, after acquiring a large area of pastoral land. The McBride family retained possession of Redcliffe with Thmas McBride running the property. By 1933 the size of the station was . Following a serious illness McBride placed Redcliffe and Oakleigh Stations up for auction in 1937. The properties were successfully sold along with the 6,600 head of sheep they were stocked with.

The Tupolev Tu-134 operated by Aeroflot crashed on 2 July 1986 during an emergency landing after it departed Syktyvkar, killing 54 of 92 passengers and crew on board. Aircraft The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-134A manufactured in 1978 and registered as CCCP-65120 to the Komi Civil Aviation department of Aeroflot. At the time of the crash the aircraft had sustained 7,989 pressurization cycles and 13,988 flight hours.  Crew  Eight crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Captain V. Dubrovsky * Co-pilot D. Kuleshov * Flight engineer S. Shamyrkanov * Navigator Y. Dmitriev Two flight attendants were present in the cabin. Synopsis All passenger baggage from Vorkuta was loaded into the rear luggage compartment, but no search of the luggage contents was carried out, which was allowed by aviation guidelines at the time. The first phase of the route was carried out without any issues on board. After the aircraft landed in Syktyvkar five additional passengers boarded the aircraft, which included two Bulgarian loggers. The flight departed from Syktyvkar at 09:55 Moscow time with 86 passengers aboard, including 19 children. While the Tu-134 was climbing away from the airport, approximately 10 minutes after takeoff at 10:05 while at an altitude of , the aircraft's rear cargo hold smoke alarm annunciated. The captain sent the flight engineer to verify the alert. The flight engineer confirmed that there was indeed a fire in the rear cargo hold where passenger baggage was stored, giving off excessive smoke. Doubting if the information he received from the flight engineer was correct the captain left the cockpit to investigate the situation with the flight engineer, in violation of established procedures. When he returned to the cockpit at 10:10:46, the plane had already climbed to an altitude of and was from Syktyvkar, which, taking into account the delay of about 4–5 minutes from the moment of the fire signal, significantly limited available options for dealing with the emergency. The captain then delegated the co-pilot and flight engineer to put out the fire while he and the navigator remained in the cockpit to initiate an emergency descent. The flight engineer and the first officer fought the fire while the captain and navigator initiated an immediate descent and turn in the direction go Syktyvkar in preparation for an emergency landing. At 10:11:11 he informed the air traffic controller about the onboard fire. At an altitude of the landing gear was released. When the aircraft was at an altitude of the flight engineer and the first officer returned to the cockpit and announced that the fire had not been extinguished, although two of the four fire extinguishers had been deployed. The two officers had attempted to reach the rear cargo compartment but because the smoke and fumes were so intense they quickly became disoriented and did not discharge the fire extinguishers in the correct location. Neither the co- pilot nor the flight engineer used oxygen masks or wore a smokehood. The amount of smoke in the cabin was intensified in part by the engines not working on full power, hence the cabin ventilation was impaired. The plane was flying at an altitude of 1000 meters in clouds with a lower threshold of 500 meters in rain. There was a possibility that due to abnormally low altitude relative to the distance from the airport the crew was not able to detect signals from the airport's radio navigation equipment. Under the circumstances of not being able to make an emergency landing at the airport immediately, the captain opted to make a forced landing outside of the airport and informed air traffic control of his decision. The Tu-134 descended below the clouds to an altitude of 300 meters and then disappeared from radar screens at air traffic control. Radio communication was also interrupted, but communication between air traffic control and the aircraft was already conducted at that time through the aircraft's radio repeater. The smoke in the aircraft cabin induced coughing, suffocation and bleeding from the nasopharynx. The fumes of the various combustion products from the fire led some of the passengers to faint. The crew did not set the air conditioning to correspond with the current engine mode, but doing so would have had little change in the cabin air. In the course of nine minutes the crew tried to find a place to land. Because visibility was limited to 6 kilometers and the aircraft was at a low altitude, the flight failed to find anywhere appropriate to land, the captain was forced to land directly in the forest directly below, and did not have time to prepare the passengers for an emergency evacuation. At 10:27:10 75 kilometers to the south-west of Syktyvkar, flying on a bearing of 60°, at an altitude of 23–25 meters above the ground, the Tu-134 struck with treetops and crashed into the forest. In violation of the aircraft flight manual, the navigator left his station at the time of the landing. The aircraft hit the ground 195 meters away from where it first struck the trees. Both wings were torn off the aircraft and the fuselage broke into three parts. A secondary fire broke out from fuel leaking after the tanks were damaged in the crash, destroying much of what remained of the aircraft. Passengers were speedily evacuated from the wreckage through the front luggage compartment, doors in the cabin, and breaks in fuselage. The cockpit door was jammed from the accident so the flight attendants helped the captain and flight engineer get out of the cockpit, but the navigator was killed in the accident and the flight engineer died of his injuries soon after getting out of the wreckage. At 13:35 the wreckage was spotted by a helicopter and 19 hours later all of the survivors were rescued from the scene. 54 of the 86 passengers died in the accident, including seven children. Forensic examination of the bodies of the deceased passengers showed that several of them had been killed by smoke inhalation and not the impact of the crash itself.  Investigation  The fire on the ground after the plane crashed destroyed most of the aircraft to the point of making study of the remains nearly impossible. The investigation lasted five months, during which the chairman of the investigation commission was replaced before the full report was completed. The official conclusion was that a fire in the rear luggage compartment spread in across the compartment sections before the crew could begin to extinguish it. The attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and the smoke and fumes from the fire spread into the cabin, the aircraft was forced to choose an emergency landing. However, due to low visibility, the distance from the airport, and the increasing amount of fumes in the cockpit, the aircraft was forced to make a landing in the forest below. The exact cause of the fire was not discovered, but it was suggested that an incendiary device or contraband flammable materials could have been in passenger baggage because the luggage was not inspected before the flight. The commission was able to exclude the possibility of leakage of hydraulic fluid or damage to the wiring in internal aircraft components causing a fire.
