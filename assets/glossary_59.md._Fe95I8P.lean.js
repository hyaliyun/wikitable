She first appeared in the sixth season episode \\"Secrets and Flies\\", broadcast on November 3, 2005. Departure Vassey appeared on a recurring basis until the tenth season when she was promoted to series regular. She was also added to the opening credits. On June 1, 2010, Michael Ausiello from Entertainment Weekly reported that Vassey's contract option had not been picked up and she would be leaving CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Vassey's departure came at a time when several of the show's actors negotiated their own contracts and Ausiello thought this might be a sign of a big cast shake-up. Development In 2009, Vassey expressed her interest in having her character go out into the field, after Wendy accompanied Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne) to a crime scene in the episode \\"Kill Me If You Can\\". Vassey enjoyed shooting outside in the sun instead of in the lab. She also enjoyed working with John Schneider who appeared in the episode. Vassey thought things were moving in the direction of Wendy being in the field more when she was sent to Las Vegas to do a ride- along and watch an autopsy. Wendy developed feelings for David Hodges (Wallace Langham), who worked in the lab with her. Vassey said Wendy liked Hodges because she could see something else in him, rather than the \\"suck-up\\" everyone else saw. She commented \\"I think these two characters work well together because it doesn't quite make sense, but it doesn't make sense in all the right ways. It makes me root for them.\\" Langham believed that Wendy's feelings were reciprocated by Hodges and that she was just waiting for him to realise and \\"take some action.\\" Langham told TV Guide's Tim Molloy that his character was also going wrong when it came to making a move on Wendy, as he was not sure of the right thing to say to her. In \\"A Space Oddity\\" (2009), Wendy and Hodges become closer and Langham stated that it would be the closest they get for a while without anything happening. Storylines Wendy is a DNA Technician and worked in San Francisco, California for a time before moving to Las Vegas to take the DNA tech position (\\"Secrets and Flies\\"). In the seventh season episode \\"Lab Rats\\" she helps David Hodges investigate the case of The Miniature Killer. The two characters have an ongoing rivalry. Hodges complains that Wendy tries to take over everything and thinks she's \\"too cool\\" for the lab. Simms insults Hodges by calling him \\"freakboy\\" and \\"loser\\" but praises his investigation methods. Wendy is apparently something of a klutz and has a reputation for being clumsy around work. In the episode \\"The Theory of Everything\\" it's revealed that she is a huge Star Trek fan. Later, she is disappointed when she learns Hodges lied to her about Grissom asking the lab techs to investigate the Miniature Killer. In an interview with TV Guide, Vassey comments that her character must have been a nerd during her high school days. In the episode \\"Lab Rats\\" there is an unfinished sentence by Wendy where she says \\"I can't believe that for half a second I actually thought I might-!\\" and gets defensive when Hodges asks what she meant. A later episode, \\"You Kill Me\\", sees friction created between Hodges and Simms when she discovers that Hodges has been working on a CSI-based board game that included a caricature of Simms as \\"Mindy Bimms, the clumsy yet buxom DNA Tech\\". (The \\"buxom\\" reference ties into the eighth-season episode \\"The Chick Chop Flick Shop\\", in which Wendy reveals that she was once paid $600 for a cameo role in a horror movie after she left college; a later viewing of the film in the episode leads to a discussion about Simms's breast size.) In \\"A Space Oddity\\" reveals that Simms and Hodges share a liking for the 1960s science-fiction TV series Astro Quest, with Wendy attending a fan convention wearing a costume based upon a uniform from the series. This causes Hodges to have various fantasies with them being characters in the show, something that affects his work, which he blames on Wendy. During the subsequent investigation of a murder at the convention, the two appear to make a connection, with Simms at one point inviting Hodges to her house to watch some Astro Quest episodes. Hodges calls a halt to the flirting after Catherine Willows suggests a relationship between the two would result in one having to change shifts. Also, his fantasies affect his work. They argue, with her stating \\"It's good you're having fantasies, because it means you're not as oblivious as everyone around here seems to think!\\" This reveals that many other CSIs have noticed the tension (one even advising Hodges to make the first move). The episode ends with Wendy realizing Hodges returns her feelings for him after decoding something that he said to her in one of the fictional languages (Velikan) of \\"Astro Quest\\" which reads \\"We were made for each other.\\" But Hodges will not date her as it would interfere with his work. In the episode \\"Field Mice\\", Henry asks Wendy for a date, and she agrees. Pranks then start following Henry, and he believes Hodges is responsible. It is revealed at the end of the episode that Wendy is responsible for the pranks, because \\"what she should want in a man isn't what she does want.\\" When confronted by Catherine and Henry, Wendy tries to confess, but Hodge interrupts and takes the blame. Henry asks Wendy for a rain check on their date. She agrees, but after Henry leaves, she tells Hodges that she and Henry will never be a couple. After a meaningful look at Hodges, she exits the room. Then Wendy turns around, rushes back to Hodges, and kisses him passionately. In Season 11, Vassey returned as a special guest star in the episode \\"Pool Shark\\" before leaving the show. She said goodbye to the team, including Hodges. She visited her sister in Portland and has decided to join a CSI team there and work in the field. She did not tell Hodges until right before she left because she did not want him trying to convince her to stay. She does not want to leave because she wants a relationship with Hodges, but feels she has to leave because the job is such a great opportunity. Reception Elizabeth Sanchez from Men's Fitness branded the character \\"sassy\\". Louise Schwartzkoff from The Sydney Morning Herald thought there was \\"half-hearted sexual tension\\" between Wendy and Hodges and said they used \\"vomit-worthy double entendres\\" while skirting around each other.

He was convicted and executed for the murder of a woman in Melbourne, Australia. He is remembered today because he was suspected by some of being the notorious serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Deeming was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England, son of Thomas Deeming, brazier, and his wife Ann, n√©e Bailey. He was a \\"difficult child\\" according to writers Maurice Gurvich and Christopher Wray.Gurvich, Maurice; and Christopher Wray (2007). The Scarlet Thread: Australia's Jack the Ripper, A True Crime Story. p. 15, 115. Sydney: Fairfax Books. . At 16 years of age, he ran away to sea, and thereafter he began a long career of crime, largely thieving and obtaining money under false pretenses. He was also responsible for the murder of his first wife Marie and his four children at Rainhill, England, on or about 26 July 1891, and a second wife, Emily Mather, at Windsor, Melbourne, on 24 December 1891. Less than three months elapsed between the discovery of Mather's body in Windsor, Melbourne, in March 1892, and Deeming's execution for her murder in May 1892; a remarkably short time by comparison to modern western legal standards.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 290. This was not only due to efficient police work, but also a result of the considerable international media interest the murder attracted. For example, it was an English journalist working for the Melbourne Argus who first approached Mather's mother in Rainhill and delivered the news of her daughter's murder. Another factor was Deeming's behaviour in public, for while he often used different names, he usually drew attention to himself with behaviour variously described as aggressive, ostentatious, ingratiating and overly attentive to women. Australia in the 1880s Police investigations after his arrest in 1892See Victoria Police notes on Deeming's criminal career . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. revealed that Deeming had moved to Australia in 1882, chiefly working in Sydney, but also working for John Danks, a Melbourne importer of plumbing and gas fitting supplies. His Melbourne employers regarded him as an excellent worker and extended him 200 pounds credit, supposedly to open a business in Rockhampton, Queensland. The money was never repaid.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 99. Deeming is known to have worked for a Sydney gasfitter, where he was charged with theft of brass fittings from his employer. Deeming indignantly denied the theft, but the items were found at his home and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. Deeming pretended to faint when the sentence was pronounced.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 101. After his release, he continued to work in Sydney as a gasfitter until, in December 1887, he was again committed for trial, now on a charge of fraudulent insolvency. He disappeared from New South Wales while on bail. Deeming was accompanied by his wife while in Australia, \\"a typical Welsh lass,\\" Marie, n√©e James. Deeming had married her in Lower Tranmere, England in February 1881 and they had lived briefly at Birkenhead before leaving for Melbourne.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 115. His brother Alfred, had married Marie's sister, Martha. By 1886 Deeming and Marie had two Australian-born daughters, Bertha and Marie. In 1888 his brothers Alfred and Walter learned that Deeming and his family were returning to England \\"with a considerable fortune\\". South Africa and return to England Later police and newspaper research discovered Deeming had been active in Cape Town, South Africa in 1888‚Äì1889, but his exact movements at this time are unclear and it appears he returned to Birkenhead, England, at least once. Marie had another child at this time. He was known to have been involved in conducting a Transvaal diamond mine swindle in 1889. His return to England via the steamship Yumna was well remembered by the Captain and passengers because of his ostentatious display of jewellery and money, and his unwanted attention to some of the female passengers.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 105. He had arrived at Hull by November 1889, lodging in the nearby town of Beverley. Here he passed himself off as \\"a retired sheep farmer\\" named Harry Lawson from Mount House Farm, Rockhampton, Queensland, living on 1,500 pounds a year.Gurvich & Wray (2007). pp. 106‚Äì7. He wooed Helen Matheson, the 21-year-old daughter of his landlady and married her, bigamously, on 18 February 1890. About a month later, after a honeymoon in the south of England, he suddenly disappeared, taking his expensive gifts to Matheson with him. Deeming's wife and extended family had heard of his bigamous marriage to Matheson according to Gurvich and Wray. Deeming was later found to have then visited Marie and his (now) four children in Birkenhead. He apparently gave Marie several hundred pounds and announced he was leaving for South America. He would send for her and the children once he was settled.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 108. Before leaving he conducted another swindle at a jeweler's in Hull. He was arrested for this on arrival at Montevideo and extradited back to England on a charge of \\"obtaining goods by false pretenses\\" being sentenced to nine months prison. Rainhill On his release from prison in July 1891, Deeming headed to the Liverpool area, settling into a hotel in the village of Rainhill, Merseyside under the name Albert Williams. A mysterious woman (almost certainly his wife Marie) who appeared at the hotel was dismissed as his \\"sister\\", visiting before she left for Port Said. Deeming then took a lease on Dinham Villa, a house in Rainhill, supposedly on behalf of a military friend, a certain \\"Colonel Brookes\\". However, Deeming himself took up residence at Dinham Villa, while a woman and several children were seen at the house and were again dismissed as merely his \\"sister and her children\\" visiting, who had \\"since returned home\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 111. Shortly afterward, Deeming complained that the drains at Dinham Villa were defective, and the kitchen floor needed to be replaced. He closely supervised the work on the floor. While in Rainhill, Deeming began to court Emily Lydia Mather,Studio portrait of Mather . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. the daughter of a widowed local shopkeeper, Mrs. Dove Mather. Mather and Deeming (as Albert Williams) married on 22 September 1891. Windsor murder In November 1891, Deeming (still using the name Williams) took Mather to Australia in the German steamship Kaiser Wilhelm II. They arrived in Melbourne on 15 December 1891. Deeming rented a house on Andrew Street in Windsor, a suburb of Melbourne. On 24 December or early on 25 December 1891, he murdered Mather and buried her under the hearthstone of one of the bedrooms, covering the body with cement. He had paid a month's rent in advance, giving the name Mr. Drewn, but almost immediately left the property. The owner, nearby butcher John Stamford, had been happy to rent to the man, because of his air of respectability, and at first, had not even known the man's name. On 3 March 1892 a prospective tenant of the Windsor house complained of \\"a disagreeable smell\\" in the second bedroom.Proactive, Number 40, Winter 2007: Journal of the Public Records Office. \\"The Crime of Century Revisited\\". page 4. The owner and estate agent later raised the hearthstone to investigate whereupon the smell became so overpowering \\"they found themselves barely able to breathe\\". The police were called and Mather's body found. A postmortem conducted on 4 March found that although her skull had been fractured by several blows, the most likely cause of death was that her throat had been cut.Autopsy report of Emily Mather . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. 19th-century illustration comparing Deeming and 'Jack the Viper' of Whitechapel Publicity surrounding the gruesome finding of Mather's body was considerable. Within a few days, The Age newspaper had connected the murder to the Whitechapel murders of London: From clues found at the vacant Andrew Street house and from information provided by local tradespeople, including Stamford and his agent, a local laundress, an ironmonger who sold Deeming cement and several carriers, investigating Victoria Police sergeants William Considine and Henry Cawsey were able to trace the recently arrived Mr. Williams to the Kaiser Wilhelm II. They were then able to interview other passengers, who gave corroborating descriptions of Mr. Williams and Mather. In the weeks at sea, Mather had talked to other passengers of her family at Rainhill, and the connection was now made. Deeming's behaviour as Mr. Williams had also attracted considerable attention during the voyage. Many passengers stated they \\"detested Williams, [but] all agreed he had treated his wife in a loving and considerate manner\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 51. Police now also had a very good description of Mr. Williams, which they circulated to other Australian colonies, but at this stage, his real identity was still unknown. At an inquest held on 8 March, it was discovered that a man answering Mr. Williamss description had auctioned a variety of household goods, possibly wedding presents, in the city in early January 1892. At this time he was staying at the Cathedral Hotel in Swanston Street, Melbourne, registered as Mr. Duncan. It later transpired that Deeming had also written an affectionate letter (as Albert Williams) to Mather's mother several days after Mather's murder. Deeming had found time to approach Holt's Matrimonial Agency (as Duncan), wishing to meet a young lady with matrimonial intentions.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 65. He had also found time to swindle a local Melbourne jeweller. Capture In the meantime, on or about 12 January 1892, Deeming had travelled to Sydney, and was now using the name Baron Swanston. During the voyage and in Sydney Deeming met and courted Kate Rounsefell. He told Rounsefell that if she agreed to become his wife, \\"she would never regret it, and would always congratulate herself on having entered into matrimony with him\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 84. After a whirlwind romance, during which Deeming gave Rounsefell several items of what was later shown to be stolen Melbourne jewellery, Rounsefell consented to marry Baron Swanston. Having also agreed to follow him to Western Australia, Rounsefell and Deeming parted company. By means of forged testimonials, Deeming had obtained a position at a mine at Southern Cross. On 22 January 1892 Baron Swanston departed for Fremantle. Again, Deeming as Baron Swanston made a name for himself on the ship, boasting of his wealth and position in society. He made approaches to Miss Maude Beech, a young woman in the care of her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Wakeley. In this case, Deeming's charm came to nothing. Mr. Wakeley told Swanston; \\"I may tell you plainly, that I don't believe your stories and I am not in the habit of allowing men of your class to enter my family circle.\\"Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 89. Once settled at Southern Cross, Deeming maintained a barrage of pleas to Rounsefell, writing on 8 February; \\"Don't keep me waiting dear. If you love me half as much as I love you, you would not keep me waiting a day\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 90. Police were closing in, however, and following telegrams by Victoria Police to Western Australia, Deeming was arrested at Southern Cross on 12 March 1892. He began by denying he was Deeming but later said \\"I think I know the party who has been murdered. I don't believe anyone would have the heart to murder a girl like that\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 79. Found in his possession at the time of the arrest were a number of Mather's belongings, including her prayer book.Deeming‚Äôs possessions on arrest . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. At about the same time Deeming was being returned to Melbourne, news of the discovery of the Rainhill murders in England arrived in Australia. Rainhill murders Following publicity surrounding the discovery of Mather's body at Windsor, investigations at Rainhill revealed the decomposing bodies of Marie Deeming and the four children; Bertha (aged 10), Mary (7), Sidney (5) and Leala (18 months) buried beneath the re-concreted floor of Dinham Villa. The throats of most had been cut (Bertha had been strangled). The murder and burials had apparently occurred while Deeming (as Albert Williams) was courting Mather, on or about 26 July 1891.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 117\\\\. NOTE: However, it may have been as late as 11 August 1891. At an inquest held at Rainhill on 18 March 1892, Deeming's brothers identified Marie and gave some accounts of his activities.See: The Australasian. 26 March 1892. . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. The Rainhill murders had gone undetected for eight months. It appears Deeming's brothers and Marie's sister had been led to believe that Marie and the children were in Brighton on a holiday and then assumed they were overseas again. Deeming had made several visits to Birkenhead to reassure Martha that her sister and the children were well.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 119. Detection of the murders was also obstructed by Deeming's lease (as Williams) on Dinham Villa, which stipulated that the house should not be sold or relet for six months, because of the imminent arrival of Colonel Brookes and/or Williams' sister. The lease also allowed Williams to resurface the concrete floor.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 118. Trial and Execution Furious demonstrations against Deeming were made on the journey to Perth, and again on the way to Albany. Deeming was tried at Melbourne Supreme Court on 25 April 1892.Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 199. The prosecution case was conducted by Robert Walsh, Q.C. Alfred Deakin, his counsel (later Prime Minister of Australia), tried to mount a plea of insanity. The defence also questioned the impact of newspaper reporting of Deeming on the jury. Perhaps wishing to aid the defence of insanity, Deeming also claimed to have caught syphilis in London and to have received visitations from his mother's spirit, which urged his actions. Before the jury retired, Deeming made a \\"lengthy,... rambling, speech of self-justification.\\" He repeated a story he had told police that Emily had \\"run off with another man\\". \\"That is my one comfort...knowing that she is not dead\\".Gurvich & Wray (2007). pp. 258‚Äì9. Deeming was found guilty as charged, however. Deeming spent the last days writing his autobiography and poetry; \\"The Jury listened well to the yarn I had to tell, But they sent me straight to hell.\\"Gurvich & Wray (2007). p. 273. He also spent time talking to the Church of England ministers, to whom he supposedly confessed. The sentence of the court was confirmed by the Executive Council on 9 May 1892 and the judicial committee of the Privy Council refused leave to appeal on 19 May 1892. Deeming was hanged at 10:01 am on 23 May 1892, he weighed , less than when he entered prison. The autobiography which Deeming wrote in jail was destroyed. Aftermath Grave of Emily Mather, Melbourne General Cemetery A family acquaintance of the Mather family, Edward Thunderbolt, Melbourne's Inspector of Public Nuisances, arranged a public subscription, and erected a monument to Emily Mather at Melbourne General Cemetery. =Jack the Ripper Theory= As Australians struggled to comprehend the savageness of the Windsor murder, significant press speculation grew, suggesting Deeming was Jack the Ripper. Newspaper clipping comparing Deeming's and Jack the Ripper's handwriting . ‚Äì Public Record Office Victoria. ‚Äì Government of Victoria. The speculation was also found in overseas reports of the case. For example, on 17 March 1892 The New York Times reported the story with the headlines: Deeming's movements at many stages of his career are obscure, but it appears he may have been in England in late 1888, the time of the Whitechapel murders. Kreitmayer's Melbourne waxworks of 1912 probably reflected widespread public opinion when it depicted in wax Deeming burying Mather, commenting that it was suspected he was \\"identical with Jack the Ripper\\".Kreitmayers Waxworks pamphlet, see page 11. items 152 and 153 . ‚Äì Government of Victoria. (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document). Speculation that Deeming was Jack the Ripper continues today and Robin Napper a former Scotland Yard detective and currently forensic researcher, along with a team of researchers, came to the conclusion that most of the evidence leads to Deeming as Jack the Ripper. This aired on a Discovery Channel documentary in 2011. According to Napper the display of Deeming's death mask as that of \\"Jack the Ripper\\" in the Scotland Yard Museum of Crime shows that the police had, in fact, always considered him a prime suspect. The reason that the police officially dismissed Deeming as a suspect of the Whitechapel murders, according to Napper, is that they had believed he was either in jail at the time according to someThe Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper by Martin Fido, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson. , page 182; The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated by Donald Rumbelow, Penguin Books. , page 268 or that he was in South Africa according to others.Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell by Stewart P. Evans and Keith Skinner, Stroud, Gloucestershire, Sutton Publishing, 2001, page 241 But Napper proved that he was not in jail at the time, and pointed to evidence that he had in fact been back from South Africa to England at the time of the murders. He also pointed to a motive (incurring syphilis from a prostitute), a criminal profile and killing pattern that fitted exactly.Prime Suspect: Jack the Ripper, Discovery Channel, 2011; Narration by Dennis Cometti Deeming's death mask is on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol in Melbourne, where he was executed, and at the Black Museum at New Scotland Yard.

Premiership season In 1946, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus two substitute players, known as the 19th man and the 20th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 19 rounds; matches 12 to 19 were the \\"home-and- away reverse\\" of matches 1 to 8. The determination of the 1946 season's fixtures were complicated by the fact that both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Lake Oval were still unavailable and, because of this, Melbourne shared the Punt Road Oval with Richmond as their home ground, and South Melbourne shared the Junction Oval with St Kilda as their home ground. Melbourne resumed using the Melbourne Cricket Ground as its home ground in round 17. Once the 19 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1946 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page- McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1946 VFL Premiership team was Essendon. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Bill Brittingham of Essendon with 66 goals, including 8 goals in the finals series. Des Fothergill of Collingwood was the leading goal-kicker in the home-and-home season, with 63 goals. * The winner of the 1946 Brownlow Medal was Don Cordner of Melbourne with 20 votes. Cordner was the first of the only two amateur players ever to win the Brownlow Medal; the second was Footscray's John Schultz in 1960. * Hawthorn took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1946. * The seconds premiership was won by . Richmond 7.15 (57) defeated 7.14 (56) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the senior preliminary final on Saturday 28 September at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. * The inaugural thirds premiership was won by . North Melbourne 11.9 (75) defeated 5.12 (42) in the Grand Final, played on Saturday 21 September. Notable events * The ANFC introduced a second substitute player, known as the 20th man; this meant that a team was now composed of 18 \\"run on\\" players, and two \\"reserves\\" on the bench. A player could be substituted for any reason (not just if he was injured and unable to continue). Once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. As with the 19th man, the 20th man was paid a match fee only in the event that he took the field. * The ANFC rejected a joint proposal from New South Wales and Tasmania to introduce an \\"order off\\" rule for foul play. * The VFL introduced a new Under-19 competition; the teams are referred to as the Third Eighteens. * The VFL resumes the Brownlow Medal award. * In Round 1, 33-year-old former champion full-forward Bob Pratt returned to South Melbourne after playing for VFA club Coburg (1940‚Äì1941) and serving in the Royal Australian Air Force (1942‚Äì1945). He kicked two goals before badly injuring a leg, and never played again. * In Round 2, North Melbourne won its first ever VFL away match against Richmond, having lost the previous 15 meetings. * From ninth position on the ladder at the end of Round 8, Melbourne won 13 of its next 14 matches and play in the Grand Final. * At half time in the closely contested Grand Final, a straighter-kicking Melbourne 10.4 (64) was three points in front of Essendon 9.7 (61); in the third quarter Essendon kicked 11.8 (74) to Melbourne's 1.1 (7).

Use by anti-spam systems  An automated whitelist is a whitelist which is created or maintained by a system that monitors incoming and/or outgoing email, and based on preset criteria, will add or remove entries from the whitelist without a need for human intervention. Optionally, some automated whitelisting systems can review records of past email communications which were previously stored within an email server's (or email client's) archives for inclusion in the whitelist. This functionality is an enhancement to creating a whitelist manually, such as exporting customer, vendor, friends, or other contact lists from various sources, to then tediously assemble them into a whitelist. Additionally, the use of such a system removes the difficult task of maintaining a whitelist as new email relationships are formed.  How it works  P. Oscar Boykin and Vwani Roychowdhury of the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California point out, \\"We exploit the properties of social networks to construct an automated anti-spam tool which processes an individual user's personal email network to simultaneously identify the user's core trusted networks of friends, as well as subnetworks generated by spams\\"; and their extensive research discovers a \\"surprisingly effective technique\\" with superior levels of \\"accuracy and automation\\"; they go on to explain, \\"it requires no user intervention or supervised training; second, it results in no false negatives i.e., spam being misclassified as non-spam, or vice versa.\\"Boykin, P., Roychowdhury, V.: \\"Personal Email Networks: An Effective Anti-Spam Tool\\", IEEE Computer, Vol. 38, No. 4, pages 61-68, April 2005,  Criticisms  Some anti-spam systems which use this method have been known to oversimplify a whitelist by adding only the domain name portion of the email addresses, thereby allowing undesirable mail from spammers to slip through. Other systems have been known to inappropriately add spammers due to clients using autoresponders, such as an \\"I'm Out of the Office Today\\" message, or spammers using a read receipt. Most systems are known to require all outgoing email to be funneled through their system for analysis and automated inclusion; whereas, others offer a small plugin for the existing email server, thereby not altering the existing outbound delivery path.

Dewitt Clinton Haskin (circa 1824 ‚Äì July 17, 1900) was an American engineer who developed the initial methods for construction of the first tunnels under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan.

Solano County Historical Society. For the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad project, he founded the Hudson Tunnel Company in 1873, and began construction in 1874 by digging a shaft in Jersey City, New Jersey. He had patented a compressed air method for reducing cave- ins, but in 1880, 20 workers were killed in a blowout. Another blowout in 1881 and a gradual loss of funding halted the project in 1887. After a British firm worked on the project from 1889-1891, lawyer William Gibbs McAdoo completed the project in 1908. (See Uptown Hudson Tubes.)

At solar elevations of 15‚Äì27¬∞, the 46¬∞ halo is often confused with the less rare and more colourful supralateral and infralateral arcs, which cross the parhelic circle at about 46¬∞ to the left and right of the sun.The 46¬∞ halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edm√© Mariotte (1620‚Äì1684). See: Mariotte, Quatrieme Essay. De la Nature des Couleur (Paris, France: Estienne Michallet, 1681). Sun dogs as well as the 22¬∞ and 46¬∞ halos are explained in terms of refractions from ice crystals on pages 466‚Äì524. The 46¬∞ halo is similar to, but much larger and fainter than, the more common 22¬∞ halo. It forms when sunlight enters randomly oriented hexagonal ice crystals through a prism face and exits through a hexagonal base. The 90¬∞ inclination between the two faces of the crystals causes the colours of the 46¬∞ halo to be more widely dispersed than those of the 22¬∞ halo. In addition, as many rays are deflected at larger angles than the angle of minimum deviation, the outer edge of the halo is more diffuse. (including an illustration and an animation) To tell the difference between a 46¬∞ halo and the infralateral or supralateral arcs, one should carefully observe sun elevation and the fluctuating shapes and orientations of the arcs. The supralateral arc always touches the circumzenithal arc, while the 46¬∞ halo only achieves this when the sun is located 15‚Äì27¬∞ over the horizon, leaving a gap between the two at other elevations. In contrast, supralateral arcs cannot form when the Sun is over 32¬∞, so a halo in the 46¬∞-region is always a 46¬∞ halo at higher elevations. If the Sun is near the zenith, however, circumhorizontal or infralateral arcs are located 46¬∞ under the Sun and can be confused with the 46¬∞ halo.

The port is located in Ningbo and Zhoushan, on the coast of the East China Sea, in Zhejiang province on the southeast end of Hangzhou Bay, across which it faces the municipality of Shanghai. The port is at the crossroads of the north-south inland and coastal shipping route, including canals to the important inland waterway to interior China, the Yangtze River, to the north. The port consists of several ports which are Beilun (seaport), Zhenhai (estuary port), and old Ningbo harbor (inland river port). The operator of the port, Ningbo Zhoushan Port Co., Ltd. (NZP), is a listed company, but it is 76.31% owned by state- owned Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group Co., Ltd., .  History  Ningbo Port was established in 738 during China's ancient history. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), it was known as one of the three major seaports for foreign trade under the name \\"Mingzhou\\", along with Yangzhou and Guangzhou. In the Song Dynasty, it became one of the three major port cities for foreign trade, together with Guangzhou and Quanzhou. It was designated as one of the \\"Five Treaty Ports\\" along with Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Shanghai after the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War. In 2006, the Port of Ningbo was merged with the neighboring Port of Zhoushan to form a combined cargo handling center. The combined Ningbo-Zhoushan Port handled a total cargo volume of 744,000,000 metric tons of cargo in 2012, making it the largest port in the world in terms of cargo tonnage, surpassing the Port of Shanghai for the first time.  Economic trade  The Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan is involved in economic trade with cargo shipment, raw materials and manufactured goods from as far as North and South America and Oceania. It has economic trade with over 560 ports from more than 90 countries and regions in the world. It is one of a growing number of ports in China with a cargo throughput volume exceeding 100 million tons annually.

It was invented in the early 20th century and was subsequently used as an anorectic or appetite suppressant in the 1950s, but was not as commonly used as other amphetamines such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, and was largely discontinued once newer drugs such as phenmetrazine were introduced. It most likely acts primarily as a dopamine releasing agent. Its activity as a norepinephrine or serotonin releasing agent is not known.  Chemistry  The molecular structure of ethylamphetamine is analogous to methamphetamine, with an ethyl group in place of the methyl group.Amphetamine is a substituted phenethylamine with a methyl group at RA position. It can also be considered a substituted amphetamine, with an ethyl group on the amphetamine backbone.The ethyl group of ethylamphetamine is at RN position, hence the name N-ethylamphetamine.Ethylamphetamine is structurally similar to N-methylamphetamine (methamphetamine), the ethyl group being replaced in methamphetamine with a methyl group.  Recreational Use  Ethylamphetamine can be used as a recreational drug and, while its prevalence is less than amphetamine's, it is still encountered as a substance taken for recreational purposes. Ethylamphetamine produces effects similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, though its potency is less. At equipotent dosage, ethylamphetamine is subjectively less euphorigenic.

They are often called pine flower weevils. As in the Anthribidae, the labrum appears as a separate segment to the clypeus, and the maxillary palps are long and projecting. Nemonychidae have all ventrites free, while Anthribidae have ventrites 1-4 connate or partially fused. Nemonychidae lack lateral carinae on the pronotum, while these are usually present, though may be short, in Anthribidae.Anderson, R.S, Oberprieler, R.G., Marvaldi, A.E. 2014. 3.1 Nemonychidae Bedel, 1882.

He popularized the term \\"machine learning\\" in 1959. The Samuel Checkers-playing Program was among the world's first successful self-learning programs, and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence (AI). He was also a senior member in the TeX community who devoted much time giving personal attention to the needs of users and wrote an early TeX manual in 1983. Biography Samuel was born on December 5, 1901 in Emporia, Kansas and graduated from College of Emporia in Kansas in 1923. He received a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1926, and taught for two years as instructor. In 1928, he joined Bell Laboratories, where he worked mostly on vacuum tubes, including improvements of radar during World War II. He developed a gas-discharge transmit-receive switch (TR tube) that allowed a single antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving. After the war he moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he initiated the ILLIAC project, but left before its first computer was complete. Samuel went to IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1949, where he would conceive and carry out his most successful work. He is credited with one of the first software hash tables, and influencing early research in using transistors for computers at IBM. At IBM he made the first checkers program on IBM's first commercial computer, the IBM 701. The program was a sensational demonstration of the advances in both hardware and skilled programming and caused IBM's stock to increase 15 points overnight. His pioneering non-numerical programming helped shape the instruction set of processors, as he was one of the first to work with computers on projects other than computation. He was known for writing articles that made complex subjects easy to understand. He was chosen to write an introduction to one of the earliest journals devoted to computing in 1953. In 1966, Samuel retired from IBM and became a professor at Stanford, where he worked the remainder of his life. He worked with Donald Knuth on the TeX project, including writing some of the documentation. He continued to write software past his 88th birthday. He was given the Computer Pioneer Award by the IEEE Computer Society in 1987. He died of complications from Parkinson's disease on July 29, 1990. Computer checkers (draughts) development Samuel is most known within the AI community for his groundbreaking work in computer checkers in 1959, and seminal research on machine learning, beginning in 1949. He graduated from MIT and taught at MIT and UIUC from 1946 to 1949. He believed teaching computers to play games was very fruitful for developing tactics appropriate to general problems, and he chose checkers as it is relatively simple though has a depth of strategy. The main driver of the machine was a search tree of the board positions reachable from the current state. Since he had only a very limited amount of available computer memory, Samuel implemented what is now called alpha-beta pruning. Instead of searching each path until it came to the game's conclusion, Samuel developed a scoring function based on the position of the board at any given time. This function tried to measure the chance of winning for each side at the given position. It took into account such things as the number of pieces on each side, the number of kings, and the proximity of pieces to being ‚Äúkinged‚Äù. The program chose its move based on a minimax strategy, meaning it made the move that optimized the value of this function, assuming that the opponent was trying to optimize the value of the same function from its point of view. Samuel also designed various mechanisms by which his program could become better. In what he called rote learning, the program remembered every position it had already seen, along with the terminal value of the reward function. This technique effectively extended the search depth at each of these positions. Samuel's later programs reevaluated the reward function based on input from professional games. He also had it play thousands of games against itself as another way of learning. With all of this work, Samuel's program reached a respectable amateur status, and was the first to play any board game at this high a level. He continued to work on checkers until the mid-1970s, at which point his program achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur.Schaeffer, Jonathan.

In 2018, it is ranked 353rd in Fortune Global 500 List. Country Garden features a market capitalization of over US$29.84 billion as of 2018; with more than 200 high-end township developments throughout China, Malaysia and Australia among its vast international project portfolio. Background Established in 1992 in Shunde, Guangdong, Country Garden was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 20, 2007, making billionaires of five of its shareholders. Founder Yang Guoqiang built the company from scratch, having previously worked as a farmer and on construction sites. The company now has interests in property development, construction, fitting and decoration, property management and hotel operations in a wide variety of global markets. In 2014, Country Garden was ranked the 6th largest property developer in China by sales revenue. 2005 share transfer In 2005, Yang transferred his shares in Country Garden Holdings Company Limited to his daughter, Yang Huiyan. In October 2007, she was declared the richest woman in Asia by Forbes magazine, with a net worth of US$16 billion.China's richest person is 26-year old woman: Forbes, Reuters, Oct 8, 2007. International Country Garden's first venture outside of China is the Country Garden Danga Bay (CGDB) coastal development in Johor Bahru, Iskandar Malaysia, with a sales figure of US$1.57 billion (MYR5.0 billion) on the day of its official launch. Similarly, its second Malaysian project in Semenyih, Selangor termed Country Garden Diamond City had 70% of its total units for Phase 1 sold in early June 2014. 'Risland Australia', Country Garden's overseas venture in Sydney also garnered strong sales, with 296 apartments at its Ryde Garden development sold within six hours in late June 2014; generating US$169 million (AUD180 million) in the process. Recent news On April 2, 2015, Chinese insurance giant Ping An became the second largest shareholder in Country Garden by acquiring 9.9% of the company for US$800 million. In Jun 2018, Country Garden halted all projects in China for security inspections following an accident at its construction site in the eastern province of Anhui that killed six people. In Aug 2018, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reportedly said he intends to ban foreigners from buying homes being built by Country Garden in the southern tip of the country. In October 2019, Country Garden, via Walker Corporation, was given approval to develop stage one of South East Wilton. This is controversial because the eastern side of the site will cut Koala corridors along Allens Creek. The Greater Macarthur area, of which South East Wilton is the most southern section, is home to the largest recovering Koala colony in New South Wales. In February 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney office of a Country Garden subsidiary, Risland Australia, sourced 82 tonnes of supplies, which were subsequently airlifted to Wuhan. This daigou operation has caused concern in Australia.

Early life Over the years, Martens was influenced by a wide range of music genres: as a youth, he first became interested in hip hop and break dance; by the mid-1980s, he began collecting electronic and synthpop albums from groups such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk and Nitzer Ebb; a few years later, it was acid house and hardcore groups. In the early 1990s, Carl Cox gave Martens a cassette tape of various remixes, which had a substantial impact of Martens' view on music, paving the way for his future career. Career history =DJ performances= Further inspired by the performances of local and international DJs on tour, Martens began his own DJ career in 1996 under the name Azzido Da Bass. One year later, he would secure his first professional job in Hamburg, Germany. The performance was a success, opening the door to additional jobs in northern Germany performing in clubs, competitive events and private parties, and within four years, Da Bass was a significant player within the German techno music scene, with tours both domestically and internationally. =Record producer= Da Bass aspired to create his own original music after several years as a DJ. After meeting producer/songwriter Stevo Wilcken in 1998, Da Bass made the transition to record producer. The duo co-wrote their first original song \\"Dooms Night\\", which was released in 1999 at the Love Parade in Berlin. Although the song did well in Germany, it languished outside the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart until a remix of the song was released by Timo Maas in 2000. The remix's popularity sent the track to No. 8 in the UK charts. Soon after, the song made major appearances around the world, including at the MTV Music Awards in 2000, several American and European commercials, and in the movie soundtrack to Angeled. Da Bass and Wilcken continued to produce a mixture of original songs and remixes thereafter, including a remix of the song \\"House of God\\" by Dimensional Holofonic Sound and their next hit \\"Speed (Can You Feel It?)\\" in 2002. The track peaked at No. 68 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Da Bass founded the independent record label Luscious Sound. His goal was to allow music artists to create their material with a minimal amount of interference from above.

History The Esperance Road District was established on 13 September 1895. Two weeks later, on 27 September 1895, the township of Esperance separated from the road district as the Municipality of Esperance. The municipality was re-absorbed into the road district on 30 October 1908. On 1 July 1961, it became the Shire of Esperance under the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires.

Political career  Long was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1512, 1526, 1536 and 1542, and High Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset in 1538. He replaced Sir Edward Darrell when the latter died as Member of Parliament for Wiltshire in 1532 and was re-elected in 1552. He was also Hereditary Bailiff of Charlton Wood and Keeper of Braden Forest, east of Malmesbury. Together with his brother Richard, he was present at the baptism of Prince Edward. He inherited the manor of Stock & Stockley from his father and later purchased the manor of South Wraxall. In 1513 he was on campaign in France and was knighted for making a gallant charge at Therouenne at Picardy in the sight of the King, for which he was granted a new crest, consisting of a lions head with a man's hand in its mouth. In 1520 he accompanied Henry VIII with other knights to the meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. In 1544 Long was at the Siege of Boulogne, having the command of 200 men, whom he raised for that expedition. His Captain was severely wounded in an unsuccessful attack on the castle, 1 September 1544. Long's close relationship with Henry VIII paid dividends at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, with grants of land in Wiltshire; Lyneham and Littlecote in Hilmarton, together with the rectory, great tithes and advowson of the vicarage of Lyneham, all formerly belonging to Bradenstoke Priory. He leased the manor of Fasterne from Catherine Parr who, after the death of her husband Henry VIII, had remarried Sir Thomas Seymour, brother of Protector Somerset. The Protector coveted Fasterne, and negotiated with Sir Henry Long to resign his lease. When she heard of this, Catherine was highly indignant. She was not on good terms with the Protector, because he had declined to give her some valuable jewels which, as she maintained, King Henry had given her for her own. She vowed she would stop the Protector getting his hands on the Fasterne lease, and would go herself \\"tomorrow, Saturday, at three o‚Äôclock\\" to the young King Edward, and give full utterance to her feelings against the Protector, his uncle. But the formidable uncle-Protector of the realm was not to be meddled with. Whether she kept her promise, and how far she succeeded in getting the diamonds, is not clear, but Somerset succeeded in getting Fasterne. Sir Henry Long somewhat unwillingly parted with it for a sum of money and the office of Ranger of Braden Forest for his life.  Personal life  Long married firstly, Jane (or Frydeswyde), daughter of Sir John Hungerford and Margaret Blount. He married secondly, Eleanor, daughter of Sir Richard Wrottesley and Dorothy Sutton. He had several children with both his wives, including Sir Robert Long. Sir Henry Long died 8 October 1556 and is buried at Draycot in Wiltshire. His second wife died about 1543.

It concerns itself primarily with the forward movement of women's rights on a global scale. Using different historical lenses from the legacy of colonialism, global feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle what they argue are the currently predominant structures of global patriarchy. Global feminism is also known as world feminism and international feminism. Two historical examples Global Feminists might use to expose patriarchal structures at work in colonized groups or societies are medieval Spain (late eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and nineteenth-century Cuba. The former example concerns women of the Mudejar communities of Islamic Spain and the strict sexual codes through which their social activity was regulated. Mudejar women could be sold into slavery as a result of sexual activity with a Christian man; this was to escape the deemed punishment. Because of their simultaneous roles as upholding one's family honor and one of \\"conquered status and gender\\", \\"Mudejar women suffered double jeopardy in their sexual contact with Christians [in Spain]\\".Tamara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard, eds. Women and the Colonial Gaze. . Nineteenth- century Cuba can be looked at as an example of colonialism and neocolonialism working together in a slave-based society to affect women's lives under patriarchy, where Cuba \\"remained a Spanish colony while enduring a neocolonial relationship with the United States\\". Havana, a city noted for its \\"absence of the female form\\", had, \\"of all the major cities in the West...the most strict social restrictions on the female portion of its population\\". Upper-class Cuban women were \\"a constant visual reminder of the separation between elite white society and the people of color they ruled\\". Transnational mothering Forced commitment to double shifts, struggle for individual autonomy, and blurring the private and public sphere of labor are all additional concerns to the primary issue for migrant women, which is the right to motherhood. The phenomena of motherhood in a transnational and contemporary time creates structural constraints for migrant women. Abusive employers and intimate violence is not the only problem these women have to face, but there are structural issues regarding the right to motherhood in this transnational era.Ladd-Taylor, Molly. \\"Mother-Worship/Mother-Blame: Politics and Welfare in an Uncertain Age.\\" Ed. Andrea O'Reilly. Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 640‚Äì48. Print. Women immigrants leave their chance overseas at an idealized motherhood of watching their children grow up while performing their gender role, and deport to be the breadwinner. The restructuring of care from the effects of globalization and neoliberalism institutionalizes these women. Globalization is constantly changing and as a result it is supporting the phenomena of women in the global south migrating to developed countries to serve domestic labors. The role of transnational mothering within a neoliberal spectrum affects the exploitation of women through the deprivation of their citizen rights, by extracting the benefits of immigrant's labor while minimizing or eliminating any obligations, whether social or fiscal to the society or state.Choy, Catherine Ceniza. (2003). \\"Empire of Care: Nursing and Migration in Filipino American History.\\" Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Migrant women of Third World countries are not drawn from their countries to the advancing economy of the First World, rather drawn from their economies that have been disrupted and distorted by Western colonial incursions, leaving many to be torn free of their roots and recruited to countries to fill its non permanent labor needs, preventing competition with native workers; fulfilling the complementary void.Glenn, Evelyn Nakano. \\"Women and Labor Migration.\\" Ed. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan. An Introduction to Women's Studies: Gender in a Transnational World (2006): 444‚Äì48. Print. Transnational mothering is viewed as an accommodation for both classes. Motherhood, along with reproductive freedom and marriage, is the fundamental right of women but is prohibited by nations that justify foreign domestic services, as much as view immigrant women as a threat to its nationalism. Nations create a process of racial formation through which women of different national and racial identities experience discrepant integration within a society, ultimately contributing to hierarchies of citizenship. In relation to social Darwinism, natives believe that Third World migrants \\"just can't make it\\", and fear degeneration, thus nations try to weed out those who do not fit the upper or middle class society in ways such as sterilization; e.g.; black women are identified as devious, immoral, domineering, sexually promiscuous, and bad mothers, resulting in their reproductive rights being threatened by regulation.Roberts, Dorothy, and Andrea O'Reilly. \\"Killing the Black Body.\\" Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 482‚Äì500.

Notable events * Following persistent wrestling between ruckmen Peter Moore and Gary Dempsey at centre bounces during the 1979 Preliminary Final between Collingwood and North Melbourne, the VFL introduced for the 1980 season a dividing line drawn across the centre circle in the wing-to-wing direction; under the new rules, each ruckman was forced to begin and run from his side of the line at a centre bounce, to eliminate wrestling.. The rule was officially adopted at the national level in November 1982. * In Round 4, Essendon's Phil Carman was reported for striking St. Kilda's Garry Sidebottom and headbutting boundary umpire Graham Carberry at Windy Hill. He was suspended for a total of 20 matches‚Äî4 for striking Sidebottom and 16 for headbutting Carberry. * North Melbourne's Kerry Good scored the winning goal after the final siren had sounded in the 1980 Escort Championships Night Grand Final at VFL Park‚Äîa goal that was highly controversial as the umpires had not heard the siren seconds before Kerry Good had marked the ball from a kick by Malcolm Blight. Collingwood lost the match by only three points. *The league threatened to kick off the Western Oval and force it to play its games away from home, after the Footscray Council granted the Footscray J.U.S.T. (a soccer team playing in the NSL) a lease to play games at the ground on Sundays ‚Äì in defiance of a League stipulation that League grounds could not be shared with other codes during winter. In the end, Footscray-J.U.S.T. played most of its games elsewhere, and the League was not forced to follow through on its ultimatum. *On 5 July, the VFL put together three separate Victorian representative teams to compete in different interstate games. The No. 1 team recorded a 21-point victory against Western Australia at VFL Park, and the No. 2 team recorded an 80-point win against Queensland at the Gabba; but, the No. 3 team suffered an upset 13-point loss against the A.C.T. at Manuka Oval, prompting league president Dr Allan Aylett to describe it as the worst team ever to represent Victoria. * 1980 was the first season in league history where neither of the top two teams of the home-and-away season reached the Grand Final. It would be the only such instance for nearly four decades, until the 2019 AFL season. * To date, this is the only season where the bottom placed side scored more points during the home & away season than the top finishing side.

An examination of the relationships between three characters in a love triangle, it was Eustache's first feature film and is considered his masterpiece. Eustache wrote the screenplay drawing inspiration from his own relationships, and shot the film from May to July 1972. The film screened at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix. With some divided initial critical reaction, it has been championed by later critics and filmmakers. Plot In Paris, Alexandre, an unemployed young man with memories of the May 1968 events in France, attempts to persuade his former love, Gilberte, to marry him. Gilberte opts to instead marry another man. Alexandre is involved with a live- in girlfriend called Marie, and is interested in films such as The Working Class Goes to Heaven. One day, after an unsuccessful reconciliation with Gilberte at the highly popular Les Deux Magots caf√©, he meets Veronika, a Polish French twenty-something nurse. In the midst of the sexual revolution, Veronika is highly promiscuous, and begins to make advances on Alexandre. During the summer of 1972, Alexandre and Marie are nude in bed in their apartment when Veronika visits. Marie lets her in and Veronika insults both of them, but acknowledges she is not pure herself. The three begin a m√©nage √† trois and sleep in the same bed, with Veronika assuring Alexandre she and Marie both love him, and telling him to be more happy with his situation and life. Although Marie affirms her indifference to Alexandre's affairs, she quickly changes her mind when she sees how close he becomes to Veronika. This leads to a growing estrangement between her and Alexandre. As the three sit together, Veronika attempts to reassure Marie about her looks and body. Tearfully, Veronika speaks about how she believes no women are truly whores, and how love is meaningless unless it produces a child. Cast * Bernadette Lafont as Marie * Jean-Pierre L√©aud as Alexandre * Fran√ßoise Lebrun as Veronika * Isabelle Weingarten as Gilberte * Jacques Renard as Alexandre's friend * Jean-No√´l Picq as Offenbach's lover * Genevi√®ve Mnich as Veronika's friend * Caroline Loeb * Andr√© T√©chin√© * Jean-Claude Biette * Pierre Cottrell * Jean Douchet * Douchka * Bernard Eisenschitz * No√´l Simsolo * Berthe Granval * Jean Eustache as the man at the supermarket Production In 1972 Eustache had begun to doubt his career in films and contemplated quitting the business. He told a reporter from Le Nouvel Observateur \\"If I knew what it was that I wanted, I wouldn't wake up in the morning to make films. I'd do nothing, I'd try to live without doing or producing anything.\\" Soon afterwards he got a new idea for a film to make with his friends Jean-Pierre L√©aud and Bernadette Lafont; he also brought in his ex-lover Fran√ßoise Lebrun who at that time was a literature student and had never acted before. Eustache was loaned money from friend Barbet Schroeder to spend three months writing the script, which was over three hundred pages. Although the film often seems to be highly improvised, every word of dialogue was written by Eustache.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. pp. 311‚Äì313. The film was very autobiographical and was inspired by Eustache's various relationships, such as his then recent breakup with Fran√ßoise Lebrun and romantic relationships with Marinka Matuszewsk and Catherine Garnier. Many of the locations used in the film were places that Garnier had lived or worked. The character played by Jacques Renard was based on Eustache's friend Jean- Jacques Schuhl.Azoury, Philippe.

Paris: Cahiers du cinema, \\"Auteurs\\". 1986. . p.114. on a budget of 700,000 francs. Eustache called it a very hostile film, and it mostly consisted of dialogues and monologues about sex. Eustache says that the character Alexandre is \\"destroying [the three lead characters], but he is looking for it all along. After his voyage into madness and depression, he ends up alone. That's when I stop the film.\\" Filming locations included Les Deux Magots Caf√©, the Caf√© de Flore, the Caf√© le Saint-Claude, the Laennec Hospital, the Blue Train restaurant and inside various apartments on the Rue de Vaugirard and Rue Vavin.Eustache, Jean. La Maman et la Putain:Sc√©nario. Paris: Cahiers du cinema. 1986. . pp. 35-42. The film had no musical score and only used natural sounds and occasionally music played by the characters on phonographs, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich and Deep Purple.Hanska, Evane. Mes ann√©es Eustache. Flammarion, Documents. 2001. . pp. 325-326. Eustache described the film as a \\"narrative of certain seemingly innocuous acts. It could be the narrative of entirely different acts, in other places. What happens, the places where the action unfolds, have no importance...My subject is the way in which important actions situate themselves in a continuum of innocuous ones. It's the description of the normal course of events without the schematic abbreviation of cinematographic dramatization.\\" Luc B√©raud is assistant director on the movie. Reception The Mother and the Whore is considered Eustache's masterpiece, and was called the best film of the 1970s by Cahiers du cin√©ma. It won the Grand Prix of the Jury and the FIPRESCI prize at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. The film created a scandal at the Cannes Film Festival, as many critics saw the film as immoral and obscene or, in the words of the broadsheet Le Figaro, \\"an insult to the nation\\", while T√©l√©-7-Jours called it a \\"monument of boredom and a Himalaya of pretension\\". On its initial run the film sold over 343,000 tickets in France. After gaining little public recognition despite receiving praise throughout the years from critics and directors, such as Fran√ßois Truffaut and other members of the French New Wave, Eustache became an overnight success and internationally famous after the film's Cannes premiere. He soon financed his next film. The critic Dan Yakir said that the film was \\"a rare instance in French cinema where the battle of the sexes is portrayed not from the male point of view alone\\". James Monaco called it, \\"one of the most significant French films of the 1970s\\". Jean-Louise Berthom√© said, \\"I am not sure that La mama et la putain, with its romances of a poor young man of 1972, doesn't say something new.\\" Pauline Kael praised the film, saying it reminded her of John Cassavetes in its ability \\"to put raw truth on the screen ‚Äì including the boring and the trivial\\". Jean-Louis Bory of Le Nouvel Observateur gave the film a negative review, calling it misogynistic and criticizing the characterization of Alexandre. Legacy The film's reputation has increased over time. In 1982, the literary magazine Les Nouvelles litt√©raires celebrated the tenth anniversary of the film by publishing a series of articles about it. It has been called one of the best films in French history by Jean-Michel Frodon and Jean-Henri Roger. Film director Olivier Assayas has especially praised the film and considers it an example of what to strive for in filmmaking. It was ranked the second greatest French film of all time by a poll of filmmakers. Andrew Johnston, writing in Time Out New York, described his experience of viewing the film: After a 2016 retrospective screening at the French Institute Alliance Fran√ßaise, film critic Richard Brody effusively praised Eustache's sophisticated portrayal of characters whose \\"intimate disasters have the feel of epic clashes.\\" Further, he sees the film as Eustache's \\"comprehensive vision\\" of radical politics and the Sexual Revolution in post-1968 France ‚Äì a stark, regretful, and suspicious vision that Brody terms \\"ferociously conservative\\". The film is also freely available on the internet. The film was adapted into a 1990 stage play by Jean-Louis Martinelli. In 1996, the French rock band Diabologum utilized Veronika's monologue in a song named The Mom and the Whore on their album #3. Vincent Dieutre's 2008 film ea2, 2e exercice d'admiration: Jean Eustache paid tribute to Veronika's monologue.

Variations include the coin in orange, and more generally \\"something in fruit\\". Effect The magician asks an audience member for a dollar bill, and then has them mark it in some way ‚Äî signing it, tearing a corner off, memorizing the serial number, or similar. The magician then destroys the bill, ripping it up or causing it to burst into flame. The magician then introduces a lemon and proceeds to cut it in half. The two halves of the lemon are pulled apart and the original bill is found inside. The audience can then verify that it is indeed their bill by comparing it to whatever they recorded earlier. Method Prior to performing the trick, the magician prepares the lemon by cutting a long slot into it by forcing a knife or pencil into the fruit from the end. A bill or card is then folded up and inserted into the hole. The flesh of the fruit will close up when the knife is removed, becoming very difficult to see. The hole can be hidden even better if the fruit has a stem, which can be removed and then glued back into place to cover the hole. The simplest versions of the trick rely on the object in the lemon being merely a copy of the one provided by the audience member ‚Äî that is, the trick becomes simply an elaborate way to reveal the result of a magician's force. For example, the audience member selects the two of clubs, their original card is destroyed, and the lemon is cut open to reveal another two of clubs. The magician may compare marks on the audience member's object to marks on the object inside the lemon. A common method is to tear the original card into sixths or eighths, give one piece to the audience member to hold as a \\"receipt,\\" and vanish the other pieces; when the lemon is opened, the card inside is shown to be intact except for a torn corner exactly matching the \\"receipt.\\" This effect can be accomplished by palming the corner torn from the prepared card and then forcing the audience member to choose that piece. Some versions do not rely on a different prepared object, but instead reveal the audience member's actual original object at the end of the trick. This variation is often known as \\"signed bill in lemon.\\" There are at least three places in the trick where a switch may be performed: First, the lemon may be prepared with a dummy bill which is switched for the signed bill after opening. Second, the lemon may be prepared surreptitiously during the act. Third, a dummy (unprepared) lemon may be introduced at the beginning of the act; the real lemon is surreptitiously prepared during the act, and the magician switches lemons sometime prior to the reveal. The third method is the most convincing, because the switch can take place while the lemon is not the center of attention.  Famous performers  The coin in orange version of the trick dates to at least the mid-1800s, and appears in Modern Magic in 1876. This was a relatively complex version that uses two oranges and considerable stagecraft to complete. The bill in lemon version is credited to Emil Jarrow (1875-1959), who made it a feature of his vaudeville act during the first half of the twentieth century. Jarrow would borrow as many as three different bills from members of the audience, causing them to later reappear inside of the lemon. Other famous performers of the effect included T.

He founded the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) in 1994, as an organization that opposed the Suharto regime. Its involvement in the labor movement led to him being forced to step down from the daily newspaper Kompas in 1995. Education and student activities He was born in Semarang, on 11 April 1961 as the first child of six children in the Wiharto Arismunandar family. He graduated from 14th National Middle School in East- Jakarta in 1980, and graduated from a major in electronics from the University of Indonesia (UI) in 1989. His father, a middle officer in the Indonesian airforce, died from disease just ten days before Satrio graduated from UI. Satrio's activities as a student were varied. He was a member of the Democratic Student Body, a head of the Electronics Students Association, member of the nature lover association, editing the campus newspaper and active in the local mosque. He also participated in receiving new members for the Muslim Students' Association in 1981 and became a member of the ISAFIS (The Indonesian Student Association for International Studies), although in the end he decided to concentrate on journalism related activities on campus. After working from 1986 to 1995 as a journalist, he went back to do a Master's degree in Defence Studies at the University of Indonesia, and graduated in August, 2000. His thesis was on The role of student journalism in the student movement in 1998: A case study of the bulletin Move! at the time of stopping president Suharto, which became the material for a book. Journalistic experience Since he was a student, Satrio had already worked as a freelance writer (1981‚Äì1986), journalist for the daily Harian Pelita (1986‚Äì1988), the daily Kompas (1988‚Äì1995), the magazine D&R; (1997‚Äì2000).

Etymology The specific name, palarostris, is from Latin: pƒÅla (shovel) and r≈çstrum (beak or snout). Geographic range S. palarostris is found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. In the United States it is found only in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument of western Pima County, Arizona. The subspecies occurring there is called the Organ Pipe shovelnose snake (C. p. organica). In Mexico it is found only in the state of Sonora.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright. 1957.

Description S. palarostris is cross-banded with black, yellow (or whitish), and red bands. Consequently, it resembles the Sonoran coral snake (Micruroides euryxanthus). The mnemonic \\"red on yellow kill a fellow, red on black, friend of Jack\\" doesn't work with this snake. However, unlike the coral snake, which has a black snout, Sonora palarostris has a yellow snout and is not venomous. Also on a coral snake, the bands go all the way around, but S. palarostris has a solid yellow belly.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification.

The City covers an area of , and lies about southwest of the Perth central business district. History In 1848 a town trust was formed comprising a chairman and a committee of five. For the next twenty-three years they set about constructing roads and many public buildings with the use of convict labour. By 1870 the population of Fremantle had reached 3,796 and it was a moderately flourishing town, resulting in a move among the colonists to secure greater control of the management of their affairs. The Municipality of Fremantle was formed on 21 February 1871, with the new council having a chairman and nine councillors. Two of the major achievements of the town council were a reliable supply of pure water and a more efficient system of sanitation. By 1928 Fremantle had a population of 22,340 and an annual revenue of ¬£73,354 - enough to warrant a claim for city status.

Bryce-Smith and E. T. Blues \\"Unsolvated n-Butylmagnesium Chloride\\" Org. Synth. 1967, 47, 113. It is also a solvent in many types of correction fluids. Structure Methylcyclohexane is a monosubstituted cyclohexane because it has one branching via the attachment of one methyl group on one carbon of the cyclohexane ring. Like all cyclohexanes, it can interconvert rapidly between two chair conformers. The lowest energy form of this monosubstituted methylcyclohexane occurs when the methyl group occupies an equatorial rather than an axial position. This equilibrium is embodied in the concept of A value. In the axial position, the methyl group experiences steric crowding (steric strain) because of the presence of axial hydrogen atoms on the same side of the ring (known as the 1,3-diaxial interactions). There are two such interactions, with each pairwise methyl/hydrogen combination contributing approximately 7.61 kJ/mol of strain energy. The equatorial conformation experiences no such interaction, and so it is the energetically favored conformation. Flammability and toxicity Methylcyclohexane is flammable. Furthermore, it is considered \\"very toxic to aquatic life\\".Chevron Phillips, 2014, \\"Material Safety Data Sheet: Methylcyclohexane (v. 1.5)\\", see , accessed 23 May 2014.

Altogether, Warburton played 90 games for Brighton, and kicked 317 goals. Warburton moved to the Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League, and made his debut in Round 1 of the 1951 season. He received a heavy knock during a game in 1952 and was rushed to hospital after collapsing at a dance after the game. He was eventually forced to retire in 1955 due to ongoing problems as a result of that knock.

The cylinder revolves around a central axis in the revolver to sequentially bring each individual chamber into alignment with the barrel for repeated firing. Each time the gun is cocked, the cylinder indexes by one chamber (for five-shooters, by 72¬∞, for six-shooters, by 60¬∞, for seven- shooters, by 51.43¬∞, and for eight-shooters, by 45¬∞). Like a magazine, the cylinder stores ammunitions within the revolver and allows the gun to fire multiple times before needing to reload. Typically revolver cylinders are designed to generally hold six cartridges (hence revolvers sometimes are referred to as \\"six-shooters\\"), but some small-frame concealable revolvers such as the Smith & Wesson Model 638 have a 5-shot cylinder, due to the smaller overall size and limited available space. The Nagant M1895 revolver has a 7-shot cylinder, the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver has an 8-shot cylinder in .38 caliber, and the LeMat Revolver has a 9-shot cylinder. Several models of .22 rimfire-caliber revolvers have cylinders holding 9 or 10 rounds. As a rule, cylinders are not designed to be detached from the firearm (except for cleaning). Rapid reloading is instead facilitated by the use of a speedloader or moon clip, although these work only on top-break and swing-out cylinder revolvers; revolvers having fixed cylinders must be unloaded and loaded one chamber at a time.  Designs =Fixed cylinder designs= A Nagant M1895 revolver, showing the fixed cylinder's loading gate open The first generation of cartridge revolvers were converted caplock designs. In many of these (especially those that were converted long after manufacture), the pin on which the cylinder revolved was removed, and the cylinder was taken from the gun for loading. Later models used a loading gate at the rear of the cylinder that allowed one cartridge at a time to be inserted for loading, while a rod under the barrel could be pressed rearward to eject the fired case. Most revolvers using this method of loading are single-action revolvers. Oddly, the loading gate on the original Colt designs (and copied by nearly all single-action revolvers since) is on the right side, which may favor left- handed users; with the revolver held in the proper grip for shooting in the left hand, the cartridges can easily be ejected and loaded with the right. This was done because these pistols were intended for use with cavalry, and it was intended that the revolver and the reins would be held in the left hand while the right hand was free to eject and load the cartridges. Since the cylinder in these revolvers is firmly attached at the front and rear of the frame, and since the frame is typically full thickness all the way around, fixed-cylinder revolvers are inherently strong designs. Because of this, many modern large-caliber hunting revolvers tend to be based on the fixed-cylinder design. Fixed-cylinder revolvers can fire the strongest and most powerful cartridges, but at the price of being the slowest to load and unload and they cannot use speedloaders or moon clips for loading, as only one chamber is exposed at a time to the loading gate. =Top break= A Webley Mk VI .455 calibre break-top service revolver The next method used for loading and unloading cartridge revolvers was the top break design. In a top-break revolver, the frame is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder. Releasing the lock and pushing the barrel down brings the cylinder up, which exposes the rear of the cylinder for reloading. In most top-break revolvers, the act of pivoting the barrel and cylinder operates an extractor that pushes the cartridges in the chambers back far enough that they will fall free, or can be removed easily. Fresh rounds are then inserted into the cylinder, either one at a time or all at once with either a speedloader or a moon clip. The barrel and cylinder are then rotated back and locked in place, and the revolver is ready to fire. Since the frame is in two parts, held together by a latch on the top rear of the cylinder, top-break revolvers cannot handle high pressure or \\"magnum\\"-type rounds. Top-break designs are largely extinct in the world of firearms, but are still commonly found in airguns. One of the most famous \\"break-top\\" revolvers is the Webley service revolver (and the Enfield revolver, a nearly identical design), used by the British military from 1889 to 1963. The American outlaw Jesse James used the 19th century Schofield Model 3 break-top revolver, and the Russian Empire issued the very similar .44 Russian calibre Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver from 1870 until 1895. =Swing- out cylinder= Example of a swing-out cylinder on a revolver The most modern method of loading and unloading a revolver is by means of the swing-out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is coaxial with the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting from the front of the cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top-break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place. The pivoting part that supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies, television, and videogames of flipping the cylinder open and closed with a flick of the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck. The shock of firing can exert a great deal of stress on the crane, as in most designs the cylinder is only held closed at one point, the rear of the cylinder. Stronger designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk, use a lock in the crane as well as the lock at the rear of the cylinder. This latch provides a more secure bond between cylinder and frame, and allows the use of larger, more powerful cartridges. Swing-out cylinders are rather strong, but not as strong as fixed cylinders, and great care must be taken with the cylinder when loading, so as not to damage the crane. History =Background= Firearm cylinders were first developed in the 16th century and, over time, had anywhere from three to twelve chambers bored into them.Blair, Claude, ed., Pollard‚Äôs History of Firearms (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1983), 210. One of the earliest examples is dated 1587.Hogg, Ian V. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Firearms: Military and civil firearms from the beginnings to the present day ... (London: New Burlington Books, 1980), 40. Cylinders were developed as a device to increase the multiple-fire capability of firearms. Firearms of the period were mostly muskets and only capable of firing a single shot before needing to be reloaded. Reloading the single-shot firearm was time-consuming and in a military or self-defense situation where seconds mattered, this rendered it almost useless after the first shot. A firearm with several pre-loaded chambers would naturally increase its effectiveness against an enemy. =Snaphance and flintlock= The first firearms to incorporate a cylinder were the snaphance and flintlock types. The lock mechanisms were very similar and used the same type of cylinder. The chambers did not penetrate completely through the cylinder. The back of each chamber had a small touch hole drilled through the side of the cylinder. For each touch hole, a small flash pan was created at the cylinder‚Äôs surface. Each pan with touch hole had a sliding gate to cover it. This prevented the gunpowder from falling out as the cylinder was turned. Assuming that each pan was filled with powder and that each chamber was charged, the operator manually turned the cylinder to align a chamber with the barrel, opened the pan cover, and was then ready to fire. Compared to the single-fire musket, the manufacturing process for this type of firearm was very expensive, which kept their numbers fairly low. =Percussion= The next evolution of the cylinder did not occur until the 1830s. While chemistry was still in its infancy, the development of fulminates as primers for firearm ignition contributed to the invention of the percussion cap. This, in turn, led to the development of the percussion cylinder. As with the earlier flintlock cylinders, the chambers within the percussion cylinders were not bored completely through. Percussion caps replaced the flintlock pans as primers and the drilled touch holes were incorporated within nipples. The nipples were inserted into a recess at the rear of each chamber. The percussion cap was placed over the nipple. These arms quickly incorporated mechanisms that automatically rotated the cylinder, aligning the chamber with the barrel, and locking it in place. Each chamber was loaded in a similar manner as the previous flintlocks, that is, from the front of the cylinder, powder was poured into the chamber and then a bullet was inserted and pressed into place with a ramrod. =Needle-fire revolver= After the initial invention in the late 1830s of a needle-fire rifle, a revolver was soon developed. This type of firearm used a paper cartridge.Friedel, Robert. A Culture of Improvement (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2007), 371. It used a long, thin, needle-like firing pin that passed through a small hole at the rear of the cylinder, through the powder, and struck a disposable primer cap that was set behind the bullet. The revolver‚Äôs cylinder simply had a small hole drilled at the rear of each chamber.Myatt, Frederick. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pistols & Revolvers: An Illustrated History of Handguns from the 16th Century to the Present Day (New York: Crescent Books, 1980), 66. The use of a paper cartridge was a change from the earlier method of charging a firearm. =Pin-fire= At approximately the same time that the needle-fire system was developed, a pin-fire method was also developed. This method originally used a paper cartridge with a primer cap within a brass base, which quickly evolved into an all-brass cartridge. From the side, a stout pin was inserted into the cartridge above the cap. The gun‚Äôs hammer pushed the pin into the cap and set off the primer. A revolver using this method had a cylinder with chambers that were bored completely through with a slight channel where the pin rested.Myatt, Frederick. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pistols & Revolvers: An Illustrated History of Handguns from the 16th Century to the Present Day (New York: Crescent Books, 1980), 88-91. This type of cylinder was first patented in France in 1854.Batchelor, John and John Walter. Handgun: From matchlock to laser-sighted weapon (Portugal: Talos Books, 1988), 78. Loading these revolvers was accomplished by moving a loading gate that was mounted behind the cylinder. To remove the spent cartridges, a push-rod was used to back the cartridges out of the cylinder through the loading gate. =Rimfire and centerfire= Cylinders that use these cartridges are what most people envision as modern cylinders. These cartridges are all metallic and are struck at the rear by the hammer. The rimfire cartridges contain a primer around the inside of the rim. The centerfire cartridges have a primer cap pressed into the base. They are similar to the pin-fire cylinders as the chambers are bored completely through, but they have no additional holes or channels connected to the chambers. In 1857, Smith & Wesson held the patent for this bored through cylinder.Myatt, Frederick. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pistols & Revolvers: An Illustrated History of Handguns from the 16th Century to the Present Day (New York: Crescent Books, 1980), 84. Removal of cartridges from the early models was done one at a time with a push rod as in the pin-fire cylinders. Later models that had swing-out cylinders incorporated push rods with extractors that pushed all of the cartridges out in a single operation. =Tape-primer= In the 1850s, in competition with Colt‚Äôs percussion revolvers, a revolver was developed that used a paper tape primer to ignite the powder in the chambers. This worked much as today‚Äôs toy cap pistols.Myatt, Frederick. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pistols & Revolvers: An Illustrated History of Handguns from the 16th Century to the Present Day (New York: Crescent Books, 1980), 67. This basically worked the same as a percussion revolver, but with only one nipple that sent the ignition spark to a flash hole at the rear of each chamber. Each chamber was loaded in the same manner as the percussion revolvers.

The campus is located on the former Claremont Estate, built in 1907 as the home of Charles and Virginia Baldwin. The main building, known as the Trianon (formerly called \\"Claremont\\"), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The school is set in a residential neighborhood at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. CSS is accredited by The Association of Colorado Independent Schools (ACIS) and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS).  History  The Colorado Springs Episcopal School for Girls was a college preparatory school that was established through a certificate of incorporation in July 1961. In March 1962 it was renamed The Colorado Springs School for Girls when it dropped its affiliation with the Episcopal church. The school opened in September 1962 with 23 students in the former home of Walter Drake and his wife on Pourtales Road with Margaret Campbell as its first Headmistress. By the spring of 1967, enrollment had nearly quadrupled and the Board of Trustees voted to purchase both the Trianon property at 21 Broadmoor Avenue and nearly 12 acres known today as Boddington Field. The school purchased a home at 24 Pourtales for boarding of students in the fall of 1965. In 1970 the school opened its program to boys and in 1975 was renamed The Colorado Springs School when it became \\"fully coeducational\\" for grades 7 through 12. In 1976 the Children's School was founded for education from Kindergarten through 12th grade, and merged with The Colorado Springs School. Experiential education was integrated into the school's educational program beginning in 1976. A pre- kindergarten program was established in 1994 and in 1998 a preschool was added to the school. The school's boarding program ended and a Homestay Program was established in 2000. In 2012, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2015, the school graduated its 50th class. The school has had ten heads of school: Margaret Campbell (1962-1974); Robert MacDonald (1974-1979); Jerel Cathey (1979-1983); Donald W. Fudge (1983-1986); George S. Swope (1986-1989); Mary Flemke (1989-2000); Mickey Landry (2000-2007); Kevin Reel (2007-2013); Aaron Schubach (2014 - 2020); and Tambi Tyler (2020 - present).  Campus buildings  The Colorado Springs School has four academic buildings covering Preschool through Grade 12. The high school building is called the El Pomar Building, as it was donated by the El Pomar Foundation The middle school and administrative offices are housed in the historic Trianon.The Children's Academic Center holds classrooms for Grade 1 through Grade 5. The Early Childhood Center has Preschool and Kindergarten classrooms. A theater and gallery are located in the Louisa Performing Arts Center. The Louise Honnen Tutt Field House is the school's gymnasium, locker rooms, weight room, and music classrooms. The Lewis B. Maytag Dining Hall is the cafeteria for all grade levels. The Carriage House holds art classrooms, a photography darkroom, and facilities offices.  Experiential education  The school offers experiential education to its students, which allows students to learn in \\"real world\\" experiences outside of the classroom through activity, project, place, service and problem-based learning.

The experiment terminated sometime in 2001 with no significant results. The name of the system was chosen to reflect the joint pen name of the authors of The Federalist Papers.  Design goals  The nine design goals of the Publius development team were: *Censorship resistance: decreasing the chance that a third party will manage to modify or delete the published materials. *Tamper evident: unauthorized changes are traceable. *Source anonymous: there is no way to tell who published the material once it is available on the web. *Updatable: publishers are allowed to modify or delete their material. *Deniable: third parties participating in publishing the materials lacks the responsibility for the hosted content. *Fault tolerant: system should function even when some involved third parties are faulty or malicious. *Persistent: there is no expiration date for published materials. *Extensible: support for future protocol extensions or growth in the number of publishers. *Freely available: all software tools required for the system should be out of charge. Overview The Publius web system consisted of the following agents: *Publishers - participants who publish their content on the web. *Servers - which host the publishers' content on the web (considered as part of the third parties). *Retrievers - participants who browse the web content published by the publishers. The Publius system relied on a static list of web servers. When a publisher wished to add a piece of content to the web, it was first encrypted using a random symmetric key. This key was split into parts such that a minimum number of shared parts were required for the reconstruction of the content (see also Secret sharing). Publius intended to support the hosting of HTML pages, images and other file formats such as PDFs and PostScripts. Reception The system opened in July 2000 for a two-month trial. The system was intended to make censorship by governments more difficult by spreading parts of documents among multiple decentralized locations and as such was a forerunner of later file sharing systems. The issues those later systems had with copyright violations and objectionable content were also foreseen with Publius. The ability of the system to distribute communication content without allowing for restriction or identification of the original uploader was called destabilizing. The project hasn't been updated since the initial trial.

The film is a recounting of the events that lead Zald√≠var to become a Marielito and leave Cuba for a better life in Miami. It premiered in 2003 on PBS as part of its P.O.V. series. It won two awards: the Grand Coral, First Prize, for Documentary and the Memoria Documentary Award (which was a joint win with Cuando lo peque√±o se hace grande). 90 Miles recounts the strange twist of fate that took Juan Carlos Zald√≠var across one of the world's most treacherous stretches of water. It is a journey of a family in search for healing and understanding. Probing and thoughtful, Zald√≠var uncovers the emotional distance opened in thousands of families by the 90 miles between the U.S. and Cuba. Synopsis In 1980, Zald√≠var was a 13-year-old who had grown up as a loyalist of the Cuban Revolution jeering in the streets at the thousands of \\"Marielitos\\" leaving the island by boat for the United States. However, within weeks, he had become a Marielito himself, headed with the rest of his family for a new life in Miami. Now a U.S.-based filmmaker, Zald√≠var recounts the strange twist of fate that took him across one of the world's most treacherous stretches of water in 90 Miles. As related by Zald√≠var in the intensely personal and evocative film, arrival in South Florida is only the beginning of the family's struggle to comprehend the full meaning of their passage into exile. What follows is an intimate and uneasy accounting of the historical forces that have split the Cuban national family in two, and which shape the passage of values from one generation to the next. 90 Miles was filmed over eight years, as the filmmaker returned to Cuba for the first time in 1998 to visit his hometown of Holgu√≠n, and again in 1999. Using news clips, family photos and home movies, the film creates a portrait of recent Cuban history, as dramatized by one family's aspirations and disappointments. Zald√≠var's is a tale rich in crossed borders, cultural re-assimilation and cross-cultural ferment. In the early 1980s, during the Mariel boatlift, Zaldivar was a highly promising student. Having grown in a socialist country, Zaldivar was happy to join in the regime's efforts to publicly humiliate some of the thousands of Cubans who were leaving in the boatlift, labeling them gusanos (worms). Unbeknownst to him, a change was in the horizon for Zaldivar and his family. One of his uncles who had fled to the U.S. in the 1960s offered to arrange the family's boatlift to Florida ‚Äî on the condition that all or none of the family go. The family was reluctant to interrupt the lives of their children ‚Äî Zald√≠var and his two sisters ‚Äî if the siblings were not willing. So the decision fell, for all practical purposes, on the young ones. Faced with the sudden possibility of leaving the country, Zald√≠var's family revealed to him, for the first time, their ongoing disillusionment with the Cuban Revolution. Out of this difference grew a cruel dilemma for the child. In the end, unable to deny his family the opportunity to start anew in Florida and deciding to place blind trust in his parents, Zald√≠var agreed to go. In the United States, though homesick and nostalgic for his homeland and surprised both by what he liked and disliked about North American life, Zald√≠var resumed learning and growing with the headstrong adaptability so often demonstrated by youth. He continued his media studies, moved to New York, became a filmmaker and came out as a gay man. Similarly, his two sisters made happy lives, marrying and having children. It is the older generation, which had most wanted to come to Florida, that experienced the greater problems. Zald√≠var's father, especially, grew depressed and remote from his son after arriving. The father's dream of building his own home in Cuba, derailed by the Revolution, seemed to lose its power in the United States, where many Cuban men find themselves working jobs well below their professional level. Feeling betrayed by the Cuban Revolution and defeated by the 'American Dream,' Zald√≠var's father withdrew into himself. Where Zald√≠var's revolutionary zeal in Cuba had created a divide of silence between father and son, in the U.S., the father's sense of failure and futility only widened the gap. 90 Miles is the account of Zald√≠var's quest to piece together the twists ‚Äî and consequences ‚Äî of his family's journey into exile. Above all, it is a search for understanding and healing between father and son, by uncovering the emotional distance opened up by just 90 miles of water between Cuba and the U.S. mainland.

His sidemen are Mick Taylor on guitar, John McVie on bass and Colin Allen on drums. The concert took place at the Wax Museum, Washington DC, on 17 June 1982. It was released in 1994 by Repertoire Records as a CD credited to John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. During the first two decades of his career John Mayall has been constantly experimenting with band formats and various musicians. In 1982 he teamed up with three musicians from his previous line-ups and toured briefly in America and Australia. At that time all of them were residing in the USA. Mick Taylor had left the Rolling Stones and was pursuing a solo career. John McVie had taken time off from his band Fleetwood Mac. Colin Allen, after disbanding Stone the Crows, had been a member of Focus. There is no evidence of studio recordings with this personnel, but another live performance with guest bluesmen (Albert King, Buddy Guy, Sippie Wallace, Junior Wells etc.) has been released on video as Blues Alive. For contractual reasons John Mayall did not release any new material during the first half of the 1980s. The CD and the video both appeared in the early 1990s, when Mayall had regained some of his popularity with a new incarnation of his 'Bluesbreakers'. More recordings from the tour were released in 2011.

It accounts for 90% of the hereditary cancers. The hereditary factors may be proven or suspected to cause the pattern of breast and ovarian cancer occurrences in the family. The name HBOC may be misleading because it implies that this genetic susceptibility to cancer is mainly in women. In reality, all sexes have the same rates of gene mutations and HBOC can predispose to other cancers including prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. For this reason, the term \\"King syndrome\\" has recently come into use. The new name references Mary- Claire King who identified the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Causes A number of genes are associated with HBOC. The most common of the known causes of HBOC are: * BRCA mutations: Harmful mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can produce very high rates of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as increased rates of other cancers. Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with a 39-46% risk of ovarian cancer and mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a 10-27% risk of ovarian cancer. Other identified genes include: *MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2: mutations in genes that lead to Lynch Syndrome put individuals at risk for ovarian cancer. *TP53: Mutations cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome. It produces particularly high rates of breast cancer among younger women with mutated genes, and despite being rare, 4% of women with breast cancer under age 30 have a mutation in this gene. * PTEN: Mutations cause Cowden syndrome, which produces hamartomas (benign polyps) in the colon, skin growths, and other clinical signs, as well as an increased risk for many cancers. * CDH1: Mutations are associated with lobular breast cancer and gastric cancer. * STK11: Mutations produce Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome. It is extremely rare, and creates a predisposition to breast cancer, intestinal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. * CHEK2: Approximately one out of 40 northern Europeans have a mutation in this gene, making it a common mutation. It is also one of the most frequently mutated genes after BRCA among Hispanics in the United States. Considered a moderate-risk mutation, it may double or triple the carrier's lifetime risk of breast cancer, and also increase the risk of colon cancer and prostate cancer. * ATM: Mutations cause ataxia telangectasia; female carriers have approximately double the normal risk of developing breast cancer. * PALB2: Studies vary in their estimate of the risk from mutations in this gene and the frequency of mutations in this gene may be different among different populations. It may be moderate risk, or as high as BRCA2. Approximately 45% of HBOC cases involve unidentified genes, or multiple genes.  Prevention  People with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are recommended to have a transvaginal ultrasound 1-2 times per year. Screening with CA-125 is also recommended. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes to prevent cancer) is recommended at age 35-40 for people with BRCA1 mutations and at age 40-45 for people with BRCA2 mutations.

Manufactured by Helicycle Ventures LLC in Mesilla, New Mexico as a kit, the aircraft is intended to be assembled by the owner and is considered a homebuilt aircraft. The Helicycle was conceived and designed by B.J. Schramm, the founder of RotorWay International. Development Schramm's concept for the Helicycle was to provide a kit for building a reliable, high-performance, real helicopter for a reasonable cost to individuals (on the order of a mid-priced SUV). Fabrication and assembly skills only require being able to accurately drill holes, bend sheet metal and tubing, install fasteners, run wiring, etc.; no welding or highly specialized aviation-specific tools are required. Kits are delivered in six increments, including the frame and skids, engine, transmission, main rotor subassembly, tail rotor subassembly, controls and linkages, cockpit exterior/interior, and fuel and electrical subsystems. Assembly instructions are provided in the form of video clips on video CDs (Video CDs) or DVDs, blueprints, and checklists. Design Specific design features include a fully harmonized rotor, a modulated collective pitch system, very low twice- per-revolution vibration level due to elastomeric thrust bearings, a sufficient flapping angle for low-\\"G\\" maneuvers and slope landings, control friction devices, and an electronic throttle control (governor). The feel of the controls in the Helicycle is modeled after that of the Robinson R22, such that quick stops and autorotations are performed similarly in both aircraft, reportedly allowing new pilots to transition to flying their kits with minimal adjustments. Operational history The Helicycle helicopter is the first experimental helicopter kit in mass-production to be powered by a turbine engine, the military surplus Solar T62-T32, capable of producing 150 shaft horsepower. The engine is limited to 95 horsepower due to torque limits on the main gearbox and rotor system. As of June 2010, five runs of about 30 kits each have been delivered to builders, for a total of 160 kits, of which more than 80 have been completed and are flying, with another kit being completed every other month, on average (delivery of a sixth run is scheduled to start in 2010). A unique feature of the kits is that a factory checkout must be completed by a factory-designated airframe and power plant (A&P;) technician and test pilot before the builder is allowed to fly the aircraft. The factory withholds a few critical components needed for flight, such as the main rotor bearings, which the factory representative brings to the checkout. In order to ensure that prospective pilots have the necessary flight skills, builders must have at least a solo endorsement from a certified flight instructor (CFI) for flying a commercially-built Robinson R22 helicopter. The total number of hours accumulated on all Helicycles flying is estimated to be well in excess of 3,000 flight hours, with three fatal accidents, the latest occurring on 28 September 2014 in rural Sumner county, Tennessee. The NTSB report on the fatal accident indicates extensive damage to the helicopter due to impact with a body of water. An examination of the anti-torque pedal assembly by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that the fracture surface patterns found on it were consistent with a bending overstress separation. It could not be determined whether the overstress condition was the result of a precrash or postcrash event. According to the probable cause report, N3275Q suffered \\"inflight collision with terrain/water\\", and \\"reason for occurrence undetermined - Pilot In Command\\". There have been several accidents and incidents where Helicycles have lost power in/near hover, resulting in minor damage to the skids and some airframes, but no serious injuries. Most of these were attributed to a radio-frequency interference (RFI) problem with the electronic governor, and the issue was reportedly solved with better shielding in 2005. At least one accident may have been caused by a crack in a fuel line due to lack of mechanical support between a manifold and a fuel injection port. Another accident involved flight into high-voltage power distribution wires, but the aircraft was able to fly again, following repairs, and the pilot was not seriously injured.

After playing 61 games for Hawthorn, Francis made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in round 9 of the 1934 season. Francis left the Hawks in controversial circumstances, due to a disagreement with the club and his family's sports store. Francis wanted the club to order their uniforms through his store, but when Hawthorn secretary Sam Ramsay refused, he asked for a clearance to Carlton. He retired as a player at the end of the 1943 season and was appointed coach of the Blues from 1956 to 1958. Under his tenure the Blues struggled despite having a good side on paper and Francis was sacked in 1958. Francis was bitter about the firing and never spoke to his former close friend and Carlton coaching successor Ken Hands again. Francis was appointed St Kilda Football Club senior coach for 1959‚Äì60, again achieving modest on-field results. His brothers John and Syd also played VFL football, both for Hawthorn.

The company is based in Wollongong, New South Wales. History =Founding= The WIN brand began from a sole free-to-air terrestrial television station in Wollongong, WIN-4, owned by Television Wollongong Transmissions (TWT). In 1979, then-owner Rupert Murdoch sold his 76 per cent controlling interest in TWT to Oberon Broadcasters, a private investment group which included Paramount Television programming executive Bruce Gordon. This allowed Murdoch to purchase Sydney station TEN-10. In 1985, TWT was made public on the-then Sydney Stock Exchange as TWT Holdings Limited with Gordon retaining a 70 per cent stake. Gordon privatised the business in 1992 to become WIN Corporation. =Expansion, aggregation and industry consolidation= In the late 1980s, the Federal Government's television equalisation program (known as aggregation) gave Gordon the opportunity to initiate a period of growth by acquiring television stations in regional Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania. In the late 1990s, WIN acquired their South Australian station and developed a new Western Australian station from scratch. These stations were integrated into what is now known as the WIN Network. The WIN Network covers large areas of regional Australia and has a total audience reach of 4.842 million people. Through Bruce Gordon's leadership, in the late 1990s and 2000s, WIN built stakes in PBL, Network Ten, and TPG Telecom. TPG Telecom was at the time known as SP Telemedia and owned fellow Nine affiliate NBN Television. August 2005 saw WIN purchase a controlling 50.1 per cent stake in satellite subscription television carrier SelecTV, however failure in adequately growing the subscriber base along with high debts saw the business placed in voluntary administration in February 2011. On 21 April 2007, the board of Sunraysia Television endorsed WIN's revised offer of $163 million for Channel Nine Perth , which went through on 8 June 2007. On 30 May 2007, Southern Cross Broadcasting announced its sale of Channel Nine Adelaide to WIN for $105 million. In June 2013, WIN offloaded the Nine-branded metropolitan Adelaide station to Nine Network's parent Nine Entertainment Co. for $140 million along with an option to purchase the Perth station, which was exercised in September 2013. In October 2015 WIN Corporation purchased a 14 per cent stake in Nine Entertainment Co. from investment fund operator Apollo. In 2008, WIN invested in a 50 per cent share of the Australian Poker League, buying from its founder Martin Martinez. However this stake was sold in 2012. On 4 June 2009, signalling their continued interest in digital assets, WIN increased to 18.4 per cent their stake in publicly listed company Quickflix, an Australian provider of online DVD rental and subscription movie and television series downloads. In the following years, WIN's share of the business dwindled down to 3.5 per cent as of 2014 as Quickflix continued to raise capital through issuing new shares. In April 2016, Quickflix entered voluntary administration. WIN held a long-term interest in a small cinema chain in Tasmania through a joint venture with Village Roadshow until 2013. The joint venture owned four cinemas which were branded as 'Village Cinemas'. This interest was originally acquired by ENT Ltd. in 1988. =Today= In early 2006, WIN Corporation bought a 25% stake in the St. George Illawarra Dragons from the Illawarra Steelers for $6.5 million. In August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake for a \\"commercially in confidence\\" sum, taking its stake to 50%. It was announced on 23 May 2016 that WIN Television had signed an affiliation agreement with Network Ten for a five-year period starting on 1 July 2016. WIN's former affiliation partner, Nine Network, signed with Southern Cross Austereo in April 2016 having secured a 50 per cent revenue share deal. WIN plays a prominent role in the local Illawarra community through investment in long-term naming rights to the Dragons' Wollongong home ground, WIN Stadium. WIN also holds naming rights to the neighbouring WIN Entertainment Centre, home to basketball's Illawarra Hawks. In June 2019, WIN closed several newsrooms throughout New South Wales and Queensland, including Orange, Wagga, Albury and Queensland's Hervey Bay.

St. Mary's colors are kelly green and white, and its mascot is the Pirate. History St. Mary's High School was originally envisioned by Father Robert Byrne in the 1880s, and was founded in 1885 as Loretto Academy by the Sisters of Loretto, with an initial enrollment of nine female students. Classes were held in local residences, moving numerous times to larger houses as enrollment grew. In 1889, the Sisters built a school on Sierra Madre, between Kiowa and Bijou, with the fourth floor serving as their residence. In 1897, St. Mary's Catholic Parish built a new church next door to Loretto Academy. In 1902, Loretto Academy was renamed St. Mary's School. At this time enrollment had grown to 250 boys and girls in classes from first grade through high school. 1904 saw the first graduation class of St. Mary's School, with two graduates. St. Mary's Parish purchased the school in 1912. In 1950, a new school was built on the southeast corner of Sierra Madre and Kiowa for first through eighth grade students, and the original building became the high school. A gym was built on the southeast corner of Sierra Madre and Bijou. Near the end of the 1950s, the school phased out the elementary grades to accommodate the larger number of students in the high school. In the early 1960s, the student population outgrew the current facilities, resulting in the building of the Catholic Education Center, which opened prior to Fall 1964. Throughout this period the Sisters of Loretto continued to provide the teaching staff of the school, mainly nuns of that order but also including lay professionals. Graduating classes of this time period routinely included more than 100 students. In the mid-1970s, due to the national shortage of sisters, the teaching staff became predominantly professional educators. On February 11, 1987, with some controversy the diocese announced the closure of St. Mary's High School due to mounting debt. A group of parents formed the Committee for Catholic Secondary Education and reopened the school in Fall 1987 as a Catholic high school not affiliated with the diocese, though still renting the original school facilities. In 1991 the diocese informed the school they would be selling the school buildings, and a search for a new site was undertaken. The school moved to its current location at 2501 East Yampa Street on August 23, 1992. The site had sufficient room for significant expansion, and the campus was improved with the additions of a chapel, additional classrooms, the Cove, stage, gymnasium, art and photography labs, and fitness center. In 2006 the school opened a multimillion-dollar sports facility on in the Cragmor neighborhood near the main campus, named The Grace Center for Athletics and Community Service. Notable alumni *Ben F.

For example, \\"sky\\" and \\"high\\"; \\"skylight\\" and \\"highlight\\". *The onset of the stressed syllable in the words must differ. For example, \\"bean\\" and \\"green\\" is a perfect rhyme, while \\"leave\\" and \\"believe\\" is not. Word pairs that satisfy the first condition but not the second (such as the aforementioned \\"leave\\" and \\"believe\\") are technically identities (also known as identical rhymes or identicals). Homophones, being words of different meaning but identical pronunciation, are an example of identical rhyme. Imperfect rhyme Half rhyme or imperfect rhyme, sometimes called near-rhyme, lazy rhyme, or slant rhyme, is a type of rhyme formed by words with similar but not identical sounds. In most instances, either the vowel segments are different while the consonants are identical, or vice versa. This type of rhyme is also called approximate rhyme, inexact rhyme, imperfect rhyme (in contrast to perfect rhyme), off rhyme, analyzed rhyme, suspended rhyme, or sprung rhyme. =Use in hip hop/rap= Half rhyme is often used, along with assonance, in rap music. This can be used to avoid rhyming clich√©s (e.g. rhyming \\"knowledge\\" with \\"college\\") or obvious rhymes, and gives the writer greater freedom and flexibility in forming lines of verse. Additionally, some words have no perfect rhyme in English, necessitating the use of slant rhyme.

The company was created in March 1984 as Tel-Optik, and filed a Cable Landing License application in September 1984 and together with Cable and Wireless of the United Kingdom, built the first privately financed transatlantic fiber optic cable, PTAT-1. It was turned on in May 1989 and was sold to Sprint Corporation in August 1989. PTAT-1 consisted of 3 operational fiber pairs and one spare fibre pair. The total bandwidth was 27 DS-3 channels of 45 Mbit/s each - a total of roughly 1.2 Gbit/s. When PTAT-1 was turned on it was 2/3s of the total bandwidth available across the Atlantic at the time. PTAT-1 was turned off when much larger systems made PTAT-1 no longer worth operating. The main spur of PTAT-1 linked New York and London via Manasquan NJ in the US, and Brean in the UK. A single fiber pair was looped down to Bermuda and up to Ireland providing 4 way connectivity. When planning started in the summer of 1983, the longest fiber system in the US was less than a mile long and ran at 1.5 Mbit/s, a T-1. The company was founded on premise that introducing international telecommunication competition would be easier via cable than via satellite, due to the regulatory environment that protected the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. The relevant regulation for a cable system was the Cable Landing License Act of 1921, which stipulated that the party at the other end of the cable be acceptable to the US. As a result of the competitive pressure that PTAT-1 introduced to the international telecommunications market, by the time the system was turned on, the international telecom monopoly between AT&T; and British Telecom was broken, and the cost of international telecommunications plummeted. PTAT-1 set the stage for the explosion of fiber optic systems which now circle the world. The founders of PTAT System, Inc. were Ron Coleman, Brian Hughes, Jim McGillan,& Connie Schaeffer. E. F. Hutton & Co. was the major financial partner in PTAT Systems. Ron Coleman was Chairman and Connie Schaeffer was the President when the Cable Landing License was filed. Ron Coleman was CEO and Chairman when the company was acquired by Sprint in 1989.

Naphthylisopropylamine acts as a non-neurotoxic releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, with EC50 values of 3.4 nM, 11.1 nM, and 12.6 nM, respectively. It also has affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors (EC50 values = 466 nM, 40 nM, and 2.3 nM, respectively), and acts as a full agonist at 5-HT2B and as a partial agonist at 5-HT2C, while its affinity for 5-HT2A is probably too low to be significant. In animal studies, naphthylisopropylamine was shown to reduce cocaine self-administration, yet produced relatively weak stimulant effects when administered alone, being a (much) lesser stimulant than d-amphetamine for comparison. Further research is now being conducted in primates to see if it will be a useful substitute for treating drug addiction in humans as well. An important observation is that in behavioral studies, rodents would consistently self-administer selective norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agents such as d-amphetamine, yet compounds that also release serotonin like naphthylisopropylamine would not be self-administered. In addition to the drugs (acute) effects on self- administration, all of the available evidence suggests that the locomotor activation caused by the majority of dopamine releasers is also dampened when the drugs also cause serotonergic release. In fact, PAL-287 causes no locomotor activation at all (although admittedly the tests were only after acute dosing). The high affinity of PAL-287 for 5-HT2C receptors meant that it functioned as a reliable anorectant and was being considered for this indication (i.e. weight loss). However, there were ultimately some concerns raised over the compounds affinity for 5HT2B receptors, since some of the more serious side effects of the serotonin releasing weight loss drug fenfluramine were linked to an activation of this receptor. Apparently, more research will have to be done to assess if PAL-287 causes activation of the 5HT2A and 5HT2B receptors in vivo. However, according to the authors, even the relatively safe drug MDMA causes heart disease, and the incidence being reported for fenfluramine was not that great, even though the evidence being presented was indisputable. Thus it is relatively more likely that any of the more serious side effects from using PAL-287 will only occur in cases of overdose, and not when using a clinically responsible amount of the drug.

He was born in Bahar village, near Serampore, Bengal. He started his career as a compositor at the Serampore Mission Press, later moving to Calcutta, where he first worked at the Ferris and Company Press before setting up his own, the Bengali Printing Press, along with his business partner, Harishchandra Ray. Having established a press, he started his own business specifically for publishing and selling Bengali books, something he had himself previously trialed at Ferris. Serampore's Samachar Darpan wrote highly of him. Apart from the few books he wrote, he published Gangabhaktitarangini, Lakshmicharitra, Betal Panchabingshati, Chanakya Sloka and a collaborative work by Lallu Lal and Ram Mohan Roy.

Works Bhattacharya is the author of various works: A Grammar in English and Bengalee Language (1816) ‚Äì Published at the Ferris and Co. Press. It contained what was necessary for knowledge of the English language, along with a translation. It was basically an English grammar in Bengali. It was published in a simple language for rousing interest among fickle-minded students. In the same year, another English grammar was published in Bengali called the English Darpan, by Ramachandra Roy. He was the assistant pundit in the Bengali department of Fort William College. Daybhag (1816-17) ‚Äì In 1816, in the introduction to English grammar, Ganga Kishore mentions that Daybhag was in the process of completion at the printing press of Ferris and Co.

It was a noted pro-Reformist publication that actively campaigned for the abolition(stop) of the Sati Pratha.  History  In the prospectus for the Sambad Kaumudi, published in English and Bengali in November 1821, Ram Mohan appealed to his countrymen to lend him \\"the support and patronage of all who feel themselves interested in the moral and intellectual improvement of our countrymen\\". In the same prospectus, he further stated that religious, moral and political matters, domestic occurrence, foreign as well as local intelligence including original communications on various hitherto unpublished interesting local topics, etc. would be published in the Sambad Kaumudi every Tuesday. Although Ram Mohan Roy was the owner, Kaumudi was actually published in the name of Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay. The latter soon found Ram Mohan's ideas too radical and parted company to start a rival newspaper called Samachar Chandrika, which became an organ of orthodox Hinduism. According to different source, Kaumudi was started by Tarachand Dutta and Bhabani Charan Bandopadhyay. The first issue of Sambad Kaumudi appeared on December 4, 1821. It contained an 'Appeal to the Bengali Public' in which it proclaimed that the primary object of its publication was to promote the 'public good'. On December 20, 1821, the Calcutta Journal brought out an editorial, commenting on the publication of this \\"new Bengali newspaper edited by a learned Hindoo\\". It also reproduced the prospectus and the 'Appeal to the Bengali Public'. In the appeal, Ram Mohan Roy said: Though Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay was nominally in charge of this weekly till the publication of its thirteenth issue, Ram Mohan was its promoter, and for all practical purposes, also its editor. After Bhabani Charan Bandyopadhyay, Harihar Dutta was the editor for some time, followed by Gobinda Chandra Kongar. Due to lack of sufficient patronage Kaumudi had to stop publication in October 1822. In April 1823 a license was granted under the new Press Regulation to Gobinda Chandra Kongar to publish and Ananda Gopal Mukherji to edit the newspaper.  Campaign against Sati  Sambad Kaumudi regularly editorialised against Sati, denouncing it as barbaric and un-Hindu. It was the main vehicle of Ram Mohan Roy's campaign against Sati. The editorial in the Calcutta Journal on February 14, 1823 observed, \\"The paper which was considered so fraught with danger and likely to explode over all India like a spark thrown into a barrel of gunpowder, has long since fallen to the ground for want of support; chiefly we understand because it offended the native community by opposing some of three customs, and particularly the burning of Hindoo widows, etc.\\" Governor-General Bentinck, largely (though not exclusively) instigated by Ram Mohan Roy, responded to the growing public outcry by outlawing Sati in 1829. Reportedly Mr Roy opposed Sati practice (burning of widow with the dead husband's corpse)but two things, in this context, he did, which make his movement just an eyewash and untrustworthy. 1. He did not oppose the Hindu scriptures which issue religious command to commit Sati. He kept worshiping those scriptures. So the Hindus kept burning their widows. Only when the then Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck banned it thru Law, people were stopped doing so. 2\\\\. The remedy, he told, was worse than the disease. He did not oppose marrying girls of innocent age (5 years to 15 years) to as old as 50-60 years old. He himself remarried a 6 year old widow at the age of 50+. The original writer of the Article should have provided this vital information.  Government Attitude  The Government viewed the newspaper with an eye of suspicion. The officials believed that the newspaper was inspired by the Calcutta Journal and patronized by its owner James Silk Buckingham. The Asiatic Journal, the unofficial organ of the East India Company published from London took Buckingham to task for encouraging and patronizing an Indian newspaper like the Sambad Kaumudi which, it thought, could serve no other purpose that to promote Indian disaffection against British rule.

However, since the 1970s, women have made inroads in both professional and volunteer fire departments in multiple countries. In modern times, women have served in a variety of fire service roles including as fire chiefs. Nonetheless, they comprise less than 20% of firefighters even in the countries where they are best represented.  History  Many ancient civilizations had a form of organized firefighting. One of the earliest recorded fire services was in Ancient Rome. The Aboriginal Australians had been managing and responding to wildfires for thousands of years, with women being involved. Firefighting became more organized from the 18th century onwards, led with the rise of insurance companies and then with the rise of government fire services in the 19th century. In 1818, Molly Williams was recorded as being the first female firefighter in the United States. As a slave in New York City, she joined a volunteer engine company. Young women in boarding houses in the United Kingdom were taught fire drills, including high ladder rescues. During World War II, women served in the wartime fire services of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, though mostly in administrative and support roles. As a result of the second-wave feminism movement and equal employment opportunity legislation, official obstacles to women were removed from the 1970s onwards. The first female firefighter in the United Kingdom was recruited in 1976, while the first in New Zealand joined in 1981. Many fire departments required recruits to pass tough fitness tests, which became an unofficial barrier to women joining. This led to court cases in a number of countries. In 1982, Brenda Berkman won a lawsuit against the New York City Fire Department over its restrictive fitness test. She and 40 others then joined as its first female firefighters. A similar lawsuit led to the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in 1999 that fire departments could not use restrictive fitness tests unless they could justify the need for them. Nevertheless, the percentage of women recruited by fire departments has been low. In the UK, women make up 5% of firefighters which is less than the percentage for police officers (29%), paramedics (38%)Health & Care Professionals Council: Gender breakdown of paramedics and military personnel (10%). A report by the London Fire Brigade found that discouraging factors included the portrayal of firefighting in the media, a lack of information available to young girls and unrealistic ideas about the role.London Fire Brigade recruitment report Other issues include shift patterns that are not suitable for mothers with young children.  By country  = Australia = The Aboriginal Australians developed techniques for managing bushfires in the 60,000 years before the arrival of European settlers, with women being involved.  Amazon Ladies Fire Brigade  Excluding these indigenous precursors, the first all-female firefighting crew was recruited in 1901 in Armidale, New South Wales.Australia. It was formed in response to a fire at Cunningham House in the same town. Known as The Amazons this volunteer crew complimented the all-male paid firefighting crew, and was the first example in Australia of male and female crews doing routine fire drills together using the same equipment. Station Officer Minnie Webb was the first female Captain in Australia. The creation of the Amazon Ladies Fire Brigade and their operational and dress uniforms was inspired by Captain Webb of the paid firefighting brigade in Armidale. Captain J.T.A. Webb became captain in 1898. He held this position until his death on 17 May 1924. He formed the first women's fire brigade in the early 1900s and also instructed the all-female brigade at the New England Girls School and the fire squad at The Armidale School in October 1923. Penrith Fire Museum has an archived collection on Captain Webb's career. Webb immigrated from England, and where he had seen the trained female fire responders that were common at all-female British boarding schools (see United Kingdom, below on this page). The Amazons was a one-off local initiative and the Webb children were recruited into both the male and female brigades. The model was not adopted elsewhere in Australia. However, the Dubbo Dispatch and Independent Bulletin of 1905 reportedTROVE 43 digitized newspaper articles in TROVE about the Amazons 1902‚Äì1905 that the Dubbo Brigades had attended in Dubbo with 'upwards of 70 Brigades' from across NSW, and an 'exhibition of hose and ladder...and life- saving' had been performed by the Amazon Ladies Brigade UNE Archives and Heritage Centre the original images of the Amazon Ladies Fire Brigades (framed memorial photographic collection)article with photographs written by the Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1871‚Äì1912), Wednesday 8 February 1905, page 353. Unlike Britain, Australian jurisdictions did not establish voluntary female brigades during WWI, and despite great interest in the Amazons during 1901‚Äì1905, no other jurisdictions took up the idea. Captain Minnie Webb went on to become a nurse serving in WWI.  Women's fire auxiliaries in World War II  As was the case in Britain, women's fire auxiliaries were established in World War II in most jurisdictions in Australia to fill vacancies created when male firefighters enlisted in the war. Tasmania was ordering uniforms for the Women's Fire Auxiliary in January 1940. On 20 August 1941, the Tasmania Women's Fire Auxiliary were part of a parade (a march-past) for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill. Queensland established a Women's Fire Auxiliary in October 1941. Their duties were to include \\"driving and trailing vehicles to fires, repairing hoses, operating chemical extinguishers, looking after canteens, and extinguishing incendiary bombs\\". The Forestry Department of Western Australia recruited an all-female fire crew in Sawyers Valley. Initially only employed on weekends, they became full-time. In addition to fire suppression they carried out fuel reduction burning, firebreak maintenance, fire spotting and upgrading bush phone lines. In 1942 the WA Fire Auxiliary, made of up men and women, gave a demonstration of their skills. In the same year (1942) the Board of Fire Commissioners of NSW established the Women's Fire Auxiliary. Women served as volunteer firefighters in urban and rural locations across Australia and New Zealand. In New South Wales, recruitment took place in Wagga Wagga, Newcastle Wollongong and Broken Hill. A uniform, including a helmet, dress uniform hat, operational overalls and dress uniform jacket was provided. The Australian War Memorial has photos of the NSWFB uniform. Dorothy Barrett, organiser and Chief of the NSW Women's Fire Auxiliary was photographed in 1946 in uniform No book has been written about the female chiefs of the Women's Fire Auxiliaries, though Trove has established a 1947 press cuttings book. Also in 1942, South Australia established a Women's Fire Auxiliary and recognition was given to the vital role women were to play in emergency response. At the 2006 Women in Fire Fighting Conference, Childs curated a reproduction of historic uniforms. In the post-war era, women remained unable to join fire services as paid firefighters, though there was a growth of local women's auxiliaries across Australia. In the 21st century, these women would be seen as providing operational support and contributing to community fire safety, but in the post-war era they were often portrayed and respected as tea ladies and sandwich makers. The women who volunteered made an important contribution to fire preparedness and response. Modern developments After the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, official limits on women joining were removed. In 1985, Heather Barnes, Denise Butcher, Dawn Maynard and Allison Meenahan joined New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB) as Australia's first paid career firefighters. In 1998, the NSWFB (now Fire and Rescue NSW) appointed its first female station officers. The first National Women in Firefighting Forum (thereafter known as WIFF) was held in 2005 at Sydney Airport with the theme of \\"Firing Up Women\\". It was opened with a keynote address by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Gow. A second conference was held in 2006 and included New Zealand female firefighters. The theme was \\"Same but Different\\". The first timeline of women in firefighting was created. A vote was unanimously recorded to establish a women in firefighting association run by and for female firefighters, and out of this vote Women and Firefighting Australasia (WAFA) was born. In 2007 the first Board of WAFA was established with Susan Courtney as its president. Prior to 2005 most research, including health, uniform and risk research assumed all cohorts were male, with Robyn Cooper's work in 1997 an exception. From 2005 onwards, some research has been done into roles and challenges for female firefighters in Australia.ref> In 2006 Childs reported that less than 5% of any fire service in Australia was made up of full-time paid female firefighters, and also reported a web survey under the title \\"Not just fitting in\\". Ainsworth et al (2013) argued that in 2006 indicated that out of 33,659 volunteer firefighters, 3,798 (11%) were women. In 2011, this number had increased to 5,466 (14%). In 2015 a report by Women in Firefighting Australasia found that no fire agency had succeeded in improving the overall percentage about 5%.http://s3-ap- southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wh1.thewebconsole.com/wh/6807/images/Gender-balance- overview.pdf However, while overall total percentages had not been exceeded between 2006 and 2015, overall percentages across all fire services had improved. For example, the Northern Territory had improved from 0% to 2%. The percentage of career female firefighters remain at or below 5% of Australian fire services agencies, despite the history and activism noted above. Controversy remains acute. Allegations of sexism and bullying remain. There has also been a movement towards setting physical standards based on evidence of what is necessary.

The terms \\"smoke-eaters\\" and \\"leather lungs\\" were used to describe firemen who had no need to come out for fresh air, and this success was attributed to male facial hair that was thought to act as a \\"watery sponge\\" that held fresh air. Since they lacked this facial hair, women were unable to earn these titles. In the late 1800s, many fire halls, including ones in Nova Scotia, united to compete in sports and physical challenges relating to fire fighting. However, it would not be until over one hundred years later, during the feminist movements of the 1960s, that the absence of women in contact sports was questioned. A \\"boys' club\\" culture existed in many fire departments, as the majority of the firefighters were white males. The firefighters were held to strict standards and were fined (or could even be fired) for spitting on the floor, being late to meetings, and being drunk on or off duty. However, many of the firefighters would support each other by not reporting another member when they were intoxicated. In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a mandatory fitness test for those seeking to become firefighters in British Columbia unfairly discriminated against women. The test had been based on the physiology of male firefighters. The Court ruled that employers must show that any required workplace tests are necessary, and that there has been some effort to accommodate individuals. Female-focused camps to train young women in firefighting skills have been created by fire departments in Ottawa and London, Ontario, and have led to similar camps being established in the U.S. Currently, only 3% of firefighters in Canada are women. Many female firefighters have reported facing resistance when they try to move up in rank, feeling the need to be overqualified in order to compensate for their gender and to prove that they were hired based on merit and not simply an attempt at diversification.Poulin, C., Gouliquer, L., McWilliams, J., Young, P., Tucker, W., & Moore, A.

Women were again recruited during World War II, especially as drivers. This continued until 1955 when they had all been replaced by men. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), women were extensively used both in support roles and as frontline firefighters. Women continued to take up all roles in the 1990s. The first recorded female firefighter in Berlin was Tanja Grunwald, in April 1994 . Female professional firefighters now number about 1,000 (2.3%), with approximately 80,000 volunteers (10%). = Norway = The first documented female firefighters in Norway joined the fire services during the 1980s.in Norwegianin Norwegian In 2011, 3.7% of the Norwegian firefighters were women.(in Norwegian) = Hong Kong = The Hong Kong Fire Services Department started recruiting women for control and ambulance staff in the 1980s; however, the first firewoman was not hired until 1994.

In 1887 it was reported that women employed in a cigar factory in Liverpool had been formed into a fire brigade, and had effectively extinguished a fire at the factory.The Forest Republican., May 11, 1887, page 1, citing the London publication Fireman During World War I, women's brigades carried out firefighting and rescue in the South of England.British Pathe Women's Fire Brigade During the 1920s, women firefighting teams were employed by private fire brigades.Daily Mirror 24 Sep 1923, 26 May 1924, 6 Oct 1924 At the beginning of World War II, 5000 women were recruited for the Auxiliary Fire Service, rising to 7,000 women in what was then the National Fire Service. Though trained in firefighting, women were not there for that purpose, but rather for such positions as driving and firewatching. Many received awards for heroism.London Fire Brigade Women in the Fire Service In the modern era, some of the first women to participate in firefighting were based at Gordonstoun School near Elgin in Scotland. The school's staff and pupils had participated in a volunteer unit of the local Grampian Region Fire Brigade (GRFB) since the school's return from Wales in 1948. In 1972, the school accepted girls as pupils for the first time and from 1975 women were accepted into the voluntary firefighting unit. They were not initially allowed to be official members of the GRFB, but could operate only within the school. The turning point took place in 1976, when the scale of a forest fire on Ben Aigan near Craigellachie on Speyside led the GRFB to seek volunteers from the local community to help fight the fire. Alongside personnel from local Royal Air Force bases, a group of trained women firefighters from Gordonstoun attended. The performance and endurance of this group over seven days and nights of firefighting led the GRFB to agree to allow women to take on official front-line firefighting roles for the first time. The drought of the same year led to a call for extra firefighters and prompted other brigades to allow women to join. Mary Joy Langdon joined the East Sussex Fire Brigade on August 21 as a retained firefighter and was described by the press as Britain's first female firefighter.Sunday Express August 20, 2006, p 35 \\"I was Britain's first female firefighter\\"London Fire Brigade news release 26 Feb 2016 UK‚Äôs first woman firefighter hosts Royal fire safety day at famous Wormwood Scrubs Pony CentreThe Argus 19 Aug 2016 Sussex's first fire woman on her days in the brigade In 1978, it was announced that women would be accepted into the fire service. Josephine Reynolds became the country's first female wholetime firefighter when she joined Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service in 1983, after a year of training. In 2002, the Equal Opportunities Commission submitted a seven-page submission to the Independent Review of the Fire Service criticizing numerous practices which contributed to the extremely low recruitment of women and racial minorities in the fire service. In particular, the Commission highlighted the system of long day and night shifts, which likely discouraged women with children from applying, and the practice of only allowing those with firefighting experience to move into the higher ranks, which meant that control staff were ineligible. In 2011, Ann Millington became the first female chief fire officer, taking charge of the Kent Fire and Rescue Service..

She was an African American slave from New York, named Molly Williams, who was said to be \\"as good a fire laddie as many of the boys.\\" In the 1820s, Marina Betts was a volunteer firefighter in Pittsburgh. Then, in 1863, Lillie Hitchcock was made an honorary member of the Knickerbocker Engine Company, No. 5., in San Francisco in 1863. The first paid fire company was in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1853, and was all men. Women remained volunteer for years after. In the 1910s, there were women's volunteer fire companies in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Los Angeles, California. During World War I, many women entered the workforce to replace the men who were fighting overseas. This resulted in thousands of women working in traditionally male-dominated professions, for example, the military hired approximately 11 000 women by 1918 for clerical work. In 1936 Emma Vernell became the first official female firefighter in New Jersey, after her husband died in the line of duty. During World War II, some women served as firefighters in the United States to replace male firefighters who joined the military; and during part of the war, two fire departments in Illinois were all-female. In 1942, the first all-female forest firefighting crew in California was created. In the 1960s, there were all-female fire companies in Kings County, California, and Woodbine, Texas. During the summer of 1971, an all-female Bureau of Land Management (BLM) firefighting crew fought fires in the wilds of Alaska. Furthermore, an all-female United States Forest Service firefighting crew fought fires in 1971 and 1972 in Montana. Ruth E. Capello was the first known female fire chief in the United States. She was born in 1922 and became fire chief of the Butte Falls fire department in Butte Falls, Oregon in 1973. She died at the age of 70 in 1992. Over 100 years after the first paid male firefighter, Sandra Forcier became the first known paid female firefighter (excluding forest firefighting) in the United States, and began working in North Carolina in 1973 for Winston-Salem Fire Department. Forcier was a Public Safety Officer, a combination of police officer and firefighter. The first woman to work solely as a paid firefighter (excluding forest firefighting) was Judith Livers, hired by the Arlington County, Virginia fire department in 1974. Brenda Berkman took legal action against a discriminating physical test of the New York City Fire Department in 1982. After winning the case, women were allowed to join the New York City Fire Department; she and about 40 other women became the first female firefighters in the history of New York City. Berkman was also the founder of the United Women Firefighters and became the first openly gay person to be a paid firefighter. Chief Rosemary Bliss was the first female head of a career fire department in Tiburon, California. She became fire chief in 1993.Associated Press March 17,2002 All-male image burns firefightersMankind, Other Lazy Terms, Return to News Pages ‚Äì 2011 Women's eNews Inc. In 2002, approximately 2% of all firefighters were female in the United States. Sarinya Srisakul was the first Asian-American woman to be hired by the New York City Fire Department in 2005. In 2013, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti vowed to make sure that 5% of the Los Angeles Fire Department's firefighters were women by 2020. As of 2018 3.1% of the department's firefighters are women. In 2015, the New York City Fire Department had 58 women, representing less than 0.5% of the 10,000 active operational firefighters. Regina Wilson also became the first woman president of the Vulcan Society (African-American Firefighters Association). As of 2016, 7% of firefighters in the United States were females = South Korea = Kim Da-yeon, the first female firefighter in South Korea to participate in The Strongest Firefighter Games In 2019, Jung Moon-ho, the commissioner of National Fire Agency, said, \\"We will increase the proportion of women by 10% of the prefecture as there are many demands for recruiting firefighters regardless of gender\\". As of the end of October 2018, the number of firefighters in South Korea was 48,146. Of these, 3,610 women (7.5 percent) were women.https://news.joins.com/article/23320450  Terminology  For much of the last century, firefighting was a male-dominated or exclusively male profession. As such, firefighters were commonly called \\"firemen\\", an informal title still used by some civilians today. The title \\"firefighter\\" has become the universally accepted terminology in NFPA training materials and is used by English speaking professionals and trained volunteers as both the basic rank and overall job title that is often paired with the addition of a firefighter's EMT certification level (e.g., \\"Firefighter-Paramedic Jane Doe\\").http://www.carmel.in.gov/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=195  Challenges  Since women have only begun to be widely hired or accepted as volunteer firefighters in the last 30‚Äì40 years, there have been many difficult adjustments for the fire service. In many places, the fire service is steeped in tradition and formalized, paramilitary relationships.The Guardian 16 April 2012 \\"Burning issues for female firefighters\\" A 1998 article in Fire Engineering noted that firefighters tend to form tight-knit communities which value \\"strength, courage, and loyalty\\" but can be \\"resistant to change\\". Even if women are socially accepted members of the fire service, it is on the basis of gendered assumptions that they will bring more balanced decision making and nurturing qualities to a team of firefighters. = Health = In 2017, a study of female firefighters' occupational stress in the U.S. found that 40% of the women had engaged in binge drinking in the previous month, and 16.5% screened positive for problem drinking. According to the study, \\"problem drinkers were more than 2.5 times as likely to have been diagnosed with a depressive disorder or to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress.\\" Those with less than seven years of service were the most likely to report issues with drinking. In Canada, a lack of health coverage is often an issue for female firefighters in certain provinces. Although many cancers are covered as known occupational risks because of overexposure to fire, smoke, and toxic fumes, breast cancer is not yet covered nationwide. Although women in the fire service are generally more healthy and fit than their male coworkers as well as women in the wider population, they experience higher rates of miscarriage and preterm births. This may be linked to occupational hazards such as environmental toxins, heavy lifting, and irregular shift work. In 2012, the International Association of Firefighters in the U.S. recommended that all fire departments create policies on pregnancy and/or maternity leave, but in a study in 2018 nearly a quarter of female firefighters reported that their departments had no such policies. = Facilities and equipment = One major hurdle to entrance into firefighting for women was the lack of facilities. The immediate problem of sleeping quarters and bathing areas had to be solved before women could participate fully in firefighting as an occupation and as a culture. Communal showers and open bunk halls were designed for men only. Today, fire stations, as public entities, must either follow gender equity law or face judicial injunctions; thus, they are now designed to accommodate firefighters of both genders. However, some female firefighters still face issues related to their gender. A pan-Canadian study found that equipment, services and resources for female firefighters are often inadequate. Gear is often not made for women and offsite there is often no proper facilities for feminine hygiene needs.Lesmana, M., Poulin, C., & Gouliquer, L. (2015). The experience of female firefighters: Confronting Ageism and Sexism. Poster-presentation at the 76th annual convention of the Canadian Psychological Association, Ottawa, Canada, June 3‚Äì6. = Discrimination = A 2015 study on women in the wildland firefighting profession in Australia found that 55% reported seeing gender discrimination of others, while 45% reported experiencing it themselves. = Sexual dimorphism = There have been occasional charges of some departments lowering standards so that they could hire more women. In 2005, Laura Chick (the LA City Controller) stated in a report that Fire Chief Bamattre lowered physical requirements for female recruits and ordered that women be passed even if they failed their tests. However, many female firefighters reject any form of accommodation or special treatment, in part because they wish to prove themselves in the same way as their male counterparts, and in part because they fear it will make them a target for harassment. = Sexual harassment = Studies have found that women working in male-dominated professions, such as firefighting, experience more sexual harassment that those working in traditional female professions. This increased rate of harassment is worsened further when women are in the minority, as they often are in the fire service, because the majority group in such circumstances tends to view those in the minority as token representatives of their group rather than individuals. In a survey conducted by Women in the Fire Service in 1995, 551 women in fire departments across the U.S. were asked about their experiences with sexual harassment and other forms of job discrimination. Eighty-eight percent of fire service women responding had experienced some form of sexual harassment at some point in their fire service careers or volunteer time. Nearly 70% of the women in the survey said that they were experiencing ongoing harassment at the time of the study. Of the 339 women who indicated that they had complained about harassment, only a third (115 women) listed positive-only outcomes: investigating/taking care of the problem and disciplining the harasser. Twenty-six percent said that they were retaliated against for having reported the incident. Many Canadian female firefighters admit to experiencing some levels of systemic gendered violence such as sexual harassment and assault, which includes groping and being solicited for sexual services.Gerhardt, E. (2017). Women under fire: The negative treatment of female firefighters. (Unpublished honours thesis). University of New Brunswick: Fredericton, NB. Female firefighters who experience harassment have been found to be more hesitant to report it because they fear negative consequences such as exclusion and the exacerbation of the harassment.Poulin, C., Gouliquer, L., & McWilliams, J. (2017). Othering of full-time and volunteer female firefighters in the Canadian Fire Services. Manuscript in preparation.McWilliams, J., Poulin, C., & Gouliquer L. (2017). Symposium: New Rules, Same Results: Othering of volunteer and full-time female firefighters in Canada. 78th annual convention of the Canadian Psychological Association, Toronto, Ontario, June 8‚Äì10. Many female firefighters have reported avoiding feminine apparel such as high heels, dresses, and makeup when around their male coworkers, for fear of being hypersexualized and becoming the target of sexual assault or harassment. In 2016, a Canadian male firefighter was charged with two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault with a weapon in connection with his harassment of a female coworker. An American nationwide study found that the majority of female firefighters that experience sexual harassment do not report it to their superiors, in many instances because the supervisor was involved in or already knew about the behavior. When harassment was reported, no formal action was taken in the majority of cases. Sexually harassed female firefighters are significantly more likely to report experiencing job stress.

Cade's RoadSelkirk (2001) page 212 is a postulated Roman Road in north-east England. It is named after John Cade of Durham, an 18th-century antiquarian who in 1785 proposed its existence and possible course from the Humber Estuary northwards to the River Tyne, a distance of about . Although evidence exists for such a road on some parts of the proposed route, there is still some doubt regarding its exact course.Selkirk (2001) pages 212-217 The road's Roman name is unknown. Route =From the Humber to the Tees= Cade's Road began at Brough where there was a ferry, a Roman fort and civilian settlement (Petuaria) alongside a major Celtic settlement. The road ran northwards through Thorpe le Street and Market Weighton, before gradually turning westwards (possibly following the line of another Roman road) until it reached York (Roman Eboracum). From York it continued northwards to Thornton-le-Street near Thirsk and on to cross the River Tees (on a stone bridge now gone, but stones of which are incorporated into local buildings)Selkirk (2001) page 217 near Middleton St George and Middleton One Row, where 'Pounteys Lane' is possibly named after the Roman Pons Tees (Bridge of Tees). =From the Tees to the Tyne= From the Tees the road heads north through Sadberge and then Great Stainton (also known as Stainton-le-Street) near Sedgefield. The route of the road in the Durham area is unknown, but it is thought the road passed east of Durham City, crossing the River Wear at Kepier.Selkirk (2001) pages 214-217 The road ran past the Roman fort of Concangis, located at Chester-le-Street.Selkirk (2001) pages 212-213 Concangis is the only known Roman fort on the road between York and Newcastle. From Concangis the road headed north through Birtley to Wrekenton, once a village but now a suburb of Gateshead. From Wrekenton, a branch road, known as the Wrekendyke, headed north-east to the Roman fort and harbour of Arbeia at South Shields. It has been conjectured that the site of a Roman fort exists on the golf course at Wrekenton, but this has never been confirmed. Cade‚Äôs Road continued north from Wrekenton along Gateshead High Street and crossed the Tyne over the Roman bridge of Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne). It is not believed that the road continued north of Hadrian's Wall.

Pre- Reformation The settlement grew up round a castle of the Counts of Dillingen, the Herwartstein, which in the 13th century passed to the Counts of Helfenstein. In 1286 it was besieged by Rudolf of Habsburg, surrendered after two weeks and was demolished. In 1303, Emperor Albert I founded a Cistercian monastery here, which was settled from Salem Abbey. When the permanent buildings were constructed between 1310 and 1325, most of the stone came from the ruined castle. The new monastery was called K√∂nigsbronn, from which the town took its name. Albert granted it as part of its endowment the advowson of the church of Reutlingen, where the K√∂nigsbronner Klosterhof remains to this day; it is now used as the local history museum of Reutlingen. The whole region was not only strategically situated but was also from an early period a highly productive centre for ore extraction and metal working, which made it unusually valuable. Its possession was therefore keenly sought after, and it was frequently used as a political bargaining counter. The new monastery was thus, by virtue of its position, caught up from its inception in the political and economic conflicts of the period. Almost immediately after its foundation it was involved in the conflict between Louis of Bavaria and the papacy, in which it sided with the papacy. This then brought it into opposition to the Counter-king and later Emperor Charles IV, whose troops attacked it in 1346. In 1347 Charles not only pardoned it but compensated it for the damage by the gift of the advowson of the church of Pfullendorf. In 1353 however Charles granted the Vogtei (advocacy, or right of protection) to the Counts of Helfenstein. From then until the early 16th century the abbey was caught up in continuing political disruption between the surrounding states and great families. At various times the monastery or the Vogtei (or both) was given, generally along with Heidenheim, to the Counts of Helfenstein or the rulers of W√ºrttemberg or Austria, and different emperors alternately granted it away in exchange for favours or mortgaged it, and then restored it to independence. On a couple of occasions it was given to the city of Ulm. It was put under Imperial protection on several occasions, and at some point during this period was granted Reichsfreiheit as an Imperial abbey in an effort to shield it. K√∂nigsbronn was always a small community, on several occasions during the 15th century so severely reduced and demoralised that it barely survived. In 1513 Melchior Ruff became abbot of K√∂nigsbronn and for the first time in its history was able to put it on a stable financial and political footing. In recognition of his great achievements he was granted the pontificalia by Pope Leo X. Reformation and after On the death of Melchior Ruff in 1539 the state of W√ºrttemberg attempted to reform the monastery, but the monks were able to resist the attempt. The town of K√∂nigsbronn was destroyed in 1552 during the Schmalkaldic War and in the following year the monastery was forcibly Lutheranised; the Roman Catholic monks were expelled. It was proposed in the Restitution Edict of 1629 that the monastery should revert to being Catholic, which it accordingly was between 1630 and 1632, and again between 1635 and 1648, but the opposition of the population of K√∂nigsbronn thwarted both attempts, and the monastery remained a Protestant establishment until it was wound up in 1710. Buildings The monastery church and buildings on the bank of the River Brenz still stand. The church contains the monument of Anna Beatrix von Schl√ºsselburg (d. 1355), wife of Count Ulrich IX of Helfenstein, a great patroness and protector of the abbey. The former abbey gatehouse is now the Torbogenmuseum, a museum of local history, and also accommodates the Baden-W√ºrttemberg State Fishing Museum . Brewery The monastery brewery continued after 1710 as a commercial enterprise and is still in production today as the Klosterbrauerei K√∂nigsbronn AG.

It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and the manner in which the fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or what is left of it) is normally subject to PIE in order to find out what happened. One site where PIE is done is the ITU which is the EU centre for the study of highly radioactive materials. Materials in a high radiation environment (such as a reactor) can undergo unique behaviors such as swellingArmin F. Lietzke, Simplified analysis of nuclear fuel pin swelling, NASA TN D-5609, 1970 and non-thermal creep. If there are nuclear reactions within the material (such as what happens in the fuel), the stoichiometry will also change slowly over time. These behaviors can lead to new material properties, cracking, and fission gas release:  Fission gas release  As the fuel is degraded or heated the more volatile fission products which are trapped within the uranium dioxide may become free.J.Y. Colle, J.P. Hiernaut, D. Papaioannou, C. Ronchi, A. Sasahara, Journal of Nuclear Materials, 2006, 348, 229.  Fuel cracking  As the fuel expands on heating, the core of the pellet expands more than the rim which may lead to cracking. Because of the thermal stress thus formed the fuel cracks, the cracks tend to go from the centre to the edge in a star shaped pattern. In order to better understand and control these changes in materials, these behaviors are studied. . Due to the intensely radioactive nature of the used fuel this is done in a hot cell. A combination of nondestructive and destructive methods of PIE are common. In addition to the effects of radiation and the fission products on materials, scientists also need to consider the temperature of materials in a reactor, and in particular, the fuel. Too high fuel temperatures can compromise the fuel, and therefore it is important to control the temperature in order to control the fission chain reaction. The temperature of the fuel varies as a function of the distance from the centre to the rim. At distance x from the centre the temperature (Tx) is described by the equation where œÅ is the power density (W m‚àí3) and Kf is the thermal conductivity. :Tx = TRim \\\\+ œÅ (rpellet2 \\\\- x2) (4 Kf)‚àí1 To explain this for a series of fuel pellets being used with a rim temperature of 200 ¬∞C (typical for a BWR) with different diameters and power densities of 250 Wm‚àí3 have been modeled using the above equation. Note that these fuel pellets are rather large; it is normal to use oxide pellets which are about 10 mm in diameter. {  Temperature profile for a 20 mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 250 W per cubic meter. Note the central temperature is very different for the different fuel solids.

History La Punta, like El Morro, was designed to protect access to Havana from frequent attack by corsairs. Initially, in 1559, lookouts were posted at La Punta. In 1582 King Felipe II, convinced that it was necessary to reinforce fortresses and fleets, ordered the creation of a fortress system in several places of America, centered on Havana. Juan de Tejeda was appointed governor of the island because of his expertise in fortification. He brought along the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Antonelli, who has been considered the most renowned professional to practice in 16th century Cuba. The works began by 1590 and went on slowly. In 1595 a hurricane severely damaged the fortress, among other reasons, due to the thinness of its walls that were then more solidly rebuilt. By 1602 there was such a delay in the construction work that the engineer decided to make the fortress into a keep holding some 10 to 12 artillery pieces. Finally, as the years went by it was taken apart, leaving just 3 bastions. In 1630, due to the short distance between La Punta and El Morro and to increase the protection of the bay, a heavy copper chain was laid between them. One can see this chain in some of the engravings of that time. In 1762 the British expedition against Cuba took its toll on all the fortresses. The safety curtains and bastions of La Punta were destroyed during the invasion. At this time a chain branching out in several directions and held by heavy wood beams was laid. Its ends were tied to guns set-in at La Punta and El Morro. Some fragments of this piece still remain. Later on, with the Spanish back in power, a new governor arrived, fixing and enlarging the fortification system. In the 19th century some changes, such as the 4 esplanades built to accommodate a corresponding number of artillery pieces, were added at La Punta. La Punta, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World (circa 1921-1939) In 1851 the Spanish executed most of the prisoners they held at La Punta, including Venezuelan adventurer Narciso L√≥pez, after a failed attempt to liberate Cuba that caused outrage in the United States. The castle, in 1997, was under an intense work of restoration, (by the City‚Äôs Historian Office), that gave it its original position on the rocks. Thanks to this work canons that were engraved in the rocks. The park that surrounds it, paved with striking red ceramic tiles, is a memento of the San Antonio, a Spanish ship foundered in front of the castle with a heavy load. Some of the cargo was recovered from the flotsam and now gives the area just outside the building a special and highly distinctive character.

The first edition (black dust jacket) was published in 1984, and a second, revised edition (pale green dust jacket) in 1998. The book became the standard guide to macromoth identification used by moth recorders in the field in Britain, and the increased popularity of moth recording in Britain in the 1990s is often attributed in large part to this book. The first edition of the guide was illustrated by 42 colour photographic plates of pinned moth specimens, photographed by David Wilson. An extra plate by Wilson, showing additional species or aberrations was included in the second edition. For some species, additional line drawings showing specific identification features are included within the text.

It is majority owned (51%) by Scentre Group with the remainder owned by the Singapore Government's GIC Private Limited. Until 2014 it was wholly owned by Scentre Group, which was formerly part of Westfield Group. Once the last sections opened in April 2008, at 7 ha (70,000 m¬≤) of indoor space (4.9 ha retail [49,000 m¬≤] and 2.1 ha [21,000 m¬≤] offices), and costing around NZ$210 million to construct.

It also contains an Event Cinemas multiplex cinema and a 560-seat food court which includes major fastfood franchises.Westfield Agreements Mark Milestone In Development of Albany Town Centre (from the Westfield NZ website, 28 September 2006)  History and development  The centre was Westfield's first totally new mall since entering the New Zealand market in the mid-90s. When first mooted in 2003, it was conceived as a much smaller centre, with 20,000 m¬≤ planned initially, and with an expansion of 15,000 m¬≤ proposed for a decade later if population increase in the vicinity justified it. By 2007 when the mall opened, planning of an extension was already under way. At that time, some experts saw demand for about twice the size of the centre in retail and associated office space in the wider Albany area. However, Westfield itself had in the past put in submissions against a District Plan change in the area, contending that it allowed for \\"excessive retail provision in the Albany area\\" (in a northern 'mainstreet' area separate from the core where Westfield and a number of other retailers have their sites). The challenge was rejected by the Environment Court. The concept of the Albany mall was considered a (somewhat reluctant) new approach by Westfield, which had previously been accused of disregarding the outside effects of its malls, and of maximising commercial opportunities at the cost of the surrounding communities. Spurred by criticism and council plans to develop a 'town centre' instead of simply providing retail areas, Westfield changed its standard greenfields-type plans for the new site, and developed a more open centre with 'main street' elements and some public areas.Significant change in Westfield thinking - The Bob Dey Property Report, Monday 18 July 2005. Retrieved 20 September 2007. The change was considered a significant step away from the inward-looking shopping centres built in New Zealand in the 1990s, and North Shore City Council hoped that the centre would integrate with future growth in Albany rather than be a shopping destination alone. Opening Westfield Albany Stage One opened on 30 August 2007, with 65 shops trading.

In July 2008, the cinemas of the centre were closed preventively by Skycity cinemas due to weathertightness reasons. Problems with the roof had already caused a single cinema to be shut a month earlier. The cinemas were reopened about a week later. In May 2011, the mall was closed for inspection after sustaining damage when a tornado caused widespread damage and one fatality on Auckland's North Shore. Annual sales for the full year 2018 were $422.8 million.  Awards  In 2008, the centre received the highest award of the New Zealand Property Council, with the judges calling the centre being one of \\"a new generation of its type\\" and having a good mix of leisure and entertainment with an emphasis on public spaces, which had been \\"designed to provide a focal point for the whole Albany community and beyond\\".

He sat in the Parliament of Ireland from 1639 until 1641. After the start of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 he was declared an outlaw, became a member of the Confederation of Kilkenny and was appointed general of the horse for the county of Meath. Towards the end of the war he fought on the Royalist side and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Rathmines, dying two weeks later in Dublin Castle. Biography Plunket was the eldest son of Lucas Plunket, styled Lucas M√¥r, 10th Baron Killeen, created Earl of Fingall on 26 September 1628, by his second wife, Susanna, fifth daughter of Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee and Mary Smythe. His father died in 1637, and on 20 March that year Plunket received special livery of his estates. he inherited great estates in County Meath and County Cavan, and played a part in developing the town of Virginia, County Cavan. He took his seat in the Irish Parliament on 16 March 1639, and was a member of several committees for privileges and grievances. On the outbreak of the Rebellion in October 1641, he endeavoured, like the nobility and gentry of the Pale generally, to maintain an attitude of neutrality between the government and the northern party, and on 16 November was appointed a commissioner to confer with all persons in arms, \\"with a view to suspend for some time the sad effects of licentiousness and rapine, until the kingdom was put in a better posture of defence\\". His behaviour caused him to be mistrusted by the Government, and on 17 November he was proclaimed an outlaw. He thereupon took a prominent part in bringing about an alliance between the Ulster party and the nobility and gentry of the Pale. He was present at the meeting at the Hill of Crofty, and subsequently at that at the Hill of Tara, where he was appointed general of the horse for the county of Meath. His name is attached to the principal documents drawn up by the Irish Confederates in justification of their taking up arms. He was a member of the general assembly of the Confederation of Kilkenny, and, by taking the oath of association against the papal nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini in June 1648, proved his fidelity to the original demands of the confederates; but otherwise he played an inconspicuous part in the history of the rebellion. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Rathmines on 2 August 1649, died in confinement in Dublin Castle a fortnight later, and was buried in St Catherine's Church on 18 August. He was seven times indicted for high treason, and his estates were confiscated by the English Commonwealth's Act for the Settlement of Ireland on 12 August 1652. Family Plunket married in 1636 Mabel, daughter of Nicholas Barnewall, 1st viscount Kingsland and Lady Bridget FitzGerald, who survived him by 50 years.Reily v Ward (1717) Brown's Law Reports Vol.1 p.575 and remarried, in 1653, Colonel James Barnewall, youngest son of Sir Patrick Barnewall. Plunket's eldest son and heir, Luke, 3rd Earl of Fingall, was restored to his estates and honours by order of the Court of Claims in 1662. His daughter Mary married Walter Butler, nephew of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde: they were the grandparents of John Butler, 15th Earl of Ormonde.

At the beginning, VPPE members could be part of both their original party and of VPPE. Then the political movement was organised as an independent party, but some members, including Renzo Marangon, regional minister of Territorial Affairs, continued to have a double affiliation. In 2006, Raffaele Grazia was the only one of the original group to leave Forza Italia in the Regional Council, thus forming the \\"Veneto for the EPP\\" group.http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?e=147&c;=1&n;=27&p;=27&t;=0&key;=693 In the May 2007 provincial election of Vicenza, Giorgio Carollo was candidate for President with the support of parties from both the centre-left and the centre-right: Italy of Values, UDEUR, Liga Fronte Veneto, Christian Democracy, some citizen lists and his own Veneto for the EPP, which is part of the majority supporting the regional government of Giancarlo Galan in the Regional Council. He scored 9.9%, while VPPE got the 3.5% and elected 2 provincial councillors.http://www.repubblica.it/speciale/2007/elezioni/provinciali/vicenza.html Even if the result of Vicenza was a little disappointing for VPPE, it led to an awkward federation with Christian Democracy and Liga Fronte Veneto. The pact between the three parties, which could become a major political actor in Veneto, was signed in October 2007 by Giorgio Carollo, Raffaele Grazia, Giuseppe Pizza and Fabrizio Comencini. Following this agreement, Carollo became leader of the Christian Democracy in the northeast, while Grazia received the mandate of coordinator of the coalition for Veneto. However, the coalition was soon disbanded. The party supported the Union of the Centre (UdC) of Pier Ferdinando Casini in the 2008 general election and Carollo was a candidate for the UdC in the North-East Italy constituency in the 2009 European Parliament election.http://www.giorgiocarollo.it/it/focus_on_it_28/perche_questa_scelta/ Leadership *President: Giorgio Carollo *Coordinator: Raffaele Grazia References External links *Official website *Group in the Regional Council *Personal website of Giorgio Carollo Category:Political parties in Veneto Category:Venetian nationalism Category:Political parties established in 2005 ","title":"Veneto for the European People's Party"},{"id":"10811071","text":"is a Japanese light novel adventure series written by Keiichi Sigsawa, with illustrations by Kohaku Kuroboshi, starring the children of the characters from Allison.

Like its extraordinary child lead, this Russian drama about an orphan's search for his birth mother is small in size and monumental in pathos\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/italian.On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-italian Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \\"The film‚Äôs director, Mr. Kravchuk, throws a beautiful, somewhat gauzy light over this world that gently softens its harder angles. There is something slightly magical about the lighting, almost as if this were a fantasy land from which Vanya might actually make an escape. This sense of unreality, of magical thinking and wishing, carries the story and Vanya through a remarkable journey . . . like something out of a film by Roberto Rossellini, which is very high praise indeed.\\" Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"a deeply moving experience, alternately funny and sad\\" and added, \\"Based on a real incident, it has the ring of truth. Every detail feels right, from the chill of a Russian winter to the coldness displayed by adults profiting from a trade in orphans.\\" Leslie Felperin of Variety observed, \\"Briskly helmed by feature debutant Andrei Kravchuk, [the picture] depicts the hard-knock life in a remote Russian children's home with stark realism, evolving smoothly into a taut adventure tale as [the protagonist] hits the road in search of his mom. Possibly a bit too hard-hitting for more protected Western kids, [the picture] might appeal to subtitle-friendly tweens and teens in upmarket territories.\\" Awards and nominations The film won the Grand Prix of the Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk from the International Jury at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival, and a Special Mention from their Children's Jury..

He joined the army during World War II, and from 1942 until 1945 played most of his football for services teams, including acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a 1945 services competition in Darwin. However, he also made his league debut with Carlton and played eight games between 1942 and 1944 whenever he was stationed in Melbourne. Deacon returned permanently to Melbourne in mid-1945. He played a few games for Preston, then was cleared to and Carlton and played there permanently for the next seven years. Adept at all key positions, he quickly established himself at centre half back with Carlton. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 and 1947, and in the latter in a year which he won the Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. He was the first Carlton player to win the award. Deacon was held in extremely high regard throughout the league for his quality key position play in the years immediately following the war. In 1945, despite having played only half of the season, the Age sportswriter Percy Beames lauded Deacon's \\"great versatility and sustained brilliance through each game\\", and said he was perhaps the best key player since the early days of Laurie Nash.

J. Cronin which tells the story of an American consul, Harrington Brande, who is posted to San Jorge on the Costa Brava, Spain with his young son Nicholas. The novel relates how Nicholas's innocent love for his father is destroyed by the latter's jealousy and vindictiveness when Nicholas forms a friendship with the young Spanish gardener, Jos√© Santero. The novel was adapted for both film and television.  Plot summary  A restrained, precise man, Brande has an elevated sense of his own importance, believing his qualities have been overlooked in a series of postings around Europe which have failed to result in promotion. His other abiding resentment is the failure of his marriage to his wife Marion, who left him when his dispassionate and obsessively controlling nature overwhelmed her. Brande's paranoid need to be loved and respected are focused on his hobby, a manuscript on Malebranche, a French philosopher, and on his 9-year-old son Nicholas. Nicholas is a delicate child who has been reduced to a state of invalidism by his father's overprotective and restrictive regime. At San Jorge, the Brandes take a villa for which a couple, Garcia and his wife Magdalena have been engaged to act as butler/chauffeur and cook/housekeeper. Nicholas takes an instinctive dislike to Garcia, fearing his dead fish eyes and his tendency to appear unannounced, but Brande sees the man's obsequious servility as recognition of his own superior qualities. At Nicholas's suggestion, a gardener, the 19-year-old Jos√©, is hired to tend the neglected garden. Jos√©'s amiable and ingenuous nature, despite his poverty and the responsibility of providing for his family members, soon attract Nicholas's curiosity and the pair strike up a friendship. Nicholas helps Jos√© in the garden and his health improves. Garcia, to ingratiate himself with Brande and plant suspicion on Jos√©, informs Brande of Nicholas and Jos√©'s friendship and, intensely jealous of Nicholas's affection, Brande forbids the boy to speak to the gardener again. He has no justifiable cause to dismiss Jos√©, so he sets out to punish him and break his spirit by ordering him to build a rockery from boulders. Nicholas, however, realises that he only promised not to speak to Jos√©, and this does not preclude writing and exchanging secret notes with each other. Brande then receives a letter summoning him to Madrid and informing him that his predecessor at San Jorge, who was promoted to First Consul, has suffered a stroke. Elated and assuming that he will be appointed to the vacant post, Brande hurries to Madrid. Jos√© takes advantage of Brande's absence to take Nicholas by train into the mountains on a fishing trip. Their enforced silence is broken and the day is the idyllic highlight of Nicholas's life so far. Yet when Nicholas returns it is to find a drunken Garcia wielding a knife and abusing Magdalena. He spends a terrified night in his room and, when Jos√© learns of it the following day, rather than leave the defenceless boy alone for another night, takes him home with him. A distraught Brande returns early from Madrid. He had merely been summoned to Madrid to temporarily fill the vacancy until a permanent appointment could be made and, upon telling his superior that he expected to be appointed permanently, is effectively laughed at and told he has no hope. He refused the temporary posting and writes to summon his friend and psychiatrist Eugene Halevy. On returning to his villa, he finds Nicholas missing and Garcia informs him Nicholas has spent the night with Jos√©. He further shows Brande a scrap of Nicholas's correspondence to Jos√© saying how much he loves to spend time with Jos√©. When Nicholas returns, Garcia and Magdalena deny his version of events and he is confined to his room where Professor Halevy 'examines' him, intent upon reading something sinister into his relationship with Jos√©. Garcia then informs Brande that he is missing sums of money and suggests Brande checks his jewellery, all of which has gone. A pair of Brande's cufflinks are found in the lining of Jos√©'s jacket and he is arrested. Jos√© is to be sent for trial in Barcelona and Nicholas learns from Jos√©'s grandfather that he will attempt to escape from the train and hide in the old mill where they went fishing. Nicholas sets off to meet him, while his father accompanies Jos√© and the police to act as witness in the trial. He has received a letter from the employment agency stating that Garcia is very likely to be a criminal the police are looking for, but he decides to do nothing about it until after Jos√©'s trial. On the train, Jos√© makes his escape attempt, but Brande, anticipating his action, catches his sleeve, spoiling his jump so that Jos√© falls onto the track and is killed. In a violent storm, Brande then has to find the missing Nicholas. Seven months later, Brande is posted to Stockholm but his relationship with Nicholas is irretrievably broken. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Nicholas told Brande that he hated him. He asked for his mother's photo and her address and has been writing to her. In Stockholm, Nicholas, now recovered from a serious illness resulting from his misadventure in the storm, informs his father that he wishes to go and live with her in America.  Review  Information on 'The Spanish Gardener' from the fly leaf of 'Beyond This Place' (Published 1953 Australia and NZ): Dr Cronin has portrayed a man at the mercy of his own vanity. This man's son is the victim of his doting parent until the Spanish gardener shows the boy the way to a freer, healthier, happier life. This is a haunting book with overtones of both beauty and tragedy. Among its characters ‚Äì the frail, confined and sensitive little boy Nicholas; the father who was afraid to face himself; the criminal servant; the Consul's assistant upon whom at the moment of crisis he was reluctantly forced to rely; the fraudulent psychiatrist who would twist words spoken under mental torture; and above all the lovable character of the Spanish gardener himself ‚Äì these are among Dr Cronin's most memorable characters.

He has discovered six comets, including C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), the first Kreutz Sungrazing comet discovered by ground-based observation in over 40 years. He is also known for popularizing procedures for modifying consumer-grade digital cameras so that they can be used for digital camera astrophotography. Astrophotography Lovejoy is known among amateur astronomers for identifying modifications to digital cameras needed for astrophotography. Such cameras come configured with built-in filters that cut off infrared light. They also cut off some of the red light that many deep space objects emit. After he published procedures to modify those filters, many amateur astronomers were able to improve their deep space photography. Gordon J. Garradd named 61342 Lovejoy in honor of Lovejoy after discovering it on August 3, 2000. On 15 March 2007, Lovejoy used a standard camera to discover the comet C/2007 E2 (Lovejoy). Two months later, he discovered another comet, designated C/2007 K5 (Lovejoy) using the modified camera. On 27 November 2011, with his discovery of C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), he became the first astronomer in over 40 years to discover a Kreutz Sungrazing comet from a ground-based observation. The discovery was made using a Celestron C8 Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope working at f/2.1 with a QHY9 CCD camera. On 7 September 2013, Lovejoy discovered comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) which became visible to the naked eye in November 2013.

It is situated around Ruffey Lake in a portion of a valley through which the Ruffey Creek runs, forming the border between Doncaster and Templestowe. It has three main entrances, Victoria St, The Boulevard and King St. Despite being the second largest park in Manningham, second to Westerfolds Park, it is the biggest urban park managed by the City of Manningham. It is approximately 68 hectares (168 acres) in size.http://www.manningham.vic.gov.au/ruffey-lake-park Formerly orchards, the park has a diverse ecology; this includes a riparian strip of native bushland around the creek, areas of pine trees planted by early settlers and pockets of fruit trees remaining from past orchards. The park is named after Ruffey Creek, a watercourse that runs through the park which was dammed to irrigate the surrounding orchards, forming Ruffey Lake. During the summer, the park hosts the annual Manningham Carols by Candlelight. History After European settlement, the native bushland was cleared for orchards and in 1966 the then City of Doncaster and Templestowe Council purchased land for open space use. Ruffey Creek was dammed in the mid 1990s creating Ruffey Lake. Today, the creek and lake serve as storm water drainage basins, rubbish dropped on the streets regularly flows down the creek and there are waste catchers deployed in the lake itself to catch some of this pollution.EPA Victoria The Wurundjeri descendants in the area still have a strong association with Westerfolds Park at Templestowe. Facilities The park has three toilet blocks and electric barbecues are distributed throughout. There are three playgrounds in Ruffey Lake Park; near the Boulevard and Victoria St entrances. In the last 10 years facilities have been upgraded, predominantly the playgrounds, especially the Victoria Street adventure playground. There are sealed pathways giving access to almost every area of the park. These are of standard width and in relatively good condition but do not host dividing lines.

Leaving the country for the city, Chitty played for Sunshine in the Victorian Sub- Districts before being signed by Carlton. Chitty made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in Round 7 of the 1937 season. While a brilliant, versatile player, Chitty built his reputation as one of the game's most fearsome hardmen: \\"Some players manufacture aggression, others seem born to it; as far as Bob Chitty was concerned, aggression oozed out of his every pore.\\"Bob Chitty, Australian Football. Retrieved 10 October 2017. Chitty captained Carlton to victory in the infamous 1945 \\"Bloodbath\\" Grand Final. Chitty's king hit of South Melbourne's Ron Clegg in the second quarter is seen as what triggered the succession of violent incidents that garnered the match its nickname. In the fourth quarter, Chitty was knocked out by opponent Laurie Nash. After the match, Chitty was suspended for eight weeks for elbowing Bill Williams. After leaving Melbourne at the end of the 1946 VFL season, Chitty spent several years in country Victoria as captain-coach of the Benalla Football Club in the Ovens and Murray Football League, during which time he led the goalkicking on two occasions.

The Islamic Republic of Iran Navy is the sole operator of this class, whose all submarines serve in the Southern Fleet. No submarine of this class is active at the Northern Fleet, i.e. the Caspian Sea. History Iran had shown interest in midget submarines in the 1980s. According to the Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships, Iran assembled a midget in Bandar Abbas that was completed in 1987 in an unsuccessful attempt. Iran reportedly purchased a second midget of another design from North Korea, delivered in 1988. It is alleged that by 1993, nine midget submarines ‚Äìable to displace 76 tons surfaced and 90 tons submerged, with a top speed between and ‚Äì were imported from North Korea. Existence of Ghadir class was first known in February 2004. An unclassified 2017 report by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence stated that Iran purchased at least one submarine from North Korea in that year. In May 2005, Iran announced that it has started mass production of its own indigenous midget submarines, and aired footage of one cruising at sea level on television. Later that month, the submarine was tested during the third phase of military exercise Ettehad 84., In November 2007, commander of the IRIN Commodore Habibollah Sayyari said the second ship in the class has been completed after ten years of construction. Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei was quoted saying to Iran's navy commanders on the day the submarine was launched: \\"Today, you have been able to design and build many of the military requirements. We have become self-sufficient from other countries.\\", In May 2014, one of the ships in the class ‚ÄìGhadir 953‚Äì cruised in the Indian Ocean to make a port call to Karachi, Pakistan along with a naval group consisting of , , and , participating in a joint drill with Pakistan Navy vessels., ,  Design  Sources are inconsistent about the class which Ghadir submarines are derived from. When it was first unveiled, some experts pointed that it is similar in appearance to submarines, while those who maintained a contradicting view said that they are about 1.5 times larger than the latter and more similar to . Other sources say they are based on . Ghadir submarines displace when at the surface and while submerged. The class design is long, would have a beam of and a draft of . The submarines have a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . They have a secondary retractable propeller and are powered by diesel‚Äìelectric machinery, and fitted with two torpedo tubes. Submarines in the class are equipped with sonars of an unknown type. Ghadir's crew totals 7 officers and men. Operational capabilities Video of Ghadir firing a submarine-launched cruise missile in 2019 Ghadir submarines are alleged to have launched different types of torpedoes, namely Valfajr and Hoot. Anti-ship cruise missiles Nasr-1 and Jask-2 are both reportedly launched successfully, the latter being developed specifically for launch from submarines. The ships in the class are also capable of laying naval mines in addition to retrieving frogmen for special operations. They are assumed to have \\"an extremely limited endurance\\", while described as \\"very maneuverable\\", as well as being able to \\"sit silently submerged while waiting for its prey\\". Considering that Ghadir submarines could possess only two torpedoes or missiles, Joseph Trevithick writes that Iranians may plan to use them \\"en masse to launch barrages of the missiles\\". Vijay Sakhuja, director of the National Maritime Foundation, comments that the class is \\"[the] most difficult to detect particularly when resting on the seabed and this could be the possible tactics that the Iranian Navy could employ during hostilities. Further, given their numbers, these could overwhelm enemy's technological superiority\\". According to U.S. Navy Captain Tracy A. Vincent, Ghadir submarines can provide additional surveillance capability and create a new layer of defense for Iranian naval forces. Commander Daniel Dolan maintains that the submarines are well-deigned for the purpose of guerrilla warfare, ambush and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), describing them as potentially more expendable in comparison to attack submarines. He argues that American fleet is prone to a high threat environment created by sheer number of these \\"small but lethal threats\\". Royal Navy Commander Ryan Ramsey, who captained nuclear submarine in the Persian Gulf has stated that the submarines are a threat to western forces operating in the region, adding that \\"[t]he Ghadir-class are tiny submarines but have enough torpedoes to sink a couple of ships\\". Mark Episkopos opines that Ghadir submarines maintain \\"strong offensive capabilities\\" that contribute to the \\"dangerous\\" subsurface fleet of Iran. IRIN commander Hossein Khanzadi has said the class \\"can do what the U-boats did during World War II\\".,  Number built  Iran does not disclose number of its submarines. Sources differ in determining the number of Ghadir submarines built and operated, with estimates ranging between 10 and 21 units, as of 2019. According to 2020 edition of the Military Balance published by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), Iran operates 14 submarines in this class. Farzin Nadimi of the The Washington Institute estimated that about 20 are in service as of 2020.

Colonial Herald  James Pearce founded the original Herald in February 1867, publishing weekly. It was pitched at a more working-class audience than its counterparts in Perth at the time, and featured verse, short stories and serials. Pearce was joined by two co-proprietors, William Beresford and James Elphinstone Roe, both of whom, like Pearce, were ex-convicts. The Herald supported social reform and opposed the convict system. Beresford wrote a weekly column, \\"Chips by a Sandalwood Cutter\\", which used a fictional character to challenge the morality of the social elite. In 2013, the Fremantle Local History Collection funded the digitisation of the entire extant collection of the Herald of 1867‚Äì1886. The digitisation was carried out by the National Library of Australia, and the scanned archives made available via their Trove search engine.  World War I  In 1913 a new workers' weekly was established, with William Carpenter serving as editor. He lasted less than a year, and subsequently the newspaper became \\"less friendly\\" to the labour movement. This newspaper lasted until 1919, and in May 1921 it was incorporated (along with the Fremantle Times) into the Fremantle Advertiser.  Modern Herald  In 1989, local resident Andrew Smith launched a new Fremantle Herald from a weatherboard house, employing an editor and small team of journalists, production and advertising staff based in East Fremantle, on the corner of King and George Streets. In 1992 the operation was moved to the corner of Cliff and Croke Streets, Fremantle. It now also publishes three titles in other parts of the Perth metropolitan area: the Melville City Herald, the Cockburn City Herald, and the Perth Voice, all of which are letterbox-distributed weeklies. A two-year trial of a paid-for version of the Fremantle Herald failed to gain support from readers and was abandoned in 2005.

It continues the science fiction story that began on the first album Iron Savior. It is the only album to feature former Gamma Ray and Freedom Call drummer Dan Zimmermann.  Story  In the year 2110, earth is controlled by the Iron Savior. The gigantic machine - built in Atlantis to defend the lost continent against its enemies, the so-called Alliance - still is mistaken. The computer-unit analysis identifies man as the destroyer of Atlantis. So it continues to carry out its prime directive: Protect Atlantis and conquer the Alliance. On earth only a few people managed to hide from the bloodhounds of the Savior in the former Earth-Defense-Headquarters (E.D.H.) underneath the everlasting ice of Greenland. The machine, from the very first moment of its arrival, was transmitting signals directly to the Atlantic Ocean, North Africa, South America, and the Easter Islands. This behavior led some people to the \\"theory of Atlantis\\". And in fact after major research for anything related to the old myth, some artifacts were found on the Azores and on the Easter Islands. The dig on the Easter Islands uncovered something like the entrance to an ancient structure of unknown purpose. Shielded and protected by force fields of unknown sources, the station couldn't be entered by anybody yet. But all of a sudden another transmission - similar to the Savior's transmission but yet different - was detected. Sensors indicated that the source must be located right in the heart of the ancient structure. The attempts to enter the station made the last Atlantian on earth awake from his 300,000 year long stasis sleep. Now the \\"Sleeper\\" is the last member alive of the Atlantian Iron Savior Defense program. But when he transmitted the secret codes to direct the controls of the Savior to his station, something unexpected happened. The computer unit refused to obey his command. It almost appeared to him, as if the unit is conscious - with a will of its own, just like an organic life form. The awakening of the sleeper and the contact with the last Atlantian on earth brought a lot of clarity and turned the \\"theory of Atlantis\\" into a hard fact. On the other hand, the situation did not change at all since the machine seems to disobey the orders of its creators. The only chance to fee mankind from the Savior is now awake to bio unit. But even this seems doubtful if the robot in deed developed a consciousness and now acts like a being with emotions and the hunger for power. It is very much likely that the computer will also disobey the orders of the bio unit. So the Savior needs to be defeated or destroyed, which at this time seems to be impossible. In this situation a big fleet of alien vessels enters the solar system. They have come from the distant planet of Calderis to investigate the transmission of the Iron Savior. The Calderins are the ancestors of the Atlantian fugitives. Their forefathers left the dying civilization of Atlantis to find a new home in the vastness of space. But over the millennia they forgot about their origin and the Old World became a myth of legends and tales. But the Calderins never gave up the search although thousands of expeditions returned to Calderis without a clue. But this time they have reached their final destiny. Together with the sleeper mankind is unable to make contact and explain the fatal mistake of the Savior. So now with the unexpected help from the stars, earth will fight the final battle and it seems that the Savior can be defeated. And the time of Unification for all mankind is about to come...

It is originally native to the tropical areas of the Americas from Mexico to Argentina, and has been spread throughout the world in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, becoming naturalized or invasive in many areas. The specific epithet, \\"curcas\\", was first used by Portuguese doctor Garcia de Orta more than 400 years ago. Common names in English include physic nut, Barbados nut, poison nut, bubble bush or purging nut. In parts of Africa and areas in Asia such as India it is often known as \\"castor oil plant\\" or \\"hedge castor oil plant\\", but it is not the same as the usual castor oil plant, Ricinus communis (they are in the same family but different subfamilies). J. curcas is a semi-evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching a height of or more. It is resistant to a high degree of aridity, allowing it to grow in deserts. It contains phorbol esters, which are considered toxic. However, edible (non-toxic) provenances native to Mexico also exist, known by the local population as pi√±√≥n manso, xuta, chuta, aishte, among others.Mart√≠nez-Herrera, J., Mart√≠nez Ayala, A., Makkar, H.P.S., Francis, G., Becker, K. 2010.

Industrial Crops and Products 42: 397-401. Botanical features * Leaves: The leaves have significant variability in their morphology. In general, the leaves are green to pale green, alternate to subopposite, and three- to five-lobed with a spiral phyllotaxis.Nahar, K. and Ozores-Hampton, M. (2011). Jatropha: An Alternative Substitute to Fossil Fuel.(IFAS Publication Number HS1193). Gainesville: University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Retrieved (12-17-2011). * Flowers: male and female flowers are produced on the same inflorescence, averaging 20 male flowers to each female flower, or 10 male flowers to each female flower. The inflorescence can be formed in the leaf axil. Plants occasionally present hermaphroditic flowers. * Fruits : fruits are produced in winter, or there may be several crops during the year if soil moisture is good and temperatures are sufficiently high. Most fruit production is concentrated from midsummer to late fall with variations in production peaks where some plants have two or three harvests and some produce continuously through the season. * Seeds: the seeds are mature when the capsule changes from green to yellow. The seeds contain around 20% saturated fatty acids and 80% unsaturated fatty acids, and they yield 25‚Äì40% oil by weight. In addition, the seeds contain other chemical compounds, such as saccharose, raffinose, stachyose, glucose, fructose, galactose, and protein. The oil is largely made up of oleic and linoleic acids. Furthermore, the plant also contains curcasin, arachidic, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids and curcin. * Genome: the whole genome was sequenced by Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba Japan in October 2010. Cultivation Jatropha curcas seeds Cultivation is uncomplicated. Jatropha curcas grows in tropical and subtropical regions.http://www.agricultureinformation.com/forums/sale/19166-jatropha- curcas-seeds-seedlings-sale.html Warm climate reference The plant can grow in wastelands and grows on almost any terrain, even on gravelly, sandy and saline soils. It can thrive in poor and stony soils, although new research suggests that the plant's ability to adapt to these poor soils is not as extensive as had been previously stated. Complete germination is achieved within 9 days. Adding manure during the germination has negative effects during that phase, but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved. It can be propagated by cuttings, which yields faster results than multiplication by seeds. The flowers only develop terminally (at the end of a stem), so a good ramification (plants presenting many branches) produces the greatest amount of fruits. The plants are self-compatible.A.C.P. Juh√°sz, S. Pimenta, B.O. Soares, Batista Morais de Lourdes, D., Rabello, H. de Oliveira 2009.

Another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence, more female flowers mean more fruits.\\"Generative propagation of Jatropha curcas L. on Kalahari Sand.\\" in The Jatropha Journal. Jatropha curcas thrives on a mere of rain a year, and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season. Ploughing and planting are not needed regularly, as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years. The use of pesticides is not necessary, due to the pesticidal and fungicidal properties of the plant. It is used in rural Bengal for dhobi itch (a common fungal infection of the skin). While Jatropha curcas starts yielding from 9‚Äì12 months time, the best yields are obtained only after 2‚Äì3 years time. The seed production is around 3.5 tons per hectare (seed production ranges from about 0.4 t/ha in the first year to over 5 t/ha after 3 years). If planted in hedges, the reported productivity of Jatropha is from 0.8 to 1.0 kg of seed per meter of live fence.  Propagation  Jatropha curcas can easily be propagated by both seed or cuttings. Some people recommend propagation by seed for establishment of long-lived plantations. When jatropha plants develop from cuttings, they produce many branches but yield fewer seeds and do not have enough time to develop their taproot, which makes them sensitive to wind erosion.https://www.feedipedia.org/node/620; accessed 11 November 2017 The seeds exhibit orthodox storage behaviour and under normal treatment and storage will maintain viability at high percentages for eight months to a year.Seed Information Database; http://data.kew.org/sid/SidServlet?ID=12945&Num;=gxM; accessed 11 November 2017Guzman (De), Lucille Elna Parreno and Annalissa Lappay Aquino; 2009; Seed Characteristics and Storage Behavior of Physic Nut (Jatropha curcas L.); Philippine Journal of Crop Science, v.34, n.1, p.13-21; accessed at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281863148_Seed_Characteristics_and_Storage_Behavior_of_Physic_Nut_Jatropha_curcas_LSilva (da), La√©rcio Junio et al.; 2017; The Effect of Fruit Maturity on the Physiological Quality and Conservation of Jatropha curcas Seeds; Revista Ci√™ncia Agron√¥mica, v. 48, n. 3, p. 487-495; DOI: 10.5935/1806-6690.20170057; accessed at http://www.redalyc.org/html/1953/195350460012/Duong T.H. et al.; 2013; Storage Behaviour of Jatropha curcas Seeds;Journal of Tropical Forest Science, 25(2), pp.193‚Äì199; accessed at https://www.frim.gov.my/v1/JTFSOnline/jtfs/v25n2/193-199.pdfHeller, Joachim; 1996; Physic Nut, Jatropha curcas L. - Promoting the Conservation and Use of Underutilized and Neglected Crops, p.31; Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Gatersleben; International Plant Genetic Resources Institute; Rome; ; accessed at http://www.bioversityinternational.org/uploads/tx_news/Physic_nut__Jatropha_curcas_L._161.pdf Propagation through seed (sexual propagation) leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth, biomass, seed yield and oil content. Clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems. Vegetative propagation has been achieved by stem cuttings, grafting, budding as well as by air layering techniques. Cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of IBA (rooting hormone) to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings.Gadekar Kumarsukhadeo Prakash.

Processing Seed extraction and processing generally needs specialized facilities. Oil content varies from 28% to 30% and 80% extraction, one hectare of plantation will give 400 to 600 litres of oil if the soil is average. The oily seeds are processed into oil, which may be used directly (\\"Straight Vegetable Oil\\") to fuel combustion engines or may be subjected to transesterification to produce biodiesel. Jatropha oil is not suitable for human consumption, as it induces strong vomiting and diarrhea.  Biofuel  Jatropha plantation in the dry center/west of the Paraguay Chaco When jatropha seeds are crushed, the resulting jatropha oil can be processed to produce a high-quality biofuel or biodiesel that can be used in a standard diesel car or further processed into jet fuel, while the residue (press cake) can also be used as biomass feedstock to power electricity plants, used as fertilizer (it contains nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). The cake can also be used as feed in digesters and gasifiers to produce biogas.Poison plant could help to cure the planet Times Online, 28 July 2007. thumb\\"From planting to picking. Treat your jatropha plant as well as possible to make the yield as large as possible!\\" (A reference to the compulsory planting of jatropha in Indonesia for the production of oil as machinery lubricant and fuel for the Japanese WWII war effort.) There are several forms of biofuel, often manufactured using sedimentation, centrifugation, and filtration. The fats and oils are turned into esters while separating the glycerin. At the end of the process, the glycerin settles and the biofuel floats. The process through which the glycerin is separated from the biodiesel is known as transesterification. Glycerin is another by-product from Jatropha oil processing that can add value to the crop. Transesterification is a simple chemical reaction that neutralizes the free fatty acids present in any fatty substances in Jatropha. A chemical exchange takes place between the alkoxy groups of an ester compound by an alcohol. Usually, methanol and ethanol are used for the purpose. The reaction occurs by the presence of a catalyst, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or caustic soda and potassium hydroxide (KOH), which forms fatty esters (e.g., methyl or ethyl esters), commonly known as biodiesel. It takes approximately 10% of methyl alcohol by weight of the fatty substance to start the transesterification process. Estimates of Jatropha seed yield vary widely, due to a lack of research data, the genetic diversity of the crop, the range of environments in which it is grown, and Jatrophas perennial life cycle. Seed yields under cultivation can range from 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms per hectare, corresponding to extractable oil yields of 540 to 680 litres per hectare (58 to 73 gallons per acre). In 2009 Time magazine cited the potential for as much as 1,600 gallons of diesel fuel per acre per year. The plant may yield more than four times as much fuel per hectare as soybean, and more than ten times that of maize (corn), but at the same time it requires five times as much water per unit of energy produced as does corn (see below). A hectare of jatropha has been claimed to produce 1,892 litres of fuel. However, as it has not yet been domesticated or improved by plant breeders, yields are variable. Jatropha can also be intercropped with other cash crops such as coffee, sugar, fruits and vegetables. In 2007 Goldman Sachs cited Jatropha curcas as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production. However, despite its abundance and use as an oil and reclamation plant, none of the Jatropha species has been properly domesticated and, as a result, its productivity is variable, and the long-term impact of its large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown.World Agroforestry Centre (2007) When oil grows on trees In 2008 researchers at Daimler Chrysler Research explored the use of jatropha oil for automotive use, concluding that although jatropha oil as fuel \\"has not yet reached optimal quality, ... it already fulfills the EU norm for biodiesel quality\\". Archer Daniels Midland Company, Bayer CropScience and Daimler AG have a joint project to develop jatropha as a biofuel.Bayer CropScience Press Release, June 18, 2008. Jatropha - This particular oil well holds a lot of future promise Three Mercedes cars powered by Jatropha diesel have already put some 30,000 kilometres behind them. The project is supported by DaimlerChrysler and by the German Association for Investment and Development (Deutschen Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, DEG). = Jet fuel = Aviation fuels may be more widely replaced by biofuels such as jatropha oil than fuels for other forms of transportation. There are fewer planes than cars or trucks and far fewer jet fueling stations to convert than gas stations. To fulfil the yearly demand for aviation fuel, based on demand in 2008 (fuel use has since grown), an area of farmland twice the size of France would need to be planted with jatropha, based on average yields of mature plantations on reasonably good, irrigated land.http://www.davidstrahan.com/blog/?p=170; accessed 11 November 2017 On December 30, 2008, Air New Zealand flew the first successful test flight from Auckland with a Boeing 747 running one of its four Rolls-Royce engines on a 50:50 blend of jatropha oil and jet A-1 fuel.Enviro.aero December 30, 2008. Air New Zealand jatropha flight, update 4 Accessed October 13, 2012. In the same press release, Air New Zealand announced plans to use the new fuel for 10% of its needs by 2013. At the time of this test, jatropha oil was much cheaper than crude oil, costing an estimated $43 a barrel or about one-third of the June 4, 2008 closing price of $122.30 for a barrel of crude oil. On January 7, 2009 Continental Airlines successfully completed a test flight from Houston, Texas using a 50/50 mixture of algae/jatropha-oil-derived biofuel and Jet A in one of the two CFM56 engines of a Boeing 737-800 Next Generation jet. The two-hour test flight could mark another promising step for the airline industry to find cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuel. On April 1, 2011 Interjet completed the first Mexican aviation biofuels test flight on an Airbus A320. The fuel was a 70:30 traditional jet fuel biojet blend produced from Jatropha oil provided by three Mexican producers, Global Energ√≠as Renovables (a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S.-based Global Clean Energy Holdings), Bencafser S.A. and Energy JH S.A. Honeywell's UOP processed the oil into Bio-SPK (Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene).Erin Voegele for Biodiesels Magazine. April 8, 2011. Mexico hosts successful biofuels test flight Global Energ√≠as Renovables operates the largest Jatropha farm in the Americas. On October 28, 2011 Air China completed the first successful demonstration flight by a Chinese airline that used jatropha-based biofuel. The mixture was a 50:50 mix of conventional jet fuel blended with jatropha oil from China National Petroleum Corp. The 747-400 powered one of its four engines on the fuel mixture during the 1-hour flight around Beijing airport. On August 27, 2018 SpiceJet completed the first successful test flight by an Indian airline which used jatropha based biofuel. The ratio of conventional jet fuel to jatropha oil was 25:75. =Carbon dioxide sequestration= According to a 2013 study published by the European Geosciences Union, the jatropha tree may have applications in the absorption of carbon dioxide, whose sequestration is important in combating climate change. This small tree is very resistant to aridity so it can be planted in hot and dry land in soil unsuitable for food production. The plant does need water to grow though, so coastal areas where desalinated seawater can be made available are ideal. =Use in developing world= Currently the oil from Jatropha curcas seeds is used for making biodiesel fuel in Philippines, Pakistan and in Brazil, where it grows naturally and in plantations in the southeast, north, and northeast of Brazil. Likewise, jatropha oil is being promoted as an easily grown biofuel crop in hundreds of projects throughout India and other developing countries.World Agroforestry Centre (2007) When oil grows on trees World Agroforestry Centre press release. 26 April 2009. Large plantings and nurseries have been undertaken in India by many research institutions, and by women's self-help groups who use a system of microcredit to ease poverty among semiliterate Indian women. The railway line between Mumbai and Delhi is planted with jatropha and the train itself runs on 15‚Äì20% biodiesel. In Africa, cultivation of jatropha is being promoted and it is grown successfully in countries such as Mali. In the Gran Chaco of Paraguay, where a native variety (Jatropha matacensis) also grows, studies have shown the suitability of Jatropha cultivation and agro producers are starting to consider planting in the region. Myanmar Myanmar is also actively pursuing the use of jatropha oil. On 15 December 2005, then-head of state, Senior General Than Shwe, said ‚Äúthe States and Divisions concerned are to put 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) under the physic nut plants [Jatropha] each within three years totalling 700,000 acres (2,800 km¬≤) during the period‚Äù. On the occasion of Burma‚Äôs Peasant Day 2006, Than Shwe described in his a message that ‚ÄúFor energy sector which is an essential role in transforming industrial agriculture system, the Government is encouraging for cultivation of physic nut plants nationwide and the technical know how that can refine physic nuts to biodiesel has also identified.‚Äù He would like to urge peasants to cultivate physic nut plants on a commercial scale with major aims for emergence of industrial agriculture system, for fulfilling rural electricity supply and energy needs, for supporting rural areas development and import substitute economy. (2005 from MRTV) In 2006, the chief research officer at state-run Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise said Burma hoped to completely replace the country's oil imports of 40,000 barrels a day with home-brewed, jatropha- derived biofuel. Other government officials declared Burma would soon start exporting jatropha oil. Despite the military's efforts, the jatropha campaign apparently has largely flopped in its goal of making Burma self-sufficient in fuel. (2006 from MyawaddyTV) Z.G.S. Bioenergy has started Jatropha Plantation Projects in Northern Shan State, the company has begun planting Jatropha plants during late June 2007 and will start producing seeds by 2010. (20 July 2007 from New Light of Myanmar) = Controversies = As of 2011 scepticism about the \\"miracle\\" properties of Jatropha has been voiced. For example: \\"The idea that jatropha can be grown on marginal land is a red herring\\", according to Harry Stourton, former business development director of UK-based Sun Biofuels, which attempted to cultivate Jatropha in Mozambique and Tanzania. \\"It does grow on marginal land, but if you use marginal land you'll get marginal yields,\\" he said.Reuters: Biofuel jatropha falls from wonder-crop pedestal, 21-1-2011Friends of the Earth Europe: Biofuel 'wonder-crop' jatropha failing to deliver, 21-01-2011 Sun Biofuels, after failing to adequately compensate local farmers for the land acquired for their plantation in Tanzania, pay workers severance, or deliver promised supplies to local villagers, went bankrupt later in 2011, the villager farmland being sold to an offshore investment fund. An August 2010 article warned about the actual utility and potential dangers of reliance on Jatropha in Kenya. Major concerns included its invasiveness, which could disrupt local biodiversity, as well as damage to water catchment areas. Jatropha curcas is lauded as being sustainable, and that its production would not compete with food production, but the jatropha plant needs water like every other crop to grow. This could create competition for water between the jatropha and other edible food crops. In fact, jatropha requires five times more water per unit of energy than sugarcane and corn.Friends of the Earth kicks against Jatropha production in Africa, Ghana Business News, Friday, May 29, 2009, Food for human consumption Xuta, chuta, aishte or pi√±√≥n manso (among others) are some of the names given in Mexico to edible non-toxic Jatropha curcas.G√≥mez-Pompa, A., Mar√≠n-Andrade, A.I., Campo-Garc√≠a, J., Dom√≠nguez-Landa, J.H., Cano-Asseleih, L.M., Segura-Ju√°rez, L.M., Cu√©llar-Mart√≠nez, M., Fern√°ndez-S√°nchez, M.J., S√°nchez-S√°nchez, O., Lozoya, X. 2009.

Although there are many varieties of pallet racking, all types allow for the storage of palletized materials in horizontal rows with multiple levels. Forklift trucks are usually required to place the loaded pallets onto the racks for storage. Since the Second World War, pallet racks have become a ubiquitous element of most modern warehouses, manufacturing facilities, retail centers, and other storage and distribution facilities. All types of pallet racking increase storage density of the stored goods. Costs associated with the racking increases with increasing storage density. Selective pallet racking systems Selective pallet rack \\"Very narrow aisle\\" pallet racks. Picture taken from a \\"man-up\\" truck Drive-in pallet rack system Push back system designed to store pallets of motorcycles Pallet flow lane showing rollers Selective pallet racking is a common pallet racking system in use today. Selective pallet racking systems typically come in one of two configurations: a roll formed, or clip-in configuration, and a structural bolt-together configuration. #Roll formed selective rack is most commonly manufactured in a \\"teardrop\\" style (so named as the holes on the column of the upright are shaped like a teardrop). Pallets then rest on the horizontal load beams that are held in place by mounting clips. Because the clips on teardrop configurations can be quickly moved, the shelves can be easily adjusted to different heights to accommodate various load sizes. This is convenient for a warehouse that needs to store a wide variety of product sizes. #Structural pallet rack systems are very similar to roll formed pallet rack systems except the horizontal load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. The bolt fixings make this a form of adjustable shelving - racks can be constructed, reconfigured, and dismantled and reused as necessary. Structural pallet racking can be designed into the structure of the building itself, so that the upright columns are simultaneously used to support the roof of the storage facility, in which case the structural pallet rack uprights replace the storage building's vertical support I-beams. This system is a rack supported building. Selective pallet rack systems provide easy accessibility to all products at all times - important if the inventory is rapidly depleted and restocked (called quick turnover). A selective pallet rack system is commonly used in a \\"big-box\\" distribution application, as well as in retail store inventory rooms, cold storage applications, wholesale stores, etc. Common components of selective rack include the following: # Load beams (also called step beams or box beams). #* Most step beams are roll formed members with a 1‚Öù‚Äù step along the top inside edge. This step is used to hold any load support components such as pallet supports or wire decks. #* Box beams have no inset step, instead have four flat sides like a box. All load beams typically mount onto an upright frame column with integral rivets or hooks. Some systems utilize an extra clip or bolt to lock the beam to the upright. #* Structural beams are hot formed structural C shapes with connecting clips at either end. Structural load beams are generally used with structural uprights but can be used with standard roll formed uprights. Structural load beams offer heavier weight capacities than step beams or box beams. # Upright frames (also called upright columns or uprights) vary in size and design depending on load requirements, and styles. The most common upright column is produced by roll forming flat coil stock steel into a modified \\"C\\" shape with returns. This style is often referred to as open-back roll-formed columns. Holes or slots are punched during manufacturing up and down the column at standard intervals so that the load beams can be mounted into the upright columns. Upright frames can also be constructed utilizing structural C shapes for columns. Structural uprights have an increased weight capacity over roll formed uprights. # Diagonal braces and horizontal braces, commonly referred to as upright frame lacing is usually welded between two upright columns to form selective upright frames. The lacing may be bolted to the columns in some cases. # Pallet supports are roll formed channels that are placed front to back between the load beams to support pallets. # Timber decking comes in two forms: close boarded and slated. Close boarded decking provides a solid 'floor' to a level of racking while slatted is formed by rows of timber and acts as a permanent pallet. # Wire decking is commonly used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the rack structure. Wire mesh decking comes in various thicknesses and mesh dimensions. Wire mesh construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of the holes in the mesh. Most wire mesh decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this waterfall decking, the wire mesh extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. Reverse waterfall decking can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. Lay-in decking rests inside the step of the beam, and wire mesh does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of wire mesh. Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below. # Footplates, also known as footpads or baseplates, are at the base of columns and serve as anchors to give the rack more stability: anchor bolts are inserted through the baseplate's holes to attach the column to the concrete floor. Footplates are made of thicker steel and in some geographic locations, they must be of a certain size and seismic rating. Footpads increase the pallet rack's overall stability and weight-bearing capacity. # Shims are used when the uprights are resting on uneven floors; the shims, equal in size to the base of the uprights, are installed beneath the uprights to level the rack. # Row spacers are sometimes used if uprights are arranged in back-to-back rows; the spacers are mounted between adjacent columns to ensure that the rows are kept straight and to give the pallet racks even more strength and steadiness. # Wall ties may be used for further support if the uprights are arranged in a row along a wall. # Column protectors, also known as post protectors, are protective shields that can be installed around the base of an upright to minimize damage where forklifts might hit the upright. Damage to the base of a column can weaken the entire frame and could cause it to collapse. Column protectors are made of various materials such as polyethylene, ductile iron casting, and other durable materials. # Guard rails are installed to increase protection for upright columns and for human safety when platforms or steps are attached to pallet racks. Very narrow aisle otherwise known as VNA, is the use of selective pallet racking in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of angle iron bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the angle iron is 4‚Äù by 3‚Äù and ¬º‚Äù - ‚Öú‚Äù inches thick. A distinct advantage of a narrow aisle pallet racking is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations. Other common types  High bay racking supported cold storage facility, under construction in 2018 Many types of pallet storage racks are available with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal pallet racking system, several considerations should be taken into account: * Desired storage density * Floor space and building height * Placement of building doors and columns * Inventory accessibility * Inventory rotation * Item/load size and weight * Optimal storage design * Cost of materials and installation Some of the most common types of pallet rack systems used include: # Drive-in, Finlayson, T.J. 07/9/1968 \\"Drive in pallet rack\\" and drive-through (sometimes spelled Drive- thru) are storage rack configurations that allow the forklift to drive directly into the lane of stacked rows (called a bay). The difference between a drive-in and a drive-thru pallet rack system is simply whether the bays have an entry at only one end, or at both ends. Drive-in rack systems use a common entry and exit, while drive-thru systems have entry points at either end of the bay. Because a drive-in racking system has only one entrance, it uses what is called a LIFO (last in, first out) storage method. With only one entrance, the last pallet put into a row is necessarily the first one to be taken out. A drive-thru storage system, with two different entry points, can also use a FIFO (first in, first out) storage method. With a FIFO system, pallets are loaded in one end and are pushed back to the other end, where they are then at the front of the row on the opposite side. The first pallet put into such a row is the first one taken out at the other end. This system is advantageous for material with an expiration date or wherever shelf life is a major concern. # Push-back pallet rack systems are designed around the principle of organizing space by depth rather than width. This depth arrangement greatly reduces aisle space and increases storage density. In this configuration, each bay can be up to six pallets deep; each pallet stored on wheeled carts that fit onto rails., Agnoff, Charles 12/29/1987, \\"Gravity Flow Storage System\\" Fig. 1 Shows Pallet on track and cart system. The rails are slightly angled toward the load/unload side of the rack in order to take advantage of gravity, saving enormous amounts of energy for moving heavy pallets. When a forklift sets the pallet onto the cart, it drives forward and causes the pallet to bump the next pallet, causing the entire row of pallets to roll backwards. When removing a pallet from the front position the remaining pallets immediately stage themselves forward so that the next available pallet can be accessed. Push back rack is a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system. # Pallet flow systems are high density pallet storage systems that utilize depth to increase capacity. This system uses a slightly inclined rail with rollers that allow pallets to move easily along the sloped plane. These systems are also called gravity flow or dynamic flow systems. The pallet flow system often has complex motion and braking systems to control the speed of the moving pallet. Pallet flow racking systems are either a FIFO (first in, first out) or a LIFO (last in, first out) storage system. If the system is loaded from the back and unloaded from the front, it is FIFO; if the system is loaded and unloaded from the front it is a LIFO system. # Compact mobilized pallet racks (also known as motorized mobile pallet racks or mobile industrial rack system),, Tourdot, Matthew A 09/18/2007 \\"Mobile Industrial Rack System\\" Patent refers to this product. are designed to maximize the use of warehouse storage space. This can reduce your pallet storage area in half, or double the capacity of your pallet rack storage in the same floor area. It allocates space by converting static access aisles into productive storage space. By mounting rows of pallet racks onto heavy-duty rolling carriages and positioning them on floor tracks. Rows of pallet racks (up to 96‚Äô long) move sideways along the floor tracks creating a movable floating access aisle. Typical warehouse storage facilities may have dozens of static access aisles but only one or two forklifts capable of accessing stored materials. This reduces the number of access aisles to match the velocity requirements of your storage area. Rows of pallet racks are moved by pushing a button or by remote control, which opens access aisles when and where they are needed. Mobilized storage system has helped many organizations reduce or eliminate new building construction costs, auxiliary warehouses, building expansions, and decrease ongoing operational costs (lighting, energy, insurance) by redistributing the use of their storage floor space. Some disadvantages of high density pallet storage systems are; less access to all stock at any given moment (although if the stored product is all the same, it should not matter), and the expense of such systems. Selective pallet rack systems are considerably less expensive per pallet position than their higher density counterparts. In most medium to large facilities, however, high density pallet rack systems are essential, since they provide the efficiency of time and high cost facility space is better optimized. Identifying the brand of racking systems is important to order compatible shelving or resell the racks. It is possible to differentiate between the many pallet rack brands by looking at the shape of the vertical beams, increments of height adjustment and the shape of the holes on the vertical beams. Safety considerations Because of the size and weight of pallets, safety is relevant. Workers must pay attention to any loose components in the pallet rack system, and also take the time to report any damage in the pallet rack frame. Such frame damage could cause the pallets to fall. It is the owner's legal responsibility to communicate this important warning to all who are around storage racks: Never climb on racks during or after assembly. Storage racks are not designed to be stepped on or climbed on. A slip or fall may result in serious injury. 'It is especially important to have highly visible warning signs if the pallet rack system is used in retail environments, such as wholesale centers, where the public is present. Quality pallets that are not damaged must be used. To save money, or perhaps from neglectful management, some warehouses use pallets until they become faulty and dangerous. Regular inspection of pallets for broken or fractured planks or stringers, protruding nails, and missing support blocks is essential. Damaged pallets can cause loading and unloading problems; for example, loose stringers can get hung up on the pallet racks, which can cause loads to fall from high positions. Also, faulty pallets can cause obstruction problems in flow systems by jamming certain pallet rack designs. Proper motorized equipment must be used for the application. Obstructing the end of aisles by staging pallets in these areas can cause severe and potentially fatal injuries and accidents. Overloading or exceeding the recommended load specifications for a racking system may cause a catastrophic failure of your storage rack system. Rack audits (safety checks) must be performed regularly by a qualified inspector familiar with RMI design and safety standards. Food products must follow FDA regulations and use approved pallet racks.  Load containment systems for pallet racks  Pallet racks are used throughout industry and distribution facilities for bulk storage of items. Generally, the items stored are boxed goods stacked on pallets which are placed on the rack. The pallets are accessed by some type of mechanized lifting and retrieval device. Sides of a pallet rack must be accessible by the mechanized device for storage and retrieval of goods. Thus these \\"access sides‚Äù must be open; entry to them cannot be permanently blocked/guarded. However, there are instances where an aisle way is designated along a row of pallet rack for pedestrian or other traffic and not for operational access by the lifting or retrieval device. When a pedestrian or other traffic aisle way is designated along a run of pallet racking it is good practice to guard the aisle way from a potential hazard created by objects that may fall from the pallet rack. In these situations, load containment systems are added to the designated aisle way side of the pallet rack to prevent or control any item from falling off of the back of the rack system or potentially falling on and injuring a person in the aisle. Containment systems may also be placed between back to back installations to prevent items on one side of rack potentially pushing items off the adjacent rack. There are two types of load containment systems for pallet racking: steel mesh containment panels and netting containment systems. = Netting containment systems = Pallet rack protective netting system. Load containment safety netting was originally adapted from cargo-based maritime netting used throughout the centuries for nautical trade and exploration. Safety netting has found widespread industrial use in load containment, driven in part by the post-war expansion of warehouse distribution systems. Netting types of varying break-strength and deflection allowances can be used within a load containment netting system. Widely accepted as an alternative to metal or other solid barrier systems, load containment safety netting provides a light weight, high-strength, easily customizable means to protect goods and personnel while allowing airflow, humidity control and clear visibility within sectioned containment areas. Netting containment systems are used on rack bays or gravity-flow rack channels to contain loose or falling objects. Palletized parts or boxes can become dislodged during bay loading. Rack netting containment systems can be placed vertically at the front, or pick face, and/or at the rear sides of racking systems prevent dislodged objects or full pallets from falling. Netting containment systems can be applied across multiple bays or as single bay units and secured by varying fasteners determined by frequency of access, load requirements and net or load sizes. Actuating systems can also be found in current netting containment systems to allow remotely operated rack bay access by use of pull cords or other means. In addition to vertical placement, horizontal netting can also be utilized in rack systems to protect against objects falling from one level to another or into tunnel areas, and to provide barriers between storage between and rack supports. = Steel mesh containment panels = Steel mesh containment panel system for pallet rack. As the distribution industry grew, alternative methods were sought for containing items dislodged from palletized storage while stored on pallet rack systems. Distributors found steel wire mesh panels were a viable alternative to netting containment systems. The following are the two types of steel mesh containment panels used for pallet racking: * Framed steel wire mesh panels are constructed of steel wire mesh, which may be welded or woven into a square, diamond, or rectangular pattern or welded or otherwise fixed into a shaped steel frame. The panels are mechanically attached to the existing pallet rack uprights with brackets. The panels may be mounted flush with the rack uprights, or more commonly, offset by several inches to allow for load overhang. * Unframed steel wire mesh panels are constructed of welded wire mesh with a bond shear edge (no tails on the edge) mechanically attached to the existing upright posts by the way of stand-off brackets, or sleeves of various lengths.

Sakai Hirochika, who was the son of Chikauji, had two sons, and their descendants gave rise to the two main branches of the Sakai clan. Hirochika's younger son, Sakai Masachika, served several Tokugawa clan leaders ‚Äì Nobutada, Kiyoyasu and Hirotada; and in 1561, Masachika was made master of Nishio Castle in Mikawa. Sakai Sigetada, who was the son of Masachika, received the fief of Kawagoe Domain in Musashi Province in 1590; and then in 1601, Sigetada was transferred to Umayabashi Domain in K≈çzuke Province.Papinot, p. 51. In 1749, the descendants of Tadakiyo were transferred to Himeji Domain (150,000 koku) in Harima Province, where they continued to live up through the Meiji Restoration. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Count\\" in the Meiji period. Events in Tadakiyo's life Tadayiko served under sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ietsuna as one of the R≈çj≈´ (chief advisor) from 1653‚Äì1666, and then as Tair≈ç, head of the R≈çj≈´ council, from 1666‚Äì1680.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Sakai Tadakiyo\\" in . Generally regarded today as self-indulgent and corrupt, his policies (or lack thereof) are generally said to have been responsible for initiating the shift to hedonism, and debauchery which characterized the Genroku era (1688‚Äì1704). Though a Golden Age for the arts, this era was regarded by the following generation of officials as one of immorality, impropriety, and excessive extravagance.Sansom, p. 63. By the time Tadakiyo became head of the R≈çj≈´ in 1666, most of the capable and stalwart politicians who might have opposed him, such as Matsudaira Nobutsuna had died. Abe Tadaaki remained as his only significant critic, until his death in 1671. Tadaaki constantly rebuked Tadakiyo for his poor sense of proper policy, and his laidback nature. He accused Tadakiyo of taking bribes, and of handling situations on a case-by- case basis, without any sense of overall policy or progress towards a goal. Tadakiyo was also criticized by a number of daimy≈ç, including a member of the Ikeda clan of Okayama Province, who warned of poor conditions and discontent in the provinces, and the threat of peasant revolt. From 1658 to 1674, Tadakiyo took a personal interest in the affairs of the Date clan of Sendai, and particularly in the Date Disturbance, a now-famous succession dispute within the clan over leadership of the family and the role of daimy≈ç. Tadakiyo was friendly with the former daimy≈ç of the clan, Date Tadamune, whose son Date Tsunamune, was arrested in 1660, and forced to retire from his post on accusations of drunkenness and debauchery. The regents who governed over his successor, Tsunamune's infant son Date Tsunamura, were then accused in turn of corruption and poor government. This element of the affair dragged out for ten years before Tadakiyo summoned the key parties involved to Edo in order to conduct a formal inquiry; this ultimately ended in the death of one Sendai retainer at the hands of another, who was in turn cut down by the Tair≈ç's guards.Sansom, pp. 63‚Äì67. Some historians believe that Tadakiyo could have, and should have, seen the entire affair to an end years earlier, and judge it likely therefore that he was taking bribes from Tsunamura's regents, who sought to draw out the situation and avoid any action being taken against them.Sansom, p. 67. When Shogun Ietsuna died in 1680, Tadakiyo suggested that his successor be chosen from the princely houses of the Imperial family. This reportedly infuriated R≈çj≈´ Hotta Masatoshi, who had been appointed the previous year, and who vehemently objected to this obvious attempt on Tadakiyo's part to seize power for himself; R≈çj≈´ and Tair≈ç wielded significant power, but were not meant to control shogunal succession, as this would also imply the ability to gain power over the shogun himself. Tadakiyo resigned his post, and Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Ietsuna's younger brother, was installed the following day, appointing Masatoshi as Tadakiyo's successor as Tair≈ç. Tadakiyo died the following year.Sansom, p. 68. References Further reading * Appert, Georges and H. Kinoshita. (1888). Ancien Japon. Tokyo: Imprimerie Kokubunsha.

Overview  DJ controllers are microprocessors based which are used to provide easier control of the software than the computer keyboard and touchpad on a laptop, or the touchscreen on tablet computers and smartphones. They do not mix audio signals like DJ mixers; rather, they send signals to a computer to tell the DJ software running on the computer how to mix audio. Many DJ controllers also have a built in sound card with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs), which allows the DJ to preview music in headphones before playing it on the main output. Most DJ controllers use the standard MIDI or HID protocols to communicate with the computer via USB. Modern DJ controllers emulate two turntables/CDJs and a DJ mixer. However, DJ controllers are much cheaper than two turntables or CDJs plus a mixer. Unlike turntables, controllers can take advantage of the flexibility of computer software, for example, by allowing the DJ to store multiple cue points with music files. Also, DJ software allows users to remap the components of controllers to perform different functions than the controller manufacturer intended. Some DJ controllers break from the conventional two jog wheels and a mixer layout and are designed to be easily mapped however the user wants. Some controllers are designed to be used either for live PA performances with software such as Ableton Live or with DJ software. A few DJ controllers, most notably the Novation Dicers, are designed to be used with timecode vinyl. Many of the DJ controller that can be used with timecode vinyl can also be used as MIDI devices, or even as standalone devices. DJ controllers are usually designed to work with only one or a few DJ software programs endorsed by the manufacturer. Most controllers use the standard MIDI or HID protocols, so other software can usually be made to work with them. However, it may take considerable effort to get a controller to work with software it was not designed for, and some controls may not make sense with other software. DJ controllers are slowly becoming as powerful as professional media players and mixers, including effects, LCD screens, and touch-sensitive performance pads. Modern DJ controllers also usually include drum pads, fader tempo control, and sometimes can even include motorized platters. With the exception of the classic look, feel, and operation of a vinyl turntable and mixer setup, DJ controllers are starting to be just as versatile and efficient for professional club DJs History Early examples of DJ controllers include the Hercules DJ Console released by Guillemot Corporation in 2004, which features a 6 channel soundcard with SPDIF and MIDI ports, traditional mixer-style faders, crossfader and EQs, jog wheels and CD DJ style button controls. In 2007, Vestax produced a controller specifically designed for DJing, the VCI-100, that emulated two turntables and a DJ mixer setup and was built with quality components acceptabzzz·æõle to DJs. Many manufacturers saw the success of the VCI-100 and started selling their own similar devices. Unlike the original VCI-100, some of those devices had integrated sound cards. In 2009, Pioneer DJ produced new models of their popular CDJ media players, the CDJ-2000 and CDJ-900, that could also be used as controllers to control DJ software via HID. This way, CDJs can be used to control DJ software without playing a timecode signal into a sound card. In 2010, Native Instruments released the Traktor Kontrol S4, which used high resolution jog wheels and a proprietary protocol rather than MIDI to achieve better performance of the jog wheels. The Mk2 of the Kontrol S4, released in 2013, uses standard HID signals rather than a proprietary protocol to communicate with the computer.

The album was released in April 1983 on White Label Records, a subsidiary of Mushroom Records. History In late 1980, Machinations recorded some songs at Trafalgar Studios in November 1980, the band entered the studio with producer Lobby Loyde. These recordings resulted in the band's debut single, \\"Average Inadequacy\\"/\\"Arabia\\" in September 1981, and the four-track debut self-titled, Machinations EP, in December, both released on the independent Phantom Records label. \\"Average Inadequacy\\" created enough interest for Mushroom's White Label to sign the band and reissue the single with a new B-side, \\"Machinations of Dance\\" in March 1982. A year later, Machinations issued a new single, \\"Jack\\"/\\"Be Double\\" in February 1983, prior to their debut album release, but it failed to chart. Esteem peaked at #54 on the Australian album charts. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. It was also released in the United States by A&M; Records. Musically, the album contained synthpop with dark overtones, except for the single \\"Pressure Sway\\", a bright funk/pop song that was a dance-floor favourite. Singles The first single, \\"Jack\\" was about US writer Jack Kerouac, and due to lyrical reference to illegal drugs ('I wanna take some 1960s LSD'), \\"Jack\\" was often not played in live sets when audiences included minors.

Choshu cannons firing on Western shipping in Shimonoseki. Japanese painting. The was an edict issued by the Japanese Emperor K≈çmei in 1863 against the Westernization of Japan following the opening of the country by Commodore Perry in 1854. The order The edict was based on widespread anti-foreign and legitimist sentiment, called the \\"Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians\\" movement. Emperor K≈çmei personally agreed with such sentiments, and ‚Äì breaking with centuries of imperial tradition ‚Äì began to take an active role in matters of state: as opportunities arose, he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession. His efforts culminated on March 11, 1863 with his \\"Order to expel barbarians\\". A deadline for the expulsion was set two months later to May 11. Consequences The Shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, and the Edict inspired attacks against the Shogunate itself as well as against foreigners in Japan. The most famous incident was the firing on foreign shipping in the Shimonoseki Strait off Ch≈çsh≈´ Province as soon as the deadline was reached.Hagiwara, p. 35. Masterless samurai (r≈çnin) rallied to the cause, assassinating Shogunate officials and Westerners. The killing of the English trader Charles Lennox Richardson is sometimes considered as a result of this policy. The Tokugawa government was required to pay an indemnity of a hundred thousand British pounds for Richardson's death.Jansen, pp. 314‚Äì315. But this turned out to be the zenith of the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement, since the Western powers responded to Japanese attacks on western shipping with the Bombardment of Shimonoseki. Heavy reparations had earlier been demanded from Satsuma for the murder of Charles Lennox Richardson ‚Äì the Namamugi Incident. When these were not forthcoming, a squadron of Royal Navy vessels went to the Satsuma port of Kagoshima to coerce the daimy≈ç into paying. Instead, he opened fire on the ships from his shore batteries, and the squadron retaliated. This was later referred to, inaccurately, as the Bombardment of Kagoshima. These incidents clearly showed that Japan was no match for Western military might, and that brutal confrontation could not be the solution. These events, however, also served to further weaken the shogunate, which appeared too powerless and compromising in its relations with Western powers. Ultimately the rebel provinces allied and overthrew the shogunate in the Boshin War and the subsequent Meiji Restoration.

Located in Saint Petersburg, it operates 20 faculties and more than 100 departments. Embroidered in its structure are the Institute of Pre-University Courses, the Institute of Continuous Professional Development, and the Pedagogical Research Center. The university is named after the Russian writer and philosopher Alexander Herzen. History The university dates its creation to , when Emperor Paul I of Russia gave an independent status to the Saint Petersburg foundling house established by Ivan Betskoy and put it under the patronage of Empress Maria Feodorovna. The Imperial Foundling House eventually developed into the modern Pedagogical University.. Betskoy's humanistic ideas furnished the basic principles of the foundling house. The strong pedagogical traditions and consistency in education were passed from one generation to the next and were finally inherited by The State Russian Herzen Pedagogical University. The foundling house was based in a unique architectural complex: the palaces of the earl Kirill Razumovsky and Aleksey Grigorievich Bobrinsky on the Moyka in present-day Saint Petersburg. The Imperial Foundling House developed as a complex educational establishment carrying progressive ideas of upbringing based upon charity and patronage. It mainly took in destitute and deprived children: foundling orphans, disabled children, and children from failed marriages. Besides being an educational establishment and a center for childcare, the foundling house had an operating hospital. Surrounding village districts had for the first time access to free pediatric care. Old view of the Razumovsky Palace compound The foundling house laid the basis for women's pedagogical education across the country. In 1837, the \\"Women's Foundling Institute\\" was established on the basis of the House's higher classes. After 1885 it was called Nicholas' Foundling House. Its graduates were taught by a tutor, a music and dancing pedagogue and a French language teacher. The vast experience of the Nicholas' Foundling house gave rise to the establishment of the first institution for pedagogical higher education: the Women's Pedagogical Institute that was established in 1903. Concerned with the foundling house is the onset of Russian applied correctional pedagogy. In 1806, a new unit appeared in the structure of the house. It was a college for the deaf, the first educational establishment for disabled children in Russia. Here, the first Russian pedagogues for deaf children were educated and their first works on the subject were created. In 1864, a pedagogical seminary was created for countryside students who were to become teachers of public schools and colleges. Four years later, a women's college was established that granted specialisations of a fully trained nurse, village school and kindergarten children. This set the basis for Russian pre-school education. During these years, kindergartens were set up in the district of the foundling house. The graduates of the House successfully worked in the new establishments for children. In the Mariininsky department, a reorganised foundling house, famous pedagogues like M. V. Chistyakov worked, the editor-in-chief of \\"Children's magazine\\" and the author of numerous books for children, and V. A. Zolotov, an active adherent of the \\"sound method\\" of teaching reading and writing and an author of a lot of textbooks for public colleges. K. D. Ushinsky's pedagogical ideas rendered immense influence on restructuring the departments of the foundling house. Thanks to the work of Mariininsky department and its foundling house, the pace of pedagogical education in Saint Petersburg in the beginning of the 20th century took an unusual course. A whole system of establishments dealing with a range of questions concerning birth, pre-school, elementary, high-school, higher education, and correctional pedagogics was set, giving rise to a prototype of the prospective university. Herzen University as seen from Moika River In 1918, the consolidation process of Mariinsky department and foundling house-related establishments started. In the same year, the Women's Pedagogical University was renamed the First Pedagogical Institute. Based on the Teachers' Board, the second Pedagogical Institute was established. On 17 October 1918, the third Pedagogical Institute was created. In 1918, the foundling house-related establishments were reorganized into the Pre-school Education Institute and Social Education Institute. These were the first higher education facilities in Russia that specialized in pre-school and primary school education and defectology. In the period between 1922 and 1925, the first, second, and third Pedagogical Universities, the Pre-school education Institute, the Social Education Institute, and the Psychoneurological Institute were merged. The united establishment was named State Leningrad Herzen Pedagogical Institute. Notable staff and alumni Over the years, the university has been the workspace for outstanding scientists, academicians, and professors. Many of them initiated worldwide known scientific schools, thus making a valuable input in development of Russian science. * Anan'ev B.

It is based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Stephen King. The plot focuses on the strained relationship between a mother and her daughter, largely told through flashbacks, after her daughter arrives to her remote hometown on a Maine island where her mother has been accused of murdering the elderly woman for whom she cared. The screenplay for Dolores Claiborne was adapted by Tony Gilroy, and the film was shot in Nova Scotia in 1994. Kathy Bates stated in a retrospective interview that her performance as the titular Dolores was her favorite performance she had ever given. In 2013, Time named the film among the top 10 greatest Stephen King film adaptations. Plot In 1995, Dolores Claiborne works as a domestic servant on Little Tall Island in Maine. Dolores has a struggle with her elderly, paralyzed employer, Vera Donovan, in her mansion. Vera falls down the staircase and Dolores ransacks the kitchen. She is caught by a mailman, who sees her standing over Vera with a rolling pin, apparently intending to kill her. Vera dies and the police begin a murder investigation. Dolores' daughter, Selena St. George, is a successful journalist, living in New York City, who battles depression and substance abuse. Selena arrives in town to support her mother, despite her own doubts about Dolores' innocence. Dolores insists she did not kill her employer. Selena finds little sympathy for Dolores, as the entire town believes she murdered her husband, Joe St. George, almost 20 years earlier. Some of the town's inhabitants harass her by vandalizing her home, taunting her in the street, and driving by her house and screaming at her. Detective John Mackey, who was the chief detective in her husband's murder case, is determined to put Dolores away for life. Selena also believes Dolores killed her father, and has not spoken to her mother in over a decade. In 1975, Joe was an abusive alcoholic, and one night Dolores had threatened to kill him if he ever harmed her again. Selena, then 13 years old, was unaware her mother was being abused. Dolores went to work as a housemaid for millionaire Vera Donovan to save money to pay for Selena's education. Dolores went to the bank to withdraw her money so Selena and she could flee Joe's abuse. The plan was abandoned, however, when Dolores discovered that Joe had stolen the money from Selena's savings account. Dolores says Vera threw herself down the staircase and begged Dolores to put her out of her misery. Mackey refuses to believe her, and reveals that Vera has left her entire fortune to Dolores. Mackey informs them the will is eight years old, which nearly convinces Selena her mother is guilty. Dolores eventually tells Selena that before he died, Dolores realized Joe was sexually abusing Selena when he gave her an heirloom locket. Selena has always furiously denied any abuse, and after a fierce argument, she storms out, leaving Dolores to fend for herself. Back in 1975, Dolores broke down and confessed Joe's abuses to Vera, who remained characteristically cold until Dolores mentioned that he was molesting Selena. Turning unusually sympathetic, Vera implied she killed her own late, unfaithful husband, Jack, and engineered it to look like an accident. Vera's confession formed a bond between the two women and convinced Dolores to take control of her situation. As a total solar eclipse approached, Dolores was pointedly given the rest of the day off by Vera. Dolores and Selena had an argument about Dolores' suspicions regarding Joe's sexual abuse. Selena fled home for the weekend to work at a hotel, where guests had flocked for the eclipse. Joe soon returned from working on a fishing boat, and Dolores offered him a bottle of Scotch to celebrate the eclipse. After Joe got drunk, Dolores revealed she knew he stole from Selena's account and molested his own daughter, then provoked him into attacking her and falling down an old well, leaving him to die as he plunges to the stone bottom. Selena hears this entire story on a tape left for her by Dolores, who had foreseen her departure. While on the ferry, Selena suddenly uncovers a repressed memory of her father forcing her to give him a handjob. Realizing everything, Selena rushes back to Dolores as she is attending the coroner's inquest. As Mackey makes a case to be sent to a grand jury in an attempt to indict Dolores for murder, Selena arrives and tells him he has no admissible evidence, he is only doing this because of his personal vendetta against Dolores, and that despite an often stormy relationship, Vera and Dolores loved each other. Realizing that the case would likely end with either a dismissal or acquittal, Mackey reluctantly drops the charges. Dolores and Selena reconcile on the ferry wharf before Selena returns to New York.

Themes and interpretations Though typically classified as a drama and psychological thriller, some critics, such as Roger Ebert, have classified Dolores Claiborne as a horror film, while it has also been identified as a Gothic romance. =Repression= Film theorist Kirsten Thompson identifies the film as a melodrama, \\"produced by the repression of specific traumas, [in this case] domestic violence and incest.\\" According to Martha McCaughey and Neal King, the film's use of flashbacks suggest a specific narrative point of view when considering the film's themes of abuse and incest between Dolores, as well as Selena and Joe: \\"That all the flashbacks save one belong to Dolores tells us that not only are we watching her story; it also tells us of the unavailability of the past to Selena, and of the displacement and repression forced into play by the girl's experience of incest.\\" The flashback scene in which Selena recalls her father's forcing her to masturbate him on the ferry has been particularly noted by critics: \\"Here, Selena and the viewer alike come finally to see Joe's transgressions, and by implication, to understand the truth of Dolores' tale. Throughout this scene, the perspective offered by the camera remains firmly focused on the reactions of the victim of the sexual crime.\\" =Feminist interpretation= Dolores Claiborne has been cited as a \\"self-consciously feminist\\" film that \\"combines the melodramatic impulse with the investigative structure of a noir crime thriller and a contemporary feminist consciousness.\\" The film has also been read as an example of a maternal melodrama that features an \\"idealized mother-figure\\" who sacrifices the needs of her own for others. In the book Screening Genders, one scholar considered Dolores Claiborne and Stage Door (1937) to be the only \\"truly feminist\\" films made in Hollywood, in that they \\"don't cop out at the end.\\" Reception Kathy Bates was praised by critics for her portrayal in the film. Dolores Claiborne received mostly positive reviews from critics; it currently holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews with an average rating of 6.75. The site's consensus states: \\"Post-Misery Kathy Bates proves to be another wonderful conduit for Stephen King's novels in this patient, gradually terrifying thriller.\\" The film also has a rating of 62 on Metacritic, citing \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \\"a vivid film that revolves around Ms. Bates's powerhouse of a performance... Only after the film has carefully laid the groundwork for a story of old wounds and violent mishaps does the anticlimactic truth become apparent.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and praised the performances of Bates and Leigh, saying: \\"This is a horror story, all right, but not a supernatural one; all of the elements come out of such everyday horrors as alcoholism, wife beating, child abuse and the sin of pride.\\" Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the film a negative review, awarding it a D+ rating and saying: \\"This solemnly ludicrous \\"psychological\\" thriller is like one of Hollywood's old-hag gothics turned into a therapeutic grouse-a- thon ‚Äì it's Hush‚Ä¶ Hush, Sweet Charlotte for the Age of Oprah.\\" =Box office= The movie debuted at number three for the week of March 26, 1995, with $5,721,920. It went on to make $24,361,867 domestically. That ranks it as the 15th-highest grossing film based on a Stephen King novel, unadjusted for inflation. Adjusting for inflation, it ranks as the 17th-highest. =Awards= Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh were nominated for the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards at the 22nd Saturn Awards. Ellen Muth also won the Tokyo International Film Festival Award for Best Supporting Actress.

History  The Labour inspection was officially created by the 19 May 1874 law during the Third Republic, establishing a body of 15 divisionary inspectors, and several departmental inspectors. However, they were not very efficient. Following the International Conference on Labour in Berlin on 15 March 1890, envisioning the creation of an international labour legislation, the Third Republic created by the 2 November 1892 law a specialized body of civil servants dedicated to inspection of labour conditions. It was first of all charged of the surveillance of the implementation of the 22 March 1841 law prohibiting child labour of less than 8 years old. This law had been enacted following reports by the physician Ren√© Villerm√©. The 1890 law also enacted a maximal length of work for children, women and underage girls. The function was popularized by the inspector Pierre Hamp, who maintained a chronicle in L'Humanit√© newspaper from 1906 to 1912. Following the creation of the Ministry of Labour in 1906, the IT became one of its services. In 1947, the 81st International Convention of the International Labour Organization forced all ratifying states to \\"organize a system of labour inspection\\". France ratified it under the Fourth Republic by a 10 August 1950 law. In 1975, a law was introduced to limit and regulate redundancies making it compulsory for employers wishing to carry out redundancies to obtain the authorization of labour inspectors. This law was abolished in 1986 by Jacques Chirac administration. During a routine inspection of seasonal workers on a vineyard on 2 September 2004, Claude Duviau, a farmer from Saussignac shot and killed two labour inspectors, Sylvie Tr√©mouille and Daniel Buffi√®re. Duviau was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He died in custody on 26 January 2016. The shooting led to a nation-wide debate on labour inspectors' work conditions in France.  Number of inspectors  There are in 2010 600 Labour Inspectors and 1219 controllers. Each year, they established approximatively 16.000 proc√®s- verbaux, of which only a fourth lead to a sanction of the employer.

When his father died in December 1094, the military strongman, al-Afdal Shahanshah, raised Nizar's younger brother al-Musta'li to the throne in Cairo, bypassing the claims of Nizar and other older sons of al-Mustansir. Nizar escaped Cairo, rebelled and seized Alexandria, where he reigned as caliph with the regnal name al-Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ li-Dƒ´n AllƒÅh (). In late 1095 he was defeated and taken prisoner to Cairo, where he was killed by immurement. Many Isma'ilis, especially in Persia, who rejected al-Musta'li's imamate and considered Nizar as the rightful imam, split off from the Fatimid regime and founded the Nizari branch of Isma'ilism, with their own line of imams who claimed descent from Nizar that continues to this day. Later during the 12th century some of Nizar's actual or claimed descendants tried, without success, to seize the throne from the Fatimid caliphs. Life Nizar was born on 26 September 1045 to the ruling Fatimid imam‚Äìcaliph, al-Mustansir (). At that time, al-Mustansir was around 15 years old and had already been on the throne for ten years. Nizar was most likely the eldest son of the caliph, although another son named Abdallah is sometimes listed as the senior of al-Mustansir's sons. About 1068, as internal turmoils led the dynasty close to collapse, al-Mustansir dispersed his sons throughout his territories as a safeguard; although Nizar is not mentioned by name except in later versions of this story, he was likely involved in this scheme as well. This flight lasted at least until the Armenian commander Badr al-Jamali assumed power in 1073 as vizier and quasi- dictator and restored order in Egypt. In 1094, shortly before his death, Badr was succeeded by his son, al-Afdal Shahanshah. =Disputed succession= As the oldest son, Nizar was apparently considered to be his father's most likely successor, as was the custom; indeed, historians often state that Nizar had been his father's designated (na·π£·π£) successor. However, no definite designation of Nizar as heir seems to have taken place by the time of al- Mustansir's death. The Mamluk-era historian al-Maqrizi writes that this was due to the machinations of al-Afdal, who had prevented al-Mustansir from making his choice of Nizar public because of a deep-seated enmity between the two men. Reportedly, the vizier had once tried to enter the palace on horseback, whereupon Nizar yelled at him to dismount and called him a \\"dirty Armenian\\". Since then, the two had been bitter enemies, with al-Afdal obstructing Nizar's activities and demoting his servants, while at the same time winning the army's commanders over to his cause. Only one of them, the Berber Muhammad ibn Masal al-Lukki, is said to have remained loyal to Nizar, because he had promised to appoint him vizier instead of al-Afdal. Gold dinar minted in al-Musta'li's name Indeed, when al-Mustansir died in December 1094, al-Afdal, who himself had only recently succeeded his own father, raised a much younger half-brother of Nizar, al-Musta'li to the throne and the imamate. Furthermore, Al-Musta'li, who had just married al-Afdal's sister, was completely dependent on al-Afdal for his accession. This made him a compliant figurehead who was unlikely to threaten al-Afdal's recent, and therefore as yet fragile, hold on power by attempting to appoint another to the vizierate. Some later accounts hold that al-Musta'li's accession was indeed legitimate, by asserting that on the wedding banquet, or on his deathbed, al-Mustansir had chosen him as his heir, and that one of al-Mustansir's sisters is said to have been called to him privately and received al-Musta'li's nomination as a bequest. Modern historians, such as Farhad Daftary, believe that these stories are most likely attempts to justify and retroactively legitimize what was in effect a coup d'√©tat by al-Afdal. However, al-Maqrizi also includes a different narrative that casts doubt on whether al-Afdal's move was really a carefully prepared coup. When al-Afdal summoned three of al-Mustansir's sons‚ÄîNizar, Abdallah, and Isma'il, apparently the most prominent among the caliph's progeny‚Äîto the palace to do homage to al-Musta'li, who had been seated on the throne, they each refused. Not only did they reject al-Musta'li, but each of them claimed that al-Mustansir had chosen him as his successor. Nizar claimed that he had a written document to this effect. This refusal apparently took al-Afdal completely by surprise. The brothers were allowed to leave the palace; but while Abdallah and Isma'il made for a nearby mosque, Nizar fled Cairo immediately. To add to the confusion, having learned of al- Mustansir's passing, Baraqat, the chief missionary (dƒÅ øƒ±ÃÑ) of Cairo (the head of the Isma'ili religious establishment) proclaimed Abdallah as caliph with the regnal name al-Muwaffaq. However, al-Afdal soon regained control. Baraqat was arrested (and later executed), Abdallah and Isma'il were placed under surveillance and eventually acknowledged al-Musta'li, and a grand assembly of officials was held, which acclaimed al-Musta'li as imam and caliph. =Rebellion and death= In the meantime, Nizar fled to Alexandria with a few followers. The local governor, a Turk named Nasr al-Dawla Aftakin, opposed al- Afdal, so Nizar was quickly able to gain his support. He also won over the local qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (\\"magistrate\\"), the inhabitants and the surrounding Arab tribes to his cause. He then rose in revolt and proclaimed himself imam and caliph with the title of al-Mustafa li-Din Allah (\\"the Chosen One for God's Religion\\"). A gold dinar of Nizar, bearing this title, was discovered in 1994, attesting to his assumption of the caliphal title and the minting of coinage with it. According to the historian Paul E. Walker, the speed with which Nizar gained support, and some other stories narrated in al-Maqrizi, suggest the existence of a relatively large faction that expected or wanted him to succeed al- Mustansir. Nizar's revolt was initially successful: al-Afdal's attack on Alexandria in February 1095 was easily repulsed, and Nizar's forces raided up to the outskirts of Cairo. Over the next months, however, al-Afdal managed to win back the allegiance of the Arab tribes with bribes and gifts. Weakened, Nizar's forces were pushed back to Alexandria, which was placed under siege. In November, Ibn Masal abandoned the city with most of the remaining treasure, forcing Aftakin and Nizar to surrender against a writ of safety (amƒÅn). Both were taken back to Cairo, where Nizar was immured alive and Aftakin was executed. Nizari schism Despite problems with succession arrangements before, the events surrounding al-Musta'li's accession was the first time that rival members of the Fatimid dynasty had actually fought over it. This was of momentous importance since, given the pivotal role of the imam in the Isma'ili faith, the issue of succession was not merely a matter of political intrigue, but also intensely religious. In the words of the historian Samuel Miklos Stern, \\"on it depended the continuity of institutional religion as well as the personal salvation of the believer\\". To the Isma'ili faithful, writes Stern, it was \\"not so much the person of the claimant that weighed with his followers; they were not moved by any superior merits of Nizar as a ruler [...] it was the divine right personified in the legitimate heir that counted\\". Isma'ili imams resulting from the Musta'li‚ÄìNizari and Hafizi‚ÄìTayyibi schisms As a result, the events of 1094‚Äì1095 caused a bitter and permanent schism in the Isma'ili movement, that continues to this day. While al-Musta'li was recognized by the Fatimid establishment and the official Isma'ili da øwa, as well as the Isma'ili communities dependent on it in Syria and Yemen, most of the Isma'ili communities in the wider Middle East, and especially Persia and Iraq, rejected it. Whether out of genuine conviction, or as a convenient excuse to rid himself of Cairo's tutelage, Hassan-i Sabbah, the chief Isma'ili leader in Persia, swiftly recognized Nizar's rights to the imamate, severed relations with Cairo, and set up his own independent da øwa (the da øwa jadƒ´da, \\"new calling\\"). This marked the permanent and enduring split of the Isma'ili movement into the rival \\"Musta'li\\" and \\"Nizari\\" branches. Hassan-i Sabbah founded the Nizari Order of Assassins, which was responsible for the assassination of al-Afdal in 1121, and of al-Musta'li's son and successor al- Amir bi-Ahkam Allah (who was also al-Afdal's nephew and son-in-law) in October 1130. This led to a succession of coups and crises that heralded the final decline, and eventual collapse, of the Fatimid state. In 1130‚Äì1131 the dynasty was temporarily abolished outright by al-Afdal's son Kutayfat, before Nizar's nephew Abd al-Majid, in the absence of a direct heir of al-Amir, assumed the imamate and the caliphate as al-Hafiz li-Din Allah in January 1132. Al-Hafiz' succession led to another schism in Isma'ilism, between those Musta'lis who accepted al-Hafiz' succession (the \\"Hafizis\\") and those who did not, upholding instead the imamate of al-Amir's infant son al-Tayyib (the \\"Tayyibis\\"). Whereas Nizari Isma'ilism survived in Persia and Syria, and Tayyibi Isma'ilism in Yemen and India, the Hafizi sect, closely associated with the Fatimid state, did not long survive the latter's final abolition by Saladin in 1171. Descendants and succession Contemporary sources attest that Nizar had sons. At least one of them, al-Husayn, fled with other members of the dynasty (including three of Nizar's brothers, Muhammad, Isma'il, and Tahir) from Egypt to the western Maghreb in 1095, where they formed a sort of opposition in exile to the new regime in Cairo. In 1132, following the highly irregular accession of al-Hafiz, al-Husayn tried to return to Egypt. He managed to raise an army, but al-Hafiz successfully suborned his commanders and had him killed. In 1149, al-Hafiz had to confront a similar threat by a purported son of Nizar. He also managed to recruit a large following among the Berbers, but he was also killed when the Fatimid caliph bribed his commanders. The last revolt by a Nizari claimant was by al-Husayn's son Muhammad in 1162, but he was lured with false promises and executed by the vizier Tala'i ibn Ruzzik. There are indications that another of Nizar's sons, named Muhammad, had left for Yemen. None of these sons had been designated as successor by Nizar, however, so they lacked the legitimacy to become imam after him. This raised an acute problem for the Nizari faithful, as the line of divinely ordained imams could not possibly be broken. At first, some Nizaris held that Nizar was not dead would return as the Mahdi (or at least with him). Indeed, coinage from Alamut Castle, the centre of Hassan's nascent Nizari Isma'ili state in central Persia, was minted with Nizar's regnal name of al-Mustafa li-Din Allah until 1162. No imam was named publicly at Alamut until then, and Hassan-i Sabbah and his two immediate successors ruled instead as dƒÅ øƒ±ÃÑs and ·∏•ujjas (\\"seals, proofs\\"), representatives of the absent imam. However, the Nizaris soon came to believe that a son or grandson of Nizar had been smuggled out of Egypt and brought to Alamut. He and his two successors‚Äî, , and ‚Äîare held to have been imams in occultation until 1162, when with Hassan II, the imams reappeared in public and took up the reins of the Nizari state. The current head of Nizari Islam, the Aga Khan, claims descent in direct line from Nizar via Hassan II.

Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"unusually impressive\\", it has both north and south aisles and owes much of its interest to the Victorian restoration undertaken by J. D. Sedding between 1885 and 1889 which was funded by Henry Mildmay of Flete. However, the tower and spire survive from the 14th century; there is a square Norman font carved with lions, a tree and leaf decoration; and the rood screen, 1535, restored by Sedding, is very finely carved. The east window contains stained glass by Heywood Sumner (1866), and later windows in the north aisle are by Hugh Easton.Cherry & Pevsner, pp. 484‚Äì5 Monuments within the church include, in the north chapel, a large one to three generations of the Hele family which includes a semi- reclining figure of Sir Thomas Hele of Flete (died 1670). Also to the Bulteel family, 1801, in Coade stone; and in the chancel a separate one to Elizabeth Bulteel (died 1835). Holbeton today The local primary school takes the majority of the local children.

The Norroy Kings of Arms recorded their genealogies on their visitations of Lancashire in 1613 and 1664. The original Elizabethan Howarth Hall in Great Howarth was demolished in the early 19th century.

It is a sequel to Trancers and is set six years after the events of the first. Plot Los Angeles, 1991. Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) has gotten used to life with his wife Lena (Helen Hunt) in the six years since they killed Whistler. Hap Ashby (Biff Manard) has made a fortune investing and has moved from the streets to a palatial estate, sharing it with Jack and Lena. But life is about to get difficult for Jack. Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo (Richard Lynch), has gone back in time and created a \\"trancer farm\\" under the guise of an environmental organization. GreenWorld claims it strives to 'clean up the world', but actually they kidnap homeless people and mental patients to enslave in a trancer army. Once again, Hap is under attack, useful to Wardo as the ancestor of future Angel City Council Member Ashe. Jack is ready to singe some trancers in the name of the law, but he does not expect his dead wife Alice (Megan Ward) to show up‚Äîand neither is Lena. Alice has been saved from death by the City Council and sent back to 1991 to help Jack stop Wardo. The tension mounts as Lena becomes fearful of losing Jack to his future wife, Hap returns to drinking alcohol to deal with the stress, and Jack realizes that when Alice returns to the future, she will die again. Somehow, Jack must find a way to save more than just the future.

Potokinov√°, Ivan Krasko, Janko Cig√°≈à, 12 July 1876 in Lukovi≈°tia (Lukovistye) ‚Äì 3 March 1958 in Bratislava) was a Slovak poet, translator and representative of modernism in Slovakia. Biography He was born into a peasant family in Lukovi≈°tia, a village in the Gemer (G√∂m√∂r) region. He studied at the Hungarian grammar school in Rimavsk√° Sobota (Rimaszombat), later at German grammar schools in Sibiu and Bra≈üov, where he graduated. In 1900 he applied for the study of chemical engineering in Prague, where he successfully graduated in 1905. He was a member of the Slovak association Detvan. He worked then for some time as a chemist in the town of Klobuky, later in a chemical factory in Slan√Ω. When the First World War broke out, he went to fight on the Eastern Front against the Russian Empire. After end of the war, he returned to Czechoslovakia and started working as a politician, becoming a member of parliament and a senator of the Agrarian Party. He mostly lived in Bratislava, but in 1943, he moved to Pie≈°≈•any, where he lived until 1958. He died on 3 March 1958 in Bratislava, and is interred in Lukovi≈°tia. There is a memorial room in Pie≈°≈•any, opened in 1976, dedicated to his life and work. A street in Pie≈°≈•any is named after him. Literary output He started writing poems during his grammar school studies, but he published first of them only in 1896, called Piese≈à n√°≈°ho ƒæudu (app. Song of our folk). He published his works under pseudonym Janko Cig√°≈à until second half of the 1900s, when he changed his poetical name to Ivan Krasko (Ivan = J√°n in Slovak, Russian name and Krasko = after the village of Kraskovo). He has written some more works in the 1910s, but many of his first works were first published in the 1950s. The topics include: social inequality, Magyarisation of the Slovak nation, passivity of young generation and also his personal sadness. He also wanted to write poetic composition about his experience from the World War I and protests against it, but only the introduction was published in 1929 under the name \\"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\\" (a Hebrew/Aramaic New Testament quote that reads Bo≈æe m√¥j, Bo≈æe m√¥j, preƒço si ma opustil? in Slovak and My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? in King James Version English).

Polymers containing inorganic and organic components are sometimes called hybrid polymers, and most so-called inorganic polymers are hybrid polymers.Inorganic Two-dimensional Nanomaterials, Editor: Changzheng Wu, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2017. One of the best known examples is polydimethylsiloxane, otherwise known commonly as silicone rubber. Inorganic polymers offer some properties not found in organic materials including low- temperature flexibility, electrical conductivity, and nonflammability.Manners, Ian, \\"Polymers and the periodic table: recent developments in inorganic polymer science\\", Angewandte Chemie, International Edition in English 1996, volume 35, 1603‚Äì1621. . The term inorganic polymer refers generally to one- dimensional polymers, rather than to heavily crosslinked materials such as silicate minerals. Inorganic polymers with tunable or responsive properties are sometimes called smart inorganic polymers. A special class of inorganic polymers are geopolymers, which may be anthropogenic or naturally occurring.  Main group backbone  Traditionally, the area of inorganic polymers focuses on materials in which the backbone is composed exclusively of main- group elements. =Homochain polymers= Homochain polymers have only one kind of atom in the main chain. One member is polymeric sulfur, which forms reversibly upon melting any of the cyclic allotropes, such as S8. Organic polysulfides and polysulfanes feature short chains of sulfur atoms, capped respectively with alkyl and H. Elemental tellurium and the gray allotrope of elemental selenium also are polymers, although they are not processable. The gray allotrope of selenium consists of helical chains of Se atoms. Polymeric forms of the group IV elements are well known. The premier materials are polysilanes, which are analogous to polyethylene and related organic polymers. They are more fragile than the organic analogues and, because of the longer Si‚ÄìSi bonds, carry larger substituents. Poly(dimethylsilane) is prepared by reduction of dimethyldichlorosilane. Pyrolysis of poly(dimethylsilane) gives SiC fibers. Heavier analogues of polysilanes are also known to some extent. These include polygermanes, (R2Ge)n, and polystannanes, (R2Sn)n. =Heterochain polymers= Si-based Heterochain polymers have more than one type of atom in the main chain. Typically two types of atoms alternate along the main chain. Of great commercial interest are the polysiloxanes, where the main chain features Si and O centers: ‚àíSi‚àíO‚àíSi‚àíO‚àí. Each Si center has two substituents, usually methyl or phenyl. Examples include polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, (Me2SiO)n), polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS (MeSi(H)O)n) and polydiphenylsiloxane (Ph2SiO)n).Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. ‚ÄúInorganic Polymers‚Äù, Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. . Related to the siloxanes are the polysilazanes. These materials have the backbone formula ‚àíSi‚àíN‚àíSi‚àíN‚àí. One example is perhydridopolysilazane PHPS. Such materials are of academic interest. P-based A related family of well studied inorganic polymers are the polyphosphazenes. They feature the backbone ‚àíP‚àíN‚àíP‚àíN‚àí. With two substituents on phosphorus, they are structurally similar related to the polysiloxanes. Such materials are generated by ring-opening polymerization of hexachlorophosphazene followed by substitution of the P‚àíCl groups by alkoxide. Such materials find specialized applications as elastomers. General structure of polyphosphazenes. Gray spheres represent any organic or inorganic group. B-based Boron‚Äìnitrogen polymers feature ‚àíB‚àíN‚àíB‚àíN‚àí backbones. Examples are polyborazylenes, polyaminoboranes. S-based The polythiazyls have the backbone ‚àíS‚àíN‚àíS‚àíN‚àí. Unlike most inorganic polymers, these materials lack substituents on the main chain atoms. Such materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, a finding that attracted much attention during the era when polyacetylene was discovered. It is superconducting below 0.26 K. Ionomers Usually not classified with charge-neutral inorganic polymers are ionomers. Phosphorus‚Äìoxygen and boron- oxide polymers include the polyphosphates and polyborates.  Transition- metal-containing polymers  Inorganic polymers also include materials with transition metals in the backbone. Rarely are such materials processible. Examples are Krogmann's salt and Magnus's green salt. Magnus's green salt, which is not a salt, features a one-dimension chain of weak Pt‚ÄìPt bonds.  Polymerization methods  Inorganic polymers are formed, like organic polymers, by: * Step-growth polymerization: Polysiloxanes; * Chain-growth polymerization: Polysilanes; * Ring-opening polymerization: Poly(dichlorophosphazene). Reactions Inorganic polymers are precursors to inorganic solids. This type of reaction is illustrated by the stepwise conversion of ammonia borane to discrete rings and oligomers, which upon pyrolysis give boron nitrides.

Nina is a neuroscientistBBC Scotland Press Release who enlists the help of five Neurons (animated characters representing the senses) in her brain to answer a scientific question. The show is produced by Lucille McLaughlin, who has also produced the children's programmes Balamory, Me Too! and Bits and Bobs. The series is commissioned by CBeebies Controller, Michael Carrington. Synopsis/plot Most of the show is based at Glasgow Science Centre, with a small part taking place outdoors. At the start of the show, Nina conducts experiments in front of an unseen audience of children. At one point of the show, Nina is 'contacted' by (usually two or three, but rarely four) children, who appears on a computer screen asking a science-related question (e.g., ‚ÄòWhat makes rainbows appear and disappear?‚Äô) Nina then chooses one (or more) of the five Neurons inside her brain based upon which of the senses is most appropriate to answer the question. Once the Neuron has been selected, the children (called the 'experimenters') then visit Nina, using fun experiments and games. Afterwards, Nina takes the children out to find out more about the answer to the question, sometimes with the help of their friends and family. After they have found out the answer to the question, they travel back to the Glasgow Science Centre to do another experiment. Then, the ‚Äòexperimenters‚Äô leave. At the end of each show, a song is sung, which changes from series to series depending on the theme of the series. Then, the Neurons discuss what they have done and the individual role they have played. The show ends with Nina and the Neurons bidding farewell to the viewers.Nina And The Neurons Official Logo 2007-Present Characters and cast The main character of Nina is played by Scottish actress Katrina Bryan. She is a scientist who works in the lab. Nina wears either a white lab coat with brightly coloured cuffs and lapels in her lab, or one of a bright yellow coat or blue jacket when outside. In the programme, Nina drives either a pale blue 1970s Volkswagen Type 2 (Transporter) minibus or a New MINI, both bearing numberplates reading 'NINA', or rides a bicycle in the Go ECO! version. The Neurons are computer-animated characters (stylised with human facial features and body, but no legs) who live inside Nina's brain, with no legs, and are named to reflect the five senses which they represent: Felix, voiced by James Dreyfus in the first series but subsequently by Lewis MacLeod, represents touch. He is green, speaks in a posh accent and is particular about his appearance. Belle, voiced by Kelly Harrison represents hearing. She is pink but also loud and can be bossy. She's also the group vice leader. Luke, voiced by Patrice Naiambana, represents sight. He is yellow and is also the group leader. His character is laid back and relaxed, and speaks with a Jamaican accent. Ollie, voiced by Siobhan Redmond represents smell. She is purple and described as 'sweet, self- assured and a bit of a goth.'Cbbeebies Grownups at the BBC She is the elder sister of Bud. Bud, voiced by Sharon Small represents the taste neuron. He speaks with a Scottish accent. He is blue and also the youngest Neuron and can be enthusiastic and easily excited. He is the younger brother of Ollie. Bud and Ollie are often chosen together by Nina due to the way taste and smell work together. Felix and Luke got chosen together by Nina due to the way touch and sight work together. Belle and Luke got chosen together by Nina due to the way hearing and sight work together. Felix and Belle got chosen together by Nina due to the way touch and hearing work together.

Signs and symptoms There is a range of signs and symptoms including cleft lip or palate, mental retardation and various forms of ectodermal dysplasia. Additional symptoms may include fused eyelids, absent nails, delayed bone growth and dry skin.

Biography Born in Montreal, Quebec, Campbell graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1967. He worked at the Attorney General of Ontario's office as appeal counsel for the attorney general and as deputy attorney general. He later was senior policy advisor to the current Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Ontario Roy McMurtry. Outside of the AG office, Campbell worked briefly at the Parkdale Legal Clinic in 1977 and taught at Osgoode Hall. He was appointed to the bench in 1986. Campbell's notable contributions included a 1995 inquiry into the police investigation of Paul Bernardo's crimes and the 2003 SARS Commission inquiry. Campbell died of cancer and degenerative lung disease on 17 April 2007 in Toronto. SARS Commission In Canada, health-care workers made up 43 per cent of 2003 SARS epidemic cases. An inquiry was called by then-Premier Ernie Eves who selected Campbell to be the Chairman. The SARS Commission report can be found in the Archives of Ontario, and has five volumes. In total, more than 2000 pages were written by Campbell and his staff. Campbell was selected from amongst the supernumerary justices of Ontario on 10 June 2003 by the government of Ernie Eves, whose Conservative colleagues held the legislature at the time of the inquiry's formation and indeed the SARS epidemic itself, which had hit the shores of Toronto on 23 February 2003. In his final report, Campbell fixed a list of Thirteen Essential Questions, which are enumerated below: #Why Does SARS Matter Today? #How Bad Was SARS? #What Went Right? #What Went Wrong? #Were Precautions Relaxed Too Soon? #Who Is There to Blame? #Was Information Withheld? #Did Politics Intrude? #Was SARS I Preventable? #Was SARS II Preventable? #Were Health Workers Adequately Protected? #Are We Safer Now? #What Must Be Done?

The Auckland waterfront in 1912, with steam ferries at the ferry quay. Plan of the Auckland waterfront ca. 1930, with the older coastline of 1841 also shown as a darker line. Shipbuilding and other marine companies abound on the Western Reclamation, next to industrial uses. The Auckland waterfront (rarely the Auckland harbourfront) is a city-side stretch of the southern WaitematƒÅ Harbour coastline in Auckland, New Zealand. Previously mostly dominated by Ports of Auckland uses, from the 2000s on it is becoming increasingly open to recreational public use, with a number of former wharves being converted to office, entertainment, and later also some residential uses. Extents The waterfront stretches roughly from the suburb of Saint Marys Bay / the Auckland Harbour Bridge in the west to the Ports of Auckland areas in the east. However, in most usage, 'Auckland waterfront' only refers to those parts freely accessible to the public (such as around the Viaduct Basin and the Auckland CBD), and thus at the moment excludes much of the Western Reclamation and almost the whole of the Ports of Auckland area to the east. While Auckland City technically has a second waterfront on the Manukau Harbour, this is never called 'Auckland waterfront'. Future During 2006, a prolonged public discussion about the future of the waterfront was begun, first by the start of public consultation on the future of the Western Reclamation, then by the plans for Stadium New Zealand on the land of Ports of Auckland. While the plans for Stadium New Zealand were eventually scrapped (partly because of complaints of some citizens that it would block harbour views, but mostly due to its effect on port operations),Quandary for Mallard after ARC votes No ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Friday 24 November 2006It's Eden Park, Government says ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Monday 27 November 2006 the discussion had shown that Aucklanders would prefer greater access to the waterfront, which is at the moment is still industrial land / port land in large areas. However, Ports of Auckland (the company still owning most of the Auckland wharves) noted that while it will explore plans for greater public access, it needed most of the space for the foreseeable future.Opening our waterfront: ARC looks into public access ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Thursday 30 November 2006 As most of the Western Reclamation will not see any immediate transformation (due to ongoing commercial leases and required decontamination before future use), the sights are currently set on extending the public areas of the Viaduct Basin with a new entertainment strip along Jellicoe St to the west of it. This is to be linked by a bridge to the Viaduct and the Auckland CBD, with the bridge design possibly being internationally tendered, and for all works to be completed in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011.Waterfront to be opened for visitors ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Monday 5 March 2007 =Queens Wharf= In early 2008, ARC plans were unveiled that may see Queens Wharf, the wharf closest to the Auckland Ferry Terminal, converted into public space. Currently the wharf is used to store ripening bananas and hold import cars before fumigation treatment by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry staff. However, plans for the specific activities are still up in the air, though a new cruise ship terminal, to support the heavily booked Princes Wharf terminal, seems likely to be part of the mix.Waterfront plan to transform Auckland ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Monday 11 February 2008Queens Wharf a golden opportunity for Auckland ‚Äì Region Wide, newsletter of the Auckland Regional Council, March 2008, Page 4 Commentators have remarked that the wharf has been open to the public before during its early working life, when loading took place next to strolling members of the public, recreational fishing and other uses, a kind of life as on a \\"European square\\", and that the authorities should try to recreate such a feeling by providing for compatible mixed uses. The Yokohama Passenger Terminal was held up as an example, with port, ferry and customs/immigration facilities contained within a wharf, and with a sweeping public park on the roof of the structure.Let's have our park and cruise ships too ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Friday 16 February 2008 = Economic future = A 2010 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers projected that up to 2040, the waterfront would generate $4.29 billion for the economy of the region, and about 13,600 people could be employed in waterfront businesses by that time.

Its main goals are in improving the efficiency, transparencyBackground Document on Public Consultation (from the OECD Code, 10-Mar-2006) and public involvement in large-scale projects or laws and policies. It usually involves notification (to publicise the matter to be consulted on), consultation (a two-way flow of information and opinion exchange) as well as participation (involving interest groups in the drafting of policy or legislation). A frequently used tool for understanding different levels of community participation in consultation is known as Arnstein's ladder, although some academics contest that Arnstein's ladder is contextually specific and was not intended to be a universal tool. Ineffective consultations are considered to be cosmetic consultations that were done due to obligation or show and not true participatory decision making. Public comment (or \\"vox populi\\") is a public meeting of government bodies which set aside time for public comments, usually upon documents. Such documents may either be reports such as Draft Environmental Impact Reports (DEIR's) or new regulations. There is typically a notice which is posted on the web and mailed to lists of interested parties known to the government agencies. If there is to be a change of regulations, there will be a formal notice of proposed rulemaking. The basis for public comment is found in general political theory of constitutional democracy as originated during and after the French Enlightenment, particularly by Rousseau.Jean-Jaques Rousseau, The Social Contract, late 1700s, Public Domain This basis was elaborated in the American Revolution, and various thinkers such as Franklin, Jefferson Declaration of Independence, Jefferson et al, 1776 and Thomas Paine Common Sense, Thomas Paine, late 1700s, public domain. are associated with the rejection of tyrannical, closed government decision making in favor of open government. The tradition of the New England Town Hall is believed to be rooted in this early American movement, and the distillation of formal public comment in official proceedings is a direct application of this format in the workings of public administration itself.  Consultations around the world  Public consultations are typically held in Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand or Australia, though most democratic countries have similar systems. In the United States, for example, this process is called \\"public notice and comment\\" (see Rulemaking). Some organisations such as the OECD also use such processes. In Canada, the word \\"consultation\\" has a special meaning among some First Nations Groups: \\"it is the duty of the Crown and third parties to consult with First Nations who have asserted, but not proved, aboriginal rights or title.\\"Billy Garton and Sandra Carter, \\"First Nations Consultation: Higher, Wider, Deeper and Sooner\\", Bull, Housser & Tupper, 2002. There is great variation of public consultations. In some countries there is a list of all consultations, or consultations are mentioned in normal news feed. Depending on the country there can be national or regional public consultations. The two types of public comment Public comment embedded in actual meetings is typical of meetings convened by legislative or executive bodies; judicial units do not have public comment, but rather testimony from witnesses and procedural statements from attorneys. Public units such as city councils or county legislative bodies are typical examples of legislative public comment hearing bodies. Note that comments may be written, oral, or electronic. There are two types of comment periods. One is when comment goes to a specific agenda item. Secondly there is a class of public comment which pertains to items which are not on the agenda for that day. However, it is necessary that comments be restricted to matters within the jurisdiction of the government body. This latter requirement is seldom enforced except in those unusual cases in which commentators have set themselves at odds with policy makers and have been designated as a nuisance. In such cases, there are usually more explicit reasons given for restricting the rights of such speakers, however most undesirable comments tend to be outside the scope of legislative jurisdiction. The above distinction between agenda-item public comment and what is called \\"general public comment\\" pertains both to legislative type bodies as well as executive agencies. These are typically commissions, committees or boards. There are typically public comment periods during meetings of agencies such as city councils, county boards, and agencies which are concerned with matters such as water quality, fish and game, sewer runoff management and transportation. Time limits frequently range from one to five minutes for unscheduled presentations. It is not typical to require that the person commenting be a resident, a registered voter, a qualified elector, or even a citizen, simply that they be present and able to speak. A whole different class of public comment is requested by agencies which are seeking input on draft policy documents such as environmental impact reports which provide information which may be used in policy determinations by their own agency and other agencies at various levels of government. Typically there is a notice of completion of the draft which is posted in the newspaper, on the web, and is mailed to known interested parties who may be designated as \\"stakeholders\\" or simply \\"interested parties\\". A public comment period is established and comments which are received by the cutoff date become part of the official public record. In some cases, there is a statutory mandate that those comments be replied to or incorporated in some fashion into the Final document. Oral public comment at public meetings Comments provided at public meetings may be oral or written and not infrequently utilize audio visual aids such as thumbdrives, CD's or overhead projectors (transparencies or opaque material). They may include video clips. A laser pointer, such as used by professional presenters, is useful but seldom utilized except by scheduled presenters on preset agendas, who are often credentialed professionals hired by the government agency to produce reports or provide consultation. Public comment in some cases includes remarks from experts or public officials with some role in the issue at stake, but at a different time or level of process. Typically these kinds of comments may be ad hoc, not solicited by the governing agency which is conducting the hearing. There may be informal expectation that such a party may comment, but if it is an interested agency then there will be prior notification and a larger chunk of time may be allowed to such presenters. Surprisingly, however, these knowledgeable high level speakers, including office holders, often are limited to the same time constriction and queing requirements as all other public commentors. They simply wait in line, their name is called when their speaker slip happens to come to the top of the pile, and they are subject to being cut off after their two minutes or three minutes are up. This equalization between expert and lay commentator is an example of social leveling which occurs in democratic process and which is often harshly criticized by elitist theorists such as Machiavellians, fascists, communist technocrats and other conservative social thinkers. Persons preparing public comment often think about and express the value of the constitutional protection and a certain level of gratitude for the opportunity to speak. Such expressions are considered good etiquette the first few times a speaker presents to a board, and it is also common to state one's background, credentials, or interest. Persons who speak frequently to a particular agency become better known and typically refrain from repeating such formalities to excess, and may go directly into their substantive testimony. Variation of official attitude toward public meeting comment In constitutional democracies which permit public comment, meeting facilitators can be relaxed, friendly and informal, allowing for errors on the part of public speakers such as exceeding allowable time. In some cases they are strict in enforcement of rules and may make somewhat hostile remarks to speakers. This attitude may be a result of prior episodes in which public commenters may have expressed accusations or hostility to seated officials. Frequently, such remarks result in warnings and may escalate to the point that the meeting chair may not recognize the public speaker and refuse to allow access to the microphone. Less frequently, speakers who are out of order are ordered to leave, escorted out of the building, or, rarely, placed under arrest for trespass or other charges. However, most government agencies in the United States are reluctant to resort to such measures, which may be viewed as restricting free speech protection of the US and various state constitutions. They may also result in litigation and in some cases do. For instance, Robert Norse filed suit against the City of Santa Cruz when he made a Nazi style straight arm salute to the Santa Cruz City Council as a protest for council not permitting one additional public speaker who had not put in a speaker's slip and would have exceeded the amount of time allowed for public comment. The suit, typical of a possible consequence of not permitting public comment, is based upon Title 42 Section 1983 of the US Code, and alleges that city council violated his First Amendment right to free speech by having him arrested for refusing to leave as ordered in response to his gesture.Norse vs. City of Santa Cruz, US District Court, North Central District, Public Record Some states and regions may differ widely in their policies and procedures with regard to public comment, ranging from the extremes of anarchist collectives in twentieth century Spain, in which many routine decisions were made by workers councils, to dictatorships in which making a comment on the performance of government officials can be proscribed by law as tantamount to slander or provoking insurrection. In such systems, even the very idea of exposure to risk of prosecution deters the flow of information needed for the system's self rationalization process, resulting in stifled innovation, accumulated inefficiencies, decline of group morale and trust levels, with eventual system collapse. Liberalized systems also typically proscribe slander, fabrications and personal attacks, however defined, and public commenters are discouraged from engaging in back and forth discussion with board or committee members. Comments which are directed from the floor towards persons who have the floor are generally classified as heckling. Public comment in authoritarian systems Authoritarian systems generally tend to take a dim view of public comment. In the writings of Benito Mussolini, he expressed the view that fascism offers \\"free\\" speech, but only to persons who were \\"qualified\\" to have an opinion.Readings on Fascism and National Socialism Selected by members of the department of philosophy, University of Colorado Contents. The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini Similarly, in the historical development of Nazism, public commentators at official NSDAP rallies were not infrequently beaten by the mob, or, if there were large numbers supporting the adverse commentator, brawls broke out.\\"Goebbels\\" by Ralf Georg Reuth today's People's Republic of China, public comment on government policy is considered inappropriate, and may result in long prison terms for persons such as Wei Jingsheng. Public comment as an aid to editing of government publications As indicated above, there is a separate and distinct form of public comment, in the US, does not occur at meetings but is solicited in written or electronic form prior to a set deadline. This type of comment may pertain to an intended action, such as permit issuance, or the classification of a particular species of plant or animal as endangered. Other instances occur with regard to publication of draft environmental impact reports, which comments are then answered and may be reflected in subsequent revisions to the document. These public comments are often posted on the web in advance of the deadline, which provides commentators with an opportunity to view the remarks of others before committing themselves in writing. This type of comment process may be mandated in legislation or in regulations enforcing statutes such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or California's Cxxxx Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Triggering events may include development proposals, mandated master plan updates or discovery of an endangered species. The NIH requested and received massive public comment pertaining to its own openness to its generally sophisticated public, and they did a thorough job of analyzing the voluminous submissions which is posted on their website.http://publicaccess.nih.gov/analysis_of_comments_nih_public_access_policy.pdf A government portal which may be useful allows review of comments and opportunity for making comment and can be searched by keyword.http://www.regulations.gov/#!home The keyword search crosses different government agencies and has drop-downs permitting a boolean exclusion algorithm narrowing the focus between alternative choices such as documents, rules, notice of proposed rule changes, etcetera.

Old Turn Junction, or Deep Cutting Junction () is a canal junction in Birmingham, England, where the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal meets the Birmingham Canal Navigations Main Line Canal. The junction features a circular island. History When the first Birmingham Canal (now known as the BCN Main Line) was built in the late 1760s there was a dispute among the shareholders about where the canal should terminate. In the end two termini were created: one in 1772 at Newhall Hill, called the Newhall Branch, and the other in 1773 at the western end of Paradise Street, called the Paradise Street Branch. The junction of these two branches became known as Deep Cutting Junction, these days called Old Turn Junction. Deep Cutting was the name of the short stretch of canal between the junction and Broad Street Tunnel. The Birmingham Canal Company head office was built at the end of the Paradise Street Branch, where there were wharves along the side of a pair of tuning fork shaped basins. This was Old Wharf, later partly filled in and built upon, leaving the present day Gas Street Basin. Later, in 1798, the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was built and joined the Main Line at Farmer's Bridge, a few hundred yards (metres) along the Newhall Branch, creating Farmer's Bridge Junction. When the Newhall Branch was closed in the early 20th century the name of the junction at Farmer's Bridge top lock was transferred to the current Old Turn Junction, so Farmer's Bridge Junction was synonymous with Old Turn Junction and Deep Cutting Junction. In 1993, the name Farmer's Bridge Junction was dropped, leaving it again as Old Turn Junction. The Telford New Main Line modifications following his 1824 survey cut through many of the bends of the Old Main Line, including bypassing the Oozells Street loop, so that Old Turn Junction became the meeting of four branches. =Roundabout island= The island was installed during World War II, to allow the use of temporary dams to protect the railway tunnel beneath it, should the canal be breached by bombing. The north tunnel of the Stour Valley railway line (main western approach to New Street Station) runs a few yards north east of the junction, under the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. The fingerpost at the junction was added on 21 May 1983, the first of many canal junctions to be signposted under John Phillips' leadership of the BCN Society. Nearby Once at the heart of an industrial area, the junction is now overlooked wholly by recent developments, including the National Indoor Arena and the National Sea Life Centre, the latter being part of Brindleyplace. To the South-East is the International Convention Centre and Gas Street Basin, where the BCN ends and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal begins.

Overview JX is implemented as an extended Java virtual machine (the JX Core), adding support to the Java system for necessary features such as protection domains and hardware access, along with a number of components written in Java that provide kernel facilities to applications running on the computer. Because Java is a type-safe language, JX is able to provide isolation between running applications without needing to use hardware memory protection. This technique, known as language-based protection means that system calls and inter-process communication in JX does not cause an address space switch, an operation which is slow on most computers. JX runs on standard PCs, with support for a limited range of common hardware elements. It is Free software, developed by the University of Erlangen. The primary benefits of JX include: * a small trusted computing base (TCB) results in a high security system * lack of address space switching enables high performance compared to most microkernel systems See also *JavaOS References External links *Project home page *JX Poster *The JX Operating System *Execution Time Limitation of Interrupt Handlers in a Java Operating System *Ubiquitous Computing and the Need for a New Operating System Architecture *The Structure of a Type-Safe Operating System *A Java Operating System as the Foundation of a Secure Network Operating System Category:Operating system kernels Category:Microkernels Category:Free software operating systems Category:Microkernel-based operating systems Category:Discontinued Java virtual machines ","title":"JX (operating system)"},{"id":"10812215","text":"Windows File Protection (WFP), a sub-system included in Microsoft Windows operating systems of the Windows 2000 and Windows XP era, aims to prevent programs from replacing critical Windows system files. Protecting core system files mitigates problems such as DLL hell with programs and the operating system. Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 include WFP under the name of Windows File Protection; Windows Me includes it as System File Protection (SFP).  Operation  With Windows File Protection active, replacing or deleting a system file that has no file lock to prevent it getting overwritten causes Windows immediately and silently to restore the original copy of the file. The original version of the file is restored from a cached folder which contains backup copies of these files. The Windows NT family uses the cached folder . Windows Me caches its entire set of compressed cabinet setup files and stores them in the folder. WFP covers all files which the operating system installs (such as , , , etc.), protecting them from deletion or from replacement by older versions. The digital signatures of these files are checked using code signing and the signature catalog files stored in the } folder. Only certain operating system components such as the Package Installer (Update.exe) or Windows Installer (Msiexec.exe) can replace these files. Changes made using any other methods in order to replace these files are reverted and the files are silently restored from the cache. If Windows File Protection cannot automatically find the file in the cached folder, it searches the network path or prompts the user for the Windows installation disc to restore the appropriate version of the file. WFP integrates with the System File Checker () utility. Windows Vista and later Windows systems do not include Windows File Protection, but they include Windows Resource Protection which protects files using ACLs. Windows Resource Protection aims to protect core registry keys and values and prevent potentially damaging system configuration changes, besides operating system files. The non-use of ACLs in Windows File Protection was a design choice: Not only did it allow operation on non-NTFS systems, but it prevented those same \\"bad\\" installers from failing completely from a file access error.

As a child, he was captured as a slave by the Ottomans, and brought to the service of the then Kapudan Pasha Husrev Pasha. His intelligence and ability impressed his master and secured his rapid rise. He was stationed in Karaƒëorƒëe's Serbia for a short time. At only 29 years, he was appointed governor of K√ºtahya, from where he acquired his sobriquet. In 1820, he was sent by Sultan Mahmud II, along with many other pashas, to quell the rebellion of Ali Pasha of Yannina against the Porte. At the same time, the Greeks were preparing their own uprising, which broke out in March 1821. Thus, after the defeat and death of Ali Pasha in 1822, he was at hand to campaign against the Greek rebels.  Operations in Epirus ‚Äì First Siege of Missolonghi  Having been appointed commander-in-chief of the Ottoman forces in Epirus, he marched south, to meet the Greek forces under Alexandros Mavrokordatos, which were campaigning towards Arta. He inflicted a crushing defeat upon them in the Battle of Peta, on 4 July 1822, and proceeded southwards, to the strategically important town of Missolonghi. There he was met by Omer Vrioni, and their joint force of 8,000 besieged the city for two months, from 25 October to 31 December 1822. Omer Vrioni, contrary to Re≈üid Mehmed's view, initially tried to take the town by negotiations, which the besieged Greeks took advantage of, dragging them out until November 8, when they were reinforced by sea, at which point they refused to negotiate further. The siege began in earnest, and the two pashas scheduled their main assault for Christmas night, December 24, calculating that the Greeks would be caught by surprise. The plan was leaked to the defenders, and the attack failed. Six days later, the siege was lifted.  Campaign in Thessaly  After the failure at Missolonghi, Re≈üid Mehmed moved against the mountainous region of Pelion, which he managed to subdue. For his success, he was appointed governor of the sanjak of Trikala, and was finally appointed commander-in-chief of all Ottoman forces in Rumelia.  Third Siege of Missolonghi  From this position he was tasked by the Porte with taking Missolonghi and thus securing western Greece. Re≈üid Mehmed assembled an army of more than 35,000 and in February 1825 he set out for Missolonghi. On arriving there on April 20, he immediately invested the town with earthworks and subjected it to heavy bombardment. However, despite his efforts, the Greek garrison, aided by raids from the Greek bands behind his lines and resupplied by the Greek fleet despite the Ottoman naval blockade, resisted effectively. In the end, he was forced to call upon the assistance of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, whose army had been victorious against Greek forces in the Morea. The Egyptian forces arrived in early November, but a split occurred between the presumptuous Ibrahim and Re≈üid Mehmed, who withdrew his forces. After the Egyptians failed too in their assaults, Ibrahim acknowledged his error. The two pashas now cooperated, and the siege was intensified. The seaward supply route was cut, forcing threatening the defenders with starvation. Finally, they attempted a desperate escape, breaking out through the besieging forces, on the night of 10 April 1826. The sortie resulted in a massacre of the defenders, and Missolonghi fell to the Ottoman forces.  Campaign in Attica  After this success, Re≈üid Mehmed turned towards Attica and Athens, where he arrived in July. He besieged the Greek garrison on the Acropolis of Athens unsuccessfully for ten months, until his unexpected victory over a Greek relief force at the Battle of Phaleron on 24 April 1827 forced the Greeks to surrender the fort.  Campaign against Bosnia Eyalet  The Ottoman Bosnian leadership led by Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá were outraged when Sultan Mahmud II granted Serbia autonomy and subsequently six districts from the Bosnia Eyalet with the Treaty of Adrianople. Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá had already begun to support the cause of the fallen Janissary after the Auspicious Incident and would not allow Mahmud II to further disintegrate Bosnian society. Instead of negotiating with Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá, the Grand Vizier Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha (already engaged in an aggressive campaign against Albanian pashas and beys) mobilized his Ottoman army towards Travnik. Disappointed by Re≈üid Pasha's move, Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá marched forward with an army of 52,000 into Pri≈°tina, and later fought and defeated Re≈üid Pasha at ≈†timlje. A Bosnian delegation reached the Grand Vizier's camp in Skopje in November of that year. The Grand Vizier promised this delegation that he would insist to the Sultan that he accept the Bosniak demands. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when his cannons attacked Bosnian units stationed on the outskirts of Novi Pazar. Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha later began an aggressive campaign into Bosnia with the assistance of the renegade kapetan Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá and defeated the entire army of Bosnia Eyalet led by Husein Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá outside the town of Stup.  After the Greek Revolution  A very distinguished general, Re≈üid Mehmed fought in the Russo-Turkish War, where he was defeated by General Diebitsch at the Battle of Kulevicha. Subsequently, he was appointed Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, a post he held from January 1829 to 17 February 1833. From that position, he orchestrated the Monastir massacre of 1830 of the Albanian beys killing hundreds. He led the Ottoman armies in Anatolia in the Egyptian-Ottoman War. He was captured by the forces of his old antagonist, Ibrahim Pasha, at the war's decisive Battle of Konya in 1832.  Campaign in the Diyarbakir Eyalet  He was appointed the WƒÅli of Diyarbakir Eyalet and Raqqa Eyalet in 1834 and onwards led military campaigns against the local Kurdish tribes Garzan, Bedir Khan and Milli and the Yazidi in Sincar. In 1835 he subdued the Milli tribe in Mardin. In 1836, he defeated the ruler from the Emirate of Soran. He died in 1836.

He made a considerable fuss while incarcerated including going on hunger strike three or four times and eventually when a letter he had smuggled out of the prison was published in a Fife newspaper questions were asked in the Commons. Hearing of Cunningham's plight and impressed by his determination the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) campaigned for his release. His release was something of legend as it is noted in The Spanish Civil War by Hugh Thomas that Cunningham has the reputation of being: \\"the only soldier in a military jail in England who made such a fuss that the authorities freed him to rid themselves of the trouble of looking after him\\". He was released after serving two years and four months of his sentence. While with the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders he was company champion in many events including: 1 mile, 2 mile track events and also welterweight boxing champion. Edinburgh City Councillor, Donald Renton's older brother served with him in Jamaica and described him as \\"the gamest man in the British Army\\". Prior to 1936 he was active as an organiser in the London area for the National Unemployed Workers' Movement during which time he led an unemployed march to Brighton in 1933. He worked as a miner and labourer.  Spanish Civil War Years  At the time of Franco's attack on the democratically elected government of Spain Cunningham was one of many Scots who volunteered to fight alongside the people of Spain to defend their freedom and democracy. As Britain and many other democratic nations of Europe refused military aid to the Spanish Government and maintained a policy of \\"non- intervention\\" such an act of volunteering was illegal. Nonetheless volunteers recognised the threat Fascism would post to all democratic nations and as the war went on volunteers from many countries were organised into the International Brigades. He arrived in Spain 19 October 1936 and was involved in the early defence of Madrid after joining the Machine-Gun Company of the Commune de Paris Battalion, part of the XI International Brigade. He rapidly rose to Captain. In December 1936 he fought at Lopera as a section commander with the British and Irish Company of the XIV International Brigade. He was made a Major and Commander of the British No. 1 Company and as a Lieutenant Colonel he was in charge of the entire English-speaking brigade. The small 34-year-old played a key role in the February 1937 Battle of Jarama. He was wounded after leading the January 1937 battle at Los Rozas and in order to fight at Jarama it is reported that he \\"left hospital with a fever to go and fight\\". The battle at Jarama was one of the principal actions of the Spanish Civil War. If the Jarama valley were surrendered, the road from Madrid to Valencia would be cut off allowing Madrid to be taken by the Fascists which for all intents and purposes would cost the Spanish government the war. Along with Frank Ryan he rallied the remnants of the British Battalion in a defensive action which held the line outside Madrid. Cunningham led a bombing raid down a trench held at one end by the Fascists and at the other end by the Spanish government troops. They took this trench and with six men and a Lewis gun, cut off a group of some 80 Fascists from their own lines. This almost impossible defence blocked Franco's attempt to seize the capital. The Jarama action had left him with three rifle wounds through his left upper arm and another rifle bullet under his shoulder blade that had entered his left chest, passed through, and lodged there. Cunningham was hospitalised from 15 March 1937. He later served as Chief of Brigade Staff of the XV Battalion, but after the battle of Brunete the Communist Party of Great Britain recalled all the leaders of the British volunteers back to London. Spanish Government supporters praised Cunningham's military skillMcGovern, John, Daily Worker, 31 December 1937 and en route to London he was welcomed back to Glasgow on 31 August 1937 by 2,500 Communist Party members. = Controversy and Resignation from the Communist Party = Jock Cunningham was a popular and courageous commander. His military influence was praised by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) during his speech at a Unity Campaign meeting 15 March 1937 in Liverpool: \\"One day we shall tell our children about the defense of Madrid, this epic story that can never die in the pages of World History. I think of Jock Cunningham leading his men fearlessly and unafraid‚Ä¶dancing with death. A word of encouragement here...ceaselessly moving among his men until everyone has become influenced with the mighty unconquerable spirit of a worker blessed with a fiery hatred of Fascism‚Ä¶this is Jock Cunningham. Our Chapaev\\".Daily Worker, 15 March 1937 In The Spanish Civil War, Hugh Thomas, explains the reference to Chapaev. Speaking of Cunningham he said: \\"He was a man of great physical strength and possessed marked qualities of leadership. He was nicknamed the \\"Chapaev\\" after the guerrilla leader of the Russian Civil War ‚Äì and there could not at that time have been a greater compliment.\\" After differences arose in the CPGB, Pollitt decided Cunningham and fellow Scot Commissar George Aitken were not to return to Spain. It was a controversial decision because it was the two most capable and respected men who were not allowed to return to Spain. The official explanation was that, due to the obvious difficulties of the war, differences had arisen between the group of leaders and it was decided they could not all work together again. Aitken was appalled by the decision. Nonetheless, Pollitt stuck by it. Cunningham was placed on extended recuperation and was given a place on the Party executive. Fred Copeman revealed many years later that there was a political motive for Cunningham's removal from the front line. Pollitt feared that he was too independent and single minded to be easily controlled. In response to the cynical disregard for all he had done, he chose to resign from the CPGB drift away and lead his life in anonymity. He was last seen in the 1950s on the fringes of a political meeting in Aberdeen. Jock spent the rest of his days working as a casual labourer travelling across Britain. He was very close with his siblings, particularly his sister Annie and older brother John. He had residence in the family home on Old Post Office Lane in North Queensferry, although he rarely stayed longer than four weeks at a time. Death and legacy He had long suffered pain in his chest which he believed to be due to the bullet lodged there. On invitation of his older brother John to come to Canada, he decided to enter hospital to deal with the war injury which troubled him. It was discovered he had carcinoma, most likely the source of his pain. He died of bronchial carcinoma at Pavilion 11, Mearnskirk General Hospital, Renfrewshire, Glasgow on 22 February 1969.Death certificate. Writing of Jock Cunningham to The New York Times in April 1937 Ernest Hemingway said \\"For what he had done he would have had a V.C (Victoria Cross) in the last war. In this war there are no decorations. Wounds are the only decorations‚Ä¶\\" In the 1990s the Scottish playwright, Hector MacMillan, wrote a play about Jock Cunningham entitled \\"A Greater Tomorrow\\", focusing on his service in the Spanish Civil War and speculating about his later years. Cunningham was portrayed by Derek Anders. In 2010 he was subject of a BBC Radio Scotland documentary.

He is remembered for being co- founder of the Brisbane Broncos club. The Paul Morgan Medal for the Brisbane Broncos' best and fairest player of the season is named after him. Footballer Morgan attended Brisbane State High School where he was a pupil of former Queensland Maroons captain, Cyril Connell, Jr.. Morgan represented Queensland in rugby league in his first year out of school and went on to play for the Bulimba Cup-winning Toowoomba team of 1970 alongside Wayne Bennett. He later played in Brisbane for Redcliffe and was their goal kicker. Administrator In 1986 Paul Morgan joined Barry Maranta, Gary Balkin and Steve Williams to form a Brisbane-based club for the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, Australia's top rugby league club competition at the time. All men had played for Brisbane domestic teams. Four organisations made bids for the team which would be established in 1987. Ron McAuliffe, had the support of the NSWRL over the Maranta-Morgan group, other groups included 'International Syndicate' led by John Sattler and Bob Hagan, and one by Darryl van der Velde (who would later be CEO of the South Queensland Crushers). The NSWRL decided not to have a Brisbane club in 1987 but in a final bid for the 1988 season, both McAuliffe and Maranta-Morgan bid for the club. The NSWRL finally decided to have a Brisbane-based team and thus the Brisbane Broncos were born. The rights originally were going to go to the McAuliffe based group, but when it was realised they didn't have the funds to support the club, it was given to Maranta-Morgan. However the Maranta-Morgan group did not please everybody, especially Australian Rugby League chairman Ken Arthurson, who decided to add other (now defunct) Queensland-based teams, Gold Coast in 1988 and South Queensland in 1995. Morgan was a stockbroker by trade; he was in charge of Pacific Sports Entertainment, the company that owns the Brisbane Broncos. Paul Morgan died of a heart attack while playing golf in Brisbane. He was 54. He left a widow, Suellen Morgan. The day after his death the Brisbane Broncos played against St Helens R.F.C. in England for the 2001 World Club Challenge wearing black arm-bands in honour of Morgan, and the Broncos' player of the year award was named after him. Paul Morgan's son, Lachlan Morgan played for the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the 2006 Queensland Cup grand final.

It is long and has a vertical range of . The entrance is normally dry, but in flood it becomes an impressive resurgence. Its name derives from the north country word for badger. It consists of three main passages. From the entrance a stooping height passage heading south-east reaches a large deep pool after from which a stream emerges. This flows down a low passage to the north for some where a sump is reached. The third main passage continues south underwater from the pool for at a depth of where it reaches a junction and becomes too restricted. The cave is formed in Carboniferous limestone, and is thought to drain the Great Asby Scar area to the south-west. The resurgence is presumed to be St. Thomas's Well in Great Asby. The main part of the cave has been known for a long time, and it was an object of curiosity in the nineteenth century. A brief foray into it was described in The Gentleman's Magazine in 1791, and a description appeared in The Monthly Magazine in 1802. The first full description complete with passage lengths appeared in 1813. The first account of an exploration by cavers was in 1941 by members of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club, and in November 1946 it was surveyed by a group from Appleby Grammar School led by Brian Price. The upstream sump was first dived for about to a descending rift in 1960 by members of the Cave Diving Group, at which time the main part of the cave was re-surveyed by Warburton et alia. Further exploration took place in 1975-1976 by members of the same group to reach the current limit.

It is an opportunistic pathogen on numerous hosts causing leaf spots, rots and blights on many plant parts. It can also cause upper respiratory tract infections and asthma in humans with compromised immunity.  Hosts and symptoms  Alternaria alternata has many different hosts depending on its forma specialis. In this review, only Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici (AAL) is going to be assessed. This pathogen infects only certain cultivars of tomato plants and is often referred to as Alternaria stem canker of tomato. AAL's main symptom is cankers in the stem. It resides in seeds and seedlings, and is often spread by spores as they become airborne and land on plants. It can also spread throughout other plants. Under severe infection, lesions enlarge and become coalesced causing blighting of the leaves. This symptom progression occurred in research done in Pakistan: the symptoms on affected tomatoes started with yellowing and browning of the lower leaves, then began developing on the leaf tips and along the margins of the leaf petiole. This progression continued until the entire leaves were covered in diseased tissue and then fell off. In addition under to necrotic leaves and petioles, plants are found to have severe defoliation, with considerable yield losses when it occurs before flowering. The tomato fruit can also be infected as well, with brown cankers dotting them and making them inedible. Once the disease has spread to a certain point, little can be done to save the tomato plant. There are several host factors that affect disease development. For example, various signaling pathways in tomato plants affect their susceptibility to AAL. Salicylic acid promotes resistance to AAL and antagonizes the ethylene response. Ethylene controls the synthesis of jasmonic acid, which is a necessary pathway for susceptibility. Independently of each other, salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid can influence the susceptibility of tomato to AAL. Diagnosis of AAL is often from observing signs and symptoms from this fungal pathogen. In addition, a tomato cultivar's resistance to a toxin produced by AAL also affect disease development. Please see the Pathogenesis section for more details on this process.  Environment  In order to survive, Alternaria alternata needs a moist warm environment. It is often found in areas with humid climates, or where there has been significant rainfall. The fungus lives in seeds and seedlings, and is also spread by spores. This disease flourishes in dead plants that have been left in gardens over winter. Additionally, when dead infected debris is added to compost pile it can spread to other vegetables throughout the garden. There are no insect vectors for this disease. This means that using insecticides has no effect on the susceptibility of a tomato plants susceptibility to this pathogen. However, there are several cultural practices that can be done to suppress this fungal pathogen's impact. The disease first occurs in the host's exposed leaves. Plants planted with rows in an east-west direction have more severe disease than do plants planted north-south. This implies that if one plants tomato plants in a north-south manner they will be less susceptible. It is also suggested to highly monitor plants in April through June. This is when the pathogen is most prevalent. If monitoring indicates the presence of AAL, it is suggested to begin late-spring treatments of fungicide about mid-April. However, if a garden has a history of disease, it is advised to take extra measures. This can be done by treating tomatoes in mid to late April and 2 to 3 weeks later by applying a fungicide. Because this is a fungal pathogen that thrives off of wet environments, overhead irrigation is never advised when irrigating. This causes the moisture to remain on the leaf tissue and increase susceptibility to the disease and an optimal environment for the fungus to survive and grow. A better solution to this problem is using a drip irrigation system; this allows the majority of the plant to stay dry. Overall, AAL thrives in moist warm environments. There are no insect vectors, so applying insecticides have no effect on a plant's resistance to this disease. Cultural practices for preventing this disease include planting tomatoes in a row north to south, monitoring plants heavily April through June, and using a drip irrigation system to keep as much plant tissue dry and free of favorable environments for this pathogen.  Disease cycle  Teleomorph of Alternaria alternata is thought to be Clathrospora diplospora: this has yet to be confirmed. As a result, this pathogen propagates itself via asexual spores called conidia.Timmer, Lavern. M., Tobin L. Peever, Zvi Solel, and Kazuya Akimitsu. \\"Alternaria Diseases of Citrus - Novel Pathosystems.\\" Phytopathology Mediterranea 42 (2003): 99-112. Citrus Research and Education Center. Web. 21 October 2015. These conidia are produced in lesions on mature or dying leaves. Their production can begin in as few as ten days after the first symptoms appear, and can continue for to up to fifty days.Dewdney, M. M. \\"Alternaria Brown Spot1.\\" EDIS New Publications RSS. Web. 22 October 2015. A. alternata's conidia disperse via air currents, and their release from the lesions can be triggered by rainfall, or even just a sudden drop in humidity. When the conidium lands on a leaf, it will wait until the nighttime dew, and then germinate. It can either enter through the stomata, or penetrate directly through the top of the leaf, using its appressorium, infecting the leaf within 12 hours.  Pathogenesis  At the cellular level, toxins are produced by AAL that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato. This host specific mycotoxin is called fumonisin B1. It was identified and confirmed by research conducted on fast atom bombardment and ion spray mass spectrometry. As follows, tomatoes that are resistant to this pathogen are partly due to resistance from this specific toxin. Resistance to the pathogen in tomato is inherited as a single gene expressing complete dominance. However, sensitivity to the fumonisin B1 gene is controlled by a single locus with two alleles expressing incomplete dominance when heterozygous. In addition to resistance to the specific gene, resistance can be found from signaling pathways. At the organismal level, AAL grows very slowly. This makes it so its presence is often not known until seedlings become larger and are transplanted into the garden. A fungicide may be used to save the plants once they are infected; however, the disease cannot be completely eradicated.

Biography  From the beginning of the 17th century, the Ming dynasty - China was decaying during a large number of rebellions, the greatest one being the rebellion of Li Zicheng, who gathered a very large army of followers around him and became more successful every year. It is said that Li met Gao while hiding in the house of her father, and when he left, she went with him and took and active part in the rebellion, following him side by side at the head of his army, sharing his command; while Li was the commander of the male troops, Gao educated, trained and lead the female troops of rebels. The rebellion was so successful that the armies of Li and Gao effectively controlled large parts of China and ruled them as independent entities. This caused Ming-China to fall to pieces, as it was at the same time attacked by the Manchu people. In 1644, Li Zicheng captured Beijing, deposed the Ming dynasty and declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, Shun Â§ßÈ†Ü. Accordingly, Guiying became the empress and took control over the city as his regent, but soon after, the Manchu took Beijing and established the new Qing dynasty. Li was killed in 1645. Gao now saw the Manchu as her new enemies, and switched her allegiance to her former enemies: the remnants of the Ming ruling family had formed a new court in the south of China and ruled as the Southern Ming dynasty, and Gao, making herself known as the greatest enemy of the Qing dynasty, was called there to serve and continue the fight against the foreign intruders. She was styled \\"Lady of the first degree\\" in her own right, her position as military commander was secured and she was declared protector of the new Ming dynasty. Gao led the fight against the Qing dynasty until her death in 1647. Gao Guiying is undoubtedly one of the most unusual and interesting characters in Chinese history, especially considering the time she lived; there have been a large number of women in her position earlier on in Chinese history, but in the 12th century, women's position in China diminished severely, and the only other women of her time to have a similar position were Shen Yunying and Qin Liangyu.

Born in Port Colborne, Ontario, he played for the Boston Bruins. Gallinger was one of the league's youngest players when he broke into the NHL, playing on the \\"Sprout Line\\" of Boston with Bill Shill and Bep Guidolin. Gallinger's career was cut short, when in 1948 Gallinger and former team-mate Billy Taylor were discovered gambling on their own teams and banned for life by the NHL. They were reinstated in 1970 and these are the longest suspensions in NHL history. Prior to the suspension, Gallinger had established himself an effective offensive NHL player and, as an excellent multi-sport athlete, had even been sought after to play professional baseball. Career Don Gallinger came from a hockey family. Gallinger's father, Frank, was a lacrosse player, but also played hockey in the Northern Hockey League. Don Gallinger had two uncles, \\"Red\\" and \\"Shorty\\" Green, who were considered talented players during the era when players played the full 60 minutes. Don's eldest brother, Frank, played senior hockey in Port Colborne. Brother Keith played intermediate hockey. In junior hockey, Gallinger was team-mates and friends with future Hockey Hall of Fame member Teeder Kennedy. The two were successful in both hockey and football. Gallinger was the second-youngest player in NHL history when he broke into the NHL with Boston at age 17, playing on the \\"Sprout Line\\" with Bill Shill and Bep Guidolin. The Bruins had lost their high-scoring line of Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart to the Royal Canadian Air Force and NHL teams were willing to accept younger players. Gallinger showed natural ability as a goal-scorer and was third in voting for the Calder rookie of the year award. The Bruins finished in second place in the regular season and went to the Stanley Cup finals losing to the Detroit Red Wings in four straight games. Gallinger missed a large part of the 1943‚Äì44 and all of the 1944‚Äì45 season serving with the Canadian military. Before leaving for the military, on January 8, 1944, in a game at Maple Leaf Gardens against the Boston Bruins, the mayor of Port Colborne honoured Kennedy and Gallinger, both hometown heroes, with gold watches on behalf of his town's citizens. Beginning in February 1944, Gallinger played hockey for the R.C.A.F. Bombers. At the time of his entering the military, Gallinger had scored 13 goals in 23 games with Boston. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, graduating at the top of his air gunners' class. He was discharged in September 1945 as a flying officer. Gallinger finished the 1945‚Äì46 season leading the Bruins in points. The Bruins finished in second place in the NHL and went to the Stanley Cup finals before losing to the Montreal Canadiens. Star shortstop of the Boston Red Sox, Johnny Pesky. Offered a contract by the Sox, Gallinger boasted he was capable of taking Pesky's job. Gallinger had been offered contracts to play baseball by both the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies while he was with the Bruins. In April 1946, Gallinger had a tryout with the Red Sox. Boston sportswriter Bill Grimes said Gallinger \\"may turn out to be a great shortstop. He can run, he can throw, and he's got good power at the plate. he takes a level cut and hits the ball very sharply.\\" A sportswriter suggested to Gallinger it might be better for him to try for an outfield position since the Red Sox's current shortstop Johnny Pesky was considered the league's best. Gallinger confidently replied that Pesky \\"beat out somebody else for the job, didn't he?\\" However, Gallinger turned down the baseball opportunities, because the money offered was not enough. Gallinger finished the 1946‚Äì47 season with 10 points less than his previous year as the NHL strengthened with the return of players who had been serving in the war. The Bruins finished in third place and lost in the opening round of the playoffs to the Montreal Canadiens. =NHL betting scandal= Background In the 1940s, the most famous betting scandal in North American organised sport was baseball's 1919 World Series. However, gambling was also a problem in professional hockey. In 1946, the NHL had discovered a betting ring operating in Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. Babe Pratt, a star player with Toronto, was suspended for nine games for betting on his own team. When the betting problem still continued into the next season, the NHL made it clear that any more infractions would receive more severe punishment. Gallinger had gambled on the Bruins from the time of his rookie year, although he later insisted he never bet on Boston to lose until he met Billy Taylor.Keene p. 62 Taylor, a 28-year-old center, had arrived to the Bruins in a trade to start the 1947‚Äì48 season and was living in the same boarding house as Gallinger. Taylor, who had a reputation for gambling, had heard Gallinger also gambled, and explained to Gallinger how he could double his yearly $7,500 salary by betting on his team to lose. Taylor and Gallinger rationalized that they were not deliberately trying to lose games, since they were only betting on games their team would probably lose anyway. The two became involved with James Tamer, a Detroit gambler and career criminal and began receiving instructions to bet on games based upon their inside knowledge of the team's attitude and injuries. For three months, until the scheme was uncovered, Gallinger bet on eight games, between $250 and $1,000 a game. Betting exposed By early in 1948, Bruins management became suspicious of Taylor's poor play and he was traded to the New York Rangers. In February 1948, Gallinger phoned Tamer before a game in Chicago. The conversation was recorded by a wiretap on Tamer's phone. The conversation as reported in a Detroit newspaper: Tamer: How are things going tonight? Voice: Don't worry about the game tonight... I don't intend to do so good. Bet $500 for me.Wright p.248 Gallinger also told Tamer that the Bruins would be without Milt Schmidt in the game. Tamer in turn phoned Taylor in New York to bet $500 on Boston to lose. Although the Bruins won the game against Chicago, Detroit police informed NHL President Clarence Campbell of the wire taps. In late February, Gallinger was visiting his family in Port Colborne when he received a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, the general manager of the Bruins, Art Ross, was questioning all the Boston players one- by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger he knew he was involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a psychiatrist in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was looking for a way to defend him. Early in March 1948, word of a gambling scandal involving some Boston Bruin players made its way into the press. The players involved had not yet been named. On March 3, The Bruins were playing the Chicago Blackhawks at the Boston Garden in their first game since news of the scandal became public. The Boston fans cheered loudly as the Bruin players skated onto the ice. Old-time followers of the Bruins compared the reception to the last time Boston had won the Stanley Cup in 1939. Boston was down 4‚Äì1 going into the third period, but rallied to tie the game. With the game at 4‚Äì3, Don Gallinger brought the puck down the ice, skillfully getting past at least three Blackhawks players in the process, and passed the puck to Johnny Peirson, who scored his first NHL goal to tie the game. On March 4, 1948, Walter Winchell named Gallinger as one of the players involved in the gambling scandal. The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. \\"You probably know what this is about, don't you?\\" Carroll asks. \\"Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball,\\" Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. \\"Winchell\\", said Gallinger. \\"Do you mean the fellow in New York?\\" Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations. On Sunday, March 7, the Bruins were playing the Toronto Maple Leafs in Boston. In the second period, Gallinger intercepted a Gus Mortson clearing pass and let go with a low 30-foot shot past goaltender Turk Broda. It would be Gallinger's last goal in the NHL. Expulsion for life The president of the NHL, Clarence Campbell, banned Gallinger from the NHL for life and refused to lift the ban 15 years later. On March 9, 1948, Gallinger was suspended indefinitely, pending an investigation, by the NHL for gambling on hockey including games involving the Bruins. NHL President Clarence Campbell said Gallinger and teammate Billy Taylor, who had already been expelled for life, were guilty of \\"conduct detrimental to hockey and for associating with a known gambler.\\"Fischler p.132 On September 28, 1948, Don Gallinger met the same fate as Taylor, receiving a lifetime expulsion from the NHL. While Gallinger continued to deny his involvement publicly, on October 9, 1949, Gallinger confessed his guilt privately to Campbell. In another player gambling incident in 1946, Babe Pratt had his life-time suspension, also for gambling, reversed after nine games when he freely admitted his guilt to then- NHL president Red Dutton. However, Campbell did not grant Gallinger similar leniency. Years later, Gallinger stated that Campbell had advised him not to reveal to anyone that he had confessed. Campbell, when asked, denied that he had ever advised this to Gallinger. After the Babe Pratt gambling incident, the NHL board changed their constitution to eliminate a player's right to appeal if found guilty of gambling on a game's outcome. Attempts to have the ban lifted In January 1963, the Toronto newspaper The Globe and Mail ran a series on Gallinger and the betting scandal. The series included an in- depth interview by journalist Scott Young with Gallinger and opened the debate whether Gallinger and Taylor should be reinstated after 15 years. However, Clarence Campbell still strongly opposed reinstatement and the suspension remained. In 1966, Babe Pratt, found guilty of gambling the season before Gallinger and Taylor, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1970, the suspension to Taylor and Gallinger was finally lifted. These are the longest suspensions in the history of the NHL.Zawadzki With the suspension lifted, Taylor became a scout for the NHL Pittsburgh Penguins, but Gallinger never returned to the NHL. However, according to Gallinger's son, Don Gallinger, Jr., the lifting of the ban served to give his father peace of mind. Personal life Don Gallinger grew up and played sports in Port Colborne, Ontario. He was the youngest of six children.Menary p.301 He was childhood friends with Toronto Maple Leafs' captain Teeder Kennedy. Burlington, Ontario where Gallinger spent the last 30 years of his life. It was also where a son, given up for adoption at birth 51 years earlier, tracked down and later united with Gallinger.After being suspended by the NHL, Gallinger moved to Kitchener, Ontario where he met and married Kathleen Wagner. The couple had three boys and another child, Randy Kathleen, who died at age 11 at Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto. Gallinger and his wife ran several downtown hotels. Gallinger participated in baseball in the early 1950s, captaining the Kitchener-Waterloo Panthers to two championships. He also coached the Junior B teams in Hamilton and Port Colborne in the early 1960s. After Gallinger and his wife separated in the mid-1960s, he moved to Burlington where he lived for 30 years until his death. Kathleen Gallinger died in a car accident at age 41. =Lost son reunited= In the summer of 1946, Gallinger had an affair with a young Canadian socialite. The affair became more of a scandal when she became pregnant. Her parents sent her off to California as it was unthinkable for an heiress to marry, in her parent's view, a \\"lowly\\" hockey player. The boy was born in 1947 in Bell, California and was immediately put up for adoption. In 1998, the boy, now Bruce Black, a successful San Jose businessman, decided to finally contact his birth father. Black had been told at age 18 by his adoptive parents who his birth father was, but lacked the nerve to contact him. Black did not know Gallinger's whereabouts, but had met San Jose Sharks radio broadcaster Dan Rusanowsky whose hobby was genealogy research. With Rusanowsky's assistance he located Gallinger. In late 1998, Black phoned Gallinger and then later took his family to Toronto to meet his father and half-brothers. When Gallinger died in 2000, his obituary included Black as one of his surviving sons. Don Gallinger died of a heart attack February 3, 2000 at Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington, Ontario. Gallinger was survived by sons Don, Michael, Kim, and Bruce.

She is known for writing the libretto for Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe (1823) and the play Rosamunde, for which Franz Schubert composed incidental music. Life Helmina was born in Berlin, the daughter of Prussian officer Carl Friedrich von Klencke and his wife Caroline Louise von Klencke (1754‚Äì1802), daughter of Anna Louisa Karsch and herself a poet. The marriage of her parents had already broken up at her birth and she was partly raised by her grandmother. She started writing at the age of 14. Married the first time in 1799, she divorced the next year and upon the death of her mother moved to Paris, where she worked as a correspondent for several German papers. From 1803 to 1807 she edited her own Franz√∂sische Miszellen (\\"French Miscellanea\\") journal, commenting on political issues, which earned her trouble with the ubiquitous censors. In Paris she befriended Friedrich Schlegel's wife Dorothea, who introduced her to the French orientalist Antoine-L√©onard de Ch√©zy. In 1805 they married and Helmina subsequently gave birth to two sons: the later author Wilhelm Theodor von Ch√©zy (1806‚Äì1865) and Max von Ch√©zy (1808‚Äì1846), who became a painter. In 1810, together with Adelbert von Chamisso, she translated several of Friedrich Schlegel's lectures from French into German. They had a short romantic fling, followed by another extramarital affair of Helmina with the Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, probably the father of another son who died shortly after his birth in 1811. As her second marriage too turned out to be an unhappy one, Helmina finally parted from her husband in 1810. She returned to Germany, where she alternately lived in Heidelberg, Frankfurt, Aschaffenburg and Amorbach. In 1812 she settled in Darmstadt. She witnessed the German campaign of the Napoleonic Wars as a military hospital nurse in Cologne and Namur. After she had openly criticised the miserable conditions in the field, she was accused of libel, but was acquitted by the Berlin Kammergericht court under presiding judge E. T. A. Hoffmann. From 1817 she lived in Dresden, where she wrote the libretto of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe. Weber appreciated her writing but disliked her unbound ambition, speaking of her as a \\"suave poetess but unbearable woman\\". Several of her Romantic poems were set to music and Franz Schubert wrote incidental music for her play Rosamunde, which however flopped when it premiered in 1823 at the Vienna Theater an der Wien. Living in Vienna from 1823, she again became politically involved, calling attention to the inhumane working conditions at the saltworks in the Austrian Salzkammergut region. She met Beethoven who was one of her heroes growing up and became good friends with Beethoven and attended his funeral in 1827. In 1828/29 her son Max left to live with his father in Paris, which was a grievous blow, exceeded by the message of her husband's death in 1832 and the loss of her annual alimony payment. While Max returned to live with his mother in Munich, her elder son Wilhelm ultimately fell out with Helmina. Upon Max's death in 1846, she remained alone and in despair. Nevertheless, during the 1848 March Revolution she met exiled poet Georg Herwegh in Strasbourg and encouraged him to fight for democracy in nonviolence and by the waiver of radical actions. Unsuccessfully trying to find another employment as a journalist in order to earn a bare living, she finally retired to Geneva, where she received a modest pension by an artists' charitable foundation. She was by now nearly blind and dependent on care by her niece Bertha Borngr√§ber, who also recorded her memoirs which were revised by Karl August Varnhagen von Ense. She died in Geneva at the age of 73. Published Works Helmina von Ch√©zy's published works as cited by An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers.

She also accompanied her father on his missions, and she was married to a man of the army as well. She fought in Hunan Province against local bandits under Zhang Xianzhong (1605 - 1647). In 1643, her father was killed in battle against the rebel army of Zhang Xianzhong, and Shen Yunying took his place in command during the fight and led the soldiers to victory. In recognition of this, she was offered her father's position, which she accepted. She displayed great military skill in her fight to protect the Ming dynasty from the armies of both the Manchu Qing dynasty and Gao Guiying, the other great female commander of the time, on whose opposite side she was, but she could not prevent the capture of Beijing in 1644 and the death of the last Ming emperor. When her husband was killed in battle the same year, one year after her father, she lost her will to fight from the sorrow and withdrew to a private life. She founded a school where she educated girls in both academics and the martial arts. Shen Yunying died in 1660.

It came into existence when Napoleonic prisoners were housed on the outskirts of Houghton-le-Spring. The prisoners were used as labour to cut a path through the hill at Houghton-le-Spring in order to get the troops from Durham to the coast at Sunderland. Houghton Cut as it became known has now been expanded to carry a 4-lane road, the A690. The place the prisoners were housed was known as \\"The French Houses\\" and this later changed to \\"Fencehouses\\". This origin is highly debatable. A more likely origin was put forward by the late Houghton-le-Spring historian, C.A. Smith MA, in an article in the Official Houghton-le-Spring Urban District Handbook, 1962, as: Fence Houses derives its name from Biddick Fence which formed the southern boundary of South Biddick and included BurnmoorHoughton-le-Spring Urban District The Official Guide, 1962 The land was originally part of the Grange (a large local manor house). In about 1950, a modern housing estate was added to the village it, called the Grange estate. A railway line was built, bringing a 2-platform station providing services to Sunderland, Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham, and a stock yard from which local farmers shipped their cattle by train. The station opened in 1836, and the Post Office two years later as a Railway Sorting Office. The line closed to passengers in May 1964, apart from a one- day service for the Durham Miners Gala that year. In the 1960s. Fence Houses had the largest telephone exchange in the area (The Police house at Shiney Row away had the number \\"Fencehouses 55\\" in the 1940s). In the 1980s the Fence Houses exchange numbers became the Durham exchange numbers. The village is essentially a single main street cut in two by the path of the old railway line which also splits the village into control of two local authorities ‚Äì Sunderland Council for the south of the village and Durham to the north). This is believed to be one of the only villages to split by local authorities in England with the North part of Fence Houses, County Durham and the South part of Fence Houses, Tyne & Wear.

Biography He studied law, and began his law practice in Dresden in 1793. In 1814, he abandoned his law practice to devote himself exclusively to literary work. He was a very industrious writer in many fields of literature, in all of which he was popular in his day with a large class of readers. With Winkler, he edited the Abendzeitung from 1817 to 1826. Though he published five volumes of sentimental and popular poetry, his poetry is the weakest of his literary efforts; the 1894 edition of the reputed Brockhaus encyclopedia critiqued it as being \\"smooth in form but without the least bit of originality.\\"Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon. 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 10, p. 339. His popular tales have somewhat more merit than his poems; but it is in the line of operatic plays that he is best and most generally known. Libretti and plays Besides Der Freisch√ºtz, he wrote the play Das Nachtlager von Granada (1818), which later became the model for Karl Johann Braun von Braunthal's libretto for Conradin Kreutzer's opera Das Nachtlager in Granada (1833).

Opened in 1942, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the war Thruxton was used primarily as a combat fighter airfield. However, paratroops who participated in the Bruneval raid (Operation Biting) in which German radar technology was captured took off from here in Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers on the evening of 27 February 1942. Also, gliders used in the D-day landings operated from here. After the war it was closed in 1946. Today the site is occupied by the Thruxton Circuit. It remains an active aerodrome at the same time, now named Thruxton Aerodrome. History While under United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) control, it was known as USAAF Station AAF-407 for security reasons, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its station-ID was \\"TX\\". Thruxton was transferred to the USAAF Ninth Air Force on 3 January 1944. On 1 March the 366th Fighter Group with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts were transferred to the airfield from RAF Membury. Operational squadrons of the group were: * 389th Fighter Squadron (A6) * 390th Fighter Squadron (B2) * 391st Fighter Squadron (A8) The 366th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command. The group moved to its Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at St. Pierre du Mont, France (ALG A-1) on 17 June 1944 . Current use Upon its release from military use, in 1947 the field was leased by the Wiltshire School of Flying, whose engineering arm designed and built numbers of the Thruxton Jackeroo - a four-seat conversion of the DH82 Tiger Moth. Over the next few years their training fleet was joined at Thruxton by substantial numbers of light aircraft. Flight training at the airfield is now provided by Western Air (Thruxton) Ltd at what is now known as Thruxton Airport. The southwest end of the former 02/20 secondary runway is now used as an aircraft parking ramp with the airport facilities also being built on the former runway. The northeast end of the runway still exists, but is largely abandoned, with parts of it also used for aircraft parking. The airport uses part of the former main 07/25 wartime runway for takeoffs/ landings. A grass runway was built parallel to the 12/30 secondary runway, the wartime concreted runway being in a deteriorating state and unused. Thruxton airfield is also the operational airfield for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance service. Motorcycle racing started in 1950 with the famous Thruxton 500 motorcycle endurance race, followed by cars in 1952. The runway and perimeter roads formed the original circuit until a new track was laid in 1968 utilizing the former airfield perimeter track At 2.356 miles (3.792 km), the new circuit uses only the perimeter road with the addition of a chicane called Club and a series of three tight corners called Campbell, Cobb and Seagrave. All of the loop and pan dispersal areas have been removed. There is no flying on race days but the airfield is used for flying during practice and test days on the motor circuit.

History =Royal Air Force use= RAF Chilbolton was opened in September 1940 as a satellite of RAF Middle Wallop and was used as a relief landing ground by the Royal Air Force (RAF). At first it was developed piecemeal with the addition of the necessary facilities that took it towards existence as an independent airfield. It then hosted its own Hawker Hurricane squadrons which took part in the Battle of Britain. No. 238 Squadron RAF operated throughout the Battle of Britain from Middle Wallop and RAF St Eval as part of No. 10 Group Fighter Command, posted to Chilbolton in September 1940 with Hurricane Is. During the Battle of Britain many sorties were flown covering Southampton to Bristol. Once the battle had been won and therefore the threat of invasion had passed major Luftwaffe raids ceased. Several Supermarine Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons came and went, none stayed very long. By late 1941 Chilbolton had been upgraded with the addition of a perimeter track and several fighter concrete dispersal pens around it. By November 1941 it was placed into Care and Maintenance as there was no use for it by then as the Battle of Britain had ended and there were sufficient airfields in the area to continue the war without it. RAF Units stationed at Chilbolton: * 238 Sqn, Hurricane I, arrived 30 September 1940, departed 20 May 1941. * Glider Pilots Exercise Unit, de Havilland Tiger Moth/Miles Master/General Aircraft Hotspur arrived Dec-Jan 1941. * 238 Sqn, Hurricane IIA, arrived 1 February 1941, departed April 1941. * 308 Sqn, Spitfire IIA, arrived 31 May 1941, departed 24 June 1941. * 501 Sqn, Spitfire IIA, arrived 25 June 1941, departed 5 August 1941. * 504 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 11 August 1941, departed 26 August 1941. * 245 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 September 1941, departed 17 Nov 1941. * 245 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 23 Nov 1941, departed 19 Dec 1941. * 184 Sqn, Hurricane IID, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943. * 174 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943. America came into the war with the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in late 1941; the Allies began preparations for the invasion of Europe. RAF Chilbolton was then allocated to the Americans and transferred to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) playing host to Army Co-operation Command units. =USAAF use= Chilbolton was known as USAAF Station AAF-404 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its RAF and USAAF Station Code was \\"CB\\". 368th Fighter Group On 1 March 1944 the 12th and 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons from the 67th Reconnaissance Wing, flying Spitfires and Mustangs, moved in from RAF Aldermaston to make way for a C-47 group, only to be ejected two weeks later when a new fighter group arrived. The 368th had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes: * 395th Fighter Squadron (A7) * 396th Fighter Squadron (C2) * 397th Fighter Squadron (D3) The 368th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command. Chilbolton continued to be retained by the USAAF for use by transports as a staging airfield for cargo operations to and from the Continent and it was not returned to the RAF until March 1945 by which time most of the C-47 groups had been transferred to forward stations in France. =Back to RAF Control= In the hands of the RAF, Chilbolton played host to a fighter Operational Training Unit - No. 41 OTU - for the rest of World War II, and then to several different fighter squadrons equipped with Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Tempests as the RAF reduced its strength at the end of the war. * No 41 OTU, Hurricane/Spitfire/Master/Martinet arrived March 1945, disbanded 26 June 1945. * 26 Sqn, Mustang I/Spitfire XIV, arrived 23 May 1945, departed 20 August 1945. * 183 Sqn, Spitfire IX, arrived 17 June 1945, departed 8 October 1945. * 247 Sqn, Tempest F2/Typhoon Ib, arrived 20 August 1945, departed 7 January 1946. * 222 Sqn, Tempest V, arrived 10 August 1945, departed 15 August 1945. * 54 Sqn, Tempest F2, arrived 15 November 1945, departed 28 June 1946. * 183 Sqn, Tempest II, arrived 15 November 1945, disbanded 15 November 1945.  Into the 'Jet Age'  In March 1946, Chilbolton became the first RAF station to operate de Havilland Vampire jets when 247 squadron converted to Vampire FB1's, but by the late summer that year the station was on care and maintenance. * 247 Sqn, Tempest F2/Vampire F1, arrived 16 February 1946, departed 1 June 1946. * 247 Sqn, Vampire F1, arrived 12 June 1946, departed 27 June 1946. =Post war= With the facility released from military control in 1946, Vickers Supermarine selected the airfield as a location for conducting flight development programmes of their jet prototypes and development aircraft, remaining for the best part of ten years. Supermarine Attacker, Supermarine Swift and Supermarine Scimitar were developed there as well as many early experimental swept wing jet fighters. The airfield was also used for some location filming of David Lean's classic film, The Sound Barrier in the early 1950s. The Spitfire T Mk IX, a 2-seat trainer and the last Spitfire variant to be built, was also developed and test flown at Chilbolton for export to India and Eire (Southern Ireland). Folland Aircraft also occupied another part of the airfield to conduct similar work on their products, chiefly the Midge and Gnat, but were gone by the end of 1961. With their departure, the wartime airfield began to be dismantled, with large sections of runway, perimeter track and loop hardstands being removed for hardcore. The next organisation to take an active interest in the site was the Space Research Council which set about building an observatory with what was to become a prominent local landmark - a radio telescope, known as the Chilbolton Observatory, which was built almost in the centre of the airfield, on the wartime main runway. When constructed, the north end of the runway was removed, with a two lane access road replacing the runway and connecting to the local road network. Various other enterprises flourished or faded in the buildings on the periphery of the airfield. Flying continued on the old airfield during the 1980s when helicopters and light aircraft serving a field spraying organisation were in residence using a grass strip built parallel to the main north‚Äìsouth 12/30 runway. Current use Today, the perimeter track has been largely reduced to a single-lane farm road as much of the airfield has been returned to agricultural use. A large section of the 06/24 secondary runway still exists, although reduced to half width. In aerial photography, however, much of the former wartime airfield's runways and hardstands can be seen as disturbances on the landscape, giving a ghostly appearance to the area. A large Type B.1 hangar also survives in agricultural use on the Leckford Estate which occupies the SW corner of the former airfield. Flying still takes place at Chilbolton with the Chilbolton Flying Club having established an airstrip on the former playing fields in front of the old RAF gymnasium with planning consent being obtained in 1992. Today club members fly Light aircraft and Ultralights from the airstrip. see http://www.chilboltonflyingclub.co.uk/ See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Brooks, Robin.

The state park offers swimming, fishing, and other activities on of beach, wetlands, and woodlands. Sherwood Island is numbered as Connecticut's first state park because state purchase of land at the site began in 1914. The park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History In the 1640s, several colonists from the Town of Fairfield, who came to be known as the \\"Bankside Farmers,\\" settled in the area that included Fox Island, which was later renamed Sherwood Island, administering the island in common. Daniel Sherwood settled on Fox Island in 1787. During the 1800s, his large family farmed the uplands on the west side of the island and operated a gristmill on the Mill Pond. Many farmers shared the Machamux salt marsh. (See also Henry Burr Sherwood.) By the 1860s, the place was known as \\"Sherwood's Island.\\" Gallup Gap Creek at one time ran north and south on the east side of the park but not far from the center. Some have said that what was known previously as Sherwood's Island was only west of that creek, which was later dammed up to help water flow at the grist mill. When the Connecticut State Park Commission was formed in 1911, one of its main tasks was to find and develop shore parks along Connecticut's coastline. Field secretary Albert Turner walked the shoreline seeking suitable sites: several hundred acres of undeveloped land with natural scenic beauty, fronting on a good beach, and far enough from cities to ensure freedom from sewage pollution and lack of interference with industrial development. He concluded that Sherwood Island was the only suitable site in Fairfield County. At that time, the land had many owners. Acting for the state, Westport farmer and public citizen William H. Burr Jr., who led the fight to create the park, bought two small parcels in 1914, including a strip of beachfront,Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail sign at east end of pavilion at Sherwood Island State Park, read on November 17, 2007 giving Sherwood Island its designation as Connecticut‚Äôs first state park, although it took another two decades for the park to be widely used. Various parcels bought by 1915 amounted to by deed, although a state survey showed they in fact amounted to . The park at this point had of shorefront. In 1923, another north of the island were acquired for possible use as a parking lot, although they were unconnected to the other . Some access to the park at this time was available through the Town of Westport's Burying Hill Beach. At this point, further development of the park stalled when local landowners, led by local property owner Edward Gair, persuaded a town meeting to oppose further land acquisitions and spending on the park. The state legislature, reluctant to act without local approval, defeated a proposal from the State Parks Commission to spend $500,000 on further park development. Large beachfront properties were acquired by developers. For the next nine years, supporters and opponents in Westport and Fairfield County debated the matter. By 1932, the state leased more land in what became the park (with an option to buy within five years) and opened the park that summer. On April 29, 1937, with the lease and option to buy nearing expiration, Governor Wilbur L. Cross signed two bills with a total appropriation of $485,000 for the state to buy more land and develop the park. This was a victory for the Connecticut Forestry Association, the Fairfield County Planning Association, and supporters, including William H. Burr, who came to be known as the father of the park. In the 1950s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed jetties and extended the two beaches. In 1959, the state built an art deco styled pavilion/bathhouse. In 2002, a memorial was dedicated to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Features ;Geography and geology The park is bounded on the west by the Sherwood Mill Pond and on the south by Long Island Sound. It is separated from the mainland by creeks and ditches. The park's beaches are long, more than a mile. Waves on the beach separate three different colors of sand into separate lines -- red (garnet), black (magnetite) and white (quartz) are sorted by the waves because each type has a different density and shape. ;September 11 Memorial 9-11 Memorial at Sherwood Island. Sherwood Island State Park was chosen for Connecticut's September 11 Living Memorial because on a clear day, the New York City skyline is visible from the point. On 9/11, people at the park witnessed the smoke rise over the World Trade Center. The park was authorized, though not activated, to be a staging area for relief efforts. At the dedication on September 5, 2002, the names of 149 deceased victims of the attacks were read aloud; each person was a resident of Connecticut or had close family in the state. Governor John G. Rowland presided over the interfaith ceremony of music, speech, and prayer. The memorial's design incorporates the endurance of granite, the sheltering beauty of trees, and the tranquility of the sea. The polished granite stone monument reads, \\"The citizens of Connecticut dedicate this living memorial to the thousands of innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001 and to the families who loved them.\\" The memorial is handicapped-accessible. ;Nature center The Sherwood Island Nature Center is a summer facility that offers close-up experiences with live animals, displays about the environment and local history, and educational programs. The first nature center was set up by Park Supervisor Glenn Dochtermann in an unused first-aid and lifeguard building in the 1990s. Dochterman used the site as a meeting place for guided field trips and furnished the building with local specimens. In 1995, the Friends of Sherwood Island supported the nature center and established a summer internship program. In 2002, the building was deemed structurally unsound and a campaign to construct a new nature center was launched. The total cost of $340,000 for the new building came from $196,000 from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and $144,000 from the Friends of Sherwood Island. The new facility was constructed and opened in 2009. ;Access The park is accessed from Exit 18 on Connecticut Route 95 (I-95) and proceeding south onto Sherwood Island Connector, also known as Connecticut Special Service Road 476, before reaching the park's paved and gravel parking areas. Activities and amenities Park activities include saltwater swimming and fishing, picnicking, scuba diving, field sports, bird watching, flying kites and model airplanes, and visiting the nature center. Facilities include a pavilion, bathhouses, concessions, a first aid station, toilets, and drinking fountains.

There is a Christian Church called the St Marys Orthodox Church located in Evoor South . Environment The village used to be once blessed with green, lustrous paddy fields, healthy coconut plantations and picturesque thatched houses intertwined by white sandy country roads. Things have drastically changed; paddy fields are all filled and concrete houses with garish colours have come up in their place. Once swaying healthy coconut palms have become pale with root wilt disease and the sandy pathways are replaced by bituminous roads. Celebrities Eminent persons of the locality include famous Thullal artist Evoor Damodaran Nair, novelist Evoor C. K, noted poet Evoor Parameswaran and senior civil servants like Shri. Varrier of Indian Railways, Anandan of Indian Statistical Service and Mathew George of Telecom. Evoor has excellent teams of chenda vidwans and kathakali artists who are famous across the State. The annual temple festival and the boat race at the Evoor Puncha are great social events and attract many visitors. Schools The only presence of Government is by way of three government run lower primary schools. Deshabandhu Vayanashala located in Evoor North had a great treasure of valuable books including compositions on palm leaves providing succor to the knowledge hungry youth of yore. With the advent of Internet Deshabandhu too like other rural libraries has become just a symbol of a rich heritage. Economy The social milieu of the village makes interesting patterns. The economy is basically agrarian with not much divide between the rich and the poor. Gulf money has made dents on the once accepted social hierarchy. Demographics Though Nairs were once the predominant class, now the Ezhavas have gained both financial and social edge. The NSS Karayogams and the SNDP Sakhas have had significant contribution in the social and cultural progress of the members of the respective communities. The Syrian Christians were always in minority and a culturally distinct group. Most of them have migrated to cities. There a few families of Tamil Brahmins around the Evoor temple‡¥Ö and at least two Nampoothiri Illams of repute in Evoor. Almost all the members of the backward and scheduled communities have progressed considerably thanks to the enlightened community leaders of the locality and the influence of progressive political outlook. Politics Politically the locality is predominantly left oriented. 2014 Conversion Controversy During December 2014 the village was caught in a controversy with a few dalit Christians getting reconverted as dalit Hindus under the ageis of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. However, later it was reported that they were practicing Hindus even before re conversion.

Siege After the battle of Peta and the fall of Suli, the road to Missolonghi for the Ottomans was clear. An Ottoman force of 11,000 troops, led by Omer Vrioni and Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha, alongside part of the Ottoman fleet led by Yussuf Pasha of Patras sieged the town on 25 October 1822. Inside the fortified town, there was Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Markos Botsaris, Athanasios Razi-Kotsikas and around six hundred men with fourteen guns. The food and ammunition they possessed would last for only a month. The Ottomans could easily take the city with an attack, although they preferred making negotiations with the besieged Greeks. The Greeks took advantage of this, dragging the negotiations out until the reinforcements from the south arrived. In November, the Greek fleet arrived and targeted the Ottoman ships. More than 1,000 soldiers with food disembarked, relieving the besieged Greeks who subsequently ceased the negotiations. Upon realising their mistake, the Ottomans resumed the siege in earnest.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 75 After a month of bombardment and sorties, the main Ottoman assault was set for the night of December 24, before Christmas, expecting that the Greeks would be caught by surprise. Unknown to the Ottomans, the Greeks were warned by Vryonis' Greek secretary, allowing them to make preparations and causing the Ottomans to lose the element of surprise.

Geography  Gleinst√§tten is situated west of the Sausal hill range, about halfway between the district cities of Leibnitz and Deutschlandsberg, and approximately 35 km to the south of Styria‚Äôs capital, Graz. Its oldest part, with the prominent Renaissance castle, is centered on the eastern and southern edge of a terrace that provides protection against the floods of the river. The villages Prarath, Haslach and Forst (the latter two on the opposite side of the river) are part of the Gleinst√§tten community.  History  = Neolithic to Roman history = There are very few neolithic finds, and no Bronze Age finds, at Gleinst√§tten. However, at this time the hill ranges hemming in the Sulm river were used as an east-to-west transit route between the Balkans, the southern parts of the Basin of Graz and what would much later become the Austrian‚Äôs southernmost province, Carinthia. In the early alpine Iron Age, from the early 8th century BC to the early 600s BC, a significant Hallstatt culture settlement of more than regional importance existed on the Burgstallkogel, a prominent hill just across the Sulm valley. The inhabitants of this settlement maintained long-range trade relations, and it would have been reasonable for them to keep at least a watch post on the terrace on the opposite side of the valley; however, nothing to this effect has been found so far. Only in the 5th century B.C., when the Burgstallkogel settlement was already abandoned, a small and rather poor habitation was present north of Gleinst√§tten. There is also no proof of a settlement at Gleinst√§tten during Roman rule when the area was part of the province of Noricum, although the remains of a Villa rustica have been identified near the former Burgstallkogel settlement. = Middle Ages = Gleinst√§tten castle and church Relief in the north wall of the Gleinst√§tten church, dated to the 2nd quarter of the 13th century CE Gleinst√§tten castle, one of the finest surviving examples of Italian- influenced castle architecture in Austria The village is first mentioned in 1245 as Micheldorf, a name which could refer to the Archangel Michael to whom many contemporary churches and chapels in the vicinity were dedicated. It could also simply mean \\"large village\\" or \\"the larger village\\" (as opposed to one or more nearby smaller ones) because in medieval German the prefix \\"Michel-\\" stood for \\"large\\". The fact that the first known document referring to the adjacent villages Haslach and Prarath dates from 1136 suggests at least a similar age for Gleinst√§tten which has a much more prominent location. However it seems quite likely that all these settlements date back to the 9th century when the early Bavarians reclaimed the region from the predecessors of the current Slovenians who had loosely settled it after the rule of the Avars had succumbed to Charlemagne. From the Rationarium Styriae (1265) we know that 18 houses in Micheldorf were obliged to pay taxes to king Premysl II Ottokar. In 1285 ownership of the village passed from the Micheldorfer family to the related Gleinzer family which reported to the archbishop of Salzburg. Their name most certainly traces back to the Old Slavic word root glina, which refers to the abundant clay deposits near the village. In 1523 Balthasar Gleinzer, who had owned Micheldorf since 1515, obtained permission to rename his village Gleinzst√§tten (\\"place of the clay\\"), from which the current name evolved. = Renaissance to World War II aftermath = The year 1556 marked the conversion of the small medieval fortification at the center of the village to one of the most significant castles in the style of the Italian Renaissance that have been preserved in Austria. It grew toward its current four-wing, three-storey design from 1622 onward when the Zeller family assumed ownership of Gleinst√§tten. Modifications were made around 1640 and after a fire in 1666, and then again around 1740 after another line of Salzburg nobility, the Khuenburg (K√ºenburg) family had taken over. This line held formal rule until the Revolutions of 1848, and maintained effective ownership of Gleinst√§tten (and were frequently elected to public offices) until 1870. In 1907, Pistorf and Prarath seceded from Gleinst√§tten to form their own municipalities; however, Prarath rejoined in 1965. During these centuries Gleinst√§tten experienced war, natural disaster, and epidemics to the same extent as most other places in Austria. Among the most serious events were the following ones: * 1532 Turkish troops retreating from their abortive Siege of Vienna lay waste to the area * 1680-1681 The last outbreak of the Black Death (bubonic plague; see Great Plague of Vienna) claims numerous victims * In 1734 and 1822 fires devastated Gleinst√§tten * In 1805 the village suffered from military action and marauding during the War of the Third Coalition * In 1853 massive hail destroyed the entire harvest * The year 1916 saw a flood that ruined the agriculture and caused severe damage to traffic routes World War I claimed a heavy toll on the population of Gleinst√§tten, and the subsequent loss of Lower Styria in 1919 transformed the entire area into a border district with limited economic perspectives. Although nobility had been legally abolished in Austria, the Wucherer von Huldenfeld family which owned the castle along with many of the local assets enjoyed considerable popularity. They managed to hold on to their estate for some time, and even initiated the first wave of industrialization. However, by 1931 their economic situation had deteriorated so much that the Baron‚Äôs creditors expelled the family from the castle, which started to fall into disrepair. = Recent Past = General economic recovery in Austria, increasing attention of the Styrian provincial government to its border regions, and relaxing political relations with Yugoslavia all contributed to a favorable development of the region during the 1960s and 1970s. By this time the decay of the castle had progressed to such a degree that its demolition was acutely considered. However, a strong grass-roots initiative that pushed for preservation was ultimately successful politically as well as in securing financing. Refurbishment commenced in 1976, and in 1978 the carefully restored castle (with its arcaded inner courtyard now covered by a transparent roof) was reopened as a communal building accommodating the local administrative offices and the elementary school. This exemplary revitalization made Gleinst√§tten a regional cultural attraction and contributed much to its elevation to market township in 1980. Since that time residential construction activity at the periphery of the township has triggered a considerable growth of the population. With its various public schools Gleinst√§tten has also become a regional educational center. On 11 September 2010 Gleinst√§tten (which is transected by the Sulm valley Bundesstra√üe B74) became the first community in Austria to implement the shared space traffic concept.Stra√üe ohne Verkehrsschilder: Erfolgreicher Start.Die PRESSE Sept. 14, 2010. Article (in German)  Economy  Gleinst√§tten enjoys a flourishing economy with about 60 local enterprises, from manufacturing to service and industry consulting. Many of these companies are drawing additional benefit from the accession of former Communist countries ‚Äì especially nearby Slovenia - to the European Union. Tourism traditionally is a strong factor, fuelled by guests who greatly enjoy opportunities for hiking, bicycling and bathing along with the excellent wine and culinary specialties such as pumpkin seed oil. Agriculture maintains a strong position which remains centered on maize grown as food for pigs. Several industry and commerce enterprises in Gleinst√§tten have become of more than regional importance. Tondach Gleinst√§tten AG, majority-owned by world market leader Wienerberger AG, is one of the most significant European manufacturers of construction bricks and roofing tiles. A factory belonging to Assmann enterprises manufactures industry plastics.

The discussion became an acrimonious church intrigue, active approximately from 1598 to 1603. The English government saw advantage in its continuation and supported the appellants or opponents of the archpriest; the controversy is also widely known as the Appellant Controversy. It produced a rich pamphlet literature. Interpretations of its underlying substance have differed: one question to the fore was the allegiance of recusants to the English crown, but it is now argued that internal church matters were central. Other factors were the role of the Jesuits in the English mission and tensions between Catholic clerics and laymen.Patrick Collinson, Elizabethans (2003), pp. 233‚Äì4; Google Books. Background At the time, under Queen Elizabeth I's Protestant religious settlement, the Roman Catholic faith suffered legal disabilities. Foreign powers, most notably Spain and France, supported the training of English Catholic clergy on the European mainland. These priests came principally from two backgrounds: Jesuits and seminary priests. The seminary priests were trained at the English College, Douai in Northern France, an establishment set up by Cardinal Allen and associated to the University of Douai. The root of the controversy stemmed from two different views of the state of the Roman Catholic Church in post-Reformation England. The Jesuits saw England as a missionary field, almost a clean slate, while many of the secular clergy saw their church's survival as a continuation of the institutions of the past. There were also suspicions in England that Jesuit missionaries supported Spanish foreign-policy aims, endangering English Catholics through their political entanglements Appointment of Blackwell In 1598, some four years after the death of Cardinal William Allen in 1594, the Cardinal Protector of England appointed an archpriest to oversee the mission in England, with the permission of Pope Clement VIII. Enrico Caetani had taken on the role of Cardinal Protector, given that the obvious successor to Allen in terms of involvement in the English mission, Robert Parsons, was not broadly acceptable. There were early misgivings about Caetani's choice, however. The archpriest was to have authority over all secular clergy in England, and George Blackwell was chosen: he was close to the Jesuits, and his letter of appointment included instructions to co-operate with them. The new nuncio in Brussels was Ottavio Mirto Frangipani who had jurisdiction over the archpriest, and he believed the arrangement gave excessive control to the Jesuits.Paul Arblaster, Antwerp and the World: Richard Verstegan and the international culture of Catholic reformation (2004), p. 63; Google Books. At the same time, Richard Barret was given control of secular priests in the Spanish Netherlands other than those answerable to the nuncio there, and was told to co-operate with Blackwell, and to act against disruptive English priests. Resistance to Blackwell Affronted, and fearing their loss of independence, a vocal minority of seminary priests refused Blackwell's authority. William Bishop and Robert Charnock travelled to Rome to represent their views and appeal against Blackwell's appointment. They arrived in December 1598; but Parsons had them arrested; and the Pope excluded Bishop from both Rome and England. Some of the seminary priests supported Blackwell, while others continuing to appeal to Rome for his removal. The latter group came to be known as \\"Appellants\\". Their leaders included Christopher Bagshaw, Thomas Bluet, John Colleton, the layman Anthony Copley, John Mush and William Watson.Houliston, p. 121; Google Books. Bagshaw and Parsons had been at odds since 1574.Carrafiello, p. 92; Google Books. Henry Constable, a poet and theological polemicist, was a prominent lay Catholic advocate for the appellant side.Carrafiello, p. 161 note 52; Google Books. The approach taken in appealing against Blackwell changed over the space of about four years. The first appeal of 1598/9 was quite clumsy. In 1602 negotiations were backed by a decision of the French theologians of the Sorbonne,Thomas Graves Law, The Archpriest Controversy vol. 1 (1898), pp. xviii‚Äìxix; archive.org. and had much greater success.Houliston, p. 126; Google Books. As framed by Thomas Graves Law, the controversy turned on Blackwell's relationship to the Jesuits as laid down by Caetani, and this was the central thrust of the appeal of 1600.Thomas Graves Law, The Archpriest Controversy vol. 2 (1898), p. xviii; archive.org. It was dated 17 November 1600 from WisbechRobert Southwell, An Humble Supplication to Her Maiestie (1953 edition), p. xiii; Google Books. (where in Wisbech Castle around 30 priests were interned). Official resolution In 1602, the Pope settled the quarrel by reaffirming Blackwell's authority in a brief of 11 October, but making concessions to the Appellants. He ordered that the next three vacancies among Blackwell's assistants were to be filled from among the Appellants, and he rescinded the instruction that Blackwell was to consult with the Jesuits, instead forbidding such consultation. Relations between the two factions of seminary priests then improved; though there was an attempt to make out the fine print of the brief to disadvantage three appellant clergy (Bluet, Watson and William Clark).Dictionary of National Biography, Clark, William (d. 1603), catholic priest, by Thompson Cooper. Published 1887. The Protestation of Allegiance Some Appellants went to the Queen, requesting religious toleration in return for their declaring allegiance to her and for her expelling the Jesuits from England. Seeing a chance to divide the Catholics, Elizabeth initially welcomed these approaches, and her government gave some of the Appellants access to printers during the pamphlet war. However, in 1602, disappointed at the Pope's settlement of the dispute, Elizabeth issued a proclamation accusing the Appellants of disloyalty, offering them mercy only if they gave themselves up and signed a \\"protestation of allegiance\\". Thirteen of the Appellants publicly asserted their loyalty to Elizabeth in this manner: they were Bishop, Colleton, Mush, Charnock with Roger Cadwallador and Robert Drury (future Catholic martyrs), Francis Barnaby, Anthony Champney, John Boseville, Richard Button, Anthony Hebourn, John Jackson, and Oswald Needham.Charles Dodd, Dodd's Church History of England, Volume 3 (1840 edition), p. xcxi; Google Books. Richard Bancroft and the Appellants A bitter pamphlet war followed from the inflammatory manuscript Adversus factiosos in ecclesia circulated in 1598 by Thomas Lister.Michael C. Questier, Newsletters from the Archpresbyterate of George Birkhead (1998), p. 90 note 31; Google Books. The royal policy of helping the appellants print pamphlets was implemented by Richard Bancroft as bishop of London. Leading printers were used: Robert Barker, Thomas Creede, Richard Field, James Roberts and three others. The authors included the French writers against the Jesuits, Antoine Arnauld and √âtienne Pasquier.Lisa Ferraro Parmelee, Good Newes from Fraunce: French anti-league propaganda in late Elizabethan England (1996), p. 42; Google Books. Bancroft cultivated his contacts with individual appellant priests. He supported Thomas Bluet's wish to travel to Rome and see Pope Clement VIII, with permission and contacts in Parliament.Bernard Bourdin, The Theological-Political Origins of the Modern State: The Controversy Between James I of England & Cardinal Bellarmine (2010), p. 54; Google Books. In September 1601 William Watson was resident at Fulham Palace, under the protection of Bancroft. Francis Barnaby was another appellant contact of Bancroft's, who communicated for him with Christopher Bagshaw, in Paris, and had worked with William Clark in writing a 1603 pamphlet against the English Jesuits.A Replie unto a certain Libell latelie set foorth by Fa.

The Maldives are among the countries with the least tolerance towards Christians. According to the former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, no religion other than Islam should be allowed in the Maldives. Public practise of the Christian religion is prohibited. In the late 1990s, the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs warned people that they would face arrest if they listened to radio programs broadcast in the Dhivehi language by the Far East Broadcasting Association, based in the Seychelles. In 1998, 50 Maldivian Christians were arrested and held on the prison island of Dhoonidhoo, and Christian foreigners who were suspected of missionary work were also expelled from the country.

The Maldivian High Commission in Colombo stated in 1998, that reports of persecution are wrong.  History  The arrival of the Portuguese also saw the appearance of Christianity in the region. In 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a Viador (Viyazoru), or overseer of a factory (trading post) in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in Goa. They tried to impose Christianity on the locals and some of the nobility were converted. After a local leader repelled the Portuguese, Christianity receded. The Dutch nominally controlled the region in the mid-17th century then the British in the last years of the 17th century. However, the Dutch and British didn't interfere with the religious beliefs of the locals. Today, Christianity in the Maldives is mainly practiced by tourists and temporary workers.

The company was acquired by Epic Games in 2008. History Donald Mustard at the 2011 Game Developers Conference Chair Entertainment was formed in 2005 by Donald Mustard and Geremy Mustard, CEO Ryan Holmes, and other key Advent Rising core design team members Bert Lewis, Orlando Barrowes, Nathan Trewartha, Cameron Dayton and Jared Trulock. Soon after, Chair licensed the literary rights to its Empire property to best-selling author Orson Scott Card. The novel Empire was published by Tor Books and debuted as a New York Times Best-Seller in November 2006. Card has since released the literary sequel Hidden Empire and committed to writing additional novels for the series. Chair also secured an option with Joel Silver and Warner Bros. for the Empire movie, which is currently in development. Additionally, Chair has retained the rights to produce future video games and comic books based on its Empire property. Chair began production on its first Xbox Live Arcade game, Undertow, in the fall of 2006. Released on November 21, 2007, Undertow is a fast-paced, action-shooter that takes place entirely underwater. Upon release, Undertow won numerous E3 and Editor's Choice awards and was named Xbox Live Arcade Game of the Year by Official Xbox Magazine. On January 29, 2008, Chair announced it had acquired the interactive rights to Orson Scott Card's novel Ender's Game with plans to adapt the best-selling novel as a digitally distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. In May 2008, Chair Entertainment was acquired by Epic Games. On August 19, 2009, Chair released its second game, Shadow Complex, exclusively for Xbox Live Arcade. The game was published by Microsoft Game Studios and won more than 45 Game of the Year and 35 E3 and Editors Choice Awards. The game was released to positive reviews, with a score of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic.com as of July 10, 2010. Shadow Complex featured a story written by famed comic book author Peter David and was set in Chair's Empire universe. On September 1, 2010, Chair's next title, code-named \\"Project Sword\\", was announced at the Apple Fall Event 2010. The game, Infinity Blade, a sword fighting title playable on iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, was released December 2010, and is the first game on Apple mobile devices powered by Unreal Engine 3. It utilizes Apple's new GameCenter online gaming service. A tech demo for UE3, entitled Epic Citadel was released on iTunes the same day as a free download (though it was created by Epic Games, not Chair). In October 2010, Chair relocated from Provo, Utah to Salt Lake City, Utah. Chair relocated to its current studio in South Jordan, Utah in 2013. On December 14, 2010, Chair Entertainment confirmed in an interview that it had ceased development on the video game version of Ender's Game in favor of a continued focus on developing its own original intellectual properties. During the Apple Fall Event 2011, Infinity Blade II was announced, with new features and visuals which took advantage of the next generation of iOS hardware (the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S). The game was released on December 1, 2011. On January 5, 2012, Epic Games announced that the Infinity Blade franchise had generated over $23 million in revenue. In August 2013, Chair released the literary sequel, Infinity Blade: Redemption, also written by Brandon Sanderson. At the Apple iPhone 5S conference on September 11, 2013, Infinity Blade III, allegedly the final Infinity Blade game in the series, was announced by Donald Mustard and Geremy Mustard, who took the stage to provide a live demo. Infinity Blade III debuted at #1 on the App Store on September 18, 2013. The game featured the exclusive debut of the original, Infinity Blade-inspired song \\"Monster\\" from award-winning alternative rock band Imagine Dragons.

Established at Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) on 1 June 1876, by the liberal section of the Brahmo Samaj, it was successor of Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya (School of Hindu Women) set up on 18 September 1873 by Annette Akroyd. Banga Mahila Vidyalaya was merged with Bethune College on 1 August 1878.Kopf, David (1979), The Brahmo Samaj and the Shaping of the Modern Indian Mind, pp. 30-41, Princeton University Press, The short-lived Banga Mahila Vidyalaya not only laid the foundations for higher education of women in India, it was the pivotal issue which fostered the second split in the Brahmo Samaj. David Kopf says that while the immediate cause for the split in the Brahmo Samaj in 1878, was the marriage of Keshub Chunder Sen's daughter to the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, ‚Äò‚Äôwomen‚Äôs emancipation was the major issue of the 1870s.\\" The background When the Brahmo Samaj split for the first time in 1866, all the progressives within the organisation, including Keshub Chandra Sen, Sivanath Sastri, Sib Chandra Deb, and Durga Mohan Das, were together. Their thinking about most matters related to the Brahmo Samaj matched. The parting of ways started in the early 1870s, and one of the issues on which they differed was women's education. The writings of Theodore Parker, the socially active Unitarian, had a profound impact on the Brahmo Samaj thinking. Mary Carpenter, a British follower of Theodore Parker and daughter of Ram Mohan Roy‚Äôs Unitarian friend, Lant Carpenter, also had a positive impact on Brahmo Samaj thinking. During her first two visits to India, Mary Carpenter met the Brahmos and asked them to extend the American and English efforts at women‚Äôs emancipation to India. Among her more devoted supporters were Monomohun Ghosh, whom she had occasion to meet when he was in England, attempting first an entry into the Indian Civil Service and then the English bar in the early and mid sixties. When Mary Carpenter visited Kolkata in 1869, she had a definite scheme for promoting women‚Äôs education in India. She proposed the establishment by the Brahmo Samaj of a normal school to train women teachers for girls‚Äô schools. Such a school was set up as part of the Indian Reform Association. At that point of time, Bethune's school was the only institution for girls‚Äô in Kolkata, which Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan and other liberals were supporting. It was then that a second British woman, Annette Akroyd entered the scene. She had formed a deep friendship with Monomohun Ghosh in England and when Keshub Chunder Sen went to England and delivered his noted speech on Female Education in India, she made up her mind to travel to India. She arrived at Kolkata in 1872 and was house guest of Monomohun Ghosh. Annette Akroyd opened her school, Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya, in 1873 with Dwarkanath Ganguly as headmaster. It became the cause of a bitter quarrel between the conservative and liberal sections of the Brahmo Samaj of India. Ultimately, Annette Akroyd got married and left the school. With the arrival of Mary Carpenter on her third visit to India, a more ambitious scheme to train women for higher education was adopted with the establishment in 1876 of Banga Mahila Vidyalaya . Conflict of opinions The focus of conflict between the conservatives and progressives initially centred on one view that female education as preparatory for marriage and the other view that women should be educated on the same basis and to same levels as men. David Kopf writes, \\"Miss Akroyd played a leading part in this debate, sarcastically distinguishing Keshub, the rhetorician of women‚Äôs liberation in England from Keshub, the typical Hindu male keeping knowledge from the minds of women‚Ä¶ Keshub tried to convince Miss Akroyd, Ghosh and Sastri that he was progressive, but at the same time wary of radical change.‚Äô‚Äô Miss Akroyd lost faith in Keshub‚Äôs ‚Äògo slow‚Äô policies. Sen countered with a warning about denationalised female education in Bengal and anglicized curriculum. The progressives, who later formed Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, replied, that Keshub Chunder Sen had joined the growing legion of Hindu revivalists and militants who had nothing but contempt for things western. David Kopf writes, \\"The triumph of the Sadharan Brahmos over the Keshubites on the issue of women‚Äôs emancipation clearly represents the impact of Unitarian social philosophy on Hindu society and culture. As the facts disclose, Unitarian impact was not merely intellectual or ideological. Through the advocacy and work of Carpenter and Akroyd, its impact was intrusively practical.\\" He goes on to conclude, \\"The relatively emancipated professional Indian woman of today owe a considerable debt of gratitude to the Brahmo pioneers of the nineteenth century. The revival Durga Mohan Das, Dwarkanath Ganguly, Ananda Mohan Bose, Monomohun Ghose and Annadacharan Khastagir were actively involved in the revival of the Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya as Banga Mahila Vidyalaya. The education imparted was of a higher standard, its students following the course meant for Entrance (school leaving or university entrance) Examinations.Bagal, Jogesh Chandra, History of the Bethune School and College (1849-1949) in Bethune College and School Centenary Volume, edited by Dr. Kalidas Nag, 1949, pp. 33-35Sastri, Sivanth, Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj, 1903/2001, , pp. 178-179, New Age Publishers Pvt.

It was formerly managed in Calcutta by Miss Akroyd, and lately revived by some Bengali gentlemen who desire to see girls appearing at the university examination and finishing their education at the new college for women in Cambridge‚Ä¶ It is the first attempt to establish a higher English boarding school for girls.\\" Among the prominent students of the school were Kadambini Bose, a cousin of Monomohun Ghosh, Sarala Das and Abala Das, daughters of Durga Mohan Das, and Subarnaprova Bose, sister of Jagadish Chandra Bose and later wife of Mohini Mohan Bose.\\" Kadambini Bose became the first woman in India to pass the Entrance Examination in 1878.Acharya, Poromesh, Education in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 86-87, Oxford University Press, Banga Mahila Vidyalaya was located in Ballygunj.It is not clear whether the school was revived at Ballygunj or Hindu Mahila Vidyalaya shifted to Ballygunj from Entally where it was initially located. Sivanath Sastri, in his Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj, p 197, mentions both the schools as being in Ballygunj. Amalgamation with Bethune College By the year 1866-67 a movement was afoot for remodelling Bethune School because the school was not sought after. That Banga Mahila Vidyalaya was higher type of school was also admitted. Monomohun Ghose who was secretary to the Bethune School Committee was also connected with Banga Mahila Vidyalaya. He played an important part in the amalgamation of these two institutions. Chief Justice Sir Richard Garth, who was president of Bethune School paid a visit to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya and was highly pleased with the arrangements and the instruction imparted to the girls. The result was an offer from the committee of Bethune School to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya for amalgamation, which came about on 1 August 1878. With the amalgamation Bethune School entered a new phase in its history.

She was also able to carry 1,000 troops on her mine deck as a fast troop transport. Shortly after completion she was modified and became a gunnery training ship, replacing the elderly armored cruiser . Shortly before the beginning of World War II, she reverted to her original role and most of the gunnery training equipment was removed. She was sent to Casablanca, in French Morocco, when the war began to lay a minefield, but the order was cancelled a day later and she was ordered to disembark her naval mines. She exploded while landing her still-fuzed mines on 13 September 1939. Design The Marine Nationale decided to build a fast minelayer as part of its 1925 Naval Programme after the British made her debut in the early 1920s. Pluton was similar in many respects, also being armed with four single destroyer- caliber guns, but was smaller and faster. She could also be used as a fast transport for up to 1,000 troops. The sides of the mine deck were normally open to the weather, but metal panels could be used to close it off when carrying troops.Guiglini & Moreau, pp. 153, 155 =General characteristics= Pluton was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . Her longitudinally framed hull was subdivided by 15 transverse watertight bulkheads. Duralumin was extensively used in the superstructure to save weight, but this resulted in corrosion problems and strength issues. She was fitted with a single counterbalanced rudder powered by an electric motor that was too weak for the job. Her turning circle was with 25¬∞ of rudder at , larger than that of the light cruiser which was longer. She was totally unarmored and relied upon her watertight subdivision for survival.Jordan, pp. 21‚Äì22 =Propulsion= Pluton had a two-shaft unit machinery layout with alternating boiler and engine rooms. Her Br√©guet single-reduction impulse geared steam turbines were designed for , but made on trials. Four du Temple boilers powered the turbines at a pressure of .Jordan, p. 22 An auxiliary boiler was fitted to heat or cool the ship's magazines and provide drinking water. Each propeller shaft drove a three-bladed bronze propeller for a designed speed of , but she achieved on trials.Guiglini & Moreau, pp. 155, 158 of fuel oil was carried which was originally calculated to provide an endurance of at , but it was revised downwards to once she entered service because the demands of her auxiliary machinery had been seriously underestimated. A pair of turbo generators provided electricity at 235 volts. Two diesel generators were mounted in the aft engine room to provide power while in harbor and a third was installed in a special compartment on the first deck for emergency use.Jordan, pp. 22‚Äì23 =Armament= Pluton was originally intended to carry two single turrets, one each fore and aft, with guns, four anti-aircraft (AA) guns and four light AA guns. However four guns were substituted for the 203 mm guns before construction began and six more 37 mm guns were added in lieu of the 75 mm guns during construction although the baseplates for the 75 mm guns were retained for future use.Guiglini & Moreau, p. 153 The four 138 mm 40-caliber guns were on M1924 mounts with gun shields. Two guns each were fore and aft in superfiring positions on the centerline. Their elevation limits were -10¬∞ to +35¬∞ and they had a 270¬∞ arc of fire. Their rate of fire was a nominal eight to nine rounds per minute, but proved to be considerably less in service. They had a maximum range of about with a shell at a muzzle velocity of . 150 rounds were provided for each gun. One powder and one shell magazine served each pair of guns, each of which had their own individual hoist.Jordan, p. 23 Ten 37 mm/50 cal semi-automatic AA guns were carried by Pluton. Two were fitted on the foredeck, six amidships between the funnels and two on a platform at the stern. 10,000 rounds were carried with 144 rounds in ready-use boxes near each gun. The guns could depress 15¬∞ and elevate to 80¬∞. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . Their effective anti-aircraft range was less than . All of these guns‚Äîexcept for the pair on the stern‚Äîwere removed shortly after Pluton was commissioned in 1932.Guiglini & Moreau, pp. 160, 166 Twelve obsolete Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns were carried in six twin mounts. Two mounts were on top of the bridge, two atop the after boiler room ventilator housing and two just forward of the tripod mainmast. 48,000 rounds were provided for them. They were removed shortly after Pluton was commissioned in 1932. Pluton was designed to carry 220 Sautter-Harl√© mines, but had space for 30 extra, for a total of 250. They were carried on the first deck, or mine deck, using a system of four rails along the sides of the ship and moved via chain-drives. Each pair of rails converged on a turntable at the forward end of the rails and a transverse spur connected the two turntables. The spur facilitated loading mines from one side of the ship and allowed mines to be moved to each of the rails. The rails ended in four ramps at the stern of the ship that sloped down at a 30¬∞ angle to minimize the shock of impact when the mines were released from the chain drive. Up to 270 of the smaller Br√©guet B4 mines could be carried.Guiglini & Moreau, pp. 160‚Äì61 Service She entered service with the French Mediterranean Fleet in 1932. Pluton experienced many teething problems, particularly with the machinery. Shortly after she was commissioned the Navy decided to give her an extra role as a gunnery training ship and she entered Toulon Dockyard for the necessary modifications on 24 October 1932. Quarters for 40 men were added on the mine deck. Most of the 37-mm AA guns and all of the 8 mm machine guns were replaced by four 50-caliber 75 mm Canon de 75 mm Mle 22 or 24 AA guns and 12 Hotchkiss machine guns on six twin mounts, two mounts where the 37 mm guns had been mounted on the foredeck and four between the funnels.Guiglini & Moreau, pp. 166, 171 The 75 mm guns had a maximum depression of 10¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 90¬∞. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 8‚Äì18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of . The Hotchkiss guns had a cyclic rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 200 and 250 rounds per minute to allow for reloading its 30-round magazines. They had a theoretical ceiling of . A simple fire-control director was added for the 138 mm guns and 15 additional rangefinders were installed for use by the Rangefinding School.Guiglini & Moreau, p. 171 Pluton spent much of 1933‚Äì1935 in dockyard hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 April 1933. She was refitted four times during this period to add more gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects. These included reinforcement of her superstructure where it had been damaged by the muzzle blast from her 138 mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones. A high-angle fire-control director for her 75 mm guns was added, two of her 75 mm gun were converted to powered, remotely controlled mounts, gun shields were added to the 75 mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck. The wreckage of Pluton at Casablanca In 1936, an experimental twin 13.2 mm gun mount with a gun shield was added between the starboard 75-mm guns and more rangefinders were added to bring her total up to 31. Her boilers and condensers were repaired in a refit between 25 November 1936 and 13 March 1937. Later that year Pluton had a major refit that involved repair of her turbines, replacement of her 138 mm fire-control director by one of the type used by the light cruisers and the transfer of the foredeck 13.2 mm machine guns to positions on the forward superstrucut. Her last refit, from 15 November 1938 ‚Äì 15 February 1939, retubed two boilers, enclosed the AA director to protect it from the weather, improved the remote control of the 138 mm guns and added gun shields to each of the twin 13.2 mm mounts.Guiglini & Moreau, p. 172 Pluton was transferred to Lorient on 10 May 1939 when the French Navy formed the 5e Escadre there which controlled all training ships and planned to convert her into a full-time training ship as consort to the training cruiser on 1 June 1940.Jordan, p. 28 She would have been renamed La Tour d'Auvergne at that time, as the name Pluton was reserved for mine warfare ships in the French Navy. As war approached, it was decided to retain her as a minelayer and most of the extra fire control equipment was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of the reorganization of the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Br√©guet mines embarked. She was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after the mines had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark the mines. While landing the mines on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. Three trawlers (Etoile du Matin, Marie Merveilleuse, and Sultan) were sunk by the explosion, and the auxiliary minesweepers Charcot, Gosse, and Chellah damaged beyond repair. Two other auxiliary minesweepers, Grodin and Alcor, were damaged but able to be repaired.http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-3909-06SEP01.htm One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but demolition work did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.Guiglini & Moreau, p. 232 Notes Bibliography * * Category:Cruisers of the French Navy Category:Ships built in France Category:1929 ships Category:World War II cruisers of France Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Maritime incidents in September 1939 Category:Minelayers of the French Navy Category:Ships sunk by non-combat internal explosions ","title":"French cruiser Pluton"},{"id":"10813128","text":"Location of Katete town and district in Eastern Province, Zambia Ox-drawn carts and bicycles waiting for customers Katete is a medium town in the Eastern Province of Zambia, and is headquarters of Katete District. The town is at the foot of rocky hills which lie to its east, including Mpangwe Hill and Kangarema Hill, which rise to 1600 m and are surrounded by cultivated fields. It lies on the Great East Road about 90 km south-west of the provincial capital, Chipata at an elevation of 1060 m on the watershed between the middle Luangwa River and the Zambezi. In the town is a major road junction, with a surfaced road branching off and running 50 km to the Mozambique border and connecting with Tete on the Zambezi 339 km to the south- east. History Although Katete now lies on the Great East Road, in the 1950s Katete was a small settlement down a dirt track. At the road junction there was a just filling station and a handful of shops run by Indian traders. The settlement was to service an \\"NRG\\" (Northern Rhodesia Government) secondary technical school for African male students. The school had a brickyard where mud bricks were handmade and kiln-fired. Subjects included woodwork, agriculture, sugar-making (from sugar cane), and leather tanning, but academic subjects such as arithmetic and science were also taught. The teachers, who were mainly European, lived in bungalows in the settlement. The school was known as the Area School and part of the Eastern Province, NRG Development Area. The school dealt specifically with adult education which also included mass literacy in the Chichewa vocabulary that included women. This latter was based on the Frank Laubach system and refined by Hope Hay whose husband Rev Arthur Hay built and was first principle of the school. Katete was a bus stop on the Great East road for the Thatcher Hobson Servivce which was where the small commercial centre was sited. (to correct the modern impression of a 'filling station', in those days fuel came in 44 gallon drums with a siphon tube)The NRG administrative and educational settlement was South of this point while St Francis Church mission hospital and an agricultural research station lay to the North. The area was also known for several tobacco farms cultivated by white settlers.
