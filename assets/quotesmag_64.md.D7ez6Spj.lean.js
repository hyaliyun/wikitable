It is native to west and central Africa, has been cultivated since ancient times in Africa, and is sometimes also used in tropical Asia where it has become naturalized to a small extent. It is used in Africa as a leafy vegetable; the leaves are eaten fresh and cooked. The leaves are slimy in texture when cooked. The shoots are used in soups and porridge. The seeds are eaten whole or as a paste. The leaves are also used medicinally as a laxative, an antidote to scorpion venom and to treat sprains and ease childbirth. This plant is an annual herb growing up to 1.2 to 1.5 meters tall. The leaves are opposite, or toward the top of the plant, alternately arranged. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and up to 12 centimeters long. They may be smooth-edged or serrated. Flowers occur singly in the leaf axils. They are pink to purple in color, sometimes white, and somewhat bell-shaped. They measure up to 5 centimeters long. The fruit is a capsule up to 3.5 centimeters long which contains seeds roughly 3 millimeters long. This plant grows wild in savanna and other habitat types. It is also a weed of fields and homesteads. It can grow on poor, rocky soils and it flowers even through drought conditions. When cultivated the plant yields 5 to 6 tons of leaves per hectare. This plant is vulnerable to the leaf spot disease Cercospora sesami. It is also attacked by hawk moths, the moth Antigastra catalaunalis, and the vegetable bug Nezara viridula.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Koƒçevje municipal site It no longer has any permanent residents. Name The Slovene name Mokri Potok literally means 'wet stream' and may be an ironic name because the watercourse with the same name is often dry. The German name Unterwetzenbach (literally, 'lower Wetzenbach) is paired with neighboring Oberwetzenbach (literally, 'upper Wetzenbach), which is named Sadni Hrib in Slovene. The origin of the name Wetzenbach is uncertain. The most common explanation is that it refers to the surname Wetz (i.e., 'Wetz's Creek'), which was attested in the Gottschee area. Another theory holds that the name Wetzenbach is a corruption of Weiss Bach 'White Creek'. The Slovenian name Brusni potok (literally, 'whetting steam') was used in prewar Yugoslavia and was a mistranslation of the German name, mistaking the modifier Wetzen- for the verb wetzen 'to whet, hone'. History Mokri Potok was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1498 it had three full farms divided into six half-farms. In the land registry of 1574 there were four half-farms as well as a full farm owned by the mayor. Before the Second World War the village had 19 houses. The village was not destroyed during the war, when its original inhabitants were expelled. The last residents abandoned the village in 1965.

She was the mother of King Khalid who was the fourth ruler of Saudi Arabia. Background Al Jawhara bint Musaed was from the Al Jiluwis, a cadet branch of the Al Saud. The family, Al Jiluwi, are significant for Al Sauds since it is composed of the descendants of the younger brother of King Abdulaziz's grandfather Faisal bin Turki Al Saud. The roots of the Al Jiluwis trace back to Prince Jiluwi bin Turki bin Abdallah, who served as the governor of Unayzah during the late 1700s. Al Jiluwi and Al Sudairi were strong supporters of the Al Saud in the early years of state formation. The members of Al Jiluwis allied themselves with King Abdulaziz to eliminate the threat posed by the Al Kabir clan. For instance, Abdallah bin Jiluwi served as King Abdulaziz's deputy commander and helped him in the conquest of the eastern region of Arabia. He served as the governor of the Eastern Province from 1913 to 1938. Then, his son, Saud bin Abdullah, served as the governor of this province between 1938 and 1967. Next, his another son, Abdul Muhsin bin Abdullah, served as the governor of the province from 1967 to 1985 until being replaced by Prince Muhammed bin Fahd. Additionally, the members of Al Jiluwi intermarried with the Al Sauds. More specifically, the spouses of late King Faisal, late King Fahd, late King Abdullah, late Prince Sultan and late Prince Nayef were all members of Al Jiluwi clan. Early life Al Jawhara was born in around 1891 and was the daughter of Musaed, a nephew of Faisal bin Turki Al Saud. Her mother was Hussa bint Abdullah bin Turki Al Turki, and her paternal grandmother, Noura bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, was also from another powerful family, Al Sudairi. In addition, she was the sister of King Abdulaziz's mother, Sara bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. The full brother of Al Jawhara, Abdulaziz bin Musaed, was one of former governors of Hail Province. One of Abdulaziz bin Musaed's spouses was the sister of King Abdulaziz, Hussa bint Abdul Rahman. They had no child. The daughter of Abdulaziz bin Musaed, Al Jawhara bint Abdulaziz, was the wife of late Prince Nayef and the mother of Prince Saud and Prince Mohammad, former crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Another daughter, Al Anood bint Abdulaziz, was the first wife of King Fahd. Marriage Al Jawhara bint Musaed was one of the King Ibn Saud's favorite wives. They were married in 1908 when she was seventeen years old. She was the fourth spouse of King Ibn Saud. It was the only marriage of King Ibn Saud to one of the Al Saud or a close relative. Their marriage produced three children; Prince Mohammad, King Khalid and Princess Al Anoud. Her daughter, Al Anoud, married to the sons of Saad bin Abdul Rahman. She first married Fahd bin Saad and they divorced in 1935. Then she married Saud bin Saad, brother of her ex-husband, in 1940. In Spring 1913 before the capture of Al Hasa King Abdulaziz was in Hofuf and sent an ode to Al Jawhara. She was special for King Ibn Saud due to several reasons. First, Al Jawharah was King Ibn Saud's cousin. Secondly, she was chosen by King Ibn Saud's mother as a wife for him. And lastly, she died at young age. Activities Al Jawhara bint Musaed was extremely interested in horse riding and breeding. She formed a stable within the palace in Riyadh and also, hired the best Najdi horse riders to train cavalry who in turn contributed significantly in King Abdulaziz's attempts to unify Saudi Arabia. She owned various books which she donated to a local organization. Death Al Jawhara bint Musaed died in Riyadh in 1919 in the flu epidemic, which also killed Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz, eldest son of King Ibn Saud. Her room in the palace was kept, not allowing anyone to enter except for King Ibn Saud's sister, Nuora. Al Jawhara bint Musaid's death is reported to make King Abdulaziz so sad and devastated that he cried. In private meetings with his friends King Abdulaziz talked about her stating that she was a great companion for him during the difficult times of establishing his rule.

Philip Delano lived a long life in Plymouth Colony where he became a person of some note, being involved in numerous governmental activities such as civil commissions and juries. Among his early activities was in becoming a very young (investment) Purchaser in 1626 and making the first recorded land sale in Plymouth after the institution of private property. At his death it is believed he had become a person of some wealth.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 280Genealogical Profile of Philip Delano/De la Noye, (collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society accessed 2013) Philip Delano died in Duxbury, Massachusetts between August 22, 1681 and March 4, 1681/82. His burial place is unknown.Charles Edward Banks,The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Father Original Narratives of Early American History (New York: Grafton Press, 1929), p. 115  French language and Walloon ancestry  Philippe de Lannoy was baptized in the Protestant Walloon church of Leiden, Holland on November 6, 1603. His parents are recorded as Jan (Jean) de Lannoy of Tourcoing and Marie Mahieu of Lille (Rijsel in Flanders in the Spanish Netherlands, later a part of France after capture by Louis XIV in 1668),George English, Ancestry and History of Philip Delano, Born Philippe de Lannoy (Mayflower Descendant, 56 [2007]), pp. 70-90, 163-184 who were betrothed on January 13, 1596 in the same Walloon church. Both parents made their way with their families to Leiden via Canterbury, England, having fled from Flanders around 1579. Jean's father was Gysbert (Guilbert) de Lannoy. His father Jean died within a year or two, and his mother became betrothed to Robert Mannoo, a woolcomber from the city of Namur on February 18, 1605. Philippe grew up in Leiden, but further details are unknown. Per author Eugene Stratton, Philippe was a member of the Separatist church in Leiden and had been in communion with the Walloon church. The Walloons were the French-speaking natives of the ancient region of Wallonia, now in today's Belgium.  Family name  Over the years, names of various spellings have been attributed to him. The surname de Lannoy originates from the town of Lannoy, a few miles from Tourcoing. Banks has him as Phillipe de la Noye. In the 1623 Division of Land he is listed as Philipe de la Noye. In both the 1626 Purchasers list and 1633/34 tax list he is Phillip Delanoy. His name was changed from de Lannoy to Delano in New England. His father's name at marriage and death is recorded in Dutch church records as Jan Lano.  In New England  In November 1621 Philip Delano arrived in Plymouth Colony as a single man on the ship Fortune. While Bangs states that he was 16 years of age when he arrived he was actually closer to 20 though it is speculated he must at this time have been a servant of one of the other passengers, as he was a minor.. Approximately 65 passengers embarked on Mayflower in the middle of July 1620 at either Blackwall or Wapping on the River Thames.[10] The ship then proceeded down the Thames into the English Channel and then on to the south coast of England to anchor at Southampton Water. She waited there for a rendezvous on July 22 with the Speedwell, which was coming from Holland with English separatist Puritans, members of the Leiden congregation who had been living in Holland to escape religious persecution in England, including Delano his uncle Francis Cooke and his cousin John Cooke. Both ships set sail for America around August 5, but Speedwell sprang a leak shortly after, and the two ships were brought into Dartmouth for repairs. They made a new start after the repairs, and they were more than 200 miles (320 km) beyond Land's End at the southwestern tip of England when Speedwell sprang another leak. It was now early September, and they had no choice but to abandon Speedwell and make a determination on her passengers. This was a dire event, as the ship had wasted vital funds and was considered very important to the future success of their settlement in America. Both ships returned to Plymouth, where some of Speedwell passengers joined Mayflower and others returned to Holland. Mayflower then continued on her voyage to America, and Speedwell was sold soon afterwards.[11]. It appears Delano did not make the cut so came the next year. He may have lived first in Plymouth with his uncle, Mayflower passenger Francis Cooke and his son. Philippe's maternal aunt, Hester (Mahieu) was married to Cooke. In the 1623 Division of Land he is listed as Philipe de la Noye, and he shared a parcel of land with Moses Simonson. Delano was one of the Purchasers (or Old Purchasers) which were heads of families resident in Plymouth in 1626 and were later given special privileges which allowed them advantageous grants of free land. In late 1626 Isaac Allerton had reached an agreement with their colony financial backers in London, the Adventurers, that the colony would buy their debts from the London backers and form their own group in Plymouth, the Undertakers, which would assume the debt. The agreement was signed in Plymouth on behalf of the Purchasers by 27 men with Delano signing as ‚ÄúPhillip Delanoy‚Äù. In 1627 Delano made the first recorded land sale in Plymouth after institution of private property (from his share of the 1623 land division). The land was one acre on the north side of town sold to Stephen Deane. In 1633 Delano was on the freeman list. In 1637 Delano volunteered for the Pequot War. On October 2, 1637 Delano was given forty acres of land in Duxbury, adjoining the lands of John Alden and Edward Bumpus.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 281 Philip Delano served on various juries and commissions, especially grand juries. For several years Delano was appointed surveyor and resided in Duxbury by 1639. In 1641 Philip Delano deposed that he was about thirty-six years old. Delano was on the 1662 list of first-born children to get land at Middleborough.  Family  The number of children that Philip Delano had is not certain, their birth years or which of his two wives bore them. The following is the current estimate:Robert Charles Anderson, Pilgrim Village Family Sketch: Philip Delano (a collaboration between American Ancestors and New England Historic Genealogical Society) Philip married: 1\\\\. Hester Dewsbery/Dewsbury on December 19, 1634 in Plymouth. She died between 1648 and 1653. Her burial place is unknown. 2\\\\. Mary (Pontus) Glass, widow of James, sometime between September 3, 1652 (death of James Glass) and December 3, 1659. Her father was William Pontus, died before March 4, 1652/53. Her burial place is unknown.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 281, 339 Children attributed to Philip and Hester Delano: * Mary was born about 1635 and died childless.

He married Elizabeth Sampson about 1670 and had five children. * Thomas was born about 1639 and died in Duxbury on April 13, 1723. He married Rebecca Alden by 1667 and had nine children. It was known that Thomas married a daughter of Mayflower passenger John Alden, but which daughter has been controversial, although believed to be Rebecca. They witnessed a deed as ‚ÄúThomas De Lano‚Äù and ‚ÄúRebecca De Lano‚Äù. Thomas Delano and his wife were both buried in Myles Standish Burying Ground, Duxbury, Mass. * Esther was born about 1641. She was not named in her father‚Äôs estate and may have been deceased by then (1681). * John was born about 1644 and died in Duxbury after September 5, 1721. He married Mary Weston by about 1679 and had six children. * Jonathan was born about 1648 and died in Dartmouth on December 28, 1720. He married Mercy Warren on February 28, 1677/78 and had thirteen children. Mercy was a granddaughter of Mayflower passenger Richard Warren. Jonathan Delano and his wife were both buried in Acushnet Cemetery, Acushnet, Mass. Children attributed to Philip and Mary Delano: * Jane was born about 1655. She was living at the settlement of her father‚Äôs estate in 1682. There is no further information. * Rebecca was born about 1657 and died in Plymouth on April 7, 1709. She married John Churchill on December 28, 1686 and had five children. She was buried at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Mass. * Samuel was born about 1659 and died in Duxbury before August 9, 1728.

Samuel and his wife Elizabeth were both buried in Myles Standish Burying Ground, Duxbury, Mass. * (a daughter) was born about 1661. Nothing further is known about her birth and is based on the wording of various bequests in Philip‚Äôs will.  Death and burial of Philip Delano  Philip Delano died in Duxbury, Massachusetts between August 22, 1681 (date of memorandum serving as will) and March 4, 1681/2 (date of inventory). Per the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society, there are no records of his burial place. But it is likely that he was buried in the Myles Standish Burying Ground in Duxbury as he was a member of the church there and many of his descendants were buried there.  His estate and heirs  On July 5, 1682 Philip Delano‚Äôs sons Thomas and Samuel (Samuel being called the only son of the second wife) agreed to follow what they knew to be the intent of their father, now deceased, for the distribution of his estate; his other children sharing the estate being John, Jane, Rebecca and Philip.

Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter editor, 2005, , p. 308 It was largely a continuation of the Hamburgische Entreprise, whose dramaturge was Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and whose main owner was Seyler. The Seyler theatrical company became one of the most famous theatrical companies of Europe in the 18th century, attracting some of Germany's leading actors, playwrights and composers. It originally comprised around 60 members, including an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. Between 1777 and 1778 Seyler employed some 230 actors, singers and musicians. The company was originally (from 1769) contracted by the Hanoverian court with performing at Hanover and other cities of the kingdom. The company would eventually perform all across Germany, and performed for three years at the Weimar Schlosstheater, invited by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel. When Anna Amalia succeeded in engaging the Seyler Company, this was \\"an extremely fortunate coup. The Seyler Company was the best theatre company in Germany at that time.\\"\\"Herzogin Anna Amalie von Weimar und ihr Theater,\\" in Robert Keil (ed.), Goethe's Tagebuch aus den Jahren 1776‚Äì1782, Veit, 1875, p. 69 The company had an important role in the development of German opera in the late 18th century. A number of plays were written for the Seyler theatrical company. For example, the play Sturm und Drang (which gave its name to the Sturm und Drang period) was written originally for the company by Friedrich Maximilian Klinger (Goethe's childhood friend), then employed as its playwright, and first performed in 1777. In 1789, Abel Seyler's wife, the celebrated actress Friederike Sophie Seyler, published the Singspiel H√ºon und Amande, that was plagiarized by the troupe of Emanuel Schikaneder and also greatly influenced The Magic Flute.Peter Branscombe, W.

Opened as the Louisville Medical Institute in 1837, it is one of the oldest medical schools in North America and the 9th oldest in the United States. University of Louisville researchers achieved the first implantation of the first fully self-contained artificial heart, the first successful hand transplant in the world, the first five hand transplants in the United States and nine hand transplants in eight recipients as of 2008, the first discovery of embryonic-like stem cells in adult human bone marrow, and the first proof that adult nasal stem cells can grow to become other types of cells. In 2013, U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Louisville School of Medicine #76 in research in its annual list of Best Medical Schools in the United States. The school offers several dual degree programs including MD/MS, MD/MA, MD/MBA, MD/MPH, and MD/PhD degrees. For the 2017 entering class, 162 students enrolled in the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) program. In May 2013, Dr. Toni M. Ganzel was selected as the next dean of the School of Medicine. History =Louisville Medical Institute= By the early 1830s, Louisville had become a center for inland transportation into the United States. Seeking to develop cultural institutions, citizens (notably town trustee and future United States Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie) called for a medical school to be founded in Louisville. The city government appropriated funds for a new medical school at Eighth and Chestnut Streets. Much of the Louisville Medical Institute's early faculty came from Transylvania Medical Institute in Lexington, Kentucky. Theodore Stout Bell, a prominent physician at Transylvania Medical Institute, helped initiate this faculty transfer by suggesting that Louisville would have better clinical cadavers for medical study than Lexington. Classes at the Louisville Medical Institute began in temporary quarters in fall 1837, eventually moving to a building designed by Kentucky architect Gideon Shryock eight months later. Clinical teaching took part in the wards of Louisville City Hospital (now University Hospital). By the early 1840s, University of Louisville School of Medicine had become a distinguished center for medical education, attracting students from a wide variety of locations in the southern and western United States. University of Louisville Health Sciences Campus =University of Louisville Medical Department= In 1846, by ruling of the Kentucky Legislature, the Louisville Medical Institute became the Medical Department of the newly founded University of Louisville. Many notably physicians and researchers became affiliated with the medical department, including Daniel Drake, Charles Wilkins Short, J. Lawrence Smith, Benjamin Silliman, and David Wendell Yandell. In the early 1950s, Grace Marilynn James joined the faculty of the University of Louisville School of Medicine as the first African American women on staff towards ending racial segregation in Louisville area hospitals and medical professional organizations. Health Sciences Center The 1960s saw a period of major growth in the University of Louisville Medical Department. University officials began construction of a Health Sciences Center, where health-related study and research would take place and the School of Medicine would be located. The Health Sciences Center included a 120,000-square-foot Medical-Dental Research Building (opened in 1963), new buildings to house the medical and dental schools, a library, and laboratory buildings. Vice President for health affairs Harold Boyer oversaw state appropriation of funds for the construction of a new teaching hospital and ambulatory care center. In 1997, the Kentucky General Assembly approved House Bill 1, also known as the Higher Education Reform Act. It included the mandate that the University of Louisville become a premier metropolitan research university by 2020. Today, the Health Sciences Center features over 200,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research facilities, a standardized patient clinic and one of the largest academic medical simulation centers in the United States. There are five hospitals within walking distance of the Health Sciences Center campus, with the VA Hospital 5 minutes away, where students perform their clinical rotations. The Louisville Medical Center serves more than 500,000 patients each year: * James Graham Brown Cancer Center * Jewish Hospital & St. Mary's Healthcare * Norton Healthcare  Norton Children's Hospital  Norton Hospital & Norton Healthcare Pavilion * University of Louisville Hospital ‚Äì Louisville * VA Medical Center ‚Äì Louisville Innovations Throughout its history, the University of Louisville School of Medicine has been a pioneer in terms of modern medical practice and surgical procedure. Notably, the University of Louisville housed the world's first emergency room, opened in 1911 and developed by surgeon Arnold Griswold in the 1930s. Griswold also developed autotransfusion, the process by which a person receives their own blood for a transfusion rather than banked donor blood. In 1998, Dr. Roberto Bolli led a U of L team that identified an intracellular molecule that could protect the heart from ischemic myocardial damage. This group presented its findings to 40,000 cardiologists at the 1998 American Heart Association (AHA) conference. Dr. Bolli also headed a U of L team that was awarded an $11.7 million grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute‚Äîpart of the National Institutes of Health‚Äîto continue to build on this research in 2005, marking the largest nationally competitive NIH grant awarded to the university. NIH reviewers rated the proposed research program as exceedingly innovative and potentially high-impact, noting that it addresses an extremely important clinical problem in a way that will move treatments from the laboratory to the patient as quickly as possible. Using highly unusual language, the reviewers called the proposal \\"a paradigm of what a program project grant should be.\\" Dr Bolli was the lead author on the SCIPIO trial testing the effects of stem cells in heart failure. The resulting paper was retracted by The Lancet for data falsification, He is or has been on the editorial board of all major cardiovascular journals and was the Editor in Chief of Circulation Research, a post from which he was dismissed for making homophobic comments He has been a member of numerous NIH study sections and committees and is a member of the NHLBI Advisory Council. He also serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the American Heart Association. Surgeons from the University of Louisville in cooperation with the Kleinert and Kutz Hand Care Center and Jewish Hospital performed the first five hand transplants in the United States. The Hand Center performed one of the world's first cross-hand replantations, first reported repair of the digital arteries, first bilateral upper arm replantation, first bilateral forearm replantation, first reported successful technique for primary flexor tendon repair, and first vascularized epiphyseal transfer. This center has pioneered work in primary reconstruction using free tissue transfer. The Christine M. Kleinert Institute hand surgery fellowship program is one of the top fellowships in the world for hand and microsurgery. In 2001, University of Louisville and Jewish Hospital physicians and researchers, Drs. Laman A. Gray, Jr. and Robert D. Dowling, performed the world's first implantation of the AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart on July 2, in a seven-hour procedure at Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. University of Louisville cardiothoracic surgeons have performed many other novel procedures, including Kentucky's first heart transplant, the world's first heart transplant following the use of a Thoratec left ventricular assist device, the world's first endoscopic saphenous vein harvest and the first ventricular remodeling in the region. The James Graham Brown Cancer Center, an affiliate of Kentucky One Health and University of Louisville School of Medicine, has made several discoveries that have brought the center international attention. These discoveries include: * First description of Very Small Embryonic-like Stem Cells  These \\"embryonic-like\\" stem cells, which are isolated from bone marrow, will revolutionize clinical applications of stem cells and further the understanding of cancer metastasis * First development of a tobacco-based cancer vaccine  Drs. A. Bennett Jenson and Shin-je Ghim, innovators of the world's first 100% effective cancer vaccine have begun work to develop a less expensive vaccine with an increased spectrum of activity. This vaccine will be produced in tobacco plants, one of Kentucky's abundant crops. * First clinical use of G-rich oligonucleotide adptamer therapy for cancer  Drs. Trent and Bates discovered a new growth inhibitor activity of G-rich oligonucleotides which have proved effective in early phase clinical trials with no toxicity noted in humans. The drug, AS1411, is now in Phase II clinical trials. * First atomic-level study of lung cancer metabolism in human patients  Scientists in the Structural Biology Program have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to follow glucose metabolized by patients with lung cancer to demonstrate differences between normal and malignant lung tissue * First use of digoxin to enhance the effects of chemotherapy in lung cancer  James Graham Brown Cancer researchers used laboratory findings to design a clinical trial in which the cardiac drug, digoxin, is used as a supplement of chemotherapy treatment. Early results from the trial suggested the treatment will result in the highest response rate for melanoma ever reported. * First use of beta-glucan as an immunostimulant for human cancer therapy  Brown Cancer researchers, led by Dr. Gordon Ross, discovered that beta-glucan can markedly enhance the immune response of mice to injected tumors. This treatment is now being tested for the first time in humans at the University of Louisville and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. * First use of colored berries to prevent cancer in high risk individuals  Dr. Ramesh Gupta is the first to show that colored berries can prevent the development of cancer in animals and is preparing the first human clinical trial using this approach. Brown Cancer Center scientists have developed three novel cancer treatments that are in early phase trials. Additionally, at least twenty-seven new drugs or targets which are in various stages of preclinical testing have also been developed. These treatments mark one of the most robust pipelines of any cancer center in the world. Accordingly, a biotech company partially owned by the University of Louisville/Brown Cancer Center, Advanced Cancer Therapeutics, has been initiated to ensure drugs are developed locally and quickly. The goal of the cancer center is to achieve National Cancer Institute designation, a goal they are on track to receive in the near future. Students The general applicant pool has become increasingly more competitive. Kentucky residents are selected for 120 of the approximately 155 seats in the School of Medicine program each year. Out of state seats are awarded to those with superior academic achievement, MCAT scores, research, community service and/or ties to Kentucky.

His work has been recognized with two Pulitzer Prizes. Career  He was given the 2003 Bob Consadine Award for best interpretation of international affairs in a newspaper by the Overseas Press Club of America, for his articles about proliferation threats. In September 2002, Warrick was one of the first journalists to publish reports casting doubt on the Bush administration's claims that aluminum tubes discovered in Iraq were appropriate for use in uranium centrifuges. A February, 2013 report by Warrick about ceramic ring magnets which Iran made an effort to procure was criticized by scientists for the report's assertion that the magnets were specially suited for nuclear fuel enrichment. Warrick responded that despite other possible uses for the magnets, the large number of them that Iran attempted to obtain was consistent with public declarations Iran had made to the International Atomic Energy Agency about its intent to increase its number of operating centrifuges. Warrick is the author of \\"The Triple Agent\\", a narrative culminating in the December 30, 2009, Camp Chapman attack in Afghanistan, which resulted in the murder of seven CIA employees by a suicide bomber.

Originally airing on NBC, the film is based on a true storyReview Summary The New York Times and stars Melissa Gilbert as a woman who seeks justice after being raped by an acquaintance. Plot When she moves from Idaho to Venice, Los Angeles because of a new job offer, Emily Briggs (Gilbert) quickly meets Jason Barnes (Valentine), a friendly neighbor who works as a set decorator for movies. He invites her to his home in Santa Monica to pick up an old table which she can use at her new place, though abuses the meeting to rape her. Emily unsuccessfully struggles to get away, and fears for her life throughout the rape. Her cousin Marty (Bernard) insists for her to report the case, but the District Attorney denies the case because she voluntarily went to his house, and there were no witnesses present. The fact that he was arrested five times before with the same allegations does not influence the case. Emily tries to move on with her life, but finds out that she is not able to share intimacy with her boyfriend Trey Cousins (Tubb). Sometime later, Emily receives a visit from a woman named Marcia Daily (Riker), who tells her that she was raped by Jason as well, and that all of the women were stalked by him afterwards as a way of power control. Marcia tells her that an attorney named Gloria Allred (Neuwirth) can make a case of the rape if they combine powers, but Emily is reluctant to go to court. Emily later admits to being raped to Trey, when he overhears her conversation with Marcia. Trey is upset that she went to a stranger's house and estranges from her by claiming that she was asking for the rape. He tries to avoid doing harm to Jason out of anger, but eventually runs him over with his car. Aware that her fianc√© is facing a prison sentence, Emily turns to Gloria for help. Gloria agrees to take on his case, and takes Emily's rape story to the media in hopes of influencing the jury. Trey is reluctant to allow Emily's rape to become a national sensation, but the story is printed anyway on Emily's insistence. In court, Trey is sentenced to 36 months of probation, as well as getting a restraining order against Jason's residence and having to pay for his medical expenses. He is too overwhelmed with the case and its media attention, and Emily leaves him when he admits that he is too distressed with his own problems to support her with recovering from the rape. Meanwhile, a young woman named Claire Sugarman (McCullough) steps forward to being raped by Jason as well, which enables Gloria to make a case. Emily is reluctant to go court yet again, until she grows determined to prove to everyone that she was not lying about being raped. Trey visits her in hopes of a reconciliation, but Emily tells him that she honestly does not think that he believes that she was raped. During the trial against Jason, Emily is being battered while on the stand on being promiscuous. Their attorney hopes to break Jason by confronting him of having lied to the police about knowing Emily, though Jason lies himself out of the situation, endangering the case for Emily. Trey, convinced of regaining Emily's affection, sets out for himself to prove that Jason is guilty, and meets with Jason's neighbor Pete Raymond (Hobbs), who can serve as a witness. Emily is touched by Trey's actions, especially due to the fact that he ignored his restraining order in her sake. After Pete tells in court that Emily left his place shocked and battered, in torn clothes, Jason breaks and admits to the crime. He is sentenced to 10 years in jail, and Emily now reconciled with Trey, receives $5 million in damages.

It can be a decorative architectural element, or a combined ornamented structural item. It is often found over portals, doors, windows and fireplaces. In the case of windows, the bottom span is instead referred to as a sill, but, unlike a lintel, does not serve to bear a load to ensure the integrity of the wall. Modern day lintels are made using prestressed concrete and are also referred to as beams in beam and block slabs or ribs in rib and block slabs. These prestressed concrete lintels and blocks are components that are packed together and propped to form a suspended floor concrete slab. Structural uses In worldwide architecture of different eras and many cultures, a lintel has been an element of post and lintel construction. Many different building materials have been used for lintels. In classical Western architecture and construction methods, by Merriam-Webster definition, a lintel is a load-bearing member and is placed over an entranceway. Called an architrave, the lintel is a structural element that is usually rested on stone pillars or stacked stone columns, over a portal or entranceway. An example from the Mycenaean Greece cultural period (c. 1600 ‚Äì 1100 BCE) is the Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae, Greece. It weighs 120 tons, with approximate dimensions 8.3 √ó 5.2 √ó 1.2 m, one of the largest in the world. A lintel may support the chimney above a fireplace, or span the distance of a path or road, forming a stone lintel bridge. Ornamental carved lintel over Mandapa entrance at Chennakesava Temple, in the Hoysala architecture tradition of southern India Ornamental uses The use of the lintel form as a decorative building element over portals, with no structural function, has been employed in the architectural traditions and styles of most cultures over the centuries. Examples of the ornamental use of lintels are in the hypostyle halls and slab stelas in ancient Egypt and the Indian rock-cut architecture of Buddhist temples in caves. Preceding prehistoric and subsequent Indian Buddhist temples were wooden buildings with structural load-bearing wood lintels across openings. The rock-cut excavated cave temples were more durable, and the non- load-bearing carved stone lintels allowed creative ornamental uses of classical Buddhist elements. Highly skilled artisans were able to simulate the look of wood, imitating the nuances of a wooden structure and the wood grain in excavating cave temples from monolithic rock. In freestanding Indian building examples, the Hoysala architecture tradition between the 11th and 14th centuries produced many elaborately carved non-structural stone lintels in the Southern Deccan Plateau region of southern India. The Hoysala Empire era was an important period in the development of art and architecture in the South Indian Kannadigan culture. It is remembered today primarily for its Hindu temples' mandapa, lintels, and other architectural elements, such as at the Chennakesava Temple. The Maya civilization in the Americas was known for its sophisticated art and monumental architecture. The Mayan city of Yaxchilan, on the Usumacinta River in present-day southern Mexico, specialized in the stone carving of ornamental lintel elements within structural stone lintels. The earliest carved lintels were created in 723 CE. At the Yaxchilan archaeological site there are fifty-eight lintels with decorative pieces spanning the doorways of major structures. Among the finest Mayan carving to be excavated are three temple door lintels that feature narrative scenes of a queen celebrating the king's anointing by a god. Radiation protection Lintels may also be used to reduce scattered radiation in medical applications. For example, Medical linacs operating at high energies will produce activated neutrons which will be scattered outside the treatment bunker maze with a dose rate that depends on the maze cross section. Lintels may be visible or recessed in the roof of the facility, and reduce dose rate in publicly accessible areas by reducing the maze cross section.

Rajp is a right-arm off-spin bowler and a right handed batsman. Rajp currently represents the United States national cricket team. Career =Early Years= Rajp was born in Ludhiana, Punjab, India. Along with being primarily a right-handed off-spinner he is also a handy batsman. He started playing cricket professionally at an early age and represented his city Ludhiana at the U-14 and U-16 district levels. Later, Rajp, who was 14 at the time, along with his family moved to the United States of America in the year 2000. Rajp, quickly took over the Under-19 cricket scene in the USA and became one of the All-stars of the country by 2004. Soon after, he was labelled as one to watch for the future by various critics in the USA cricket circuit. =Under-19 career= Rajp captained the Southern California Cricket Association's Under-19 team from its creation in 2002 till 2006. He was also the captain of USA's South West Region Under-19 team from 2004 to 2006, which participates in the annual USA National Under-19 Tournaments. He was part of the first generation of USA cricketers in the Under-19 structure of USA that started with the first Under-19 National Tournament in 2004. Rajp went on to make the national under-19 team in 2005. Rajp first represented the United States national cricket team at the ICC Americas Under-19 Championship in 2005 against Canada, Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Argentina. Rajp was particularly successful against Bermuda, taking 5 for 7, due to which Bermuda was all out for a rather small target of 87 and USA coasted to victory by eight wickets. The very next day, Rajp took another five-for (5 for 45), against Argentina in a seven-wicket victory before USA registered its final victory of the tour against Cayman Islands to seal a sweep of the tournament and made history by clinching a spot in the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time, in Sri Lanka. At that tournament, Rajp became the first American cricketer to become the MVP of any U-19 tournament involving USA. He grabbed the best bowler of the tournament and two man of the match awards. Rajp ended the tournament with a tournament-high 11 wickets in four games and marked his arrival. Rajp's first major test came in the form of the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka, in which he was promoted to be the vice- captain of the United States Under-19 cricket team due to his performances at the ICC Americas Under-19 Championship and National Under-19 Tournaments. He had a successful World Cup campaign and finished the tournament as one of the leading wicket takers for the US and also landed himself in the top 10 wicket takers for the entire tournament, in number of wickets taken. His most notable performance came against an ICC full-member nation, New Zealand, when he took the first (and the only till date) five-wicket haul for the USA against a full member nation. United States of America Cricket Association's administration problems soon after the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup resulted in a two- year ban imposed by cricket's governing body, International Cricket Council. Rajp's name slowly faded away on the national circuit and was off the radar for the next few years before making his resurgence in 2010. =USA Domestic Cricket= Rajp has been one of the top players in the USA domestic cricket circuit for a number of years. He plays in the Southern California Cricket Association, which is based in Los Angeles, California and represents the South West Region in USA National Cricket Tournaments. He has had a good showing in domestic tournaments with the most recent being the best bowler at the 2010 Western Conference, where he also created a national level record, which stands till date, for taking 7 wickets in one innings, at a national tournament game against the Central East region. Later he went on to become the best bowler for the second time in a calendar year and this time it was at the 2010 United States Senior National tournament. Following solid domestic performances, and a good Under-19 record at the highest level, Rajp, was called for national trials in 2012 to earn a spot in the United States national cricket team. He would later go one to make the USA National Squad in 2012. =International career= Rajp made his debut in 2012 when he was selected as to be a part of the United States national cricket team at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE in March 2012. He debuted in style against Italy when he took a wicket with his very first delivery and scored an unbeaten 14 runs off 9 balls in a match that USA lost by 8 runs. Rajp had a very successful debut tournament, finishing at the top in the wickets department for his team and in the top ten on the list of highest wicket takers for the entire tournament (in number of wickets taken). Following his performances with the ball he was also the one of the best fielder in his team, with team high 6 catches, and finished the tournament in the Top Three (in amount of fielding dismissals). Awarding his success at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, his debut tour for the Senior national team, the selectors picked Rajp as one of the members of the United States national cricket team for the 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four which took place from 3 to 10 September 2012 in Malaysia. The United States national cricket team was successful in gaining promotion to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three to be held in Bermuda from 28 April to 5 May 2013. Rajp, who once again finished as one of the top wicket takers for USA in the Twenty20 however, was not chosen to be a part of that team traveling to Bermuda for Division Three, 50 over format, Following a spree of changes in the USA Squad after the team's successful triumph in the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Americas Region Twenty20 Division One where USA swept the whole tournament to gain qualification for the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE. Rajp again finished as one of the top wicket takes for USA in that tournament as well. Later in 2013, Rajp traveled with the USA Squad to Toronto, Canada for the 2013 edition of the Auty Cup (annual fixture vs Canada) and was hailed by critics as one of the stand out performers for the USA. Although, his aggressive bowling as not enough for the USA to win the Auty Cup title, it surely helped his case to become a regular fixture in the USA squad.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, O'Grady was the leading Irish trainer at Cheltenham (after Vincent O'Brien) by number of winners. Early life O'Grady left veterinary college in Dublin to take over at Killen Stables following his father's death in 1973. His father, Willie, was a top jump jockey and twice Irish Champion Jockey in 1934 and 1935. O'Grady had his first winner when Timmy Hyde saddled Vibrax in a Handicap Hurdle in Gowran Park. Following this success a virus struck all of his 18 horses causing many owners to leave him. In 1974 O‚ÄôGrady had his first Cheltenham Festival winner when Mouse Morris rode Mr. Midland to victory. 1970s and 80s In 1974 Gay Future, a horse trained by O'Grady, was involved in an attempted coup by an Irish betting syndicate in 1974. O'Grady was one of four people arrested during the police investigation but the charges against him were dropped. O'Grady soon became established as the leading national hunt trainer in Ireland, and Golden Cygnet became the stable star. O'Grady named Golden Cygnet as the most naturally talented horse he had trained. Golden Cygnet won the Supreme Novice Hurdle in Cheltenham in 1978. The following month he died after a fall in the Scottish Champion Hurdle at Ayr. Further tragedy struck the stable when the J.P. McManus owned Shining Flame broke a leg at Tramore Racecourse less than two weeks after capturing the Galway Plate. Nevertheless, O'Grady went on to become leading trainer in 1979. Following Shining Flame's victory in 1978 O'Grady went on to win three Galway Plates in four years, with Hind Hope and Rugged Lucy winning in 1979 and 1981 respectively. Hard Tarquin's victory in the 1979 Galway Hurdle made him only the fifth trainer to win both \\"big races\\" in the same year. Drumlargan won the 1983 Whitbread Gold Cup, which O'Grady described as \\"the most memorable win of my career\\". In the same year Bit of a Skite proved victorious in the Irish Grand National. 1990s and 2000s Sound Man won two successive Tingle Creek Chases (1995 and 1996), and Blitzkrieg captured the Victor Chandler Chase in 1991. Sacundai, with Ruby Walsh aboard, captured the Martell Cognac Aintree Hurdle in 2003. In the same year, Back in Front won the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham and the Evening Herald Novice Hurdle at Punchestown. More recent success came in 2009 when Tranquil Sea ridden by Andrew McNamara became the first Irish- trained horse since Bright Highway in 1980 to win the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham. Family O'Grady married in 1999. His wife Maria was killed in a fall while out hunting with the Tipperary Foxhounds in November 2017.

It tells the story of handful of people working in an old fashioned circus under the rule of Magnus, a puppeteer who strings up human beings as living marionettes and controls their every move. Christ (Clarence Mitchell) is represented as a clown dressed in white, riding atop a donkey. The clown travels around the circus helping people with their problems and gaining followers until he finally takes the place of Magnus's human puppets and is strung up and murdered. Transformed by the clown's sacrifice, Magnus smears his face with white greasepaint and takes the clown's place on the donkey as Christ resurrected.

Upon the introduction of silent movies, Biblical films, like The Passion Play of Oberammergau of 1898 which was based on the 1634 Oberammergau Passion Play, From the Manger to the Cross in 1912, and Cecil B DeMille‚Äôs King of Kings in 1927 helped to make Bible stories a popular cinematic subject. Other Christian films that were non-biblical in nature included Missionary movies, and Evangelical ministry films.http://forsbergfilm.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/communism-and-the-rise-of- christian-influence-in-american-political-mass-media/ During the early 20th Century many of America's ministers and Christian religious leaders condemned Hollywood as a ‚Äúcesspool‚Äù, saying that watching movies was a sin. During the 1960s a small corner of Christian filmmaking underwent a transformation from presenting static lectures, proselytizing, and presenting \\"sentimental\\" treatments of Bible stories, to becoming art films meant to evoke personal revelations about God in the viewer. Rolf Forsberg‚Äôs Parable was one such film, portraying Christ as a clown and the world as a circus. Recognition The film gained artistic accolades at its premiere in the Protestant Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair In the years that followed, Parable won numerous awards including a Gold Lion from the Venice International Film Festival, a Hugo from the Chicago International Film Festival, and a citation from Cannes.interview with Rolf Forsberg This helped set the stage for a movement in Christian filmmaking that would strive to connect to the viewers on an artistic level instead of simply preaching. Four years later, Parable was featured in the Christian pavillon at the Montreal permanent fair \\"Man and His World\\" during the summer of 1968. Less than a decade after Parable was released, the figure of Christ portrayed as a clown was reprised in the musical Godspell, which the author said was inspired by the film Parable. Rolf Forsberg continued to make artistically inspired Christian films until he teamed up with Hal Lindsey in 1978 to write and direct the dramatic sequences in the apocalyptic movie The Late Great Planet Earth, which became one of the top-grossing films to back up their predication. In response to numerous inquries for the film, it was re-released by EcuFilm on the movie's 40th anniversary in 2004. In 2012, \\"Parable\\" was inducted into the National Film Registry of The Library of Congress as a historic film that helped to shape American culture.https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2012/12-226.html See also *List of American films of 1964 References Notes  External links  *Parable essay by Mark Quigley on the National Film Registry website * Category:1964 films Category:American films Category:1964 drama films Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:American independent films Category:American short films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on the Gospels Category:Films shot in Wisconsin Category:World's fair films Category:1964 New York World's Fair ","title":"Parable (film)"},{"id":"36649063","text":"Techonomy 2010 Techonomy Media Inc. is an American conference and media company founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York, NY.

The term has its origin in the 12th-century Georgian chronicle and is accepted in the modern scholarship of Georgia. The Seljuq invasions resulted in a severe crisis in the kingdom of Georgia, leaving several of its provinces depopulated and weakening the royal authority, until the tide was reversed by the military victories of King David IV of Georgia (r. 1089‚Äì1125). Background The Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the Sultan Alp Arslan laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced Kakheti. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the Byzantine army at Manzikert in 1071. Although the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion, the Byzantine withdrawal from Anatolia brought them in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. In the 1070s, Georgia was twice attacked by the Sultan Malik Shah I, but the Georgian King George II was still able to fight back at times. Invasion Sultan Malik Shah In 1080, George II was surprised, in the vicinity of Queli, by a large Turkish force led by A·∏•mad, probably of the MamlƒÅn dynasty, whom the Georgian chronicle calls \\"a powerful emir and strong archer\\". George was put to flight, through Adjara, to Abkhazia. The Turks conquered Kars from the Georgians and returned to their bases laden with wealth 0This was soon followed by even larger inroads, led by Ya øqub and  øIsƒÅ-B√∂ri. On June 24, 1080, the half-nomadic Turks began to arrive en masse in the southern provinces of Georgia, quickly moving deeper into the country and overrunning Asispori, Klarjeti, Shavsheti, Adjara, Samtskhe, Kartli, Argueti, Samokalako, and Chqondidi. The key towns of Kutaisi and Artanuji and the vibrant Christian hermitages of Klarjeti were all burnt down. Those who survived the fighting had to flee to the mountains, where many of them found their death of cold and starvation. Watching his kingdom being destroyed, George II, in despair, repaired to Isfahan, to Malik Shah, who treated the Georgian monarch with much consideration and promised security from the nomads in exchange of a tribute (kharaj). Results left George's acceptance of the Seljuq suzerainty did not bring a real peace for Georgia. The Turks continued their seasonal movement into the Georgian territory to make use of the rich herbage of the Kura valley and the Seljuq garrisons occupied the key fortresses in Georgia's south. These inroads and settlements had a ruinous effect on Georgia's economic and political order. Cultivated lands were turned into pastures for the nomads and peasant farmers were compelled to seek safety in the mountains. The contemporary Georgian chronicler laments that \\"in those times there was neither sowing nor harvest. The land was ruined and turned into forest; in place of men beasts and animals of the field made their dwelling there. Insufferable oppression fell on all the inhabitants of the land; it was unparalleled and far worse than all ravages heard of or experienced.\\" A similar situation was found in neighboring Armenia as related in Aristakes Lastivertsi's chronicle. To make the things worse, a severe earthquake struck the southern provinces of Georgia, devastating Tmogvi and the surrounding area on April 16, 1088. The great nobles of Georgia capitalized on weakening of the royal power to promote their autonomy. George II attempted to make use of Malik Shah's favor to bend Aghsartan I, the recalcitrant king of Kakheti in eastern Georgia, into submission, but failed to achieve any result due largely to his contradictory actions. Aghsartan was able to outplay him by offering submission to Malik Shah and buy security by converting to Islam. Aftermath Coin of George II, 1081-1089 Such was the situation in Georgia, when, in 1089, George II chose to put the crown‚Äîor was forced to do so by his nobles‚Äîon the head of his 16-year- old son David IV. This energetic young ruler was able to capitalize on the disorder in the Seljuq empire following Malik Shah's death in 1092 and the arrival of the First Crusade in the Middle East in 1096 and embarked on a systematic campaign aimed at curbing the aristocratic opposition and expelling the Seljuqs from his kingdom. By 1099, the year when Jerusalem fell to the Crusaders, David felt strong enough to withhold annual tribute paid to the Seljuqs. A string of military successes over the regional successors of the Seljuq empire was concluded by a major victory over the Muslim armies at Didgori in 1121, which made the Georgian kingdom a formidable power in the Caucasus and East Anatolia.

She is noted for having been one of the most prominent Iranian artists of the contemporary period, and she was the first artist to achieve an artistic practice that weds the geometric patterns and cut-glass mosaic techniques (ƒÄina-kƒÅri) of her Iranian heritage with the rhythms of modern Western geometric abstraction. In 2017, the Monir Museum in Tehran, Iran was opened in her honor. Early life and education  Shahroudy was born on December 18, 1922, to educated parents in the religious town of Qazvin in north-western Iran. Farmanfarmaian acquired artistic skills early on in childhood, receiving drawing lessons from a tutor and studying postcard depictions of western art. After studying at the University of Tehran at the Faculty of Fine Art in 1944, she then moved to New York City via steamboat, when World War II derailed her plans to study art in Paris. In New York, she studied at Cornell University, at Parsons The New School for Design, where she majored in fashion illustration, and at the Art Students League. Career As a fashion illustrator, she held various freelance jobs, working with magazines such as Glamour before being hired by the Bonwit Teller department store, where she made the acquaintance of a young Andy Warhol. Additionally, she learned more about art through her trips to museums and through her exposure to the 8th Street Club and New York's avant- garde art scene, becoming friends with artists and contemporaries Louise Nevelson, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, and Joan Mitchell. =First return to Iran= In early 1957, Farmanfarmaian moved back to Iran. Inspired by the resident culture, she discovered \\"a fascination with tribal and folk artistic tradition\\" of her country's history, which \\"led her to rethink the past and conceive a new path for her art.\\" In the following years, she would further develop her Persian inspiration by crafting mirror mosaics and abstract monotypes. Meanwhile her work was featured at the Iran Pavilion in the 1958 Venice Biennale, and holding a number of exhibitions in places such as Tehran University (1963), the Iran-America Society (1973), and the Jacques Kaplan/Mario Ravagnan Gallery (1974). = Exile and return to Iran = In 1979, Farmanfarmaian and her second husband, Abol-Bashar, traveled to New York to visit family. Around the same time, the Islamic Revolution began, and so the Farmanfarmaians found themselves exiled from Iran, an exile that would last for over twenty years. Farmanfarmaian attempted to reconcile her mirror mosaics with the limited resources offered in America, but such lacking materials and comparatively inexperienced workers restricted her work. In the meantime, she placed larger emphasis on other aspects of her art, such as commissions, textile designs, and drawing. =Third return to Iran and death = In 1992, Farmanfarmaian returned to Iran and later, in Tehran in 2004, she reaffirmed her place among Iran's art community, gathering both former and new employees to help create her mosaics. She continued to live and work in Tehran until her death. On 20 April 2019 Farmanfarmaian died at her home at the age of 96.  Artwork  Aside from her mirror work (a technique known as ƒÄina- kƒÅri), Farmanfarmaian is additionally known for her paintings, drawings, textile designs, and monotypes. = Mirror mosaics = Around the 1970s, Farmanfarmaian visited the Shah Cheragh mosque in Shiraz, Iran. With the shrine's \\"high-domed hall ... covered in tiny square, triangular, and hexagonal mirrors,\\" similar to many other ancient Iranian mosques, this event acted as a turning point in Farmanfarmaian's artistic journey, leading to her interest in mirror mosaic artwork. In her memoir, Farmanfarmaian described the experience as transformative: > \\"The very space seemed on fire, the lamps blazing in hundreds of thousands > of reflection ... It was a universe unto itself, architecture transformed > into performance, all movement and fluid light, all solids fractured and > dissolved in brilliance in space, in prayer. I was overwhelmed.\\" Aided by the Iranian craftsman, Hajji Ostad Mohammad Navid, she created a number of mosaics and exhibition pieces by cutting mirrors and glass paintings into a multitude of shapes, which she would later reform into constructions which evoked aspects of Sufism and Islamic culture. ƒÄina-kƒÅri is the traditional art of cutting mirrors into small pieces and slivers, placing them in decorative shapes over plaster. This form of Iranian reverse glass and mirror mosaics is a craft traditionally passed on from father to son. Farmanfarmaian, however, was the first contemporary artist to reinvent the traditional medium in a contemporary way. By striving to mix Iranian influences and the tradition of mirror artwork with artistic practices outside of strictly Iranian culture, \\"offering a new way of looking at ancient aesthetic elements of this land using tools that are not limited to a particular geography,\\" Farmanfarmaian was able to express a cyclical conception of spirituality, space, and balance in her mosaics.  Personal life  Farmanfarmaian married Iranian artist Manoucher Yektai in 1950. They divorced in 1953, and in 1957, she returned to Tehran to marry lawyer Abolbashar Farmanfarmaian. In 1991, Abolbashar died of leukemia. She has two daughters, Nima and Zahra. While living in Iran, Farmanfarmaian was also an avid collector. She sought out paintings behind glass, traditional tribal jewelry and potteries, and amassed one of the greatest collections of \\"coffee- house paintings\\" in the country‚Äîcommissioned paintings by folk artists as coffee-house, story-telling murals. The vast majority of her works and her collections of folk art were confiscated, sold or destroyed. Exhibitions Farmanfarmaian's work has been publicly exhibited in museums, including: Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Grand Rapids Art Museum, Leighton House Museum, Haus der Kunst, Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA), Zentrum Paul Klee, Savannah College of Art and Design Museum and more. Her work has been shown in private galleries including The Third Line, Dubai; New York; Grey Art Gallery, New York University; Galerie Denise Rene, Paris and New York; Lower Belvedere, Vienna; and Ota Fine Art, Tokyo. Farmanfarmaian participated in the 29th Bienal de S√£o Paulo (2010); the 6th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art (2009); and the Venice Biennale (1958, 1966 and 2009). In 1958 she received the Venice Biennale, Iranian Pavilion (gold medal) (solo). Suzanne Cotter curated Farmanfarmaian's work for her first large museum retrospective titled 'Infinite Possibility: Mirror Works and Drawings' which was on display at the Serralves Museum (also known as Funda√ß√£o de Serralves) in Porto, Portugal (2014-2015) and then the exhibition travelled to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City (2015). This was her first large US museum exhibition. = Commissioned installations = Major commissioned installations include work for the Queensland Art Gallery (2009), the Victoria and Albert Museum (2006), the Dag Hammerskjod building, New York (1981) and the Niyavaran Cultural Center (1977‚Äì78), as well as acquisitions by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo.  Collections  Farmanfarmaian's work is included in multiple public art collections worldwide, including: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Tate Modern, Queensland Art Gallery, and others. In December 2017, the Monir Museum opened in Negarestan Park Gardens in Tehran, Iran, and is dedicated to showcasing Farmanfarmaian's works. With a collection of 51 works donated by the artist, the Monir Museum collection is managed by the University of Tehran. In popular culture Farmanfarmaian was named as one of the BBC's \\"100 Women\\" of 2015. = Bibliography = Farmanfarmaian's memoir is titled A Mirror Garden: A Memoir was co-authored by Zara Houshmand (Knopf, 2007). Her work is documented in the book, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian: Cosmic Geometry (Damiani Editore & The Third Line, 2011), which features in- depth interview by Hans Ulrich Obrist, and critical essays by Nader Ardalan, Media Farzin and Eleanor Sims, tributes by Farmanfarmaian's friends Etel Adnan, Siah Armajani, caraballo-farman, Golnaz Fathi, Hadi Hazavei, Susan Hefuna, Aziz Isham, Rose Issa, Faryar Javaherian, Abbas Kiarostami, Shirin Neshat, Donna Stein and Frank Stella.

Solar Academy International's first training center, Ontario Solar Academy, was established in 2009 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Entrepreneurs and founders of Solar Academy International, Jacob Travis and David Gower, created the training school in response to demands by solar companies experiencing a shortage in qualified workers within the solar industry, following the surge in interest in solar energy upon the passing of the Ontario Green Energy Act 2009 that led to the creation of the Feed-in Tariff Program. Today, Solar Academy International is the largest training school in Canada, having trained over 700 student graduates, with operations expanding overseas. The school's most popular class is a 5-day intensive course in which students are taught the fundamental basics of the solar industry including aspects of design, sales, and installation by NABCEP-certified installers. Instructors have, in addition to sharing a wealth of field experience and knowledge in best practices, been known to take on students for solar projects, offering practical, paid experience to beginners looking to enter the solar industry. The course concludes with a field trip to a LEED-certified Platinum facility with an operational solar PV system. This intensive course also satisfies the education requirements laid out by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) for the Entry Level Program. Students who have completed the course are eligible to write the NABCEP Entry Level Exam at one of Castle Worldwide's testing facilities by registering through the Academy. Solar Academy International also recently started offering a multiple month internship program for interested applicants to get both knowledge and experience into the solar industry. The internship is tailored to the intern's strengths and interests and offers flexibility in length and scope. Ontario Solar Academy On August 27, 2010, the then-named Ontario Solar Academy was the first solar PV training school in Canada to receive the Institute for Sustainable Power Quality (ISPQ) accreditation by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. ISPQ Accreditation is internationally recognized for having high standards in solar energy education and is awarded to training providers. Enrollment in the course surged upon approval of this accreditation, with many students satisfied with the quality of instruction and comprehensiveness of the introductory course. Course Location Courses in Canada are held at the Franken Solar facilities in Mississauga, Ontario. Past courses have also been held in select cities in the United States. Workshops in Miami and Toronto are slated to take place in December 2014.

Biography Montes was born in San Salvador. He was the son of Rosario Lemus de Montes and Dr. Baltazar Montes, founder of the Hospital Bloom, Medical College of El Salvador and the School of Nursing. As a fourth-year medical student he decided to follow his true passion: music. He began to perform in his native country, Guatemala and Nicaragua in events organized by Iris Sol, a well known singing instructor in the country at the time. Through his efforts he was able to be accepted into the San Francisco Opera in California. While in San Francisco he met singing master Bellini who saw great potential in the young Rafael and gave him a scholarship to train under him. Under Bellini he was able to perfect his vocal techniques but also received training in composing works, stage performing and singing operas, operettas and zarzuelas. Later, he met Francis Bloem, president of the Beverly Hills performing arts company, who saw his potential and sent him to a singing contest in New Orleans, where Montes won third place. He was pleasantly surprised as he was invited to perform at the 20th anniversary commemoration of the bombing of Pearl Harbor at the Disneyland Hotel in Los Angeles on December 7, 1961. He performed the only musical number, accompanied on piano by Bloem. His later performances took him to various U.S. locations, Argentina and other Latin American countries. In addition to his role as a dramatic tenor, musician, guitarist, composer, voice coach and music teacher he was also the founder of the Opera of El Salvador, which even in its early years boasted 80 members and a group of soloists.

PRARNG is the ground-component of the Puerto Rico National Guard under control of the governor of Puerto Rico, currently Wanda V√°zquez, that performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. History The Puerto Rico National Guard, like the national guards in all 50 states, is a hybrid organization. National guards are ordinarily under the control of state (or, in the case of Puerto Rico, commonwealth) officials, but are organized pursuant to federal statute, and in war time or other emergencies, Guard units may be brought under federal control. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard and Reserve units support USARSO's many multilateral exercises and programs. It is through this integration of the Active Army, National Guard, and Reserves that US Army South [USARSO] can maximize resources to carry its missions. In 1989, Congress authorized federal funding to permit the local National Guards to support drug interdiction and other counter-drug activities. 32 U.S.C. ¬ß 112. Section 112 provided that each state desiring to participate would draw up its own plan subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense. Despite this and other authority over the program granted to the Secretary of Defense, the statute required that the National Guard personnel involved in these operations be under local control and \\"not in Federal service,\\" id. ¬ß 112(c)(1), a requirement apparently designed to mesh with the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1385, limiting the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement purposes. Most National Guard members ordinarily serve only part-time, but there are exceptions. Section 112 itself provided that subject to Secretary of Defense regulations, local National Guard members could, pursuant to a state plan, \\"be ordered to perform full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) of this title for the purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-drug activities.\\" 32 U.S.C. ¬ß 502(f) allows National Guard personnel to be assigned additional duties, apart from ordinary drills and field exercises, with the provision appropriate for \\"pay and allowances.\\" Beginning in 1989, the Puerto Rico National Guard used the federal funds provided under section 112 for a variety of counter-drug projects. In one of the projects, Puerto Rico National Guard personnel assisted the U.S. Customs Service in inspecting cargo containers arriving and leaving Puerto Rico ports and airports. The Puerto Rico National Guard claims to be a direct descendant of the original militia that existed on the Island since the time of the Spanish colonization at the beginning of the 16th century. Four years after the militia establishment by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. The Puerto Rican Indians, called Tainos, rebelled in 1511. The Spanish men (mostly farmers and mine workers) had to quit their jobs to take arms and defend their adopted land. Since that unconfirmed date in 1511 when Taino Indians killed Cristobal de Sotomayor and burned the town named in his honor, the Borinquen colonists had to form, by necessity, a sort of National Guard unit with citizens as its soldiers. The Milicias Urbanas de Puerto Rico was first organized in 1693 and reorganized in 1765 as the Milicias Disciplinadas de Puerto Rico. After the Lares Uprising of 1868, the Spanish, doubting the loyalty of Puerto Ricans, began to disband these companies, including the Compania de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. The milicias, are the direct lineal ancestors of two of today's Puerto Rico National Guard Units, the 295th and 296th Infantry. The milicias were replaced in 1871 by another similar organization, El Instituto de Voluntarios. In 1899, the U.S. Congress authorized the establishment of a military unit composed of Puerto Ricans and in 1900 the Porto Rico Battalion was established. Through successive reorganizations this unit became the Porto Rico Voluntary Infantry, The Porto Rican Provisional Regiment of Infantry, the Porto Rico Regiment, U.S. Infantry and finally in 1920, the 65th Regiment, U.S. Infantry. The Puerto Rico National Guard eventually became the 296th Infantry Regiment (\\"Alerta Esta\\" - \\"Always Alert\\"). The Porto Rico Regiment, U.S. Infantry, 4,000 strong, served in World War I. From 1917 to 1919 it guarded the Panama Canal. During this period, the Porto Rico National guard also came into existence with the creation of the 295th and 296th Infantry Regiments. Additionally, several \\"Home Guard\\" units were organized and many other Puerto Ricans living in the continental U.S. served in mainland units that fought in Europe. Dark skinned Puerto Ricans were placed in such racially segregated units as the 396th Infantry, \\"The Harlem Hell Fighters\\" who fought under French command. Rafael Hernandez the famous Puerto Rican musician/composer and his brother, Jesus, served in that unit's band. All told, 236,000 Puerto Ricans registered for the World War I draft and 18,000 served in the military. Although war plans did not call for separate infantry brigades in the United States, the War Department authorized a new 92d Infantry Brigade in the Puerto Rico National Guard to command forces there. The new headquarters came into federal service on 15 October 1940, but served less than two years without seeing combat. In July 1942 the Caribbean Defense Command inactivated the brigade and replaced it with the Puerto Rican Mobile Force It has been estimated that anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 Hispanics served in the armed forces during World War II. This represents a range of 2.5 to 5% of all persons who served during the war. Figures are imprecise because, with the exception of Puerto Ricans, data on Hispanics were not maintained. Over 53,000 Puerto Ricans served during the period 1940-1946. National guard units from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California had a high representation of Mexican Americans. The US Army has never segregated Hispanic soldiers. The Puerto Rico National Guard was called into Federal Active Service in October 1940, and assigned to the Puerto Rican Department in accordance with the existing War Plan Orange. Members of Puerto Rico's National Guard, of the present 65th USA Reserve Command, and of its ancestors, the 65th Infantry Regiment and the 1899 Puerto Rican Regiment US Volunteers, were residents of the archipelago. Approximately 200 Puerto Rican women served in the Women's Army Corps. Puerto Rico Army National Guard (PRARNG) support to the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) is the longest sustained support to a law enforcement mission in modern U.S. history. Targets are drug dealers and other criminal elements. The Puerto Rico National Guard (PRNG) has concentrated on the Homeland Defense [HLD] mission by fighting drug-related crime on the archipelago and providing humanitarian relief to the communities affected by the drug trade. The PRNG concentrates on support to domestic civil authorities, counterdrug operations and humanitarian assistance. During Operation Centurion in 1996, PRNG units and the police moved into 76 housing projects to arrest dealers and criminals and restore community order. Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Rossello created the program to reinforce limited Puerto Rico LEA assets and drive out drug traffickers from housing areas. The secondary objective was to restore normalcy to communities through a coordinated security and social effort. Soldiers from aviation and military police units supported the police in the initial cordon, search, seizure and arrest phase. Once the target area was cleared of identifiable criminal elements, infantry, artillery, engineer and maintenance personnel helped community agencies rebuild housing complexes, distribute antidrug literature, rehabilitate facilities and dispose of garbage. The program was a resounding success, and the PRNG's skills and resources were paramount. Unfortunately, in terms of active force integration, this wealth of operational experience was misdirected. The PRNG applied and exercised MOOTW doctrine, not conventional war-fighting practices. They used valuable training days that could have been used for collective combat training. They also built close cooperation, reinforced habitual relationships and integrated with police and various social agencies-not with AC combat forces. Operation FRONTIER SHIELD was introduced in fiscal year 1997 to test this concept in the maritime approaches to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This region was identified as the second largest gateway, behind the Southwest Border, for drugs entering the United States and provided an emergent opportunity to create an immediate and measurable impact. Operation FRONTIER SHIELD demonstrates the tangible positive impacts of interdiction in Puerto Rico. In 1997, drug related crime was down 37 percent from the year before and the Governor no longer needed the Puerto Rico National Guard to maintain order in the housing areas. On the streets of San Juan cocaine purity went down and street prices rose nearly 36 \`percent throughout 1997. A major Jamaica Defence Force (JDF)-US bilateral training program is the quarterly unit exchange between the Puerto Rico Army National Guard and the 3rd Battalion, Jamaica Regiment (National Reserve). Under this exchange program, platoon-sized elements from each unit \\"trade places\\" for a four-day period and participate in weapons familiarization and other small unit training. The Puerto Rico Army National Guard, America's unique bicultural force, is composed of more than 8,600 citizen-soldiers. During FY99, the PRARNG was recognized as one of the most versatile and best prepared state militias of the United States. FY99 began with troops supporting the Island's communities recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Georges. Soldiers were summoned to perform disaster relief operations and engineering support for road clearance and debris removal. The PRARNG also supported communities using their specialized skills. Medical units provided preventive health care, education, and immunizations in low- income neighborhoods. Guard members served drug and law enforcement agencies through its Counter Drug Program, resulting in the confiscation of millions of dollars in illegal drugs. The PRNG is the only organization in the US conducting all three NGB-sponsored youth programs: STARBASE, Youth Conservation Corps, and Challenge. At the international level, the 113th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment deployed to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador in support of Hurricane Mitch disaster relief. Aviation units provided helicopter support to Joint Task Force Esteli in Nicaragua as part of the US Southern Command Exercise New Horizons '99. The PRARNG also commenced the State Partnership Program with the Republic of Honduras.

Approach road to Bunny Hall The house was originally an Elizabethan red brick house with an 80 foot high tower. The house was rebuilt in 1720 by Thomas Parkyns and now stands in 14.5 acres of formal gardens and parkland. It has been equipped with a cinema room and a leisure area equipped with gymnasium, steam and sauna rooms, a large indoor heated pool and separate Jacuzzi and spa area. There is also a large orangery, drawing room, library and a circular glazed frosted dome allowing light to illuminate the hallway and staircase. The hall is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England. Several buildings and structures associated with the hall are listed Grade II; these include the stable block, an out building to the north, a barn dating from 1734, the carriage archway and barns, and the garden walls and garden outbuildings, and the gate piers and walls around the park. A chest tomb near the hall and the sundial are also Grade II listed. History The manor of Bunny was acquired as a dowry by Richard Parkyns when he married Elizabeth Barlowe in the 1570s and it is believed he built the original hall. Successive generations of the Parkyns family were to live there until 1850. After the civil war the owner at the time, Thomas Parkyns, was elevated to the baronetage in recognition of the family's support for the throne. In 1720 the buildings were greatly renovated by Thomas Parkyn, 2nd Baronet. Further extensive re-modelling of the Hall was carried out between 1826 and 1835. In 1850 the Parkyns lineage failed and the estate was bequeathed to Mrs. Burt, the housekeeper who in turn left it to the Levinge family. He sold the whole estate to Sir Albert Ball, the Mayor of Nottingham who quickly passed it on to the Cordeux‚Ä≤ family. During World War II the estate and hall were bought by Bertie Edwards whose son moved out and renovated the building. It was bought in 2000 by the family of Chek Whyte and in 2009 was for sale at a price in excess of ¬£3 million.

It is found exclusively in South Africa, particularly the Namaqualand region. As with other monkey beetles, blue monkey beetles have characteristically moveable and unequally sized tarsal claws, particularly on the strong hind legs of the males. Males of the species are covered in minute sky-blue scales while the scales of the females are sienna brown. Blue monkey beetles are important pollinators of the Namaqualand region, especially for Mesembryanthemum and some daisy species, on which they primarily feed. Taxonomy Scelophysa trimeni is classified under the genus Scelophysa in the tribe Hopliini of the subfamily Rutelinae in the scarab beetle family Scarabaeidae. It was first described in 1885 by Louis P√©ringuey, a noted French entomologist who was director of the South African Museum for eighteen years. He published his description of the species in the journal of the South African Philosophical Society (now the Royal Society of South Africa). Roland Trimen, another notable entomologist, was a contemporary of P√©ringuey, preceding him as director of the museum, and it is presumed that the specific epithet trimeni is in honour of Trimen. This may be confirmed by the text of P√©ringuey's paper, which is not accessible at present. In 1895, Czech entomologist Anton Franz Nonfried published a description of a new species he called Scelophysa ornatissima in the journal Berliner entomologische Zeitschrift (now Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift). It was later determined to be the same species as S. trimeni and S. ornatissima became a synonym. Morphology Blue monkey beetles are small, usually long and wide. Males and females exhibit little sexual dimorphism in overall body size. Very small scales cover most of the body, including the middle and hind pairs of legs, and excepting the head and anterior legs. The scales in males are bright ultramarine to sky blue dorsally, and the underside scales are more silvery. Female colouring is an overall sienna brown, with a mix of brown and yellow-orange scales, and with darker bands of scales found near the pygidium and propygidium. The black legs bear a few thick black hairs. Dense short greyish to silvery white fine hairs cover the margins of the thorax and abdomen. The tibia of each leg bears a single tibial spur. The tarsal claws are double and unequal, with one weak, slender claw pressed against the larger, stronger claw. The claws of the hind legs are particularly large. In males the hind legs are also more strongly developed than in females, swollen and more robust through the femora, tibiae, and tarsi. Little is recorded on the appearance of the larvae. They are commonly known as white grubs, a general term for the larvae of most scarab beetles. Ecology and behaviour Scelophysa trimeni is endemic to South Africa. This is unsurprising considering that 69% of all monkey beetle species can be found in South Africa, and of them 98% are endemic. S. trimeni prefers the sandy and coastal regions of Namaqualand, such as Knersvlakte and Port Nolloth, respectively. Adult blue monkey beetles are typically found grouped in the centres of unscented flowers that bear dark discs and bright petals with spot patterns at the bases. They feed on the pollen, embedding their heads into the discs and browsing, and sometimes supporting themselves by hooking their hind tarsal claws onto the flower petals. Pollen is swept into the mouth by dense setae on the maxillae. The behavioural tendency to congregate is for mating purposes, and it is suggested that male beetles prefer dark-centred flowers with spot patterns because they mistake the glossy discs and bright spots for resting females. Flowers of the genus Mesembryanthemum are common hosts of S. trimeni, as are many of the African daisy species and some Heliophila. For many of these visited species, monkey beetles are key pollinators, responsible for most of the pollination that takes place. Larvae are presumed to feed in the soil on the debris and roots of plants.

After that time, the building served various uses. Since 1961, the house serves as a museum.  History  = Convent of Sisters = It was in 1445 that Henrik Housteen, who then was the chef of the kitchen of the duke of Kleve, donated to the nuns the house in the millstreet (M√ºhlenstra√üe) in Kranenburg, so that they could found a subsidiary of their convent there. In 1446 the convent moved with the approval of the duke to that house. In 1472 the sisters adopted the Rule of St. Augustine. In 1802 the Katharinen-convent was secularized. = Usage of the building after 1802 = After the convent was closed, the monastery-building served temporarily as a police office and finally was furbished up to be used as a school-building. During the Drittes Reich it was the accommodation of the NSV-kindergarten. NSV stands for Nationalistische Volkswohlfahrt. After the Second World War the building, which was only shopworn, was used as a compensatory church. In 1959/1960 the premises were thoroughly renovated.

Its post office closed in 2005. Mentcle Mine and the coal company patch town of Mentcle was apparently established in the early 1920s by Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which operated the captive Mentcle Mine here. During World War II, the mine and works were leased to the Redlands Coal Company, a commercial operator. Bethlehem Steel resumed operations soon after the war, and operated the Mentcle Mine on an intermittent basis. The Pine Township Company evidently leased the Mentcle Mines at a later date, but operations were shut down permanently about ca.1960. At least thirty-five company owned houses were constructed in the initial years of the mine operations. The town of Mentcle, Pine Township, Indiana County, Pennsylvania consists of approximately thirty frame coal company built houses arranged on either side of highway PA Rt. 553 and a short loop street to the north. The houses and town was built by the Bethlehem Steel Company to houses its miners from the Mentcle Mine. The arrangement is interesting; single family houses are located on the south side of the highway, and double family houses are located across the road, on the north side, facing the single family houses. The handful of houses on the north side loop street may have been managers' housing. All the houses are now privately owned. The single family houses are two stories in height, and of balloon-frame construction. The front-gable houses are built on concrete block foundations and are topped with shingle roofs with brick chimneys near the center of the ridge. Shed porches extend across the front. The double family houses have the long axis facing the street. Doors are located to the sides, and again, a central chimney, serving both units, is located at the center of the gable shingle roof. The Mentcle Mine complex was located to the north and east of the town, across Yellow Creek, along the former Cambria & Indiana Railroad. The tracks of the railroad were being dismantled ca.1993 and salvaged. Three mine buildings survived ca.1993, the miners wash house, a small boiler house, and an airshaft / fanhouse building. The miners wash house is a common-bond brick building, approximately 50 feet x 30 feet, with a lower extension to the west. The building rests on a concrete slab foundation and is topped by a side-gable roof with three round metal roof ventilators. A smaller boiler house is located just east of the miners wash house and connected to the wash house by cast-iron steam pipes; this gable-roof structure has a relatively tall brick chimney at the west end. Some fifty yards to the west of the main buildings is a mine airshaft. This brick and iron building has a shed roof and ca.1993 contained an intact 16 feet diameter metal fan and housing, the fan was used to force air into the workings of the mine. The fan houses was connected to the mine by an airshaft.

The Garhjat Hills is a mountain range formed by a series low lying hills, plateaux, ridges and meadows that stretch into Odisha from the Utkal Plains in the Chotanagpur region of Jharkhand and the Chhattisgarh Plains. The range, also known as the Odisha Highlands, runs in a north east to south west direction for about 382 km along the Odisha coast, covering 76,800 km2. The range rises abruptly and steeply in the east and slopes gently to a dissected plateau in the west running from north-west (Mayurbhanj) to south-west (Malkangiri). The whole area is also marked by intermontane basins which cut across the region in a number of broad and narrow river valleys and flood plains. The average height of the range is about 900 metres above mean sea level.  Etymology and History  Geographically the Garhjat Range is a northward prolongation of the Eastern Ghats. It derives its name from the Hindi term for 'fort', garh. The region was named by the Mughals who conquered Odisha under Akbar. Under the Marathas too Odisha was divided into the Mughalbandhi and Garhjat provinces and the latter was ruled by 24 vassal chiefs who paid tribute to the Marathas. These states, the Orissa Tributary States, later came to be known as the Garhjat states or the Garhjats because they were located in the region of the range.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 252. These hills cover the present day districts of Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Baragarh, Angul and Kendujhar in northern Odisha. Rourkela in Sundargarh district is a major industrial town.  Geology  The Garhjat hills are bounded by the Chotanagpur Plateau in the north, the Utkal plains in the east, the Mahanadi basin or the Chhattisgarh plains in the west and the Eastern Ghats to the south. Geologically, the region comprises crystalline rocks such as granites and gneisses that belong to the Archaean period. The Talcher, Barakar and Kamathi series of rocks containing shales and sandstones occur in the Sambalpur and Dhei districts.  Drainage  The northern Garhjat hills are a part of the Chotanagpur plateau while the southern part is an extension of the Eastern Ghats and can be divided into three - the northern uplands, the Mahanadi valley, and the south-western hills. The important rivers that drain the Garhjat hills are the Brahmani, the Mahanadi, the Baitarani and the Subarnarekha. The Odisha Highlands are densely forested with tropical semi- evergreen and tropical dry and moist deciduous forests. The Scheduled Tribes account for as much as 37% of the regions population and the Gonds are a major tribal group of this region. Malaria is a major public health concern in these hills.  Major Peaks  Some of the important peaks of the Garhjat Hills include the Malayagiri, Manakamacha and Meghasani. The Mahanadi river bisects these hills and to its south, the hills tend to gain elevation. The highest peak to the south is the Mahendragiri in Gajapati district.

He is the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, the largest investor in distressed securities worldwide. In 2020, with a net worth of $2.1 billion, Marks was ranked No. 391 on the Forbes 400 rankings of the wealthiest Americans. Marks is admired in the investment community for his \\"memos\\", which detail his investment strategies and insight into the economy and are posted publicly on the Oaktree website. He has also published 3 books on investing. According to Warren Buffett, \\"When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something, and that goes double for his book.\\" Marks focuses on risk management and says that investors should set investment strategy according to their personal situations and ask themselves whether they worry more about the risk of losing money or the risk of missing an opportunity. Marks believes that is it hard to gain an investment advantage through research since so many smart people are doing it already; the ways to get an advantage are through better inferring the consequences implied by current company data, managing the psychology of investing, and assessing the present stage of the business / market cycle. Marks does favor using market timing strategies to have cash available to be invested during a downturn. Marks notes that it is important for investors to admit what they don't know instead of believing something is certain. He aims for a \\"high batting average\\" over \\"home runs\\". Funds led by Marks have produced long term returns net of fees of 19% per year. Investors are primarily pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. Early life and education Howard Marks was born in 1946 and raised in Queens, New York. Although his family was ethnically Jewish, he was raised as a Christian Scientist. He attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for undergraduate studies, where he graduated cum laude in 1967 with a major in finance and a minor in Japanese Studies. At age 23, he earned a Master of Business Administration in Accounting and Marketing from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business where he won the George Hay Brown Prize. Career =Citicorp= From 1969 until 1978, Marks worked at Citicorp, first as an equity research analyst and then as the company's Director of Research. From 1978 to 1985, he served as a Vice President, as well as a senior portfolio manager overseeing convertible and high-yield debt. Citibank allowed him to move to Los Angeles in 1980. =TCW Group= In 1985, Marks joined TCW Group where he led the groups that were responsible for investments in high-yield debt and convertible securities, and in 1988 he and Bruce Karsh organized one of the first distressed debt funds from a major financial institution. In 1995, he, Karsh, and 3 others decided to leave to start their own firm and petitioned TCW to let them continue managing the funds they managed at TCW, giving TCW a portion of the management fees; when TCW refused, the 5 partners left the company and founded Oaktree Capital Management in Los Angeles. =Oaktree= After being founded in 1995, Oaktree grew rapidly, focusing on high-yield debt, distressed debt, and private equity. During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, Oaktree raised $10.9 billion, the largest distressed debt fund in history, to buy distressed assets, which \\"paid off richly for his investors\\". In April 2012, Oaktree became a public company via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, raising $380 million by selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each. In March 2019, Brookfield Asset Management acquired 62% of Oaktree. Marks and other members of Oaktree own 38% of the company and have full control of Oaktree's day-to-day operations. Organizations From 2000 to 2010, he chaired the Trustees' Investment Board at The University of Pennsylvania. He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and chairs the Investment Committees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he is a trustee, and the Royal Drawing School (London). Personal life Marks' first marriage ended in divorce. He has one biological child with his second wife Nancy (n√©e Freeman): Andrew Marks, who runs Freemark Partners, the investment firm for the Marks family, and one step-child: Jane Hait, from Nancy's prior marriage. =Philanthropy= In 1992, Marks created the Howard S. Marks Terms Scholarship to provide renewable scholarships to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2009 he endowed the Marks Family Writing Center at the university. =Residences= In 2010, Marks bought an oceanfront property in East Hampton for $30 million. In May 2012, he and his wife purchased a duplex unit at 740 Park Avenue for $52.5 million. In 2013, Marks sold his mansion in Malibu, California for $75 million. In 2015, he purchased a house in Beverly Hills for $23.7 million. In 2017, he purchased the house next door to his house in Beverly Hills for $9.7 million. In 2019, he purchased parcels in Amagansett, New York, near his East Hampton property, for $35 million. =Political affiliation= Marks is a member of the Democratic Party and has been critical of the economic policy of Donald Trump. In 2016, he contributed over $200,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund and similar organizations. However, he has criticised the tax plan proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying \\"a great deal of America‚Äôs economic progress has resulted from people‚Äôs aspiration to make more and live better\\".

Rozee\\". Katharina, or Catharina Rozee (1632, Leiden - 1682, Leiden), was a Dutch Golden Age artist. She is remembered for her ability to create exceptionally realistic images in the medium of embroidery. Biography Rozee was born in the city of Leiden in the Netherlands. Accounts of her life claim that she was able to depict landscapes, animals, flowers, and insects with such detail and naturalism that her work was often mistaken for an oil painting. One work in particular, described by the biographer Jacob Weyerman, depicted the trunk of a tree with a spider spinning its web and was said to have sold for ‚Äúfive hundred guilders‚Äù. In fact, Rozee‚Äôs work was so realistic that she was stigmatized as a witch and sorceress. According to Houbraken she made clever designs with silk fibers on panels of landscapes, animals, flowers and insects that looked so real that they confounded their viewers and common folk claimed she must be a magician. Katharina Rozee Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Her works were in great demand, and one of her works with \\"a landscape with a tree stump and a spider in its web\\" fetched 500 guilders. Houbraken's source was Michiel Carr√©, who told him about a portrait she made with such natural skin tones \\"that it looked like an oil painting\\". One of her best works was purchased by the Grand Duke of Florence. She died unmarried at age 50. Rozee‚Äôs artwork was owned by well-known figures including Michiel Carr√© (1657-1747), the court painter of the King of Prussia, and Cosimo III de‚Äô Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

It is a three storey brick built house originally constructed circa 1680 but later much modified. It is situated on the east side of the village of Quorn in 12 acres of land through which runs the River Soar. History Quorn Hall was originally built by John Farnham on land he had acquired by the River Soar in the middle of the 15th century and was originally known as \\"Nether Hall\\". Much of the land was subsequently disposed of by his descendants until the estate passed out of the hands of the Farnham family in 1686. In 1773 the estate was bought by Hugo Meynell, who transferred the pack of foxhounds he already owned to Nether Hall. He renamed the hall as Quorn Hall and the pack of foxhounds as the Quorn Hunt. The hall and its hounds subsequently passed through the ownership of several wealthy men until 1855, when it was bought by Sir Richard Sutton, who lived in the hall but rented out the stables and kennels. In 1906 the hunt left the Hall for newer premises in nearby Barrow upon Soar. After a short spell as a country club the hall was requisitioned during World War II for training naval personnel. For this purpose the building was considerably enlarged by extending a wing and adding a storey. It has been used since 1983 as an outdoor education centre by Leicestershire County Council. During 2012, the council considered its closure and sale and decided to close it at the end of that year.

The geometry of typical structural elements allows the internal stress state to be simplified because of the existence of a \\"thickness'\\" direction in which the size of the element is much smaller than in other directions. As a consequence the three traction components that vary from point to point in a cross-section can be replaced with a set of resultant forces and resultant moments. These are the stress resultants (also called membrane forces, shear forces, and bending moment) that may be used to determine the detailed stress state in the structural element. A three-dimensional problem can then be reduced to a one-dimensional problem (for beams) or a two-dimensional problem (for plates and shells). Stress resultants are defined as integrals of stress over the thickness of a structural element. The integrals are weighted by integer powers the thickness coordinate z (or x3). Stress resultants are so defined to represent the effect of stress as a membrane force N (zero power in z), bending moment M (power 1) on a beam or shell (structure). Stress resultants are necessary to eliminate the z dependency of the stress from the equations of the theory of plates and shells.  Stress resultants in beams  Components of stress on the surfaces of a structural element. Consider the element shown in the adjacent figure. Assume that the thickness direction is x3. If the element has been extracted from a beam, the width and thickness are comparable in size. Let x2 be the width direction. Then x1 is the length direction. = Membrane and shear forces = The resultant force vector due to the traction in the cross-section (A) perpendicular to the x1 axis is : \\\\mathbf{F}_1 = \\\\int_A (\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dA where e1, e2, e3 are the unit vectors along x1, x2, and x3, respectively. We define the stress resultants such that : \\\\mathbf{F}_1 =: N_{11}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + V_2\\\\mathbf{e}_2 + V_3\\\\mathbf{e}_3 where N11 is the membrane force and V2, V3 are the shear forces. More explicitly, for a beam of height t and width b, : N_{11} = \\\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\sigma_{11}\\\\,dx_3\\\\,dx_2 \\\\,. Similarly the shear force resultants are : \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_2  V_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_{12}  \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\,dx_3\\\\,dx_2 \\\\,. = Bending moments = The bending moment vector due to stresses in the cross-section A perpendicular to the x1-axis is given by : \\\\mathbf{M}_1 = \\\\int_A \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times (\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dA \\\\quad \\\\text{where} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{r} = x_2\\\\,\\\\mathbf{e}_2 + x_3\\\\,\\\\mathbf{e}_3 \\\\,. Expanding this expression we have, : \\\\mathbf{M}_1 = \\\\int_A \\\\left(-x_2\\\\sigma_{11}\\\\mathbf{e}_3 + x_2\\\\sigma_{13}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\\\\sigma_{11}\\\\mathbf{e}_2 - x_3\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_1\\\\right)dA =: M_{11}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{12}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{e}_2 + M_{13}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{e}_3\\\\,. We can write the bending moment resultant components as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} M_{11}  M_{12} M_{13} \\\\end{bmatrix} := \\\\int_{-b/2}^{b/2} \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_2\\\\sigma_{13} - x_3\\\\sigma_{12}  x_3\\\\sigma_{11}  -x_2\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,dx_3\\\\,dx_2 \\\\,.  Stress resultants in plates and shells  For plates and shells, the x1 and x2 dimensions are much larger than the size in the x3 direction. Integration over the area of cross-section would have to include one of the larger dimensions and would lead to a model that is too simple for practical calculations. For this reason the stresses are only integrated through the thickness and the stress resultants are typically expressed in units of force per unit length (or moment per unit length) instead of the true force and moment as is the case for beams. = Membrane and shear forces = For plates and shells we have to consider two cross-sections. The first is perpendicular to the x1 axis and the second is perpendicular to the x2 axis. Following the same procedure as for beams, and keeping in mind that the resultants are now per unit length, we have : \\\\mathbf{F}_1 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} (\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dx_3 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{F}_2 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} (\\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{22} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{23} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dx_3 We can write the above as : \\\\mathbf{F}_1 = N_{11} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + N_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + V_1 \\\\mathbf{e}_3 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{F}_2 = N_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + N_{22} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + V_2 \\\\mathbf{e}_3 where the membrane forces are defined as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} N_{11}  N_{22}  N_{12} \\\\end{bmatrix} := \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_{11}  \\\\sigma_{22}  \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\, dx_3 and the shear forces are defined as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1  V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma_{13}  \\\\sigma_{23} \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\, dx_3 \\\\,. = Bending moments = For the bending moment resultants, we have : \\\\mathbf{M}_1 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times (\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dx_3 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{M}_2 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times (\\\\sigma_{12} \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\sigma_{22} \\\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\\\sigma_{23} \\\\mathbf{e}_3)\\\\, dx_3 where r = x3 e3. Expanding these expressions we have, : \\\\mathbf{M}_1 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} [-x_3\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\\\\sigma_{11}\\\\mathbf{e}_2] \\\\,dx_3 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{M}_2 = \\\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} [-x_3\\\\sigma_{22}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + x_3\\\\sigma_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_2 ]\\\\, dx_3 Define the bending moment resultants such that : \\\\mathbf{M}_1 =: -M_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{11}\\\\mathbf{e}_2\\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{M}_2 =: -M_{22}\\\\mathbf{e}_1 + M_{12}\\\\mathbf{e}_2 \\\\,.

He was prominent in the trial of Thomas Cranmer. Martin was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Saltash in October 1553; Hindon April 1554, November 1554 and 1555; and Ludgershall in 1558. Early life and education A younger son of John Martyn, gentleman, he was born at Cerne, Dorset. He educated first at Winchester School and then at New College, Oxford. He became a Fellow of his college 7 March 1538, and after two years of probation, in 1539 admitted perpetual fellow. He is said to have acted as Lord of Misrule during some Christmas festivities at the college. Subsequently he travelled with pupils in France, and took the degree of doctor of civil law at Bourges. In 1553 Martin resigned his fellowship at New College. He was admitted a member of the College of Advocates at Doctors' Commons 15 January 1555.  Politics  Around 1955, he was official of the archdeaconry of Berkshire, chancellor to Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, with whom he was in favour, and a master in chancery. Martin took a conspicuous part in the proceedings against Bishop Hooper, Rowland Taylor, John Taylor, alias Cardmaker, and John Careless. In the prosecution against Archbishop Cranmer he was effective in bringing out the oaths Cranmer swore in 1533.Diarmaid McCulloch, Thomas Cranmer (1996), p. 578. It appears that he interfered to procure the discharge of Robert Horneby, the groom of the chamber to Princess Elizabeth, who had been committed to the Marshalsea for refusing to hear mass. In May and June 1555 he was at Calais, apparently in attendance on Bishop Gardiner, then lord chancellor. In July 1556 he was one of the masters of requests, and he was employed with Sir Roger Cholmeley to examine Silvester Taverner on a charge of embezzling the queen's plate. They were empowered to put him to such tortures as by their discretion should be thought convenient. In June 1557 he was one of the council of the north, and in the following month a commissioner with the Earl of Westmorland, Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, and Robert Hyndmer, LL.D., for the settlement of certain differences between England and Scotland, which had been occasioned by the inroads of the Grahams and others. On 13 May 1558 he and others were authorised to bring to the torture, if they should so think good, one French, a prisoner in the Tower of London. He was vilified in particular by John Bale, and after the accession of Queen Elizabeth he kept a low profile. In 1587 he was incorporated doctor of the civil law at Cambridge. Commissions to him and other civilians to hear admiralty cases were issued in 1591 and 1592.  Relationship with the crown  His treatise against the marriage of priests and monks, finished in 1553 with the assistance, it is said, of Nicholas Udall, was esteemed by Queen Mary, to whom it was dedicated; she granted him a commission to make Frenchmen and Dutchmen free denizens, and this he executed with such success in the spring of 1554 that he made himself a gentleman. He was incorporated D.C.L. at Oxford 29 July 1555, when he was sent there as one of the queen's commissioners. In September 1556 it was intended that he should succeed Nicholas Wotton as ambassador at the French court; but in the following month he was despatched by the privy council to Philip II of Spain at Ghent, concerning the contemplated marriage of the Duke of Savoy to the Princess Elizabeth, and also with respect to the trade between England and the States of the Low Countries. The king sent him to the States to treat with them on the latter subject. During Mary's reign he was Member of Parliament, for Saltash and for Hindon, several times. Works Martin's works are: * A Traictise declaryng and plainly prouyng that the pretensed marriage of Priestes, and professed persones, is no mariage, but altogether unlawful, and in all ages, and al countreies of Christendome, bothe forbidden, and also punyshed. Herewith is comprised in the later chapitres a full confutation of Doctour Poynettes boke entitled a defense for the marriage of Priestes, London, May 1554, dedicated to Queen Mary. John Poynet, whose book had appeared in 1549, published, apparently at Strasburg, a rejoinder to Martin entitled An Apologie in 1556. A Defence of priestes mariages, another answer to Martin's treatise, London [1562?], with a preface and additions by Matthew Parker, has been assigned to both Poynet and Sir Richard Morysin. * Orations to Archbishop Cranmer, and Disputation and Conferences with him on matters of Religion, 1555 and 1556.

MemSQL supports blended workloads, commonly referred to as translytical, HTAP, HOAP, and ATP workloads. For queries, it compiles Structured Query Language (SQL) into machine code. The same MemSQL database engine runs wherever Linux does, including on-premise installations, public cloud providers and in private clouds, in containers via a Kubernetes operator, or as a hosted service in the cloud known as memSQL Helios. Rather than the traditional B-tree index, MemSQL uses skiplists optimized for fast, lock-free processing in memory. Due to its fully distributed nature, MemSQL is fully scalable, and it achieves high speeds for time-critical processing of large data sets. MemSQL is compatible with the MySQL wire protocol, meaning most MySQL and MariaDB drivers and products work on MemSQL. MemSQL includes pipeline features for real-time ingest of data from Kafka, Spark, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and on-disk files. MemSQL can store data in in-memory rowstore tables or disk-based columnstore tables. MemSQL primarily stores relational data, though it can also store JSON data, graph data, and time series data. On April 23, 2013, MemSQL launched its first generally available version of the database to the public. Because of MemSQL's unique distributed workload processing and ANSI SQL processing, it is ideal for HTAP workloads requiring real-time data processing at scale. ‚ÄúHTAP solves the issue of analytic latency in several ways, including eliminating the need for multiple copies of the same data and the requirement for data to be offloaded from operational databases to data warehouses via ETL processes.‚Äù  Distribution Formats  MemSQL San Francisco office in 2020 MemSQL can be downloaded for free and run on Linux for systems up to 4 leaf nodes of 32 gigs RAM each; an Enterprise license is required for larger deployments and for official MemSQL support. MemSQL clusters can be managed in containers using the MemSQL Kubernetes Operator. MemSQL is also available as a managed service named memSQL Helios, available in various regions in Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, with a Microsoft Azure implementation promised for the near future. The underlying engine and potential system performance are identical in all distribution formats. Row and column table formats MemSQL can store database tables either as rowstores or columnstores. The format used is determined by the user when creating the table. Data for all rowstore tables is stored completely in- memory, making random reads fast, with snapshots and transaction logs persisted to disk. Data for all columnstore tables is stored on-disk, supporting fast sequential reads and compression that typically reaches 5-10x. Rowstore tables, as the name implies, store information in row format, which is the traditional data format used by RDBMS systems. Rowstores are optimized for singleton or small insert, update or delete queries and are most closely associated with OLTP (transactional) use cases. Columnstores are optimized for complex SELECT queries, typically associated with OLAP (analytics) / data warehousing use cases. As an example, a large clinical data set for data analysis is best stored in columnar format, since queries run against it will typically be ad hoc queries where aggregates are computed over large numbers of similar data items. Distributed architecture A MemSQL database is distributed across many commodity machines. Data is stored in partitions on leaf nodes, and users connect to aggregator nodes. A single piece of software is installed for MemSQL aggregator and leaf nodes; administrators merely designate the machine‚Äôs purpose when installing. An aggregator node is responsible for receiving SQL queries, breaking them up across leaf nodes, and aggregating results back to the client. A leaf node stores MemSQL data and processes queries from the aggregator(s). All communication between aggregators and leaf nodes is done over the network using SQL. MemSQL uses hash partitioning to distribute data uniformly across the number of leaf nodes.  Real-time Ingest  MemSQL Pipelines allow for real-time data ingest. A pipeline is a native connector to data sources such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Amazon S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage, or files on disk. The Pipeline pulls data into the system at high speed. Because of the lock-free skip lists, queries can retrieve the data as soon as it lands, but are not blocked from continuing while data is imported. Durability Durability for the in-memory rowstore is implemented with a write-ahead log and snapshots, similar to checkpoints. With default settings, as soon as a transaction is acknowledged in memory, the database will asynchronously write the transaction to disk as fast as the disk allows. The on-disk columnstore is actually fronted by an in-memory rowstore-like structure (skiplist). This structure has the same durability guarantees as the MemSQL rowstore. Apart from that, the columnstore is durable, since its data is stored on disk. Replication A MemSQL cluster can be configured in \\"High Availability\\" (HA) mode, where every data partition is automatically created with master and slave versions on two separate leaf nodes. In HA mode, aggregators send transactions to the master partitions, which then send logs to the slave partitions. In the event of an unexpected master failure, the slave partitions take over as master partitions, in a fully online operation with no downtime.  MemSQL Components  MemSQL ships with a set of installation, management, and monitoring tools called MemSQL Tools. When installing MemSQL, Tools can be used to set up the distributed MemSQL database across machines. MemSQL also provides a browser- based query and management UI called MemSQL Studio. MemSQL Studio provides query processing and database monitoring, and shows health and informational details about the running cluster.

It occurs in genetic isolation due to the isolated geography of its home range along a ridge of montane cloud forest in the southern portion of the Cerros del Sira. Eight specimens were collected from the upper R√≠o Shinipo and R√≠o Tzipani valleys , and a further two at Quebrada Quirapokiari in July 2011. Some taxonomic authorities (including the American Ornithological Society) consider a subspecies of the scarlet-banded barbet, although some taxonomists do place it as a distinct species. The Sira barbet is distinguished from it by differences in morphology and plumage, particularly the color on the bird's flanks, lower back and thighs, and a wider, darker scarlet breast band. DNA sequencing was also used to confirm the Sira barbet's status as a distinct species.Science Daily, (Aug. 6, 2012) New Bird Species Discovered in 'Cloud Forest' of Peru. Males are on average smaller than females, and lack the red and yellow scapular pigmentation. Their crown and flanks are also a more saturated red. They have a low-pitched purred song, but more commonly emit a Tityra-like grunt. Quiet, low-pitched groans and clucks are emitted from their roost cavities. They occur in a narrow elevational zone around 1,100 m on moist ridges adjacent to the drier eastern lowlands, and are absent at 2,000 m. They frequent the highest stratum of tall (up to 30 m) montane forest with arboreal epiphytes and moss, above a sparsely vegetated understory. Its range is sympatric and syntopic with that of the gilded barbet, and coincides with the boundary and sections of the Sira Communal Reserve. The bird's epithet commemorates John W.

Biogeochemistry of persistent bioaccumulative toxicants: processes affecting the transport of contaminants to remote areas. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 62: 236-243. History Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were the focal point of the Stockholm Convention 2001 due to their persistence, ability to biomagnify and the threat posed to both human health and the environment. The goal of the Stockholm Convention was to determine the classification of POPs, create measures to eliminate production/use of POPs, and establish proper disposal of the compounds in an environmentally friendly manner.Ridding the world of POPs: A guide to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants\\". United Nations Environment Programme. April 2005. Retrieved 2008-06-06. Currently the majority of the global community is actively involved with this program but a few still resist, most notably the U.S. Similar to POPs classification, the PBT classification of chemicals was developed in 1997 by the Great Lakes Binational Toxic Strategy (GLBNS). Signed by both the U.S and Canada, the GLBNS classified PBTs in one of two categories, level I and level II.USEPA. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement U.S Eighth Response to International Joint Commission. Retrieved June 6, 2012 http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/glwqa/eigthresponse.html Level I PBTs are top priority which currently, as of 2005, contained 12 compounds or classes of compounds. ;Level I PBTs (GLBNS) *Mercury *Polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs) *Dioxins/furans *Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) *Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) *Alkyl-lead *Pesticides Mirex Dieldrin/aldrin Chlordane Toxaphene *Octachlorostyrene The GLBNS is administered by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Environment Canada. Following the GLBNS, the Multimedia Strategy for Priority Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic Pollutants (PBT Strategy) was drafted by the USEPA. The PBT Strategy led to the implementation of PBT criteria in several regulational policies. Two main policies that were changed by the PBT strategy were the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which required more rigid chemical reporting and the New Chemical Program (NCP) under the Toxics Substances Control Act (TSCA) which required screening for PBTs and PBT properties. Compounds =General= PBTs are a unique classification of chemicals that have and will continue to impact human health and the environment worldwide. The three main attributes of a PBT (persistence, bioaccumulative and toxic) each have a huge role in the risk posed by these compounds. =Persistence= PBTs may have a high environmental mobility relative to other contaminants mainly due to their resistance to degradation (persistence). This allows PBTs to travel far and wide in both the atmosphere and in aqueous environments. The low degradation rates of PBTs allow these chemicals to be exposed to both biotic and abiotic factors while maintaining a relatively stable concentration. Another factor that makes PBTs especially dangerous are the degradation products which are often relatively as toxic as the parent compound. These factors have resulted in global contamination most notable in remote areas such as the arctic and high elevation areas which are far from any source of PBTs. =Bioaccumulation and biomagnification= The bioaccumulative ability of PBTs follows suit with the persistence attribute by the high resistance to degradation by biotic factors, especially with in organisms. Bioaccumulation is the result of a toxic substance being taken up at a higher rate than being removed from an organism. For PBTs this is caused mainly by a resistance to degradation, biotic and abiotic. PBTs usually are highly insoluble in water which allows them to enter organisms at faster rates through fats and other nonpolar regions on an organism. Bioaccumulation of a toxicant can lead to biomagnification through a trophic web which has resulted in massive concern in areas with especially low trophic diversity. Biomagnification results in higher trophic organisms accumulating more PBTs than those of lower trophic levels through consumption of the PBT contaminated lower trophic organisms. =Toxicity= The toxicity of this class of compounds is high with very low concentrations of a PBT required to enact an effect on an organism compared to most other contaminants. This high toxicity along with the persistence allows for the PBT to have detrimental effects in remote areas around the globe where there is not a local source of PBTs. The bioaccumulation and magnification along with the high toxicity and persistence has the ability to destroy and/or irreparably damage trophic systems, especially the higher trophic levels, globally. It is this reason that PBTs have become an area of focus in global politics. =Specific toxicants= PCBs Historically, PCBs were used extensively for industrial purposes such as coolants, insulating fluids, and as a plasticizer. These contaminants enter the environment through both use and disposal. Due to extensive concern from the public, legal, and scientific sectors indicating that PCBs are likely carcinogens and potential to adversely impact the environment, these compounds were banned in 1979 in the United States.USEPA. Basic Information on PCBs. Accessed June 1, 2012. http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm The ban included the use of PCBs in uncontained sources, such as adhesives, fire retardant fabric treatments, and plasticizers in paints and cements. Containers that are completely enclosed such as transformers and capacitors are exempt from the ban. The inclusion of PCBs as a PBT may be attributed to their low water solubility, high stability, and semi-volatility facilitating their long range transport and accumulation in organisms.Ritter L; Solomon KR, Forget J, Stemeroff M, O'Leary C.. \\"Persistent organic pollutants\\". United Nations Environment Programme. Retrieved 2007-09-16. The persistence of these compounds is due to the high resistance to oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination and electrophilic substitution.Amy Boate, Greg Deleersnyder, Jill Howarth, Anita Mirabelli, and Leanne Peck (2004). \\"Chemistry of PCBs\\". Retrieved 2007-11-07. The toxicological interactions of PCBs are affected by the number and position of the chlorine atoms, without ortho substitution are referred as coplanar and all others as non-coplanar. Non-coplanar PCBs may cause neurotoxicity by interfering with intracellular signal transduction dependent on calcium.Simon T, Britt JK, James RC (2007). \\"Development of a neurotoxic equivalence scheme of relative potency for assessing the risk of PCB mixtures\\". Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 48(2): 148‚Äì70. DOI:10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.03.005. Ortho-PCBs may alter hormone regulation through disruption of the thyroid hormone transport by binding to transthyretin.Chauhan KR, Kodavanti PR, McKinney JD (2000). \\"Assessing the role of ortho-substitution on polychlorinated biphenyl binding to transthyretin, a thyroxine transport protein\\". Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.162 (1): 10‚Äì21. DOI:10.1006/taap.1999.8826. Coplanar PCBs are similar to dioxins and furans, both bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms and may exert dioxin-like effects, in addition to the effects shared with non- coplanar PCBs.Safe, S. and Hutzinger, O. (1984). \\"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs): biochemistry, toxicology, and mechanism of action\\". Crit. Rev.

(1985). \\"PCBs: structure-function relationships and mechanism of action\\". Environ. Health Perspect. (38) 60: 47‚Äì56. The AhR is a transcription factor, therefore, abnormal activation may disrupt cellular function by altering gene transcription. Effects of PBTs may include increase in disease, lesions in benthic feeders, spawning loss, change in age-structured populations of fish, and tissue contamination in fish and shellfish.Lehmann DW, Levine JF, Law JM. 2007. Polychlorinated Biphenyl Exposure Causes Gonadal Atrophy and Oxidative Stress in Corbicula fluminea Clams. Toxicol Pathol. 35:356.Debruyn AMH, Meloche LM, Lowe CJ. 2009. Patterns of Bioaccumulation of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Congeners in Marine Mussels. Environ. Sci. Technol. 43:3700‚Äì3704. Humans and other organisms, which consume shellfish and/or fish contaminated with persistent bioaccumulative pollutants, have the potential to bioaccumulate these chemicals. This may put these organisms at risk of mutagenic, teratogenic, and/or carcinogenic effects. Correlations have been found between elevated exposure to PCB mixtures and alterations in liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and dermatological effects such as rashes have been reported. DDT One PBT of concern includes DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), an organochlorine that was widely used as an insecticide during World War II to protect soldiers from malaria carried by mosquitoes. Due to the low cost and low toxicity to mammals, the widespread use of DDT for agricultural and commercial motives started around 1940. However, the overuse of DDT lead to insect tolerance to the chemical. It was also discovered that DDT had a high toxicity to fish. DDT was banned in the US by 1973 because of building evidence that DDT‚Äôs stable structure, high fat solubility, and low rate of metabolism, caused it to bioaccumulate in animals.Harrison, Karl. 1997. DDT a Banned Insecticide. Molecules of the Month. http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/mom/ddt/ddt.html While DDT is banned in the US, other countries such as China and Turkey still produce and use it quite regularly through Dicofol, an insecticide that has DDT as an impurity.Turgut, C., Cengiz, G., Cutright, T. 2009. Contents and sources of DDT impurities in dicofol formulations in Turkey. Environmental science and pollution research international. Volume 16. issue 2. page 214 This continued use in other parts of the world is still a global problem due to the mobility and persistence of DDT. The initial contact from DDT is on vegetation and soil. From here, the DDT can travel many routes, for instance, when plants and vegetation are exposed to the chemical to protect from insects, the plants may absorb it. Then these plants may either be consumed by humans or other animals. These consumers ingest the chemical and begin metabolizing the toxicant, accumulating more through ingestion, and posing health risks to the organism, their offspring, and any predators. Alternatively the ingestion of the contaminated plant by insects may lead to tolerance by the organism. Another route is the chemical travelling through the soil and ending up in ground water and in human water supply.Kan, A., Tomson, M. 2009. Ground Water Transport of Hydrophobic Organic Compounds in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter. Or in the case that the soil is near a moving water system, the chemical could end up in large freshwater systems or the ocean where fish are at high risk from the toxicological effects of DDT.Woodwell, G., Craig, P., Johnson H. 1971. DDT in the Biosphere: Where Does it Go? Science. Vol. 174 no. 4014 pp. 1101-1107. Lastly, the most common transport route is the evaporation of DDT into the atmosphere followed by condensation and eventually precipitation where it is released into environments anywhere on earth.Stewart Jr, C., Woodwell G., Craig, P., Johnson, H.1972. Atmospheric Circulation of DDT. Science. 724-725. Due to the long-range transport of DDT, the presence of this harmful toxicant will continue as long as it is still used anywhere and until the current contamination eventually degrades. Even after its complete discontinued use, it will still remain in the environment for many more years after because of DDT‚Äôs persistent attributes. Previous studies have shown that DDT and other similar chemicals directly elicited a response and effect from excitable membranes.Vijverberg, H., Van Den Bercken, J. 1990. Neurotoxicological Effects And The Mode of Action of Pyrethroid Insecticides. Informa Healthcare: Critical Reviews in Toxicology. Vol. 21, No. 2 , Pages 105-126. DDT causes membranes such as sense organs and nerves endings to activate repetitively by slowing down the ability for the sodium channel to close and stop releasing sodium ions. The sodium ions are what polarize the opposing synapse after it has depolarized from firing.Vijverberg, H., Van der Zalm, J., Van den Bercken, J. 1982. Similar mode of action of pyrethroids and DDT on sodium channel gating in myelinated nerves. Nature. 295, 601 - 603. This inhibition of closing the sodium ion channel can lead to a variety of problems including a dysfunctional nervous system, decreased motor abilities/function/control, reproductive impairment (egg-shell thinning in birds), and development deficiencies. Presently, DDT has been labeled as a possible human carcinogen based on animal liver tumor studies.USEPA. 2012. DDT A Brief History and Status. United States Environmental Protection Agency. http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/chemicals/ddt-brief-history-status.htm DDT toxicity on humans have been associated with dizziness, tremors, irritability, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity has led to long term neurological and cognitive issues.Washington Toxics Coalition. 2002. PCBs and DDT. Washington Toxics Coalition. http://watoxics.org/chemicals-of- concern/pcbs-and-ddt Mercury ;Inorganic Inorganic mercury (elemental mercury) is less bioavailable and less toxic than that of organic mercury but is still toxic nonetheless. It is released into the environment through both natural sources as well as human activity, and it has the capability to travel long distances through the atmosphere.Clarkson T., Magos L. 2006 The Toxicology of mercury and Its Chemical Compounds. Critical Reviews in Toxicology. 36:609-662. Around 2,700 to 6,000 tons of elemental mercury are released via natural activity such as volcanoes and erosion. Another 2,000 ‚Äì 3,000 tons are released by human industrial activities such as coal combustion, metal smelting and cement production.Tchounwou P., Ayensu W., Ninashvili W., Sutton D. 2003. Environmental Exposure to Mercury and Its Toxicopathologic Implications for Public Health. Environmental Toxicology 18:149-175. Due to its high volatility and atmospheric residence time of around 1 year, mercury has the ability to travel across continents before being deposited. Inorganic mercury has a wide spectrum of toxicological effects that include damage to the respiratory, nervous, immune and excretory systems in humans. Inorganic mercury also possesses the ability to bioaccumulate individuals and biomagnify through trophic systems.Morel F., Kraepiel A., Amyot. 1998. The Chemical Cycle and Bioaccumulation of Mercury. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 29:543-566 ;Organic Organic mercury is significantly more detrimental to the environment than its inorganic form due to its widespread distribution as well as its higher mobility, general toxicity and rates of bioaccumulation than that of the inorganic form. Environmental organic mercury is mainly created by the transformation of elemental (inorganic) mercury via anaerobic bacteria into methylated mercury (organic).Olson B., Cooper R. 2003. Comparison of Aerobic and Anaerobic Methylation of Mercuric Chloride by San Francisco Bay Sediments. Water Research 10:113-116. The global distribution of organic mercury is the result of general mobility of the compound, activation via bacteria and transportation from animal consumption. Organic mercury shares a lot of the same effects as the inorganic form but it has a higher toxicity due to its higher mobility in the body, especially its ability to readily move across the blood brain barrier. ;Ecological Impact of Hg The high toxicity of both forms of mercury (especially organic mercury) poses a threat to almost all organisms that comes in contact with it. This is one of the reasons that there is such high attention to mercury in the environment but even more so than its toxicity is both its persistence and atmospheric retention times. The ability of mercury to readily volatilize allows it to enter the atmosphere and travel far and wide. Unlike most other PBTs that have atmospheric half-lives between 30 min and 7 days mercury has an atmospheric residence time of at least 1 year.Mason R., Sheu G. 2002. Role of the Ocean in the Global Mercury Cycle. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 16:1093-1107. This atmospheric retention time along with mercury‚Äôs resistance to degradation factors such as electromagnetic radiation and oxidation, which are two of the main factors leading to degradation of many PBTs in the atmosphere, allows mercury from any source to be transported extensively. This characteristic of mercury transportation globally along with its high toxicity is the reasoning behind its incorporation into the BNS list of PBTs. Notable PBT environmental impacts =Japan= The realization of the adverse effects from environmental pollution were made public from several disasters that occurred globally. In 1965, it was recognized that extensive mercury pollution by the Chisso chemical factory in Minamata, Japan due to improper handling of industrial wastes resulted in significant effects to the humans and organisms exposed.The Ministry of the Environment, (2002).\\"Minamata Disease: The History and Measures‚Äù. Retrieved January 17, 2007. http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/ Mercury was released into the environment as methyl mercury (bioavailable state) into industrial wastewater and was then bioaccumulated by shellfish and fish in Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea. When the contaminated seafood was consumed by the local populace it caused a neurological syndrome, coined Minamata disease. Symptoms include general muscle weakness, hearing damage, reduced field of vision, and ataxia. The Minamata disaster contributed to the global realization of the potential dangers from environmental pollution and to the characterization of PBTs. =Puget Sound= Despite the ban on DDT 30 years earlier and years of various efforts to clean up Puget Sound from DDT and PCB‚Äôs, there is still a significant presence of both compounds which pose a constant threat to human health and the environment. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), a common marine species in the Puget Sound area have been the focus of a few studies to monitor and examine the effects of DDT accumulation and magnification in aquatic wildlife. One study tagged and reexamined seal pups every 4 to 5 years to be tested for DDT concentrations.Calambokidis, J., Jeffries, S., Ross, P., Ikonomou, M. 1999. Temporal Trends in Contaminants in Puget Sound Harbor Seal. Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Publications. http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00964/ The trends showed the pups to be highly contaminated; this means their prey are also highly contaminated. Due to DDT‚Äôs high lipid solubility, it also has the ability to accumulate in the local populace who consume seafood from the area. This also translates to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, since DDT will be transferred from the mother to child. Both animal and human health risk to DDT will continue to be an issue in Puget Sound especially because of the cultural significance of fish in this region.

Like most other large buildings in central Christchurch, Radio Network House was damaged beyond repair in the 2011 earthquake, and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) added it to the demolition list in August 2011. In July 2012, it was announced that the building was going to be imploded, involving a specialist company from the United States with considerable experience in this type of work. The right to push the button for the implosion was put up for auction on Trade Me, and became that website's third most viewed auction. The winning bid of was made by a consortium of demolition contractors, who allowed the Child Cancer Foundation to nominate a six-year-old boy from Queenstown to trigger the event. The implosion, which was carefully monitored to assess the suitability of this demolition method for potential future applications, went without any problems and it is anticipated that this will have paved the way for many more implosions in New Zealand in general, and in Christchurch in particular. But as of 2020, only one further implosion has been carried out. Background Radio Network House in June 2012, displaying the Newstalk ZB logo Radio Network House was a 14-storey office tower constructed in 1986. The building was located at 155 Worcester Street, on the north side of the street and in the block between Manchester Street and Latimer Square. For its last twelve years Radio Network House was owned by Greg Hedges through his company Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. The building was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who displayed their logo on the building. Shows such as What Now, After School, Simon Barnett's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed in the tower block. TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington. In the late 1990s, Telstra New Zealand, the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand, owned the naming rights to the building. After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form TelstraClear, the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building. The building's naming rights were sold to The Radio Network and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB, a subsidiary of The Radio Network, was displayed on the building. The Canterbury region was hit by a series of earthquakes, and the office building was damaged beyond repair by the earthquake on 22 February 2011. About 400 people worked in the building before the earthquakes. Following the earthquakes, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) was set up to manage the recovery process. Preparation On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to the list of buildings to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The large number of tall buildings still to be demolished in Christchurch made the implosion of Radio Network House a test case, as the technique had not been applied to New Zealand buildings before. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with. Before demolition, buildings are stripped of their contents, including internal plasterboard linings. As the fees for dumping demolition waste have risen since the earthquakes, it is more economical for demolition contractors to produce 'clean' demolition material. Holes were drilled into support columns of the building and filled with a total of some of explosives, which when set off, would destroy the support structure and cause the collapse of the building. A challenge for the demolition contractor was that explosives available in New Zealand are low-velocity and low-energy. A representative from Ceres stated that the implosion would shorten the demolition process by some six weeks and would save money. Costs were around NZ$1m for the implosion, compared to some NZ$1.2m for a conventional demolition, with the owner's building insurance covering the costs. The owner of the building, however, stated that the implosion was not a cheaper option for his company than a conventional demolition, but it \\"would save others thousands\\". He likened the consent process to Christopher Columbus wanting to sail to America, with everybody telling him that it could not be done. The owner of the Westende building, on the corner of Manchester and Worcester Street and some away from Radio Network House, threatened to seek a court injunction against the implosion. He raised concerns about potential seismic activity, possible damage to his new building, and noxious contaminants transferred by dust. The original Westende building had been destroyed in the first earthquake in 2010 and was one of the very few new buildings in the centre of Christchurch to have been rebuilt already. The concerns were dismissed by the demolition contractors and the threatened court action did not eventuate. Auction Proceeds from the auction have gone to the restoration of the Isaac Theatre Royal in Christchurch, which reopened in 2014 Soon after the announcement was made that the implosion had been approved, it was reported that the demolition contractors considered putting the right to push the button for the implosion up for auction, with the proceeds going to charity. \\"I've seen them go for $6,000\\" is how one of the company representatives was quoted, but the issue of liability needed to be worked through. The auction was set up on the internet auction website Trade Me and went live on Tuesday, 24 July, at 11 am. It was set up with a $1 reserve (meaning that theoretically, the right to push the button could have been sold for just $1). The auction was hugely popular and within one hour, bidding had reached $6,000. Bidding reached $30,000, but some bids were considered illegitimate and Trade Me staff removed them, and in other cases, bidders themselves requested to be removed. When the auction closed, it had received the third highest number of viewers of Trade Me auctions, at 459,420 views. The winning bid was $26,000, placed by a consortium of eight demolition contractors who at the time were undertaking demolitions in the Christchurch Central City (D Construction, Dormer Construction, Jurgens Demolition, March Construction, Pro Tranz Contracting, Clampet Developments, Shilton and Brown Demolition, and Ward's Demolition). They gave the right to choose a person to push the button to the Child Cancer Foundation, who nominated a six-year-old boy from Queenstown. The charity chosen to receive the proceeds of the auction was the Canterbury Earthquake Heritage Buildings Fund, who passed the funds to the Isaac Theatre Royal in Gloucester Street, a heritage building registered as Category I by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (since renamed to Heritage New Zealand). The Government of New Zealand pledged to match donations towards the restoration of heritage buildings dollar for dollar, so the final amount received by the Isaac Theatre Royal was NZ$52,000. The restored Isaac Theatre Royal reopened in November 2014. Implosion Close up of the Radio Network House rubble showing the Newstalk ZB logo The demolition companies, on the day prior to the implosion, advised the public to stay away for health and safety reasons, and watch the proceedings on TV or the internet. Several television stations had live streams of the event, and The Press announced that they would post a video on their website shortly after the implosion. An exclusion zone was put in place to ensure that nobody would be within approximately of the building. Despite the advice, thousands of onlookers filled the street on the morning of 5 August, a Sunday. Punctually at 8 am, a series of short explosions were heard, followed by another series a couple of seconds later. The building collapsed towards the north as planned, and the implosion manager from Controlled Demolition, Inc. said that it went a bit further than he had hoped, so he was lucky. The explosions were heard around Christchurch. One of CERA's objectives in approving the implosion was to find out how the soil behaved, as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12 mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site. With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, it will be much easier for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA. Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a \\"target- rich environment\\". Only the Christchurch Central Police Station has since been demolished by implosion, in May 2015. The implosion attracted global attention, with media in Australia, Canada, Ireland, South Africa and the United States covering the event.

Timberlake (March 22, 1846 ‚Äì February 21, 1891) was an American law enforcement officer, Civil War soldier, farmer and rancher who served as a deputy U.S. marshal for the Western District of Missouri. Timberlake is best known for being the chief enforcer and investigator against the James-Younger Gang, beginning in the 1870s, which culminated in the death of the outlaw Jesse James on April 3, 1882, at the hands of Robert Ford. Life and career James Timberlake was born on March 22, 1846 in Platte County, Missouri, to farmer John Timberlake and his wife Patsy Noland. Timberlake remained at home to help on his family farm until 1864, when he joined the cavalry division of the Army of Missouri, under the command of Colonel Alonzo W. Slayback in the American Civil War. Timberlake became a second lieutenant and participated in a number of engagements under the command of General Joseph O. Shelby.History of Clay and Platte Counties, Missouri. St. Louis: National Historical Company, 1885. ASIN B00679V9QM. p. 368-9. Following the surrender of the Confederate States of America, Timberlake accompanied Shelby and his one thousand-plus men into Mexico to pledge allegiance to Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Maximilian declined this offer, but granted land to the troops.Arthur, Anthony: General Jo Shelby's March, Stewart Printing and Publishing Co., Marble Hill, Missouri, 2010. . In December 1865, Timberlake abandoned his life in Mexico and returned to Missouri to continue farming and raising stock. On November 25, 1874, Timberlake was married to Katie Thomason, the daughter of Grafton Thomason, who was a founder of Liberty, Missouri. In 1876, Timberlake was appointed constable of Liberty, but was discharged in 1878 so that he could be appointed as the new county sheriff. When the James-Younger Gang rose to prominence in the 1870s, Timberlake teamed up with Kansas City's Police commissioner Henry H. Craig to investigate and pursue the outlaws. Timberlake became the primary investigator of the gang and soon gained recognition from Governor Thomas Theodore Crittenden, who claimed Timberlake was largely responsible for the dissolution of the gang in 1882. In January 1882, outlaws Robert Ford, Charles Ford and Dick Liddil surrendered to Timberlake at the Fords' sister, Martha Bolton's residence in Ray County, Missouri, on the condition that they would receive full pardons and $10,000 in reward money, in exchange for the death or imprisonment of the gang's ringleader, Jesse James.Stiles, T.J.: Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War, Vintage, 2003. . Robert Ford directed Timberlake to Adairville, Kentucky, where he arrested Jesse James' cousin, Clarence Hite on February 11, 1882.Gilmore, Donald: Riding Vengeance With the James Gang, Pelican Publishing Company, 2009. . p. 355 On March 24, 1882, Timberlake detailed a plan he designed in collaboration with Crittenden, which entailed that the Fords would have ten days to apprehend James, or else the pardon and reward would not stand. When Robert Ford killed James on April 3, 1882, Crittenden resented that an apprehension was not made and paid the majority of the reward to Timberlake. Following the death of Jesse James, Timberlake, along with the other conspirators in the mission to assassinate James found their reputations ruined, due in large to the nature in which James was killed. Timberlake, having completed his second term as county sheriff, declined to run for re-election, in favor of running for county collector, but was soundly defeated, thanks to a smear campaign run by supporters of James' cause.Hansen, Ron: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Harper Perennial, 1997. . p. 345 He retreated to New Mexico, where he and his brother maintained successful ranches. However, Timberlake returned to Missouri in 1883, when he was reappointed deputy U.S. marshal for the Western District of Missouri by Crittenden. He resigned soon after his wife died, however, and returned to farming and remained working at the stables until he died from an opioid overdose of morphine, prompted by his insomnia, on February 21, 1891.

He was known for his commitment to social commentary and psychological depictions of Jewish themes and characters. In 1914, at the age of 45, Pilichowski emigrated to Great Britain. He served as president of the Association of Polish Jews in London. From 1926 until his death, he was also the president of the Ben Uri Art Society. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the National Museums in Krak√≥w and Warsaw and the City Museum of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. More representative work is held at the Jewish Museum of New York (\\"Sukkot\\"). Life Pilichowski was born in Pi≈Ça near Sieradz in central Poland (some sources list the village of Zadzim close to Pi≈Ça). He began his art education with painter Szmul (Samuel) Hirszenberg, his relative, in the nearby metropolitan city of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He continued art studies in Warsaw with Professor Wojciech Gerson (1886), then in Munich, at the Academy of Fine Arts, and in Paris, at the Acad√©mie Julian. While in France, he also exhibited his paintings for the first time. In 1894, he had his first solo exhibition in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Pilichowski settled in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ around 1894, and began to produce his first engaging paintings about Jewish life in an industrialized environment. He portrayed peddlers, migrants, exhausted travellers at railway stations and dignified mourners at funerals. He also depicted Jewish prayers, gatherings, festivals and holy days. Pilichowski became an active Zionist around 1908 and turned to political portraiture of Zionist leaders. He moved to Paris in 1904, and to London a decade later, with his wife and young children. He visited Mandate Palestine in 1925. While there, he produced a monumental painting showing some 120 people for the opening of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a group portrait which included himself. Back in London, he also painted impoverished Jews from the Whitechapel district. Pilichowski was married to Lena Pilichowski in Poland and had 4 children while in France. He died in London either in 1933 (according to some), or more likely in 1934.

Derivatives of the Seabee system, she and her sister ship, Tibor Szamueli, were built in the late 1970s by the Finnish state-owned shipbuilder Valmet in Vuosaari shipyard. As the demand for lighter transport fell in the 1990s, she was sold and eventually broken up in Alang in 2003. Yulius Fuchik was featured in the 1986 techno-thriller Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond.Good Bye, Tom Clancy. Suomen Sotilas 2/2011, page 90.  History  = Development and construction = In the 1970s, the Soviet authorities issued a request for tenders for the construction of a vessel capable of carrying 25 to 30 barges with displacement of 1,300 tons. At that time, the Soviet Union had the most extensive inland waterway system in the world and the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal connecting the North Sea to the Black Sea was expected to open in the near future. Together with the increasing oil prices, the development of efficient barge-carrying systems with high loading and unloading rate generated considerable interest in the Soviet Union.'Yulius Fucik'. The Motor Ship, March 1979. Pages 78‚Äì81. The contract for two ships was awarded to the Finnish state-owned shipbuilding company Valmet and was, at the time, the largest single contract made by a Finnish industrial company at FIM 700 million (US$200 million). Although Valmet had been developing its own barge handling system, it was agreed that the proven American Seabee concept would be adopted instead of the shipyard's own design due to the relatively short timescale before delivery. The Soviets purchased two sets of drawings from the American owners for US$1 million.Russians Get U.S. Ship Plans. Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 29 October 1975. However, a number of changes were made to the original design, and as a result the design costs accounted for some 25 percent of the man-hours spent on the project. The work included extensive model testing, which resulted in the adoption of a bulbous bow that alone increased the ships' service speed by 0.5 knots. Yulius Fuchik, named after a Czech journalist, was launched on 3 March 1978 and handed to V/O Sudoimport, the Soviet foreign trade organization with a monopoly for the foreign trade of ships, on 20 October of the same year. At the time of her delivery, she was the most expensive ship ever constructed by a Finnish shipyard.Valkonen, M.

The ships were later followed by two smaller feeder-type barge carriers, Boris Polevoy and Pavel Antokolskiy, in the 1980s. = Career = Tibor Szamueli, the sister ship of Yulius Fuchik, moored at Ust-Dunaysk, Ukraine, on 25 August 1992. Yulius Fuchik and her sister ship were operated by Interlighter, a company founded in May 1978 by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia with the sole purpose of transporting lighters without transshipment between the countries along the Danube river and the countries in South and South-East Asia.The historical background of the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company. Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company. The transportation service was offered under the brand \\"Danube-Sea Line\\". The barges carried by Yulius Fuchik were loaded in various ports along the Danube river and then pushed downstream to Sulina, Romania, where they were loaded in the ship. They were mainly transported to the Mekong Delta, a voyage that took around 18 days, and pushed upstream as far as Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for unloading. Occasionally, lighters were also carried to Karachi, Pakistan; Bombay, India; and Penang, Malaysia. The service continued until the early 1990s, when the demand for lighters dropped and the ships were laid up.TIBOR SAMUELI - IMO 7505334. Comment by Marek Gono. The subsequent career of the Finnish-built barge carriers is unclear. Both Yulius Fuchik and Tibor Szamueli were sold in the late 1990s and renamed Production Driller and Development Driller respectively. Despite the names, it is uncertain if the ships were ever converted or otherwise used for offshore drilling. After the alleged plans for using the barge carriers to transport rolling stock from the United States to the Latin America fell through, the ships were laid up in Piraeus, Greece.Infoflot.ru Forum. Photograph of Production Driller in Piraeus . The ships changed hands again in 2002. Production Driller was renamed Asian Alliance and Development Driller became Asian Reliance. It is unknown if the specialized barge carriers, already close to the end of their economic life, were used for transporting cargo. Both ships were sold for scrap in 2003 \\"as is\\" in Eleusis, Greece.Search Results. celship.com. Asian Alliance was renamed Alliance and broken up in Alang, India, while Asian Reliance was rechristened Reliance and then C Reliance, and scrapped on Gadani Beach, Pakistan.  Design  = General characteristics = Yulius Fuchik was long overall and between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and her depth to the upper deck was . From keel to mast, she measured . The draft of the ship when loaded to the summer load line was , corresponding to displacement of 60,262 tons. Her gross register tonnage was 35,817 register tons, net register tonnage 15,497 register tons and deadweight tonnage 37,850 tons.USSR MORFLOT Cargo Ships, Part 2, pages 87‚Äì88. In terms of the main dimensions, Yulius Fuchik was slightly wider than the older Seabee ships, but otherwise her main dimensions were nearly identical to the original design. The general arrangements of Yulius Fuchik were largely dictated by the cargo handling system. The superstructure, spanning across the weather deck, housed only part of the ship's accommodation space. The entire crew of 50 was housed in single cabins, most of them located within the narrow side compartments on both sides of the cargo decks. In addition to normal messes and saloons, the amenities of the ship also included sports and hobby rooms, library, sauna, photographic laboratory and even a swimming pool.'Yulius Fuchik'. Shipping World & Shipbuilder, January 1979. = Cargo capacity = Yulius Fuchik belonged to the distinct group of cargo ships known as barge carriers which offered, at the time, the highest theoretical loading and unloading rate of all cargo ships. The lighter aboard ship (LASH) system was based on unpowered barges, also known as lighters, that were loaded on board a larger vessel for transport between inland waterways separated by open seas. For this purpose, Yulius Fuchik had vast cargo decks and a large lifting platform in the stern. Although the basic design of the ship was based on existing Seabee ships with a capacity of 38 1,000-ton lighters, Yulius Fuchik was designed for 26 slightly different \\"Danube-Sea barges\\" weighing 1,300 tons each. Both the lower deck and the 'tweendeck could accommodate eight barges, two side by side, while the longer weather deck had enough space for ten barges, each capable of carrying 1,070 tons of cargo. The barges were moved longitudinally in the cargo holds on remote-controlled platforms. Although the bottom deck, located below the waterline at maximum draught, was protected by a watertight stern door, flooding it while the ship was underway would not have compromised the stability of the vessel. The most striking feature of the ship was the lifting platform in the stern, abaft from the propellers and rudders, which was supported by high cantilever structures on both sides. Although the arrangement was similar to the original Seabee design, the \\"Syncrolift\\" cargo elevator was electric instead of hydraulic. Eight winches in four pairs were capable of hoisting 2,600 tons of cargo at a speed of 0.7 metres per minute ( per minute), giving the ship a calculated loading capacity of about 2,600 tons per hour in optimum conditions.Tibor Szamuely - erikoinen laiva. Tekniikan Maailma 5/1980. In addition to the purpose-built barges, Yulius Fuchik could also carry other types of cargo. Although each barge could be loaded with 15 standard 20-foot shipping containers, they could also be carried on the cargo decks and even moved around with the barge-handling equipment. Using special container adapters on the cargo rails, Yulius Fuchik could carry 1,312 loaded containers plus an additional 240 empty containers on the upper deck stacks, bringing the total container capacity to . In addition, 54 LASH-type barges (the type used by the nuclear-powered Sevmorput) could be carried with another set of adapters, and the decks were strengthened for ro-ro cargo with axle loads up to 22 tons. Furthermore, the ship carried two pusher tugs for handling the barges.Four 600-HP Pusher Tugs Completed By Valmet. Maritime Reporter. = Power and propulsion = Yulius Fuchik was powered by four 16-cylinder W√§rtsil√§-Pielstick 16PC2-5V400 medium-speed diesel engines located amidships, each producing at 504 rpm. The engines were coupled via double input/single output reduction gearboxes to two KaMeWa controllable pitch propellers turning at 135 rpm. The propeller shafts were of considerable length, and thus had to be supported by six bearings. The propulsion system gave the ship a maximum speed of , but her typical service speed was slightly less, . Underway, the ship burned heavy fuel oil at a rate of 128 tons per day. The propulsion system of Yulius Fuchik was the largest deviation from the original Seabee design which utilized a single steam turbine coupled to a fixed pitch propeller instead of the twin shaft diesel power plant. For maneuvering at ports, Yulius Fuchik was also equipped with a 900kW bow thruster. Onboard electricity was produced by four six-cylinder medium-speed Valmet-B&W; 6S28 diesel alternators, each generating 1,250 kVA.  In popular culture  Yulius Fuchik played a prominent role in the 1986 techno-thriller Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond. In the novel, she was disguised as the American-flagged Seabee carrier Doctor Lykes and used to transport Soviet troops to Keflavik, Iceland. In order to conform with the slightly different silhouette of the Lykes Lines ship, parts of her superstructure were removed and the shape of the funnels was altered with prefabricated parts. Furthermore, the twenty-foot Interlighter markings on the side of the ship were painted over and replaced with \\"Lykes Lines,\\" and the white L on a blue diamond of the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company emblem was added on the forward superstructure. Later in the book, Yulius Fuchik was spotted by an American P-3C Orion shortly after launching four Lebed class hovercraft from her cargo deck. After an SA-7 surface-to-air missile launched from the ship failed to hit the Orion, the American plane retaliated with a Harpoon anti- ship missile and called in two F-15s to strafe the ship with their 20 mm cannons. The damaged Yulius Fuchik eventually reached the port of Keflavik and, after running aground during the approach, slowly settled to the bottom next to the quay in water only a few feet deeper than the draught of the vessel.

It was much less damaging than its predecessor, and most of the storms in the season remained over water or only brushed land. The first system was Tropical Depression A1, which formed in October and passed north of Madagascar. The first named storm was Albertine, which formed on November 23 in the northeastern portion of the basin and became one of three intense tropical cyclones. The last storm was Marlene, which was also an intense tropical cyclone and dissipated on April 11\\\\. Most of the storms originated from the intertropical convergence zone. In late December into early January, tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted to the east of Madagascar, undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with each other. Later in January, Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones, but weakened before passing near Rodrigues. Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the Mozambique Channel toward the end of January, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region. In February, Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues, and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from Australian region. Later in the month, Ingrid brought strong winds to Mauritius. Tropical storms Josta and Kylie developed toward the beginning of March from the same overall system, affecting Madagascar and R√©union, respectively. After they dissipated, Tropical Depression Lidy caused flooding and damage on Rodrigues due to heavy rainfall.

In the year, MFR tracked tropical cyclones south of the equator from the coast of Africa to 90¬∞ E. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued warnings in an unofficial capacity. Several of the storms in the season affected the island of Rodrigues, an outer island of Mauritius; however, only one - Tropical Depression Lidy - caused damage after dropping heavy rainfall. The season as a whole was much less damaging than the preceding season. There were 58 days in which a storm or cyclone was active, 17 above normal. There were 11 systems that became moderate tropical storms, two above the normal of 9. The six tropical cyclones - a storm with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) - was also above the average of five. Systems =Intense Tropical Cyclone Albertine= The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) became active toward the end of November, spawning a low pressure area on November 23 about 400 km (250 mi) east of Diego Garcia. This system quickly organized into a tropical disturbance, aided by favorable conditions. On November 24, the JTWC began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 02S. The next day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Albertine while moving southwestward, steered by a ridge to the southeast. Late on November 25, an eye developed in the center of the convection, and Albertine intensified to tropical cyclone status the next day. The eye gradually became better organized, attaining a diameter of 90 km (55 mi) on November 28 as Albertine became an intense tropical cyclone. At that time, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), with gusts to . In contrast, the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). After moving over an area of cool water temperatures, Albertine quickly weakened and lost its well-defined eye. On November 30, the center passed about northwest of Rodrigues after weakening to severe tropical storm status. After weakening gradually, the storm began deteriorating faster due to increasing wind shear. A polar low steered Albertine southeastward until absorbing the system on December 3. In its formative stages, Albertine brushed Diego Garcia with gusts of 63 km/h (39 mph). On Rodridgues, Albertine produced peak gusts of , along with heavy rainfall, causing some damage. The island was under a cyclone watch for 39 hours, the first of the warning system set up by MFR during the season. =Moderate Tropical Storm Christelle= Toward the end of December, the equatorial trough spawned two areas of convection - one persisted southwest of Diego Garcia, which would become Tropical Storm Bentha, and the other persisted between Agalega and the Farquhar Group in the Seychelles. The latter system organized into Tropical Disturbance B1 on December 27, but wind shear in the region prevented significant development and dislocated the center from the thunderstorms. A ridge to the southeast steered the disturbance slowly southwestward toward Madagascar. As it neared the country, the system turned westward and intensified into a tropical depression after developing a spiral band of convection. On January 2, the depression made landfall near Antalaha in northeastern Madagascar, and quickly weakened over land. The system moved to the northeast and looped back to the east, influenced by developing Tropical Storm Bentha. On January 4, after Bentha was named, the system was renamed Tropical Disturbance C1. Convection gradually reorganized over the center as the two storms interacted and moved cyclonically around each other. The disturbance intensified after Bentha began weakening, becoming Tropical Storm Christelle on January 5. On the next day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 07S. Christelle slowly intensified as it turned more to the south, becoming the dominant system after absorbing Bentha. A warm spot formed in the center of the convection, and the MFR estimated peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) on January 6. The same wind shear that weakened Bentha caused Christelle to deteriorate on January 7\\\\. The center passed near Mauritius on January 8 as a tropical depression. Two days later, a cold front steered the system to the southeast, absorbing it after Christelle became extratropical on January 11. Both Bentha and Christelle brought gusty winds and rainfall to Mauritius, and caused R√©union to be under a cyclone watch for five days. The system also produced rainfall and landslides in Madagascar. =Moderate Tropical Storm Bentha= The same broad system that spawned Christelle also produced an area of convection southwest of Diego Garcia toward the end of December. On January 1, the convection began organizing, aided by an anticyclone aloft, and it became a tropical depression on the next day. The system quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bentha on January 3 while moving generally southwestward. Also on that day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 06S. On January 4, Bentha attained peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and on the same day the storm began interacting with developing Tropical Storm Christelle to the west. On January 5, increased shear weakened Bentha, and by the following day the storm deteriorated into a tropical depression. The system passed about 250 km (155 mi) north of R√©union on January 6, dissipating shortly thereafter near Tromelin Island while being absorbed into Christelle. Both Bentha and Christelle brought gusty winds and rainfall to Mauritius, and caused R√©union to be under a cyclone watch for five days. =Intense Tropical Cyclone Dorina= The ITCZ spawned an area of convection and a vortex in the northeastern portion of the basin on January 18, which organized into a tropical disturbance that day. It initially moved southeastward under the influence of the monsoon, although it gradually recurved back to the southwest. On January 19, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Dorina, and on the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Dorina quickly intensified into a tropical cyclone by January 21, developing a 40 km (25 mi) eye in the center of the convection. Later that day, the storm became an intense tropical cyclone, less than three days after its development; such a quick time to attain that intensity is unusual for the basin. At 18:00 UTC on January 21, Dorina attained peak winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), according to the MFR, and 185 km/h (115 mph) according to the JTWC. After moving over an area of cooler waters, Dorina began weakening, indicated by the previously well-defined eye becoming ragged. On January 24, the cyclone weakened into a severe tropical storm. The motion became more west-southwesterly after the ridge weakened. A passing trough increased shear over Dorina, which caused further weakening and for the convection to deteriorate. However, conditions became more favorable on January 27, allowing Dorina to re-intensify slightly as it redeveloped an eye feature. On that day, the storm passed about 250 km (155 mi) south of Rodrigues, producing gusts of 115 km/h (70 mph). Subsequently, Dorina turned back to the southwest and later to the south, influenced by another passing trough that had absorbed Tropical Storm Fodah. Strong wind shear caused the storm to weaken again. On January 31, Dorina became extratropical while turning to the southeast and was later absorbed into the trough. =Severe Tropical Storm Fodah= After the remnants of Tropical Depression Eliceca dissipated over Madagascar, an area of disturbed weather persisted over the Mozambique Channel, spawning a low pressure area near Juan de Nova Island on January 21\\\\. Convection greatly increased on the next day, indicating the system became a tropical disturbance. Moving southward, the system became a tropical depression on January 23 as the system organized further, aided by an anticyclone aloft. On January 24, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fodah while near Europa Island, and soon after became a severe tropical storm. The MFR estimated peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), while the JTWC, which initiated advisories that day as Tropical Cyclone 09S, estimated winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Gusts on Europa Island were less than 110 km/h (70 mph), despite the storm being nearby. A strong band of convection spread along the Madagascar coastline, producing gusts of 180 km/h (110 mph) at Morombe. Fodah also produced of rainfall, as well as high seas. Moving around the ridge, Fodah continued southward, encountering stronger wind shear on January 25\\\\. Steady weakening commenced as the convection deteriorated, and Fodah became extratropical on January 26\\\\. A trough turned the remnants to the southeast, absorbing it on January 29. =Tropical Cyclone Gail= The ITCZ spawned an area of convection near Diego Garcia that became a tropical disturbance on January 31\\\\. The system slowly organized due to wind shear in the region, and it moved slowly for several days. On February 4, the disturbance became a tropical depression after the convection organized slightly. Intensification became more rapid on the next day after conditions became more favorable, allowing the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Gail. Also on February 5, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as Tropical Cyclone 10S. Gail quickly strengthened while moving southwestward, developing a small, poorly-defined eye in the center of the convection. On February 7, it attained tropical cyclone status, reaching peak winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Increasing shear caused Gail to weaken, beginning on February 8\\\\. That night, the center passed less than 30 km (20 mi) north of Rodrigues. Gail maintained its intensity as a severe tropical storm after the shear decreased slightly. A trough turned the storm to the south on February 10 and caused weakening, resulting in Gail's dissipation on the next day. While Gail approached the island of Rodrigues, the storm produced winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and gusts to at Port Mathurin. =Moderate Tropical Storm Heida= As Gail was developing, the ITCZ spawned another disturbance in the Australian region on February 3\\\\. On the next day, it crossed 90¬∞ E into the south-west Indian Ocean as a tropical depression. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Heida on February 5 while moving west-southwestward, although the convection never organized beyond a disorganized central dense overcast. The JTWC initiated advisories that day as Tropical Cyclone 11S, and Heida quickly attained peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Wind shear in the region caused the storm to weaken into a tropical depression, although Heida briefly re- intensified into a tropical storm on February 6\\\\. A trough in the region steered the circulation to the south-southwest and increased wind shear, resulting in Heida's dissipation on February 8. =Tropical Cyclone Ingrid= On February 22, a tropical disturbance formed southwest of Diego Garcia. It moved westward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ingrid on February 24. That day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 13S. Ingrid turned more to the southwest while passing just east of St. Brandon, where winds reached 56 km/h (35 mph). After continued intensification, the storm became a tropical cyclone on February 26 while passing between Mauritius and Rodrigues. On Mauritius, winds gusted to 91 km/h (56 mph) at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport, and the storm produced high waves. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), while the JTWC estimated winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Ingrid turned to the southeast and weakened, becoming extratropical on March 1. =Severe Tropical Storm Josta= An extended series of low pressure areas spawned what would become Tropical Storm Josta on March 5 near the Comoros in the northern Mozambique Channel. It initially drifted westward while slowly organizing, becoming a tropical storm on March 7. On that day, the JTWC classified Josta as Tropical Cyclone 16S. On March 8, Josta approached the coast of Mozambique within 90 km (55 mi) of Pemba before turning abruptly to the east-southeast. The convection fluctuated in intensity, eventually becoming better organized on March 9\\\\. That day, an eye feature formed in the center of the convection, and the MFR estimated peak winds of 105 km/h (65 mph). By contrast, the JTWC upgraded Josta to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The eye feature dissipated soon after due to increased shear, causing Josta to weaken. On March 10, the storm re-intensified slightly, aided by the monsoon, as it passed 160 km (100 mi) south of Mayotte. It again weakened soon thereafter, with the convection spreading ahead of the circulation over Madagascar. On March 12, the circulation dissipated off the northwest coast of Madagascar, partially due to the influence of the stronger Kylie to the southeast. Rains from the storm reached along the coast of Madagascar, despite the storm not making landfall. =Moderate Tropical Storm Kylie= The same overall system that spawned Josta also produced a disturbance on March 6 off the east coast of Madagascar. While drifting southeastward within a trough, the system slowly organized until becoming a tropical storm on March 7, the same day that the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 17S. On the next day, the system was named Kylie as it meandered to the north of Mauritius without further strengthening. The convection organized on March 10 into a central dense overcast, and the next day attained peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), according to the MFR. By contrast, the JTWC assessed Kylie as becoming much stronger, reaching winds of 160 km/h (100 mph). Subsequently, a trough turned the storm to the southwest, bringing it over the island of R√©union on March 13\\\\. Increased wind shear deteriorated the convection as the storm turned to the southeast on March 14\\\\. The next day, Kylie was absorbed by the trough. On R√©union, Kylie produced rainfall along with gusts of over 100 km/h (65 km/h), along with high waves. The storm prompted classes to be canceled, as well as for the airport to be closed, causing flights to be canceled. =Intense Tropical Cyclone Marlene= The final storm of the season formed on March 29 from the ITCZ to the east of Diego Garcia. The large area of convection quickly became more organized, intensifying into Tropical Storm Marlene on March 30. On that date, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S. Marlene continued to strengthen as it moved west-southwestward, aided by a surge in the monsoon. An eye formed on March 31, and on the next day the storm became a tropical cyclone. The eye reached a diameter of 25 km (15 mi), embedded within a well-defined central dense overcast. Later on April 1, Marlene became an intense tropical cyclone, just three days after its genesis. That day, it turned to the south due to a passing trough. Less favorable conditions caused Marlene to weaken on April 2, although it re-intensified the next day. The MFR estimated peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), and the JTWC estimated winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). The trough that turned it to the south later caused the cyclone to weaken and for the eye to dissipate. On April 5, Marlene was downgraded into a severe tropical storm and subsequently drifted to the northwest, influenced by a ridge behind the trough. Two days later, the storm turned to the southeast and later to the east, gradually weakening into a tropical depression. On April 11, a passing trough absorbed Marlene in the eastern periphery of the basin. =Other systems= Satellite image of Tropical Depression A1 On October 1, an area of convection developed about Seychelles at a low latitude. Moving southwestward, the system organized into Tropical Disturbance A1 on October 2, the first of the season. A small central dense overcast subsequently developed over the circulation. A ridge to the south steered the disturbance westward, bringing it just north of the Farquhar Group. On October 5, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, reaching peak winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear dissipated the convection as the rapidly weakening depression passed north of Madagascar. On October 7, the circulation dissipated. There were two other disturbances between October and late November. There was a tropical disturbance in the first two weeks of January before Dorina formed. Later in the month, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection in the northern Mozambique Channel near the Comoros. A circulation formed within the system on January 20 near the western coast of Madagascar, quickly becoming a tropical depression. That day, the Meteorological Service of Madagascar named the system Eliceca, but the depression quickly moved inland and dissipated. Two disturbances formed in February after the development of Heida and before Ingrid formed. The ITCZ later produced a disturbance northeast of Rodrigues after Kylie dissipated on March 14\\\\. It intensified into a tropical depression as it moved southwestward. Due to the threat to Rodrigues, the Mauritius Meteorological Service named the depression Lidy on March 15, although wind shear in the region prevented further strengthening. It produced gusty winds while passing near Rodrigues on March 16, and subsequently looped near the island. Convection from Lidy produced of rainfall, causing flooding in some areas on Rodrigues. The rains caused erosion and the most damage on the island of any storm in the season. Later, Lidy drifted to the west in the trade winds, dissipating on March 20 to the north of R√©union. After Lidy, there was one final non-developing disturbance. Storm names A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55¬∞E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55¬∞E and 90¬∞E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year, so no names are retired. { width=\\"90%\\"  *Albertine *Bentha *Christelle *Drina *Eliceca *Fodah *Gail *Heida  *Ingrid *Josta *Kylie *Lidy *Marlene * *    * } See also *List of Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons *Atlantic hurricane seasons: 1994, 1995 *Pacific hurricane seasons: 1994, 1995 *Pacific typhoon seasons: 1994, 1995 *North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons: 1994, 1995 *1994‚Äì95 South Pacific cyclone season *1994‚Äì95 Australian region cyclone season References Category:South-West Indian Ocean cyclone seasons Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"1994‚Äì95 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season"},{"id":"36650736","text":"Diversion Books, originally founded as a digital publisher in 2010, publishes up to forty titles per year in physical, digital, audio and other formats.

Built in the late nineteenth century, it has endured several major floods. Historic context Milton and the surrounding portions of Trimble County are a hilly region located along the Ohio River. The area's first settlers arrived in 1785, when it was still part of Virginia, and Milton was incorporated four years later. River commerce was always an important part of the local economy: across the river from Milton is the city of Madison, which was an early commercial center for Indiana, and a river ferry between the two settlements was started in 1804. The two cities have been connected by the Milton-Madison Bridge since 1929.Johnson, William Gus. '. National Park Service, 1982-11. Accessed 2012-08-06. By the middle of the 19th century, Milton's prosperity was evident in its business community, which included a factory, two blacksmith shops, a hotel, and several grocery stores. After the Civil War, economic growth was handicapped: the rise of rail transportation led to a decline in river traffic, and combined with the absence of a railroad in Trimble County, this led to economic weakness, including the closure of a Milton distillery that was the county's only industry. Despite their economic hardships, Milton residents erected a surprising number of new buildings during the late nineteenth century. Their new construction was typically vernacular in style, in contrast to the high Greek Revival style that was popular before the Civil War. Unlike in previous decades, this period's new buildings often employed various small decorations, many of which were prefabricated; Ginn's Furniture is typical of this style, featuring small elements such as ornamentation on the windows and a cornice with brackets. Unfortunately, most of Milton's historic architecture has not survived to the present. Significant floods inundated the city repeatedly in the late nineteenth century, and almost everything in its downtown was destroyed. Architecture Ginn's Furniture was erected on an unknown date in the last quarter of the 19th century. Built of brick on a foundation of limestone,Johnson, William Gus.

The two-story facade is six bays wide and features many large windows on both stories situated between limestone lintels, while the sides are divided into eight bays. Individuals may enter the building through either of two entrances in the facade or through three doors on the side; the latter are equipped with sidelights. The entire building is covered by a hip roof, which is pierced by a chimney near each end. Inside, the most impressive element is a pressed tin ceiling, which is original to the building. Preservation In the early 1980s, Kentucky Heritage Council officials travelled throughout Trimble County to conduct a survey of its older buildings for historic preservation purposes. As a result of the survey, thirty-three buildings and one historic district in the county were nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as part of a multiple property submission, and all but one of them were added to the Register in 1983 and 1984. By that time, just six pre-1937 commercial buildings in the downtown were still in existence, including Ginn's Furniture Store. Accordingly, it was one of the buildings listed on the National Register in 1983, due largely to its place as a rare survivor among the earlier buildings in Milton's floodplain zone. Moreover, it was deemed to be the area's most significant building from an architectural point of view ‚Äî not just downtown, but citywide.

Cragun has been called a \\"prince of the ballet world\\" and \\"one of the most important dancers of the twentieth century.\\" Early life and training Born in Sacramento, California, Cragun was one three sons. His father was a college librarian As a child, he was very interested in both music and dance.Judith Cruickshank, \\"Richard Cragun Obituary\\", The Guardian (London), 10 August 2012. At age five, he began taking tap dance lessons . A few years later, Cragun decided to become a professional dancer after his father took him to see Singin' in the Rain (1952),. Donald O'Connor, one of the stars of the film, became Cragun's \\"first, absolute idol.\\"Paul Vitello, \\"Richard Cragun, Stuttgart Ballet Dancer, Dies at 67\\", obituary, International New York Times, 10 August 2012. Inspired to emulate O'Connor's lyrical, balletic style of tap dancing, Cragun took ballet classes As a teenager, Cragun received a scholarship to the Banff School of Fine Arts in Banff, Alberta. He studied there with Betty Farraly and Gweneth Lloyd. When Alexander Grant, was visiting Banff, he was impressed by Cragun's skills. He suggested Cragun apply to the Royal Ballet School in London. Cragun spent one year at the Royal Ballet school, working with Errol Addison and Harold Turner. At age 17, Cragun went to Copenhagen, Denmark, to privately train with Vera Volkova, who was responsible for polishing his remarkable classical technique.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Cragun, Richard\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). Performing career In 1962, Volkova recommended Cragun to John Cranko, director of the Stuttgart Ballet. Cranko hired him sight unseen, as a member of his corps de ballet. In 1965, soon after his appointment as principal dancer in Stuttgart, he began his dance partnership with Marcia Hayd√©e. Cragun and Hayd√©e performed Swan Lake, Onegin and The Taming of the Shrew. Their professional partnership at the Stuttgart Ballet lasted from 1965 until Cragun's retirement in 1996,.Horst Koegler, \\"Cragun, Richard\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, pp. 261‚Äì262. Besides his appearances with leading companies in Germany, Cragun danced in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Sweden, Italy, Canada, the United States, and Japan. In 1990, during the Stuttgart revival of the Broadway musical On Your Toes, Cragun exhibited his tap dancing skills.Craine and Mackrell \\"Cragun, Richard\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (2000).  Critical notices  Cragun was described as a big, handsome man, with a powerful physique who danced with dazzling virtuosity and distinct virility, a perfect foil for the brilliant technique and delicate femininity of Hayd√©e.John Gruen, \\"Stuttgart Profiles: Marcia Hayd√©e and Richard Cragun\\", Dance Magazine (New York), August 1975, pp. 71‚Äì76. Another description said that Cragun was blessed with a perfect physique for dancing, Cragun was a virtuoso of the ballet stage, equaled by only a few male dancers of his generation.Walter Terry, Great Male Dancers of the Ballet (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1978). He embodied the explosive, colorful form of classical ballet that was sometimes called \\"the Stuttgart style.\\" Flawless triple tours en l'air were his trademark, an athletic feat accomplished only by such bravura dancers as Edward Villella and Mikhail Baryshnikov on rare occasions.Alexander Bland and John Percival, Men Dancing: Performers and Performances (New York: Macmillan, 1984). Clive Barnes, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote, \\"He possesses tremendous elevation. There is a cumulative pulse and rhythmic beat to his dancing that is enormously impressive.\\" He won high praise for his performances in principal roles in Cranko's Romeo und Julia, Onegin, and, especially, The Taming of the Shrew. \\"Cragun was a strikingly handsome Petruchio, by turns self-mocking, overbearing, funny, and tender. The role suited his robustly masculine and charismatic stage personality and provided a first-class showcase for his virtuosity and partnering skills. No dancer has equaled him in the role.\\" Roles created In the course of his long career, Cragun created many roles in the ballets of John Cranko and other European choreographers. Among them are the following.Koegler, \\"Cragun, Richard\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 2, p. 262. =Ballets by Cranko= * 1963.

Personal life Cragun and Hayd√©e shared a romantic relationship and lived together for 16 years. The relationship broke up in 1977 when Cragun realized that he was a gay man. However the two remained friends and colleagues. Hayd√©e bore him no resentment. \\"Richard was one of the best dancers in the world\\", she said. \\"Even after our separation, we were the best of friends.\\" In later years, Cragun entered a relationship with Brazilian choreographer Roberto de Oliveira that lasted until Cragun's death. Later life In his later years with the Stuttgart Ballet, Cragun became one of the company's ballet masters .Hartmunt Regitz, \\"Ballettmeister Richard Cragun\\", Stuttgarter Ballett Annual 15/16 (1993), pp. 29‚Äì36. After finishing his dancing career, he became the ballet director of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. In 1999, after three unhappy years at the Deutsche Oper, he left the position. With Hayd√©e's encouragement, Cragun and de Oliveira moved to Brazil, where they launched DeAnima Ballet Contempor√°neo for youngsters from the black favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Cragun also became ballet director at the city's Teatro Municipal, where, he managed a company of 70 dancers and staged works from the Stuttgart repertory. A talented cartoonist, Cragun also mounted several exhibitions of his work in art galleries and other venues in the city.Klaus Hart, \\"Richard Cragun (1944‚Äì2012), T√§nzer, Ballettdirektor, Rio de Janeiro\\", Klaus Hart Brasilientexte, website, http://hart-brasilientexte.de/2009/06/08. Retrieved 21 December 2015. In 2005, Cragun suffered a stroke. His poor health was compounded by having HIV/AIDS. On 6 August 2012, Cragun suffered a seizure triggered by a lung infection. He was admitted to a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where he died soon after. A friend gave this report of Cragun's funeral: > \\"The most moving moment at yesterday's cremation ceremony in Rio came when > the flower-covered coffin began to move away, and Richard's friends and > admirers, led by Marcia Hayd√©e, stood, applauded, and cried out 'Bravo', as > they had so many times at the end of his magnificent performances.

It opened in 1982 and eventually closed in 1993 but it was preceded by Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery that put down most of the ground work for what would follow. History Tom Jancar and Richard Kuhlenschmidt opened Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in 1980. The Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery was located in the basement of the historic Los Altos Apartments on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The gallery measured 8‚Äô x 14‚Äô. The gallery was responsible for showing Los Angeles artists David Askevold, William Leavitt, and Christopher Williams (artist) as well as NY artists Louise Lawler and Richard Prince who are part of the Pictures Generation artists.

Richard Kuhlenschmidt Gallery began in 1982 and continued to focus on the Pictures Generation, most of these artists contacts were introduced during the Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery period, they are as follows Sherrie Levine, James Welling, Matt Mullican, Allan McCollum and James Casebere in addition to Douglas Huebler, one of the pioneers of conceptual art. Known for showing \\"art that was very difficult to sell\\", Kuhlenschmidt's gallery was described at the time as \\"the only gallery in Los Angeles devoted to showing artists who are principally influenced by intellectual and conceptual concerns.\\" In 1985, Kuhlenschmidt sponsored a benefit exhibition for AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) in tribute to friend and colleague Joe Bishop, a prominent writer and critic, whose death from AIDS had recently rocked the art world. The ‚ÄúJoe Bishop AIDS Benefit‚Äù exhibition included work by John Baldessari, Ross Bleckner, Robert Longo, David Salle, Cindy Sherman and Eric Fischl. Kuhlenschmidt moved his gallery to Santa Monica in 1988 as that city became a magnet for the burgeoning local art scene. In 1990, the gallery featured a major overview of works by the Viennese architectural firm, Coop Himmelb(l)au, which included a symposium ‚ÄúWelcome to the Millenium: Architecture Strikes Back‚Äù that included Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelblau, as well as notable Los Angeles architects Thom Mayne, Michael Rotondi and Eric Moss.

In service from 1910 until 1945, the vessel saw brief service as a hospital ship for the Royal Canadian Navy during World War I. In 1945 the ship caught fire in the harbour of Ketchikan, Alaska. The burned hulk was beached on Gravina Island where it remained for the next few years until it was towed to Seattle, Washington and broken up for scrap. Design and construction Ordered from Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd and constructed at their yard at Wallsend-on-Tyne with the yard number 859, the vessel was launched on 10 March 1910.Colledge, p. 499 Prince George had a gross register tonnage of 3,320 tons and was long between perpendiculars. The vessel had a beam of and a draught of . The passenger ship was propelled by two shafts, each driven by a four- cylinder triple expansion steam engine. Power was provided by two double-ended and two single-ended boilers creating under forced draught. This created and gave Prince George a maximum speed of .Hacking, p. 18 Prince George and Prince Rupert both initially burned coal; however, in 1912 they were converted to burn fuel oil. Prince George could carry 350 tons of cargo. The ship could accommodate 200 first class and 36 second class passengers. For excursions, up to 1,500 persons could be carried.Hacking, pp. 18, 20 Both Prince George and Prince Rupert were initially registered in Newcastle upon Tyne, but this was later changed to Prince Rupert, British Columbia.Hacking, p. 20 Service history Initially, Prince George and Prince Rupert served regular runs from Seattle to Victoria, Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Stewart, British Columbia. However, Seattle and Victoria were dropped from the route after a few years and Skagway, Alaska was added. On one of Prince Georges first trips up the coast, the passenger ship carried the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier to Prince Rupert for a government announcement. On 19 December 1910, Prince George went aground in the First Narrows. Later refloated, the vessel suffered only minor damage. On 14 October 1912, the ship was struck by the small fishing vessel Lief E in Puget Sound. The commander of Prince Rupert ordered boats lowered, which then towed the fishing vessel to Harbor Island, Seattle, where Lief E was beached.Guay, p. 101 After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Pacific coast of Canada was threatened by the possibility of German raiders attacking coastal shipping. The old Royal Canadian Navy cruiser was dispatched south in early August from Vancouver to cover the retreat of weaker Royal Navy vessels to Canadian waters after reports of German vessels along the west coast.Johnston et al., pp. 301‚Äì304 Due to the unknown nature of the force Rainbow might encounter, Prince George was taken over by the Royal Canadian Navy on 8 August and hurriedly outfitted as a 200-bed hospital ship. The ship was then sent south to provide support to the Canadian cruiser.Johnston et al., pp. 303‚Äì304Guay, p. 87 Sailing separately, Prince George was sighted by Rainbow and, due to hospital ship's three funnels and cruiser stern, initially mistaken for one of the German warships. This led the commander of Rainbow, Walter Hose to turn away and retreat. However, the identity of the ship was rectified and the two vessels returned to port. On 14 August, Prince George, sailing off the coast of Washington, encountered the sloop , one of the vessels Rainbow had been sent to cover. Rainbow joined the two ships and all three returned to port.Johnston et al., p. 307 Prince George was paid off as a hospital ship on 1 September and re-converted to a passenger vessel by her owners. In 1919 Grand Trunk Pacific Railway became insolvent and was placed under the management of Canadian National Railways (CN) in 1920. In 1923, Grand Trunk Pacific Railway had been absorbed by CN and by 1925, the vessel was made part of the Canadian National Steamship Company.Guay, p. 86 On 23 July 1920, the vessel struck the North Bluff in the Seymour Narrows. Able to make it to port under her own power, Prince George was out of service until 1 August. The vessel grounded twice more; on 30 December 1933 on Vadso Rock and 20 December 1937 off Princess Royal Island. =Fire and fate= On 22 September 1945 Prince George was lost after she caught fire while at dock at Ketchikan, Alaska. The vessel had docked at Ketchikan on a round-trip voyage from Prince Rupert. The ship docked at 8:10 am and at 8:20 am, the fire alarm began sounding after a fuel tank exploded aboard the ship. Firemen responded and fought the fire, but after an hour the crew and those passengers still on board the ship were ordered to evacuate. The vessel was pulled away from the pier by the tugboat General Kennedy and run aground on Gravina Island. Several United States Coast Guard vessels joined the attempt to extinguish the fire. They were unsuccessful, and the vessel continued to burn for the next couple of days, with the fire going out only after the superstructure collapsed. One crew member died in the fire, with the others returning to Prince Rupert on Prince George sister, Prince Rupert.

Established in 1985 by Fr√®re Boniface Tiguila, the monastery is currently home to 28 monks. Conventual Prior Fr Bernard Anat√© is the community's superior. History =Indigenous Origins= The monastic community of Agbang began with the initiative of Fr√®re Boniface Tiguila, who had joined the Benedictine monastery at Dzogbegan, Togo, in 1979. Fr√®re Boniface's experience at Dzogbegan convinced him that Benedictine monasteries in Africa must allow for Africanization. He envisaged a monastic community that was inspired by the African concepts of village and family. The community's monks would share a lifestyle that imitated the simplicity of ordinary rural people, while participating in the mission apostolate. With the support of the bishop of Sokod√©, Fr√®re Boniface left Dzogbegan in 1985 and began to recruit candidates for his ideal monastic community. Ten young men interested in Benedictine life soon gathered around Fr√®re Boniface. A village leader offered them 23ha of bushland in Agbang, a village 20 km from the district town of Kara. The nascent community began clearing the land, and built two simple houses, a small chapel, and a well. The community lived a simple monastic life, subsisting on their own efforts and offering hospitality to anyone who passed by. During a visit to Germany in 1987, Fr√®re Boniface spoke with Archabbot Notker Wolf about his goal of bringing the Benedictine life to Togo. Fr√®re Boniface expressed his desire to affiliate his monastery with a Benedictine Congregation that was committed to the mission apostolate. Archabbot Notker was intrigued, and in May 1988 traveled with Abbot Fidelis Ruppert to Togo to inspect Fr√®re Boniface's project in African monasticism. At Agbang, Archabbot Notker observed a young community leading a balanced life of work and prayer, in close contact with local villagers. The monks were engaged in primary evangelization of local non-Christians, while also catechizing the local Christian community. The monks of Agbang had integrated African customs and rituals into their methods of initiating candidates, welcoming guests, and celebrating feasts. Archabbot Notker and Abbot Fidelis were convinced that Agbang should be adopted into the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien. At the Congregation's 1988 Council, a formal decision was made committing the Missionary Benedictines to the task of accompanying the monastery of Agbang during its quest of establishing a genuinely African Benedictine community. Monks of the Congregation would be sent to Agbang to assist for short intervals. In 1989, Fr√®re Boniface took his temporary vows at St Ottilien. That same year, three novices made a commitment to monastic life in the form of a public promise at a ceremony in Agbang in the presence of Archabbot Notker. On November 9, 1991, the new foundation at Agbang was canonically erected. This same day, Fr√®re Boniface professed his solemn vows. =Later history= In 1992, the Monastery of the Incarnation was raised to the status of a simple priory. Fr√®re Boniface, by then ordained to the priesthood, became the community's first prior. In 2004, the monastery was raised to the status of a conventual priory. Dependencies *St Maurus and St Placidus Monastery, Kara, Roman Catholic Diocese of Kara: Established in 1992. *Cella St Boniface, Lom√©, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lom√©: Established in 2009. Personnel As of May 18, 2011, 18 solemnly professed monks (4 of them priests) resided at Agbang. At this time, the community also included nine temporally professed monks and one novice. Conventual Prior Fr Bernard Anat√© is the current superior of the monastic community. Upon his election in 2010, he became the second conventual prior of Ndanda.

The Mitcham War was a bloody conflict that occurred in Clarke County, Alabama in the early 1890s. The conflict was between rural farmers in remote section of Clarke County named Mitcham Beat and merchants in Coffeeville and other towns near the Mitcham Beat. Some accounts characterize the conflict as resulting from the 1892 elections that left rural whites disenfranchised and angry and resulting in racial violence. Around 1890, a group of young rural men formed a secret society called \\"Hell-at-the-Breech\\" that believed their local economy was being controlled by a small group. On December 25, 1892, the gang entered Coffeeville and murdered a prominent businessman. Soon a vigilante mob of 500 formed to seek the Hell-at-the-Breech murderers, and eventually killed 5 men. Different sources have the violence continuing until fall of 1893 after the Hell-at-the-breech disbanded or when the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot a prominent member of the Hell-at-the-Breech gang.

According to the French Ministry of Agriculture: \\"The Red Label certifies that a product has a specific set of characteristics establishing a superior level to that of a similar current product\\". Aquaculture In 1992, Scottish salmon was the first fish and first non-French product to be awarded the Label Rouge quality mark, the official endorsement by the French authorities of the superior quality of a food or farmed product, particularly with regard to taste. To obtain this recognition, a very stringent set of standards prepared by a group of producers must be approved. These standards establish the criteria which the product must meet throughout the production chain, including farming techniques, feed, processing and distribution. Approval is officially announced through a joint decree from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Consumer Affairs, on the recommendations of the National Institute for Origin and Quality (INAO). INAO is the French public body responsible for quality and origin marks relating to food products. Scottish Quality Salmon is the standard owner of Label Rouge No. LA 33/90. Compliance with the standards is controlled by an independent certifying body, Acoura, formerly Food Certification International Ltd. Suppliers of whole Label Rouge Scottish salmon and Label Rouge Scottish salmon portions can be found on the Label Rouge Saumon Ecossais website. A Quality Benchmark The quality manual for Label Rouge LA 33/90 specifies all the requirements for attaining this superior quality standard. The PGI manual defines the criteria for product origin. The following are significant elements of Label Rouge Scottish salmon‚Äôs exceptional quality:- * The feed is composed entirely of products of marine origin, vegetable materials, vitamins and carotenoids * The flesh contains a maximum of 16% lipid * An identification system is implemented to ensure traceability of the salmon throughout the production process up to point of sale, guaranteeing origin and compliance with the stringent production criteria * Freshness guaranteed by an \\"eat by date\\" of 10 days after harvesting * Salmon are reared in accordance with codes of best practice and with respect for fish welfare, the environment and sustainability * Maximum stocking density in seawater pens is 1.5% fish and 98.5% water * Guaranteed Scottish origin Full traceability The origin of each Label Rouge salmon can be identified through a sequentially numbered tag allocated by the certifying body. This tag is attached to the fish gill and includes the following information:- * The Label Rouge logo * The approval number * An individual identification number * A ‚Äúuse-by‚Äù date * The contact details of the certifying body In addition, each box carries a sequentially numbered label, also supplied by the certifying body.

It was commissioned by Abel Seyler for the Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft, and premiered on 28 May 1773 at the Hoftheater Weimar. Considered a milestone of German opera, it was revived in Weimar and recorded in 1999.  History  Christoph Martin Wieland, the poet and librettist Alceste was commissioned by Abel Seyler for the Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft. He was a strong proponent of German opera. Anton Schweitzer worked as a musical director for the company since 1769.Konrad Kratzsch, Klatschnest Weimar: Ernstes und Heiteres, Menschlich- Allzumenschliches aus dem Alltag der Klassiker, p. 48, K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2009, The opera was an effort to found a German opera style, while earlier operas in German had relied on Italian and French traditions, for example the lost Dafne by Heinrich Sch√ºtz, and the first extant opera in German, Das geistliche Waldgedicht oder Freudenspiel, genannt Seelewig by Sigmund Theophil Staden on a libretto by Georg Philipp Harsd√∂rffer, which is closely related to works of the Renaissance. The librettist and the composer had collaborated already for the ballets Idris und Zenide and Aurora, with Wieland compared to Metastasio. Wieland wrote several comments to the libretto of Alceste, including in his essay Versuch √ºber das Deutsche Singspiel, explaining his intentions to Charles Burney who was surprised on his musical trips through France, Italy and Germany that he found now German lyrical theatre. Wieland's goal was an \\"interessante Art von Schauspielen\\" (a more interesting form of plays) with a focus on \\"R√ºhrung\\" (emotional affect). Duchess Anna Amalie of Weimar wanted to establish a Nationalb√ºhne, a stage for plays and operas in German. Early pieces for such a theatre were the Singspiele Die Jagd by Johann Adam Hiller and Die Dorfgala by Schweitzer. Wieland and Schweitzer wanted to create in Alceste a work that could compete internationally. The librettist reduced the number of characters to four, and employed no choir. The opera is regarded as a milestone of German opera.  Performance, reception, recording  The Hoftheater Weimar on an 1899 postcard The opera was premiered by the Seyler Company on 28 May 1773 at the Hoftheater Weimar, with Franziska Romana Koch in the title role, whose voice the composer had in mind when he wrote the opera. The librettist was so pleased with her performance that he wrote a poem to her. Mozart wrote that \\"Alcestis was a great success, and that although it is not half so beautiful as [Schweitzer's] Rosamund. It is true that its success was much abetted by the fact that it was the first German opera.\\"Hussey, Dynley. Wolfgang Amade Mozart. Harper & Brothers, 1928. 97 The opera singer, composer and musical theorist Ernst Christoph Dressler described the positive reception of the opera in Weimar in his 1774 book (Thoughts on the Presentation of Alceste, a German Serious Opera). He considered it a model for German opera. The opera was revived in Weimar in 1999, when the town was European Capital of Culture. Conducted by Stephan E. Wehr, it was staged in the Richard-Wagner-Saal of the , and broadcast live by Deutschlandfunk. Ideas and Impresario was the visual artist Cornel Wachter from Cologne. The ensemble, with Ursula Targler as Alceste, Sylvia Koke as Parthenia, as Admet and Christoph Johannes Wendel as Herkules, with the and its chorus recorded the opera in 2001. Another recording was made in 2008 by Concerto K√∂ln conducted by Michael Hofstetter on period instruments, with Simone Schneider, Cyndia Sieden, Christoph Genz and Josef Wagner. The DVD recorded a performance staged by Hendrik M√ºller in the Festsaal (festive hall) of Schloss Weimar, on the occasion of the reopening after the fire of the Duchess Anna Amalia Library.

He published his first novel, The Reluctant Lover, in 1912. His best-known novel, Sonia: Between Two Worlds, was published in 1917. It was the tenth best-selling novel for 1918 in the United States, and also made into a British film of the same name in 1921. McKenna was the son of Leopold and Ellen McKenna. He was educated at Westminster School (Scholar), London, and at Christ Church, Oxford (Exhibitioner). He gained a second-class honours degree in history at Oxford in 1909. After graduation, he taught briefly at Westminster School but found teaching uncongenial. Independent means allowed him to travel in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. He was medically unfit for active service during the First World War but worked in the War Trade Intelligence Department, 1915‚Äì19, and served in Arthur Balfour's Mission to the United States of America, 1917. The partly autobiographical While I Remember (1921) conveys a flavour of McKenna's early years, including his time at Oxford. The satirical moral inversion in McKenna's Confessions of a Well-Meaning Woman was acknowledged by C.S. Lewis as an influence on the latter's Screwtape letters: \\"the blacks all white and the whites all black\\".Paul Simpson, \\"A brief guide to C. S. Lewis: from Mere Christianity to Narnia\\", London: Robinson, 2013, ch.7 (unpaginated) McKenna's The Oldest God (1926) is a philosophical fantasy novel featuring the god Pan. He wrote Tex. A chapter in the life of Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, a biography about Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, the Dutch journalist who translated books from many languages into English, a.o. Louis Couperus, whom McKenna befriended in 1921. His uncle was Reginald McKenna, Chancellor of the Exchequer under H. H. Asquith, of whom he published a biography in 1948, Reginald McKenna, 1863-1943: A Memoir. His clubs were the Reform and the Garrick. For a considerable portion of his adult life he lived at 11 Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, London.

It acquired its name because the two engines drove three tractor propellers. Design and development The Triple Tractor followed the Tandem Twin and Triple Twin in the series of twin- engined aircraft built by Short Brothers, the intention behind fitting two engines being to produce an aircraft capable of sustaining flight in the event of one engine failing. It was powered by a pair of Gnome Double Omega engines mounted in tandem in the extended nose of the aircraft, the front engine driving a single propeller and the other driving a pair of tractor propellers mounted at mid-gap between the wings, using chains. In order to reduce the torque effect of the rotary engines they were arranged to revolve in opposite directions. The airframe of the Triple Twin was similar to the contemporary S.36, S.41 and S.45 tractor biplanes built by Shorts, being an unequal-span two-seater two-bay biplane, with the square-section fuselage mounted in the gap between the upper and lower wings. The tail surfaces consisted of a rectangular rudder mounted on the sternpost of the fuselage, with a rectangular horizontal stabiliser and split elevator mounted in front of it on top of the fuselage. The crew of two were seated side by side behind the trailing edge of the wings.Barnes 1967, p.83-84 Service history The aircraft was first flown by Frank McClean on 24 July 1912,Barnes p.84 and after a formal acceptance flight carried out by Lt.

Under the name Citron Research, Left publishes reports on firms that he claims are overvalued or are engaged in fraud. Left is known for advising investors on short selling and has often appeared on various media outlets such as CNBC and Bloomberg to talk about his opinions on stocks. In 2017, Left was called 'The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street' by The New York Times. Citron launched 51 investigative reports against S&P; 500 companies, between 2009 and 2015, as well as several Chinese companies, citing allegations of pyramid schemes, ineffective products and accounting, or business frauds. In 2016, Left was banned for five years by the Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal (chaired by Mr Justice Hartmann) for disclosing false or misleading information in connection with the publication of a research report on Chinese property developer Evergrande Group, and so inducing transactions under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. Despite being sued by multiple companies for the reports he has released, Left claims he has never lost a case in the United States; the National Futures Association sanctioned Left and stated that he ‚Äúmade false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud or deceive a customer in violation of NFA compliance rules.‚Äù. Early life and career Left was born in a Detroit suburb to a Jewish family and later moved with his family to Coral Springs, Florida. He attended Coral Springs High School where he was a member of the debate team and president of the Jewish youth group. He attended Northeastern University in 1993. Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure commodities brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make cold calls and push \\"questionable investments.\\" Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the National Futures Association sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being required to take an ethics- training course as part of the probe into the firm for making false statements to sell commodity futures contracts. The National Futures Association stated Mr. Left ‚Äúmade false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud or deceive a customer in violation of NFA compliance rules.‚Äù Left became active in short selling by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by boiler-room scams. When the boiler rooms eventually went out of business, Left started shorting stocks from bulletin-board scams, in which people would send out email blasts saying, \\"Buy this stock now or you'll miss out.\\" In April 1999, Left became president and CEO of Detour Media. He was named director of the company in November 1999. In 2002, his then employer Detour Media sued Left and prevailed on a $25,000 default judgment against him. Left switched to shorting the stocks full-time, using his own research to publish free reports on firms he feels are overvalued or engaged in fraud. In 2001, he founded StockLemon.com, now known as Citron Research. According to Left, he has made profits every year since he started short selling. He was a keynote speaker at the 2017 and 2018 Harvard Business School Investment Conference. Citron Research Left initially started StockLemon.com in 2001 as a self-published blog containing reports on controversial companies. He rebranded the site as Citron Research in 2007. Left researches and short sells companies he believes to be engaged in fraud, have been suspiciously promoted, or have been mistakenly overpriced by the stock market. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P; Capital IQ. GTX Global Corp. sued Left for defamation after a 2005 article he published through Citron about GTX Global. In 2007, the case was dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statues which cover writings about publicly traded companies as matters of public interest. In 2008, Left released a report in which he concluded that Home Solutions was not transparent about the company's relationship with American Renaissance. Home Solutions had loaned money to American Renaissance before the \\"partnership\\" was disclosed publicly. As a result of Left's research, Home Solutions‚Äô stock plummeted. Starting in 2012, Left published multiple reports about Questcor Pharmaceuticals centered around incorrect labeling of the drug Acthar's ingredients. When Questcor was acquired by Mallinckrodt, Left criticized the new company for continued misconduct. Several of Left's reports have become highly publicized, including a 2012 report on the legality of operations by Nu Skin Enterprises, and a 2015 report on Valeant Pharmaceuticals bringing attention to inflated sales. In October 2015, The Globe and Mail of Toronto, quoted independent research firm 5i Research Inc CEO Peter Hodson, as stating that \\"What they seem to do quite well is they're able to spin existing facts into a horrible scenario. It reads very badly,\\" and that \\"Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic so they and their clients can make the most amount of money.\\"\\"Who is Citron Research?\\" by Niall McGee; The Globe and Mail; OCTOBER 21, 2015. =Valeant Pharmaceuticals= Left's 2015 report on Valeant Pharmaceutical (later known as Bausch Health) accused the company of channel stuffing and using sham transactions to inflate drug sales. Left's initial report focused on an investigation launched by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings that examined Valeant's business model of massively spiking the prices of drugs to which it had acquired marketing rights. Left followed up with a report focused on pharmaceutical distributor Philidor RX. Left called for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the issue and referred to the company as the \\"Pharmaceutical Enron\\". As a result of the report, Valeant shares dropped after a five-year peak, eventually falling more than 90 percent from its peak in August 2015, and announced the resignation of longtime CEO J. Michael Pearson the following March. =Citron's reports on Chinese companies= Citron Research has published reports on 18 Chinese companies, 16 of which experienced a drop in stock prices, with 15 of them experiencing drops of over 70%. This has caused a collective of Chinese business leaders, including Qihoo 360 CEO Zhou Hongyi (a company that has been targeted by Left), to launch a site called CitronFraud.com (no longer operating). Left sent a legal notice to the 60 Chinese executives involved, seeking an apology, and told Tech In Asia that he is consulting with lawyers and considering legal action in response. Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former Google China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works. In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with ChineseIn 2019, languages and markets. Lee stated that, \\"Since Citron has already made big bets on these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron‚Äôs recommendation doesn‚Äôt have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead their readers to follow their recommendations!‚Äù\\"Prominent Chinese investor Kai-Fu Lee attacks Citron Research over 'ludicrous' search report by JOSH ONG; The Next Web; August 28, 2012. Longtop Financial In 2011, Left released a report through Citron about Longtop Financial, a financial software house based in China, accusing it of defrauding shareholdings, over-reporting revenues, and lacking transparency in the company's acquisition process. The report pointed out Longtop's outsized margins and unexplained stock grants and pointed out Longtop's relationship with China's largest banks. The company was later issued a Wells Notice of impending criminal charges from the SEC. Evergrande Group and Market Misconduct Tribunal sanction In 2012, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission commenced proceedings in the Market Misconduct Tribunal against Left, contending that he had spread false and misleading information about Evergrande Group in a report published that year on Citron Research‚Äôs website. In that report, Left had alleged that Evergrande was insolvent and had consistently presented fraudulent information to the investing public. In 2016, the Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal (chaired by Mr Justice Hartmann) found that Left was culpable of market misconduct by publishing claims about Evergrande Group that were \\"false and/or misleading as to material facts or through the omission of material facts\\". Left was banned from trading for five years, ordered to repay around HK$1.6 million in trading profits and about HK$4 million in legal costs and expenses incurred by the SFC, and would face criminal prosecution if he breaks Hong Kong market misconduct rules again. In 2019, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal dismissed Left's appeal against the decision of the Market Misconduct Tribunal., reported at [2019] 2 HKLRD 288 The Court of Appeal dismissed Left's application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. On 8 July 2020, the Court of Final Appeal also dismissed Left's application for leave to appeal. Jumia Citron Research published a report on May 19, 2019, regarding African eCommerce company Jumia, one month after its IPO had resulted in shares values rising about 250 percent. Subsequent to the Citron report, stock value dropped by 50 percent in one week. Citron alleged ‚Äúmaterial discrepancies‚Äù between the IPO filing and a confidential presentation made by Jumia to its investors on October 18, 2018. Citron Research alleged that the company had presented incorrect figures concerning active users, specifically, its percentage of product returned and active customers before the IPO. By August 2019, Jumia was named in several class- action suits related to employee fraud.\\"Jumia pain may not be over as shares slump below IPO price\\" By David Whitehouse; The Africa Report; October 8, 2019. Personal life Left has two children from his previous marriage. He shares custody of the children with Andrea and Alan E. Salzman. Philanthropy In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Left created a scholarship for students of the school. The award provides five seniors per year between 2018 and 2021 a $10,000 scholarship.

Pakistan's Kuldana Formation is best known for its fossil mammals, including primitive cetaceans such as Pakicetus and their close relatives. Kuldana mammals have been considered in different studies as early Luthecians (early Middle Eocene), late Ypresians (late early Eocene) or, recently, they encompass much of Ypresians up to early Lutheian time (early part of the early Eocene to early Eocene medium). Kuldana Formation The Kuldana Formation is located in the Kata Chita hills and is a thin, 20-120 m thick tongue of low-lying continental red beds that lie within a much thicker sequence of foraminifera-rich marine formations. Shallow planktonic and benthic foraminifera limit the age of the Kuldana Formation to the late early or early middle Eocene, and the current interpretation of global sea level stratigraphy favours the latter. The short duration of the low-water interval when Kuldana mammals are encountered means that differences between samples likely represent differences in local living environments, deposition sites, and sampling, rather than a substantial difference in age.

One of the first products of the Comdirect Bank was a money market account. Also, securities trading became one of the top priorities. = Public offering = Within the first few months, the Comdirect Bank gained tens of thousands of customers. In the late 1990s, the Comdirect Bank expanded to other European countries. The Commerzbank and Deutsche Telekom agreed on the cooperation of their subsidiaries, the Comdirect Bank and T-Online International. Comdirect Bank became a public company (Aktiengesellschaft) in November 1999 and went public in June 2000. Commerzbank sold a minority stake in the company. The stock was oversubscribed several times and later became part of the Nemax 50 index and the Prime Standard of Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the initial public offering were used to build the investment banking of the Comdirect Bank, for example. The company doubled its workforce to cope with the growing number of customers. = Consolidation = In 2000, the burst of the dot-com bubble hit the financial industry. The Comdirect Bank was also affected and as a result, growth slowed. After several successful years, the bank announced losses in 2001. As the Comdirect Bank slipped into financial difficulties, the board launched a savings program. At the end of 2001, the Comdirect Bank announced to focus on Germany and the United Kingdom. The company places its loss-making branches at disposal; the subsidiaries in France and Italy were sold and closed. Finally, in 2004, the Comdirect Bank sold its British subsidiary, too. From then on, the Comdirect Bank exclusively focused on its home market in Germany. The company accelerated the expansion of its product range and, in particular, cared more about customer advisory services. The new strategy stabilized the business. The first dividend was distributed in 2004 and in 2005, the German retail banking of American Express was acquired, which helped to grow the customer base significantly. To profit more from the performance of the Comdirect Bank, the Commerzbank increased its investment to almost 80% in June 2005. The group purchased the remaining share from T-Online International. = Acquisitions = Even during the global financial crisis from 2007, the business remained stable; the Comdirect Bank profited from the increase in transactions in securities trading. In 2009, the Comdirect Bank acquired the European Bank for Financial Services (ebase) from the Commerzbank, doubling the number of managed securities accounts. At the same time, the bank extended its position in financial services and asset management. During the following years, the Comdirect Bank repositioned the European Bank for Financial Services as a busisiness bank. In July 2018, comdirect agreed to sell ebase to London-based financial technology provider FNZ Group to focus more on the core business and completed the sale in July 2019. In 2016, the Comdirect Bank announced the acquisition of the Onvista Group. Both the Onvista Bank and Onvista Media, operator of a high-reach financial portal, became part of the Comdirect Bank. With this investment, the Comdirect Bank strengthened securities trading and financial information business at the same time. While the Onvista Bank merged with the Comdirect Bank, Onvista Media continued operations as a subsidiary. = Digitalization = In recent years, the Comdirect Bank invested heavily in digital technologies. For example, the company published the first online banking app with support for accounts from other institutions. It launched the \\"startup garage\\" for financial technology startups. The company was the first bank in Germany to publish an Amazon Alexa skill, for example, and later added support for Google Home. The Comdirect Bank also launched a robo-advisor named Cominvest. In late 2019, Commerzbank entered into talks with Petrus Advisers to buy its 7.5% stake in Comdirect and take over the entire online bank.Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker (December 30, 2019), Commerzbank in talks to buy Petrus Advisers stake in Comdirect: source Reuters.  Structure  Onvista Media is a subsidiary of Comdirect bank in Germany.  Products  comdirect bank offers current accounts, online brokerage and several types of credits and loans.  Responsibility  In 2009, the Comdirect Bank and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange founded the Stiftung Rechnen, a non-profit foundation with a registered office in Hamburg and headquarters in Quickborn. Its primary goal is to support knowledge of mathematics with a focus on young peogle to encourage a joy of numbers and calculation. Johanna Wanka, former Federal Minister of Education and Research, is the patron of the Stiftung Rechnen; Christian Rach, a star-rated chef and author, is one of its prominent ambassadors.  Controversies  The Comdirect Bank accidentally reported 200 million euros to an account of a customer in 2012. The bank justified the error with a technical problem on the sale of funds, which could not be seen before. After the reversal, there was a negative balance, which caused lending rates that the Comdirect Bank had to reimburse. In 2016, a breakdown occurred after a software update: A small number of customers of the Comdirect Bank were able to view account balances of other customers for a very short time. However, third parties were not able to do wire transfers. Though there was no financial or material damage, the company regretted the mistake, apologized to all affected customers and informed them about the extent of third-party access. Since 2017, the bank is being targeted by activist investor Petrus Advisers. The investor is questioning the cost structure (cost-income-ratio is over 70%), the governance and incentive structure, and the management quality among others.

Cincotta Zarzuela, the Spanish lyric theatre: a complete reference 2003 \\"Along with Amadeo Vives, Jose Serrano, Francisco Alonso and Fcderico Moreno Torroba, Pablo Luna was one of Zarzuelas major exponents during the first half of the 20th century. The litheness and richness of his melody line with its broad thematic inspiration place Luna's works closer to Viennese operetta than Spanish zarzuela. Among his 168 works are: 18 operettas; 50 zarzuelas and sainetes,\\" His best-known composition is the aria \\"De Espa√±a vengo\\" from the zarzuela El ni√±o jud√≠o.  Life  Pablo Luna received his first lessons in music theory from an organist at a church in his birthplace, Alhama de Arag√≥n. His father, Pablo Luna Ferrer, who was a member of the Civil Guard, had moved with his family to the valley of the Ebro. He studied harmony with Teodoro Ballo and composition with Miguel Arnaudas. As a violinist, Luna would make money in hotels, cafes, churches and a small chamber orchestra, as well as in theaters. In 1903 he wrote his first operetta, Lolilla, la Petenera which was followed in 1904 by La Escalera de los Duendes (The Ladder of the Elves). In 1905, he moved to Madrid to learn more about the world of zarzuela. In particular, he contacted Ruperto Chap√≠, the second director of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, and Tom√°s Barrera Saavedra, a later director of the orchestra, Jer√≥nimo Gim√©nez y Bellido and others. He also knew the librettist Luis Pascual Frutos, who wrote the libretto for the operetta Mussetta, which premiered successfully in 1908. This operetta was followed by many other stage works. In Zaragoza premiered with great success 11 March 1911 his zarzuela Molinos de viento (Windmills). Luna was the same who led the orchestra on the night of reopening of the Teatro de la Zarzuela, after a fire, in 1914. In 1918, he released one of his greatest works, El ni√±o Jud√≠o (The Jewish Boy), an exponent of the new style full of exoticism and sophistication. In March 1925 a grand concert was given in his honor and he was awarded the gold medal of the city of Zaragoza. He closed the trilogy of his three most successful zarzuelas with Benamor (1928). He also wrote eleven screenplays under the pseudonym Garc√≠a Sandoval. Pablo Luna has various streets named after him, and has a school with his name in Alhama de Arag√≥n (Zaragoza).

Description Brown- colored collinsite from Fran√ßois Lake Collinsite is translucent and brown, chocolate-black, light brown, yellowish white, white, or colorless. It is colorless in thin section and light yellow-brown to colorless in transmitted light. The zincian variety of collinsite is pale blue. The mineral can occur with fibrous habit, as globular aggregates of crystals, as concentrically layered botryoidal masses, or as bladed or prismatic crystals up to . Collinsite is a member of the fairfieldite group. Hillite is the zinc analogue of collinsite and collinsite is the magnesium analogue of messelite. =Varieties= There are three varieties of collinsite: *magnesian collinsite, *zincian collinsite, *strontian collinsite, Magnesian collinsite was described from South Dakota in 1972, zincian collinsite was described from South Australia in 1973, and strontian collinsite was described from Russia as early as 1965. The replacement of calcium by strontium that occurs in strontian collinsite is atypical of collinsite. Structure The crystal structure of collinsite was determined using essentially pure magnesian collinsite, Ca2Mg(PO4)2¬∑2H2O, and published in 1974. It consists of chains of corner-sharing (MgŒ¶6) octahedra and (PO4) tetrahedra. Four of the Mg ligands link to (PO4) groups and the other two to water molecules. Two of the ligands in the (PO4) group link to (MgŒ¶6) octahedra and the other two link to calcium atoms and act as hydrogen bond acceptors. Weak hydrogen bonds link chains together and force separation between them. The separation gives room for interstitial, eight-coordinated calcium between chains. History Diagram of the phosphorite nodules from Fran√ßois Lake; collinsite is the lightly colored layer Collinsite was discovered prior to 1927 near Fran√ßois Lake, British Columbia. In a , phosphorite nodules were discovered that consisted of a fragment of andesite enclosed by concentric layers of phosphate minerals coated in wurtzilite. The phosphate layers were composed of a mineral named quercyite (since determined to be improperly classified) and the new mineral collinsite. The Fran√ßois Lake collinsite was light-brown and consisted of sub-centimeter blades. Collinsite was named in honor of William Henry Collins (1878‚Äì1937) who, at the time, was director of the Geological Survey of Canada. The mineral was described by Eugene Poitevin in 1927 in a publication of the Geological Survey. With the analysis performed by E. A. Thompson, Poitevin identified the formula as . Since no crystals of collinsite were found, the only crystallographic information determined was the angle between cleavages. In 1940, C. W. Wolfe reexamined the mineral species. With analysis performed by F. A. Gonyer, Wolfe identified the formula of collinsite was , containing less water than Poitevin indicated. Wolfe also questioned the four cleavages found by Poitevin, since he could identify only two fair cleavages from six fibrous crystals. When the IMA was founded, messelite was grandfathered as a valid mineral species. Occurrence Collinsite has been found in Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Namibia, Norway, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and the United States. The mineral formed as an incrustation of other minerals by weathering. It occurs in association with bitumen, bobierrite, carbonate rich fluoroapatite, cryptomelane, dolomite, Fe‚ÄìMn oxides, kovdorskite, parahopeite, and scholzite.

It was discovered in Germany and described in 1890. The mineral was subsequently discredited in 1940, reinstated and named neomesselite in 1955, and the name restored to messelite in 1959. Description Messelite is a translucent mineral that is white, pale greenish white, greenish gray, pink, or colorless. The mineral may be granular or occur as internally radial aggregates of lamellar crystals arranged as globes, hemispheres, or sheafs, up to . Messelite is a member of the fairfieldite group. History Messelite was discovered in Messel, Hesse, Germany, by a Dr. Spiegel who worked as technical director at a local factory. The specimen contained a number of crystals associated with carbonaceous material. It did not conform to any known mineral at the time, a fact confirmed when it was studied at a local mineralogical institute. The mineral was described by W. Muthmann in 1890 in the journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie and its formula was identified as (Ca2+,Fe2+,Mn2+)3(PO4)2¬∑H2O. At the request of Dr. Spiegel, the mineral was named messelite () after the area in which it was discovered. The first reevaluation of messelite was carried out by C. W. Wolfe in 1940. Wolfe concluded that the material was anapaite partially altered to collinsite and he discredited messelite as a valid mineral species. Later, an unaltered mineral was found with the formula (Ca2+,Fe2+,Mn2+)3(PO4)2¬∑2H2O, essentially identical to the formula of messelite reported by Muthmann. It was analyzed by Clifford Frondel and found to be the disordered iron-rich analogue of fairfieldite. Frondel proposed in 1955 that the mineral be named neomesselite. A few years later, additional material was obtained from the type locality of Messel and studied with optical and x-ray methods. The specimen was determined to consist primarily of material identical to the neomesselite described by Frondel with a rim of anapaite. Since it is likely that the mixture studied by Muthmann was primarily this mineral, it was decided around 1959 that the name neomesselite should be discarded in favor of messelite. When the IMA was founded, messelite was grandfathered as a valid mineral species. Occurrence Messelite has been found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United States. The mineral tends to form in granite pegmatites by hydrothermal alteration at a late stage. Messelite occurs in association with amblygonite, anapaite, brazilianite, eosphorite, fairfieldite, goyazite, graftonite, herderite, hureaulite, ludlamite, phosphoferrite, siderite, triphylite, vivianite, and whitlockite.

The genus is solely known from an Early Cretaceous, Albian age, fossil amber found in Spain. Currently, the genus comprises a single species, Alavaraphidia imperterrita. History and classification Alavaraphidia imperterrita is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number MCNA 13608. The specimen is composed of a mostly complete adult insect with the majority of the wing missing. The body is positioned so a ventral view is shown and the dorsal sides are obscured. Despite the positioning and lack of preserved wings, enough details are present to show the specimen was not from a previously described genus. The specimen is included in a small piece of amber which lacks other major inclusions. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Escucha Formation in Moraza, part of the Province of Burgos in Northern Spain. Alavaraphidia was first studied by a group of paleoentomologists led by Ricardo P√©rez-de la Fuente of the University of Barcelona and including Enrique Pe√±alver, Xavier Delcl√≤s, and Michael S. Engel. Their 2012 type description of the new genus and species was published in the electronic journal ZooKeys. The genus name Alavaraphidia was coined by the researchers as a combination of the snakefly genus Raphidia and \\"√Ålava\\" which is in honor of the √Ålava amber deposits that preserved the specimen. The specific epithet imperterrita is from the Latin imperterritus meaning \\"fearless\\". The authors chose this as a reference to the unalterable nature of organisms trapped in amber. Alavaraphidia imperterrita is one of six described snakefly species found in the Albian deposits of Cantabria. Description The lone specimen of Alavaraphidia imperterrita is a fairly well preserved partial adult female. Not including the ovipositor the overall body length is with a . Generally the body coloration is dark with a striped patterning on the legs. The rhomboidal head shows large compound eyes set midway along its length. There are three large ocelli placed to the rear of the head behind the compound eyes and antennae. The antennae are notably long, being composed of forty four flagellomeres which are each 1.5 times longer than they are wide. While mostly missing from the specimen, what is preserved of the wings shows they were hyaline with brown veins and very short, strong setae. The abdomen is long and sports a robust ovipositor that has dense annulations along its length. The ovipositor is approximately long, thick, sporting short, stiff, sensory setae along its length and a club-shaped gonostyli.

Indeed, it took one Tandon factory worker only eight hours to completely assemble four Tandon motorcycles. The model in question was the 122 cc Milemaster, powered like all but the last Tandons by a Villiers two-stroke engine. Tandon received great publicity when Pandit Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, was photographed astride a Milemaster while visiting Caxton Hall in 1948. The export plan never materialised and the Milemaster, with its modest specificationhand gear change and bicycle seatand lacking rear suspension, was marketed instead in the United Kingdom until 1952. In 1949, Tandon introduced the 122 cc Superglid featuring conventional foot gear-change and a new frame with swinging-arm rear suspension. However, the suspension itself was highly unusual with damper units being replaced by a bell crank linked to rubber bands for suspension and a hard rubber block for compression action, all located under the gearbox.Devdutt's dream The Classic MotorCycle (6/12) Sufficient sales enabled Tandon to move to larger premises within Watford from Bushey Hall Road to Colne Way and introduce the larger-engined 197 cc Superglid Supreme. The short-lived (1951‚Äì53) but relatively popular 122 cc Kangaroo trials model boasted the attractions of significant ground clearance and light weight with a 197 cc Kangaroo Supreme also featuring conventional damper units in the swinging-arm rear suspension. A Tandon 200 cc scrambler model enjoyed success beating a factory-sponsored 500 cc BSA motorcycle in an Irish handicap race in 1956. Replacing the Milemaster was the 122 cc Imp which sacrificed rear suspension for light weight. However, the later, larger 197 cc Imp Supreme adopted conventional rear suspension. New roadster models with conventional rear suspension, stronger frames and bigger engines were introduced in 1954 being the 224 cc Monarch (also known as the Sprite) and, with a 242 cc British Anzani (and later 322 cc) two-stroke twin cylinder engine, the Viscount (also known as the Twin Supreme). These did not have as standard the telescopic front fork as fitted to prior Tandon models but instead boasted an Armstrong Earles-fork arrangement. These and the new 99 cc Starlett scooter could not stop Tandon Motors Limited being wound-up in 1955 by the United Kingdom Commissioner of Custom & Excise, their sales hampered by a dealer network not extending outside London. Devdutt Tandon was able however to continue manufacture of his motorcycles through his other firm Indian Commerce & Industries Limited until 1959. Tandon motorcycles suffered from a poor reputation as regards design, materials and build quality, enjoying only limited popularity. Their simplistic approach, perhaps born out of an initial design philosophy catering for the third world market, finally was neither sold cheap enough to attract the budget market nor was of sufficient quality to challenge other similar lightweight competitor marques.

It is the first and sole school of this kind in this state. The Landesgymansium f√ºr Hochbegabte is a publicly funded school in Germany for highly gifted students, similar to the Landesschule Pforta in Saxony-Anhalt, the Landesgymnasium St. Afra in Saxony and Internatsschule Schloss Hansenberg in Hesse. It is funded by the city of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, the district Ostalbkreis and the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Its stated aim is the promotion of the intellectual and social development of its students.  Location  The Landesgymnasium's campus is situated at the University park in the east of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. During the 20th century it was used as barracks initially by the German Army (Bismarck Kaserne) and then after WWII as a US military base with nuclear Pershing II missiles stationed nearby, which were eliminated in 1990. In 1992, the US forces withdrew and the campus was used as a spin-out of the University of Maryland University College until 2002. School building, boarding houses and teachers' flats are situated in the recently renovated barracks while the canteen and a gym were newly built on the former parade ground.  Conception  The boarding school started in the school year 2004/05 with one class, which never comprises more than 24 students, in both years 7 and 10. It expanded during the following years so that from the school year 2012/13 there are two classes per year. Thus the school has about 250 students of which around 200 are boarders. = General Principle = The Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte is dedicated to facilitate the positive development of its highly gifted students' talents and aptitudes. It is guided by the motto of William Stern, the psychologist who coined the term intelligence quotient: : 'Intelligenz an sich ist ein R√ºstzeug: Wertvoll wird sie erst durch die positiven Ziele, in deren Dienst sie verwandt wird.' : 'Intelligence by itself is an armamentarium: It becomes valuable only through the positive aims which it is used for.' With this maxim, the Landesgymnasiums' students shall pledge themselves to their talents and the associated demand to contribute to the formation of a responsibility elite (germ. 'Verantwortungselite'). Not only the intellectual capacity is to be supported; the school puts also high emphasis on the holistic personal development of its students. For this reason, besides the accelerated and enriched classes, the 'Fundamentum:, the school offers a wide variety of extra-curricular activities, the so-called Addita. By means of the comparably important role the student council are given, in the form of 'student parliament', 'constitution council' and the president of the student council, the students shall have the opportunity to witness and to co-create democratic processes, early. = The Campus Model = Teachers' Flats on Campus School and College constitute one pedagogical union. Until the end of the school year 2007/08, attending the college (living in the boarding houses not at home) was obligatory. Then, however, this compulsion was nullified by the council of ministers. Since school year 2008/09, every class of 24 students consists of a maximum of four external students, who live nearby and participate nevertheless in the campus life. The students life in the boarding houses, which are divided into middle (years 7‚Äì10) and upper school (year 11‚Äì12) and boys and girls in living groups. Every group is looked after by a teacher as a mentor. The Landesgymnasium's teacher thus have a pedagogical double function: On the one hand they teach their subjects, on the other they advise, accompany and guide the students as mentors in the school and college, which is why the teachers mostly live directly on campus. With increasing age, self- organisation attains more and more importance for the students. The more responsible-minded they are, the greater are the areas of freedom that are conceded by the school and college. Thereby, the Landesgymnasium offers important opportunities to live democratic forms of cohabitation and the acceptance of responsibility. The early morning sun hitting the school building of the Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte, Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. = Admissions = The admission is highly competitive and comprises three stages that must be completed successfully. Firstly, a statement by each the student and his parents has to explain motivation and background of the application. Secondly, the tested IQ must be about 130 or above. Lastly, those applicants who master the first steps are invited to spend two days living in the boarding houses and to work together in groups on different projects that assess both intellectual potential and social competence. The headteachers and the psychologists then choose a harmonic class on the basis of the gathered information. Applicants who are successful are admitted for half a year on probation. Every year a class in year 7 and another year is admitted plus some lateral entrants who fill empty places. = Teaching = The school building For years 7 to 10, the school year is divided into trimesters, the upper school years are by law divided into semesters. Concerning teaching there are some major differences to ordinary German Gymnasiums. In foreign languages and mathematics from year 7 to 10, lessons are divided into different sets that can be attended by the students according to ability not to age. Thus it is possible for a year 8 student to study mathematics on the level of year 10, English on the level of year 9 and French on the level of year 8. If a student is so excellent in a subject that even the highest set is not demanding, he can decide, together with his teacher, his mentor and his parents, that to conclude a 'learning treaty': The student is dispensed from classes in this subject but pledges to acquire the curriculum autodidactically in addition to further studies in the field. A student can even partially study at university. Regularly, students participate successfully at national and international competitions such as World Schools Debating Championships, International Physics Olympiad, International Junior Science Olympiad, Jugend forscht, Jugend musiziert, TSA.  Addita  Addita are extra-curricular activities that represent an integral part of the Landesgymnasium's conception. In this part of the school life students have both the opportunity to get new inspirations as well as intensifying their knowledge in areas of special interest. The Addita are divided into five different categories from which students are obliged to choose at least two athletic, one creative and two intellectual ones. * Scientifical Addita, e.g. ChemTech (Chemistry), NUGI+ (Biology), iLab (Computer Science), Mathematics for specialists, Technology Student Association (Engineering) * Musical-artistic Addita, e.g. Drama, Arts, Choir, Big Band, Musical * Linguistic Addita, e.g. French, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Italian * Humanistic Addita, e.g. Philosophy, Checkers, Theories of State, History, Model United Nations * Athletic Addita: e.g. Soccer, Ballrom dancing, Ultimate Frisbee, American Football. Addita can be conducted by teachers as well as students who have a high proficiency in a field. = Fees = The Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte is a public Gymnasium, thus attendance of school is free of charge. However, there are costs for board and lodging, which amount to around 500 ‚Ç¨ per month. Support for families in financial hardship is ensured by the state (BAf√∂G), so that no one is excluded for financial reasons.  Center of Competence for the Promotion of the Highly Gifted  The Center of Competence is a division of the Landesgymnasium consisting of several psychologists and fulfills internal and external tasks. It is both involved in admitting and counselling students as well as providing further education for the teachers and Surveys in the school. Furthermore, it is a statewide contact point for questions concerning the promotion of highly gifted. Besides, the Center of Competence is a test center for a variety of university admissions tests such as ACT, TSA Test and many more.  Student Research Center  In 2007, the Student Research Center was inaugurated. It enables students from the Landesgymnasium as well as from the other Gymnasiums of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd to conduct first research work, for example in a laboratorium accredited for Genetic Engineering.

Seyler) was a Hamburg banker, merchant and politician. He was by marriage a member of the Hanseatic Berenberg banking dynasty, and was a partner in the Hamburg firm Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. (Berenberg Bank) for 48 years (1788‚Äì1836), for 46 years as the company's senior partner. The \\"Co.\\" part of the company name refers to him.Wolfgang Seidel (2019): \\"Die √§lteste Bank in Deutschland: Berenberg.\\" In: Die √§ltesten Familienunternehmen Deutschlands, pp. 34‚Äì41, FinanzBuch Verlag Seyler was one of the first merchants and bankers from modern Germany to establish trade relations with the United States and East Asia. He served as a member of the government of Hamburg during the Napoleonic Wars and later as the President of the Commercial Deputation, one of the city-state's main political bodies, and as a member of the Hamburg Parliament. Ludwig Seyler was a son of the Swiss-born theatre director Abel Seyler and a son-in-law of the bankers Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg through his marriage to their eldest daughter Anna Henriette Gossler. Background and early life Ludwig E. Seyler was born in Hamburg and was the younger son of the Swiss-born Abel Seyler (1730‚Äì1800), one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe, and his Hanoverian wife Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730‚Äì1764). His father had been born in the Swiss Canton of Basel and had come to Hamburg as a young adult, where he had established himself as a merchant banker in the 1750s and 1760s. In 1763 his companies went spectacularly bankrupt with enormous debts in the wake of the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763, and from 1767 he devoted himself entirely to the theatre, largely abandoning his children as he adopted a traveling lifestyle, moving from court to court with the Seyler Theatre Company. Following the death of their mother in 1764, Ludwig Seyler and his brother and sister were raised in Hanover by their maternal uncle, the noted Enlightenment natural scientist J.G.R. Andreae. By several accounts Andreae was a highly erudite and kind man who became a loving father figure to his sister's children; he had no children of his own. Their father, Abel Seyler, remarried in 1772 to Friederike Sophie Seyler, Germany's leading actress of the second half of the 18th century and the author of the opera Oberon, a major influence on the libretto of The Magic Flute. On his father's side Seyler was descended from many of Basel's leading patrician families, especially the families Seyler, Burckhardt, Socin (originally an Italian noble family), Merian and Faesch; Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Napoleon's uncle, was a distant relative. On his mother's side he was a grandson of the Hanoverian court pharmacist Leopold Andreae. His sister Sophie Seyler (1762‚Äì1833) was married to the Sturm und Drang poet Johann Anton Leisewitz, the author of Julius of Taranto. Felix Hoppe-Seyler, the principal founder of biochemistry and molecular biology, was an adopted son of his nephew.

On 20 May 1788, he married Anna Henriette Gossler (1771‚Äì1836), the eldest child of the company's owners, Johann Hinrich Gossler (1738‚Äì90) and Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822). His mother-in-law was the only heir and last member of the Berenberg family. During his lifetime and beyond his wife's family was regarded as one of the two most prominent families of the city-state of Hamburg.Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg, 1987 Shortly after his marriage, his father-in-law made him a partner in the Berenberg company. Upon the death of his father-in-law in 1790, he succeeded him as the company's senior partner and effective head. His mother-in-law was a partner in her own right from 1790 to 1800, and in 1798 his seventeen years younger brother-in-law, the later senator Johann Heinrich Gossler, joined the company as a partner. Under his leadership and to reflect his entry into the partnership the company name was changed to Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. in 1791, and has remained unchanged since. As head of the Berenberg company Seyler greatly increased the company's international trade, and was one of the first merchants and bankers from Germany who established trade relations with the newly independent United States and with East Asia. By 1800 the capital of the company has doubled since he became a partner. The company lost half its capital during the Napoleonic Wars, but quickly regained and exceeded its former size once the war ended. Ludwig Seyler remained one of the two dominant partners, with his brother-in-law, until his death in 1836.Tradition: Zeitschrift f√ºr Firmengeschichte und Unternehmerbiographie, Volumes 4-5, 1959 At the time of his death he had worked for the company for 61 years, been a partner for 48 years and been the company's senior partner for 46 years. Napoleonic Wars and politics During the Napoleonic Wars Hamburg was occupied by France from 1806 and annexed into the Bouches-de-l'Elbe d√©partement of the First French Empire in 1811. The French government promoted the French language and instituted numerous changes in Hamburg. In February 1813 Seyler was appointed by the French authorities as a deputy judge on the commercial tribunal (tribunal de commerce). During the spring of 1813 he was among 30 prominent and wealthy Hamburg merchants who were briefly held as hostages by the French authorities to force the city to pay a \\"contribution\\" to the French government, which caused great consternation in Hamburg. The Berenberg company's head office was moved to his home in Wandrahm in 1813 when the Gossler family's city residence, Mortzenhaus, was requisitioned by the French and turned into a military hospital. Seyler later moved the head office to the home of his son-in-law Gerhard von Hosstrup. In the summer of 1813 he was appointed by the French Governor-General Louis-Nicolas Davout as a member of the municipal council (conseil municipal),Wolf-R√ºdiger Osburg, Die Verwaltung Hamburgs in der Franzosenzeit 1811‚Äì1814, p. 86, P. Lang, 1988 the governing body of Hamburg which had replaced both the government (known as the council, later as the senate) and the parliament under French rule. He served in the municipal council until it was dissolved after the liberation of Hamburg, when Hamburg became a fully sovereign state. For a brief transition period, the former municipal councillors were asked to serve in the post-Napoleonic government. On 23 March 1813 he was elected as a member of the Commercial Deputation and he served as its President from May 1817 to July 1818. The Commercial Deputation was one of the city-state's main political bodies. As a member of the Commercial Deputation he was also ex officio a member of the Hamburg Parliament in accordance with the city-state's post-Napoleonic constitution. He was also a member of the Banco Deputation, the commission that had the oversight over Hamburg's internationally used Banco currency, and of the Shipping and Port Deputation. Legacy L.E. Seyler was highly regarded in Hamburg; he was described as \\"an honourable character, both as a merchant and as a human being.\\" Seyler is interred in the family grave of the Berenberg/Gossler family on the Old Hamburg Memorial Cemetery (Althamburgischer Ged√§chtnisfriedhof, formerly Ehrenfriedhof), together with his wife Anna Henriette n√©e Gossler, his mother-in-law Elisabeth Berenberg and other relatives such as his brother-in-law, Senator Johann Heinrich Gossler and his nephew, Hamburg First Mayor Hermann Gossler.

There are four sections in the village: Stewartville Housing Scheme, Sarah Lodge, Stewartville Old Road and Stewartville Sea View. Community Stewartville is about west of Vreed en Hoop, and is separated from the neighbouring community of Leonora by a trench. The community of Uitvlugt is immediately to its west. The village is populated by various ethnic groups. With the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1834, freedmen began making group and individual purchase of land in the village. By the 1860s many Africans had settled in the Creole village of Stewartville and were working on the West Coast Demerara estates. There is a record of four Sierre Leonians in 1874 petitioning from Stewartville for a grant of crown land to cultivate rice on Hog Island, Essequibo. Later, estate workers originally from South India came to the coast and introduced their own traditions. The Indians mostly settled in areas between the Afro-Guyanese villages. A mosque was built in Stewartville around 1911. At times, in the 1970s, there were violent clashes between the ethnic groups. As of 2012 the village had a population of 2,808. Climate Temperature is fairly steady throughout the year at between and . There are two wet seasons in May‚ÄìJuly and in December‚ÄìJanuary. Average monthly rainfall ranges from in September to in June, with about annually. Infrastructure Stewartville has a secondary school, serving other communities in the region. The Unserved Areas Electricity Programme brought electricity to the community in 2005-2006. The school road at Stewartville was rehabilitated in 2009, but the job was done by an inexperienced contractor and was poor quality. In less than six months, potholes were starting to appear. In August 2011 it was announced that funding was being provided to upgrade roads in the area, including regarding the roads, road sides and drains, with 32,000 people expected to benefit directly. In February 2012 residents of Sarah Lodge were complaining that road works had started two months before and then stalled, and the unfinished construction was blocking the main road and causing serious flooding. Erosion of the shore has long been a problem. In 1918 it was reported that repairs to the sea wall were needed. Excessively high tides on 16‚Äì17 October 2005 caused breaches of the sea defenses on West Coast Demerara. In November the government announced it had approved contracts for emergency repairs. $102M was to be spent on obtaining and laying boulders along the sea defense line at Stewartville and Leonora. The work was being funded from a 38.9 Euro grant agreement under the Eighth European Development Fund. In December 2009 a high spring tide caused waves that over-topped the sea wall and flooded several yards in Stewartville Sea View. No drainage system had been installed since the 2006 flooding. The wall was damaged near to the point where the flooding occurred. In October 2010 the contractor working on a project to repair the sea defenses recommended using riprap construction as an alternative to building wave walls. With riprap construction, loose boulders absorb the force of the waves. Unlike wave walls, which tend to be undermined, crack and require expensive repair, riprap defenses need little maintenance. However, they are slightly more expensive to build. In October 2011 it was announced that the EU-funded program to reconstruct or rehabilitate about of sea defenses would not be completed by its month-end deadline. A new date of February 2012 was proposed. The contractor had run into difficulties that included design changes, heavy rains and delays in accessing duty-free materials. Other events During the 2006 general elections the PPP/C held a \\"Grand Victory Rally\\" at Stewartville before the election was held. Speaking at the rally to an audience made up mostly of sugar workers and rice farmers, President Bharrat Jagdeo outlined a $500B development plan for the next five years. The PPP/C held another massive rally at Stewartville in November 2011 during the Guyanese general election, 2011. President Bharrat Jagdeo again spoke at the event. In October 2010 a boat carrying drinks and other products from the Banks DIH company to the Essequibo Coast developed leaks and had to be grounded on the Stewartville foreshore. Mud had got into the pump, which would not start, and the engine room flooded. After the tide receded, the boat leaned to one side. Some boxes fell off and were taken away by Stewartville residents. That night, dozens of people climbed onto the boat, taking soft drinks and alcoholic drinks, as well as other products such as biscuits and bottled water. The looting was thorough, including draining the fuel from the boat's tanks. Some started drinking while they were looting. One man, apparently drunk, fell into the water and drowned between the boat and the sea wall. In March 2011 a fire broke out in Stewartville. A fire tender was quickly dispatched from Leonora Fire Station, and used the water in the tender to stop the fire from spreading. When the firefighters attempted to get more water from the nearby canal, it turned out to be full of silt and debris, which damaged the pump. Residents said the Neighbourhood Democratic Council (NDC) had been failing to maintain the canals. According to one resident, \\"All the trenches in Stewartville dem a condemn and it turning into little drains. Dem just got a couple men pulling the grass on the parapet and the drains keep getting smaller all the time; they are not digging the drains! Whenever you complain the NDC dem a vex with you.\\" In December 2011 a young man and woman on a motorbike were a few minutes from Sarah Lodge in Stewartville when they hit a cow standing in a dark part of the road. The two had to be taken to Leonora Cottage Hospital to have their injuries treated. The presence of cows wandering on the roads was apparently not unusual. Notable people Allan Carlyle Miller was born in Stewartville Village on 19 September 1898. After training in the southern United States as a doctor and a Baptist minister, he returned to Guyana and established the Guyana Missionary Baptist Church Lott- Carey. The well-known artist Donald Locke was born here in 1930. Locke started to study painting under E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class in Georgetown in 1947. In 1979 he moved to the United States, dying in Atlanta Georgia in December 2010. In 1973, Stewartville was home to Diana Amelia Barrow, who was 107 years old. She was the mother of six children, two of whom had died, and had 23 grandchildren. Michael Joseph the Finance Secretary of Guyana as of 1st November, 2018 to present was born and raised in Stewartville.

The edges of the hole may be flanged to increase the rigidity and strength of the component. The holes can be circular, triangular, elliptical, or rectangular and should have rounded edges, but they should never have sharp corners, to avoid the risk of stress risers, and they must not be too close to the edge of a structural component. Usage =Aviation= Aircraft manufacturing in Australia 1943. Note the circular lightening holes in the wing ribs. Lightening holes are often used in the aviation industry. This allows the aircraft to be lightweight as possible, retaining the durability and airworthiness of the aircraft structure. =Maritime= Lightening holes have also been used in marine engineering to increase seaworthiness of the vessel. =Motorsports= Car chassis with lightening holes, circa 1935. Lightening holes became a prominent feature of motor racing in the 1920s and 1930s. Chassis members, suspension components, engine housings and even connecting rods were drilled with a range of holes, of sizes almost as large as the component. This drive towards lightening was based on a misunderstanding of the component's mechanical behaviour. The assumption for an H-beam was that all of the resistance to bending stresses was carried in the two top and bottom flanges of the girder, with the central web only carrying out a spacing function. The central web could thus be drilled indiscriminately, supposedly without weakening the overall girder. This was based on two fallacies: firstly that the only forces on the beam were simple bending forces in the plane of the web. In practice, a more complicated force, such as an unexpected torsional twisting from a sudden suspension bump overloaded the now-weakened central web and the lightened beam failed immediately. Secondly, the assumption that the ideal forces were separated into the top and bottom flanges was increasingly unrealistic with the development of stressed skin and monocoque designs, where loads were more evenly shared. In these designs there was no \\"unloaded web\\" that could be safely drilled. In comparison to aircraft design, it was notable that motor racing lightening was carried out after the design of the components, usually without understanding the forces in the structure and without re-performing any stress calculations afterwards. Owing to the increasing number of dangerous failures, the practice of drilling lightening holes was forbidden by the race scrutineers. Lightening was still permitted, but only where it had been specified by the original designers, not by simply drilling holes afterwards. =Military= Lightening holes have been used in various military vehicles, aircraft, equipment and weaponry platforms. This allows equipment to be lighter in weight as well as increase the ruggedness and durability. They are usually made by drilling holes, pressed stamping or machining and can also save strategic materials and cost during wartime production. =Architecture= Parsons House is an example of the use of lightening holes in architecture. Lightening holes have been used on various architecture designs. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Lightening holes were fashionable and somewhat seen as futuristic and were used in the likes of industrial units, car showrooms, shopping precincts, sports centres etc. Parsons House in London is a notable building that uses lightening holes since its renovation in 1988. Ringwood Health & Leisure Centre in Hampshire is another notable example.

The International Journal of Cuban Studies, 2 December 2008. http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/i18088_3.pdf At that time, musicological research and documentation in Cuba was not undertaken by professionals fully dedicated to that subject, but instead it was conducted by historians, ethnologists or composers such as polymath Fernando Ortiz (b. 1881) or composer Eduardo S√°nchez de Fuentes (b. 1874). The controversy sustained by these distinguished personalities in reference to the possible African (or indigenous) roots of Cuban music spanned several decades, from the 1930s to the 1950s.Ortiz, Fernando. African√≠a de la M√∫sica Folkl√≥rica de Cuba. Editora Universitaria, La Habana, Cuba. 1965. Another important personality, Mar√≠a Mu√±oz (b. 1886), a Galician pianist, professor and choir conductor that graduated at the Madrid Conservatory under the guidance of Manuel de Falla, developed an outstanding musical activity in Cuba. Together with her husband Antonio Quevedo, she co-founded the Society of Contemporary Music in 1929, promoted the cultural journal ‚ÄúMusicalia‚Äù and founded the Havana Choral Society.Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P.145 Together with Fernando Ortiz, she gave summer courses on musicology at the Havana University from the 1930s. Those courses nurtured and stimulated the careers of some future outstanding musicologists such as Mar√≠a Teresa Linares Savio (b. 1920). One of the earliest contribution to musicological studies in Cuba was provided by Emilio Grenet, brother of the famous Cuban composer Eliseo Grenet. Emilio Grenet was born in Havana in 1901 and passed away in the same city, in 1941. He studied Sight-reading and Music theory with professor Armando Laguardia and worked as a pianist in New York City in 1923. After returning to Cuba he traveled to Spain where he met composer Joaqu√≠n Turina who introduced him to his professor of Harmony, Conrado del Campo. Grenet returned again to Cuba where he worked in the Education Ministry Radio Station, started his investigations about the genres of Cuban popular music and travelled to New York City to record with the orchestra of his brother Eliseo Grenet. He taught Musical composition to the renowned Cuban conductor Enrique Gonz√°lez M√°ntici and Harmony to the composer and guitarist Vicente Gonz√°lez Rubiera (Guy√∫n). In 1939, Grenet published his important work \\"Cuban popular music\\", which represented a serious study of the Cuban popular music genres, and a thorough insight into the most important aspects of the musical creation in Cuba, from the 19th Century until that time. The book also included 80 scores of representative compositions.Emilio Grenet. EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Emilio_Grenet. Retrieved: 07-30-18.  1940s and 1950s Alejo Carpentier. In 1946, the famous Cuban writer, art critic and musicologist Alejo Carpentier (b. 104) established a benchmark with his work ‚ÄúLa m√∫sica en Cuba‚Äù (1946), an attempt to put together a comprehensive history of Cuban music from the 16th century until his time. Although the work presented as facts some controversial historical issues, such as the origins of the well known ‚ÄúSon de la Mateodora‚Äù and the ‚ÄúCuban Contradanza‚Äù, this important study (based on extensive investigations conducted by Carpentier) offered a deep insight into Cuban music history never witnessed before. Coincidentally, young composers and musicologists such as Argeliers Le√≥n (b. 1918) and Hilario Gonz√°lez (b. 1920) were diligently working along with Jos√© Ard√©vol at ‚ÄúGrupo de Renovaci√≥n Musical‚Äù to improve and renovate the Cuban musical panorama.EcuRed. Grupo de Renovaci√≥n Musical. http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Grupo_de_Renovaci%C3%B3n_Musical In 1947, Argeliers Le√≥n continued offering the musicology summer courses started by Mar√≠a Mu√±oz and Fernando Ortiz at the Havana University and served as a professor of such prominent students as pianist and professor Ana Margarita Aguilera Ripoll (b. 1903), author of the important compilation of children songs ‚ÄúCancionero Infantil de Hispanoam√©rica.‚Äù Other contemporary Cuban musicologists were Mar√≠a Antonieta Henriquez, founder of the National Museum of Music, and Lydia Cabrera, an anthropologist renowned for her studies of Afro-Cuban music. Post revolutionary period (1959) After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Pablo Hern√°ndez Balaguer (b. 1928) was teaching musicology at the Oriente University, an educational institution that offered the first Music Degree in the history of Cuba. Balaguer conducted an important study about the work of composer Esteban Salas and published the Music Catalog from the archives of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral. He was a professor of several distinguished musicologists such as Virtudes Feli√∫ Herrera (b. 1941), who conducted a thorough research into Cuban historical ritual and festive traditions. Her work has been compiled in the ‚ÄúEthnographic Atlas of Cuba,‚Äù which received an award from the Cuban Academy of Science. Argeliers Le√≥n and his wife Mar√≠a Teresa Linares Savio were the leading figures of Cuban musicology during the early decades after the Cuban Revolution (1959). Between 1961 and 1970, Le√≥n was de director of the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences of Cuba and he also headed the Folklore Department at the National Theater of Cuba, the Music Department of the Jos√© Mart√≠ National Library and the Music Department at Casa de Las Am√©ricas. He served as professor at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, taught African cultures in Cuba at the Havana University and musicology at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). As a musicologist he published several books which included Del Canto y el Tiempo (1974), where he proposed a subdivision in ‚Äúgeneric complexes‚Äù to study the musical styles in Cuba.Orovio, Helio. Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK. 2004. P. 123. Mar√≠a Teresa Linares conducted extensive investigation on several areas of Cuban music history and published numerous books and articles. She worked as a professor at the Alejandro Garc√≠a Caturla Conservatory, the Havana University and the Institute of Ethnology and Folklore at the Academy of Sciences. Until year 2000 she was the director of the Museum of Music, and at a later time she was affiliated to the Fernando Ortiz Foundation. During the first decade of the Cuban Revolution (1960 to 1970) an emerging generation of musicologists started to acquire recognition within the Cuban musical scene. We should mention, in first place, two humble and dedicated investigators that had certain common characteristics. They both had university backgrounds and worked for many years at the Jos√© Mart√≠ National Library as researchers; also their main subjects of investigation were somewhat related to the musicological work of Alejo Carpentier. Alberto Muguercia (b. 19280), a lawyer from Santiago de Cuba holds the honor of having refuted one of the greatest myths in the history of Cuban music: The ‚ÄúSon de la Ma Teodora‚Äù origins. In his famous book ‚ÄúLa m√∫sica en Cuba‚Äù, Alejo Carpentier categorically attributed a 16th-century origin to a popular melody called Son de la Ma Teodora without conducting a thorough investigation about the subject, thus establishing an erroneous fact as a popular tradition. In a brilliant article about this subject: ‚ÄúTeodora Gin√©s: ¬øMito o realidad hist√≥rica? Muguercia demonstrated the inaccuracy of this theory. In turn, Zolia Lapique (b. 1930), a librarian and historian, refuted a theory formulated by Carpentier in reference to the French-Haitian origin of the ‚ÄúContradanza Cubana‚Äù. She attributed an earlier development and other possible origins (Spanish and English) to this musical style in her outstanding article: ‚ÄúAportes Franco-Haitianos a la contradanza cubana: mitos y realidades.‚Äù Giro, Radam√©s. Panorama de la M√∫sica Popular Cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1995. P. 137. Other prominent members of this generation are: Crist√≥bal D√≠az Ayala (b. 1930), author of a complete Cuban music discography, Jorge Ibarra (b. 1931), Leonardo Acosta (b. 1933), Dulcila Ca√±izares (b. 1936), Raul Mart√≠nez Rodr√≠guez (b. 1937), Helio Orovio (b. 1938), Radam√©s Giro (b. 1940), Danilo Orozco (b. 1944) and Alberto Faya (1944). The second generation (1970s) and beyond The members of the second generation of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree in the history of Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigaci√≥n y desarrollo de la m√∫sica cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978. From this group we should mention two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria El√≠ (b. 1945) and Zoila G√≥mez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Mart√≠n (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: ‚ÄúLa m√∫sica coral en Cuba‚Äù (1987) and ‚ÄúM√∫sica Coral‚Äù (1990). Rolando Antonio P√©rez Fern√°ndez, music√≥logo, violonchelista y profesor cubano. Two other important musicologists from this generation are: Alberto Al√©n P√©rez (b. 1948) and Rolando Antonio P√©rez Fern√°ndez (b. 1947). Alberto Al√©n applied his extensive knowledge of psychology and statistics to musical form analysis as well as music pedagogy, in publications such as: ‚ÄúLa forma de las formas musicales‚Äù and ‚ÄúDiagnosticar la musicalidad‚Äù. Rolando P√©rez developed extensive investigations about Afro-Cuban music and is well known for having documented and analyzed the process of transition from ternary rhythms to binary rhythms of the Cuban and Latin American popular music, during the 18th and 19th centuries, in his book: ‚ÄúProceso de binarizaci√≥n de los ritmos ternarios africanos en Am√©rica Latina (1987).‚Äù Olavo Al√©n (b. 1947) has closely followed the steps of Argeliers Le√≥n in his studies of Afro-Cuban music and, most importantly, has elaborated and expanded Le√≥n's theory of ‚Äúgeneric complexes‚Äù, in works such as: ‚ÄúG√©neros de la m√∫sica cubana‚Äù from 1976. Those theories have been strongly refuted by other musicologists such as Leonardo Acosta, who explains in his article ‚ÄúDe los complejos gen√©ricos y otras cuestiones‚Äù: Other members of this Group are renowned musicologists Martha Ezquenazi (1949), Jes√∫s G√≥mez Cairo (1949) and Dora Ileana Torres (1956). Most recently, a group of young Cuban musicologists have earned a well deserved reputation within the international academic field, due to their solid investigative work. Some of the most prominent members of this group are: Miriam Escudero Su√°stegui Miriam Esther Escudero Su√°stegui: EcuRed: https://www.ecured.cu/Miriam_Esther_Escudero_Su%C3%A1stegui, Liliana Gonz√°lez Moreno Liliana Gonz√°lez Moreno: Ecured: https://www.ecured.cu/Liliana_Gonz%C3%A1lez_Moreno, Iv√°n C√©sar Morales FloresIv√°n C√©sar Morales Flores: UNIR: La Universidad en Internet: https://www.unir.net/profesores/ivan-cesar-morales-flores/ and Pablo Alejandro Su√°rez Marrero Phd.

Next are semi-solitaire, word-problem training exercises designed to familiarize the reader with the AD&D; 2nd Edition rules.

Reception Ken Rolston reviewed New Beginnings for Dragon magazine #171 (July 1991). He called this adventure \\"an unfortunate case of the designer doing all the right things, yet ending up with a not very appealing package\\". Although he initially didn't appreciate the \\"school-like exercises\\", Rolston actually found them \\"quite instructive\\" because he realized how little he knew about the AD&D; 2nd Edition rules. He commented: \\"The character-creation walk-through, the how-to- role-play essay, and the exercises are well designed and effective, given their purpose to introduce new players to the AD&D; game systems. Though they didn't look like much fun to me, they worked like they were supposed to.\\" Regarding the short adventure found in the New Beginnings package, he commented that \\"in terms of appealing to the visual, dramatic, or tactical senses of the [Dungeon Master] or players, this isn't particularly exciting or well presented\\". He concluded the review by saying: \\"New Beginnings does just what it ought to do, and it endeavors more or less successfully to be entertaining and inspiring in the process. Its greatest limitation is that it is specifically designed to introduce players to the Taladas campaign in the Dragonlance setting, and it isn't suited for introducing players to any other AD&D; campaign setting. However, the role-playing tips and rules exercises would be quite useful for any first-time AD&D; game player or [Dungeon Master]. And if you're going to start a Taladas campaign, this is a very valuable training tool and resource for your players.\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules ","title":"New Beginnings (Dragonlance)"},{"id":"36652155","text":"Nightwatch in the Living City is an adventure for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Plot summary The player characters have ventured to the city of Raven's Bluff with hopes of finding fame and fortune, and have joined the City Guard in their night-watch patrols as a means to that end. Events and encounters follow a sort of flow chart, with several linked episodes leading to a minor climax, with a major- action climax to end the adventure. Narrative frame and DM-control hooks carry the PCs from scene to scene, but within each scene the players and DM are free to explore a variety of approaches in solving conflicts. All the action in the module takes place in a single night in the setting. Publication history LC3 Nightwatch in the Living City includes design by Walter M. Baas and Kira Glass with editing by John Nephew, and was published by TSR, Inc. as a 32-page module. Nightwatch in the Living City is based on a tournament adventure originally designed and run through the RPGA Network. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Nightwatch in the Living City for Dragon magazine #171 (July 1991). Rolston calls Nightwatch \\"a perfect example of how convention design and playtesting can produce a first-class adventure\\". He calls the adventure challenges \\"lovely role-playing set pieces\\", attributing this to the RPGA Network making \\"a special effort to encourage the role-playing elements of FRP gaming\\". Rolston states: \\"Each episode is set up with a colorful entry piece, and the gaming details and anticipated player actions are concisely presented with the sort of solid practical advice that you can get only from well-tested scenarios.\\" He goes on to say that Nightwatch is \\"all the more remarkable because city role-playing scenarios are notoriously tricky to run. Nightwatch simplifies the DM's task by providing a narrative framework [...] that leads the PCs from one conflict to another so smoothly that they aren't tempted to wander off into the city streets. In particular, the skillful dramatic staging of the PCs' induction to the Nightwatch gets the PCs quickly into character and into the spirit of the adventure.\\" He comments that the adventure episodes \\"have plenty of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't charm that is ever the burden of the public servant\\" and notes that the encounters \\"are full of lovely little misdirections and plot twists, with charming and devious NPCs, sweet little children (I know I'm in for a rough night when a DM saddles me with a lovable tyke), peculiar monsters, and plenty of oddball surprises, all seasoned with pathos, humor, and irony. There's relatively little danger of death for low-hit-point characters (the ideal situation for 1st-level beings), but plenty of opportunity exists for humiliation and confusion-the only real terrors of players in an AD&D; game universe where even death usually isn't a permanent inconvenience.\\" He felt that Nightwatch \\"is designed to encourage role-playing and DM improvisation, but Nightwatch provides the necessary rigging and practical \\"if-this-happens\\" advice that [adventures such as] Arena of Thyatis and Legions of Thyatis lack\\". Rolston concluded the review by saying: \\"This is an inspiring piece of work, perfect to run as is or to use for stealing ideas. A well-rigged narrative structure is given, yet with ample roleplaying and improvisational opportunities for DM and players. Also present is a host of nifty characters to deal with and plot puzzles to solve, featuring numerous sly and surprising variations on conventional AD&D; game cliches. Finally, good fun in abundance.

Contents This book begins with a brief chapter on Viking history and ends with chapters on Viking culture and geopolitics. The book introduces the concept of Gifts, special talents bestowed upon human characters by the Norns (Fates) at birth. If a player chooses to play a human character, he rolls on the Character Gifts Table, which gives him a chance that he will receive a permanent penalty or bonus. Vikings who aren't human are probably trollborn, a new racial type exclusive to this supplement. Trollborn are a repulsive combination of human and troll, with exceptional strength, constitution, and intelligence scores, but lower than average wisdom and charisma. They are denied Gifts but are endowed with infravision. Cultural restrictions forbid the use of certain character classes. Specifically, Vikings can not be paladins, clerics, druids, or wizards. Fighters, rangers, thieves, bards, and specialist mages are allowed, with minor restrictions. To balance these restrictions, two new character classes are introduced. The first is the berserker, a hot-tempered warrior given to spontaneous bursts of rage. After working himself into a frenzy, the berserker gains bonuses to various attributes, which persist for a number of rounds and so long as the berserker directs his rage against a particular enemy. The second new class is the runecaster, a magic-wielding warrior with the ability to carve intricate runic designs on inanimate objects, imbuing them with a variety of powers. Additional fantasy elements include a selection of new magical items, and a chapter full of new monsters including the linnorm, the havmand, and the thursir. Publication history The Vikings Campaign Sourcebook was published by TSR, Inc. as a 96-page softcover book, with a 28\\" √ó 19\\" map sheet. Design was by David Cook, with illustrations by Ned Dameron. Reception Rick Swan reviewed Vikings Campaign Sourcebook for Dragon magazine #181 (May 1992). Swan considered the book more of an AD&D; rules expansion than a campaign sourcebook; calling it \\"a user-friendly variant, easily digested by DMs and players alike. Though not quite the \\"new roleplaying experience\\" it aspires to be, there's plenty of interesting material to enliven an already existing campaign.\\" He felt that the chapters on Viking history and on Viking culture and geopolitics \\"do little to integrate history and fantasy, together they serve as an informative overview from which the DM may develop his own setting\\". He noted that the introduction \\"promises help with adapting Viking culture to the Forgotten Realms, World of Greyhawk, and Dragonlance settings, but either I missed this section or it got lost somewhere along the way. Regardless, not much adaptation is required; Vikings as presented here could exist comfortably in just about any unexplored area on Krynn or Oerth without straining the players' credibility.\\" He calls the trollborn \\"essentially humans with bad attitudes, a good choice for those with a flair for role-playing antisocial characters\\". He called the berserker and the runecaster classes \\"quite appealing and among the book's best features\\". He called the rune magic \\"an excellent addition to the AD&D; magic rules and, ironically, much better realized than the rune system in the RuneQuest supplement\\" which was titled Vikings, reviewed in the same column. He bemoaned the lack of campaigning material in the book: \\"Sadly, there's no material comparable to the RuneQuest supplement's Scenarios Book. Adventure hooks suggest themselves in the chapter on Viking culture, but there are no specific outlines. To get a Viking campaign off the ground, the DM will have to rely on his own imagination, consult one of the reference books in the suggested reading list, or borrow ideas from another game supplement.\\" Swan concluded his review with this evaluation: \\"Another chapter or two would've pushed this book over the top; notable by their absence are sections on Viking ships and sea travel, Norse mythology (we're referred instead to the 2nd Edition Legends and Lore book), and adventure design. The historical aspects are better presented than those in the RuneQuest supplement, but a game featuring trollborn and berserker warriors can't be taken seriously as a historical simulation. As a set of rule variants, however, it delivers the goods, particularly for AD&D; game players who can't get enough new character classes and magic systems.\\" References Category:1991 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons books ","title":"Vikings Campaign Sourcebook"},{"id":"36652173","text":"Derek Edwin Brown (born May 26, 1971) was a member of the Utah House of Representatives from his election in 2010, until his departure in 2014.

Vend's solution includes POS software, inventory management, E-commerce, customer loyalty, and reporting analytics. Vend integrates with other business and payments applications including Shopify, Square, Xero and PayPal, and is a key retail partner in Apple's global Mobility Partner Program.  History  Vend was launched in August 2010 by software developer Vaughan Rowsell. In the two years following its launch, Vend secured funding from various investors and announced a partnership with PayPal.Vend Raises $2 Million, Announces Key Partnership with PayPal  Virtual-Strategy Magazine In 2013, Vend raised NZ$8 million of funding from investors in Australia (i.e. Craig Winkler, MYOB founder and a cornerstone investor in Xero, and Paul Bassett and Matt Rockman, co-founders of Seek.com.au) and New Zealand (i.e. The Milford Active Growth Fund, managed by Brian Gaynor). Further capital has also been raised from existing investors including Point Nine Capital in Berlin. The following year, Vend closed US$20 million (NZ$25 million) in Series B funding. The funding round was co-lead by PayPal co-founder and the first outside investor in Facebook, Peter Thiel of Valar Ventures and Square Peg Capital in Australia. Later in 2014, the company also opened offices in Toronto and London. In August 2015 Vend announced that it had raised NZ$12 million, mainly from existing investors along with new entrant Punakaiki Fund. The company also announced cuts to staff despite achieving 1100% revenue growth in its first 3 years, and 100% revenue growth in the previous financial year. In 2015, Vend announced that it was working with Apple as one of a select group of business app developers to bring innovative mobile solutions for business to iPad users. Vend is now officially endorsed by Apple and is one of about 20 apps that Apple is curating for SMBs that are billed as both working well, and working well in concert with each other. In the same year, Vend launched Vend Ecommerce to help brick-and-mortar retailers set up shop online. It also announced a partnership with UK payments provider iZettle, and North American payments provider Mercury (now Vantiv). In 2016, the company joined forces with Square to enable US-based advanced retailers who use Vend's POS software and retail management system to process payments with Square. It also revamped its integration with long-standing partner Xero and announced a formal partnership, uniting the two companies under joint business goals in key international markets for the first time. In 2016 Vend also launched an app separate to its own platform for inventory management named Counter. Available through Apple's App Store, Counter allows retailers to perform full and partial inventory counts, as well as process product deliveries and transfers using their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. The app is aimed at retail store owners, warehouse managers, and stock room supervisors, and seeks to streamline counting inventory by reducing manual work for retailers. At the end of 2016, Vend raised a further US$9 million ($NZ13 million) led by existing investors, and with significant new investment from fund manager Movac. With the additional funding, Vend aims to continue its expansion and product development in its established markets including Australia, the US and the UK. In 2016 Vend grew its UK staff to 20 and opened a new office in East London. In 2017, Vend updated and relaunched its inventory app Counter due to widespread popularity of the app, and renamed it Scanner by Vend.  Technology  Vend uses HTML5 features in Google Chrome and Safari to implement offline processing capabilities. * A webSQL database built into the browser provides local inventory storage so sales can be processed offline and all stock levels updated. * HTML5‚Äôs offline manifest tells the browser to take copies of certain files and pages for offline use. * WebSocket (another element of HTML5) allows Vend to talk to other devices on a local network, interfacing with hardware such as an EFTPOS unit or other payment devices. Aside from being compatible with Mobile Safari & Chrome, Vend also has a native iOS app called Vend Register. The architecture of this point of sale system allows it to be hardware independent, and despite being 100% cloud- based, Vend can continue to ring up sales during an Internet outage. In 2016, Vend's Solutions team gained worldwide notoriety in technology and security circles after detecting and disclosing a major security Internet vulnerability, unrelated to the Vend platform.  Features  Vend's core feature is its web-based POS system, which runs on any device that has a web browser as well as its iPad app Vend Register. Vend also has robust inventory management capabilities designed to help retailers stay on top of stock orders, transfers, and inventory counts. It also provides features including loyalty, customer management, gift cards, and employee tracking. Reporting is a big component of Vend's software. Vend allows merchants to generate reports on several aspects of their business, including sales, inventory, and customer behavior. Users are able to build their own reports, and use a wide range of variables and filters to get the data they need. In addition to its cloud- based POS system that works on multiple devices, the company also has Vend Ecommerce, as well as other integrations with partners like Shopify and WooCommerce, to enable retailers to sell online. Vend is made for SMB retailers through to larger multi-outlet businesses with more complex retail operations, and focusses on complex inventory management. Vend provides several multi-outlet features, which enable retailers to manage multiple stores and hundreds (or even thousands) of products.

She was the widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Miki. Miki served as the wife of the Prime Minister of Japan, or First Lady, during her husband's two- year tenure from 1974‚Äì76. Biography =Personal life= Her father, Nobuteru Mori, held a seat in the Japanese House of Representatives and founded Showa Denko, a major chemical engineering firm. Her brother, Kiyoshi Mori, was the head of the now defunct Management and Coordination Agency, which would later become the interior ministry. Yoshihide Mori, another of Miki's brothers, served as the chief of the Environment Agency, the forerunner of the present-day Ministry of the Environment. She married Takeo Miki in 1940. Mutsuko Miki held the title of wife of the Prime Minister, from 1974-76. Takeo Miki died in 1988. =Activism= Miki, a prominent activist, remained active following her husband's death. A vocal supporter of Japanese pacifism, Miki fought against the potential repeal of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, a clause in the Constitution of Japan that prohibits an act of war by the state. She campaigned in favor of Article 9 across Japan, often alongside other notable supporters and colleagues. Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe. In 2004, a group of Article 9 supporters, including Miki, Takeshi Umehara, Nobel laureate Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, and writer Hisae Sawachi, joined together to establish the Article 9 Association. The association advocates for the protection of the country's pacifist constitution. Sawachi has noted that Miki once said, \\"It is an extremely normal thing to express opinions for peace.\\" Her last meeting with the Article 9 Association occurred in May 2011. Miki advocated for the compensation of comfort women. In 1995, she joined the Asian Women's Fund, a charity established by the Tomiichi Murayama administration to compensate former comfort women. While Miki had called for the establishment of the fund, she publicly severed ties with the charity in 1996 when the Japanese government balked at providing official reparations to the comfort women. Miki advocated for the normalization of bilateral relations between Japan and North Korea. She called for full diplomatic relations between the countries. In 2000, Miki and former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama traveled together to North Korea. Before the trip, Miki created handmade teacups as \\"souvenirs\\" for North Koreans whom she met on the trip. She made the teacups from soil collected in Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. According to Murayama, Miki wanted her cups to \\"convey harmonious relations among the three countries.\\" She was awarded a North Korean order of friendship for her work in 2002. She headed or chaired several other organizations, including the Asian Ladies Friendship Society. Mutsuko Miki died at a hospital in Tokyo of colon cancer on 31 July 2012, on her 95th birthday. Her survivors included her oldest daughter former member of the House of Councillors, Kiseko Takahashi, and her nephew, Eisuke Mori, who is currently a member of the House of Representatives.

Born in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, he first worked as a reporter in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play Dr Samsi. After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, Noesa Penida (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.  Early life and theatre  Andjar was born Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26 February 1902. He gravitated toward traditional theatre at a young age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) level ‚Äì first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones ‚Äì he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm. Around 1925, having had little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, where he was a reporter for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received. Advertisement for the premiere of Andjar's stageplay, Dr Samsi In the late 1920s, after spending some two years in Medan with the daily Sinar Soematra, Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng (The Lost Lutung), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film and was replaced by Bachtiar Effendi. Andjar became a writer for the theatrical troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.  Film career and death  Andjar's wife, Ratna, was the first female film director in Indonesian history. Upon his return to the Indies, Andjar formed another theatrical troupe, Bolero, with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in Surabaya. Effendi was left as the head of Bolero, which then became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine Poestaka Timoer. As his work entailed writing synopses and serials based on popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film industry. He was soon asked by The Teng Chun, with whom he had maintained a business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java Industrial Film (JIF); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following Albert Balink's 1937 hit Terang Boelan (Full Moon). After handling the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia was critical of the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer. During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, the nation's film industry nearly ceased to exist: all but one studio were closed, and all films released were propaganda pieces to assist the Japanese war effort and promote the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Andjar was not involved in these but was excited by the artistic merits of Japanese films. Although he wrote several short stories during this time, three of which were published in the pro-Japanese newspaper Asia Raja in 1942, Andjar focused on theatre, forming the troupe Tjahaya Timoer. He often visited the Cultural Centre (Keimin Bunka Sidosho) in Jakarta, where two employees, D. Djajakusuma and Usmar Ismail, discussed filmmaking with him. Both became influential film directors during the 1950s. After Indonesia's independence, Andjar moved to Purwokerto to lead the daily Perdjoeangan Rakjat. After the paper collapsed, he returned to film, film a piece entitled Djaoeh Dimata for the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration in 1948. This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid; 1948) and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa Penida, a critique of the Balinese caste system, which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy. Meanwhile, he continued to write and publish paperback serials adapted from local films. Andjar's screenplay Dr Samsi was finally adapted as a film in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision. In 1958 Asmara became the head of the entertainment magazine Varia, where the fellow director Raden Ariffien served as his deputy. Asmara held the position until his death; among other roles, he wrote a series of memoires on the history of theatre in the country. He died on 20 October 1961 in Cipanas, West Java, during a trip to Bandung and was buried in Jakarta.  Legacy  Andjar's toneels were generally based on day- to-day experiences, rather than the tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar's stage plays, as well as those of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies. Matthew Isaac Cohen, a scholar of Indonesian performing arts, describes Andjar as \\"Indonesia's foremost theater critic during the colonial period\\", noting that he wrote extensively on the history of theatre in the Indies. Cohen also believes that Andjar also worked to justify the toneel style and distance it from the earlier stambul. Even after entering the film industry, Andjar considered the theatre more culturally significant than cinema. However, the Indonesian journalist Soebagijo I.N. writes that Andjar remains best known for his film work. Andjar was one of the first native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which resulted in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with them new ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.

Berenberg, Gossler & Co. (Berenberg Bank).Manfred Pohl, Sabine Freitag, Handbook on the History of European Banks, European Association for Banking History, 1994 He was married to Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822), the only heir of the Berenberg banking family. The Gossler Islands in Antarctica are named in honour of his family. Background Johann Hinrich Gossler was a son of Johan Eibert Gossler (1700‚Äì1776), an accountant and burgher of Hamburg who had bought the office of Herrenschenk for 10,600 mark, making him master of ceremonies of the Hamburg council. The Gossler family had been burghers and velvet makers in Hamburg at least since the 17th century. The name Gossler appears in the city already in the 14th century, although it is unknown if it is the same family. Gossler's maternal grandfather J√ºrgen Friedrich Boedecker was a Hamburg merchant and grand burgher from 1706, and his great-grandfather Eibert Tiefbrunn was also a prominent Hamburg merchant. A list of his ancestors is included in the Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch. Berenberg Bank His father-in-law Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772) At a young age, Johann Hinrich Gossler joined the Berenberg company as an apprentice. The company was involved in merchant banking, insurance, shipping and trade of goods, and had been established by the Dutch Berenberg family in 1590. After seven years, at 22 and having completed his apprenticeship, Gossler left Hamburg to work for a company in Cadiz, and travelled extensively in Spain, Portugal, France and England.His wife Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822) In 1768, he returned to Hamburg, where he married Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822) in the same year. She was the only daughter of the Berenberg company's surviving owner, Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772). Johann Berenberg made his son-in-law a partner in 1769. Upon the death of Johann Berenberg's brother Cornelius in 1773, the Berenberg family became extinct in the male line and Johann Hinrich Gossler became the company's sole owner. In 1788, Gossler took on his own son-in-law Ludwig Erdwin Seyler (married to his eldest daughter Anna Henriette Gossler) as a partner. Johann Hinrich Gossler was the father of Hamburg senator and banker Johann Heinrich Gossler II (1772‚Äì1842) and the grandfather of Hamburg senator and First Mayor Hermann Gossler (1802‚Äì1877) and banker Johann Heinrich Gossler III (1805‚Äì1879). Johann Heinrich Gossler III was the father of Johann Berenberg Gossler (1839‚Äì1913). In 1880, the Hamburg Senate granted Johann Berenberg Gossler the name of Berenberg-Gossler, and in 1888, the family was ennobled in the Kingdom of Prussia as von Berenberg-Gossler. In 1910, Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was raised to the Baronial rank. Baron Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was the father of John von Berenberg-Gossler (1866‚Äì1943), Senator and German Ambassador in Rome.Johann Heinrich Go√üler II, Neue Deutsche Biographie Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg were also the grandparents of Betty Seyler (1789‚Äì1837), married to businessman Gerhard von Hosstrup, Louise Seyler (1799‚Äì1849), married to ship broker Ernst Friedrich Pinckernelle, and Henriette Seyler (1805‚Äì1875), married to Norwegian industrialist Benjamin Wegner.

He is said to have had \\"a colorful career\\" before he was affected by financial problems and ended up committing suicide. Life and career Long was born into poverty in 1878 in Lebanon, Indiana, a small, rural town in the Midwestern United States. He was educated in public schools in Indianapolis, a much larger city and the capital of Indiana. His first job was being a page on the Superior Court in Indianapolis. He later acquired an interest in newspapers and magazines and became a copy boy on the Indianapolis News. He became a reporter at the young age of 22, and later worked for many other newspapers and magazines, such as the Indianapolis Star, Kansas City Post, Cincinnati Post, Cleveland Press, and Hampton's Magazine. Long was a police reporter for the Cincinnati Post, and he was made the managing editor of this newspaper when he was 20 years old due to a shake-up at this newspaper. He created a staff to help him out, all of whom were 24 years old or younger. This staff included Roy Howard and O. O. McIntyre, among others. Long helped some editors, writers, and reporters advance their careers, such as James Oliver Curwood, Peter B. Kyne, Ring Lardner, Dean Cornwell, Damon Runyon, Royal Brown, and \\"a lot of \\"other good [magazine writers]\\"\\". Long also worked with many other reporters, including Booth Tarkington, Roy W. Howard, Meredith Nicholson, George Ade, and other reporters from Indiana. His good writing and editing skills allowed for him to get promoted to better positions. Long was the Chicago manager for the United Press at one point in time, and he was the managing editor of The Red Book in Chicago in 1912, a position that he received due to his good ability to understand people's tastes and likes. Long said that he looked at words and articles by how they sounded (\\"by ear\\"), rather than by seeing if they were grammatically correct or full of information and knowledge. William Randolph Hearst gave Long the position of President and editor-in-chief of the International Magazine Company, Inc.. This allowed him to edit the Cosmopolitan magazine, as well as other magazines, such as Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar, Motor, and Motor Boating. His salary and bonuses combined at Cosmopolitan were $180,000 a year, a sum which would be several times higher today due to inflation. He said that his secret to becoming a successful editor \\"was giving the public the kind of things he himself liked to read.\\" This even caused him initially to reject the publication of Ernest Hemingway's short story, \\"Fifty Grand\\",Long, Ray - editor. (1932). 20 Best Stories in Ray Long's 20 Years as an Editor. New York: Crown Publishers - \\"Why Editors Go Wrong: 'Fifty Grand' by Ernest Hemingway\\", pp. 1-3. although he later included it in an anthology he edited and published in 1932.Long (1932), pp. 4 ff. Time Magazine considered Long's greatest publication at the time to be The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge. A large number of short stories by the writer Somerset Maugham first appeared in Cosmopolitan, Hearst's International and Good Housekeeping. Maugham's connection with the Hearst publications began in 1920 at Ray Long's initiative and continued into the late 1940s. Professional decline On October 1, 1931, Long retired from Cosmopolitan and went into the book publishing business, which had been his lifelong ambition. In 1932 he edited, and published with his publishing partner Richard R. Smith, 20 Best Stories in Ray Long's 20 Years as an Editor,Long (1932). however, this first publishing enterprise with Smith failed, and caused Long to become bankrupt in 1933. His bankruptcy led him to move to some islands in the South Seas near Tahiti, where he lived for a year before moving back to the United States (it has been suggested that his move to the South Seas was inspired by Somerset Maugham's novel The Moon and Sixpence). In his last several years, he went to Hollywood, California and wrote and edited films for several film corporations, including Columbia Pictures Corporation, Fox Film Corporation, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He also returned to the magazine business, working for Photoplay, Shadowplay, and Liberty magazines. He was so financially desperate that he had to rely on old friends and acquaintances to get whatever jobs he could. Personal life and family Long first married Florence E. Webster, but divorced her in 1910. He later married Mrs. Schon, and subsequently married Mrs. Pearl Dillon, who was a writer herself. Finally, in 1922, Long married Lucy Virginia Bovie, who was originally from Gallipolis, Ohio. Their only child, Ray Long, was born two years later. At the time of Long's death, his wife and his son, both of whom outlived long, resided in Greenwich, Connecticut, whereas Long had been residing in California at the time. Suicide Several weeks before his suicide, Long began feeling ill. His maid, Helen Amdt (or Andt), said that on the day before his suicide, he was in a \\"dark mood all afternoon\\" and \\"seemed unusually morose\\". On Tuesday, July 9, 1935, at the age of 57, in the bedroom of his California home, he apparently attempted suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a small caliber rifle. The bullet became stuck in his neck and a part of his spinal cord became severed. He was found unconscious and dying by his maid, lying on the bedroom floor and wearing silk pajamas. Long was taken to an emergency hospital during an operation that unsuccessfully attempted to save his life. Long died half an hour after being taken to the hospital. Regarding Long's death, A.G. Peterson, the Beverly Hills officer who investigated Long's death, stated that \\"[t]here is no doubt [that] it was a suicide\\". No suicide note explaining why Long chose to commit suicide was ever found. One of Long's friends speculated that part of the reason why he committed suicide was because he \\"guessed he had passed his peak\\" in terms of creative output. This matches with previous statements by some of Long's friends \\"that the only thing on earth he feared was \\"going stale\\". He was cremated and his ashes were put into the Pacific Ocean. In a bibliographic study of Somerset Maugham, Raymond Toole Stott writes: \\"Oddly enough, Ray Long lost his life because of his association with Maugham. He was sent the typescript of The Moon and Sixpence and after reading it decided he, too, wanted to paint. He was over 50 but he threw up his job and went to live in one of the islands in the Pacific. He painted for a number of years, then decided he had no aptitude for it, and killed himself.\\" Funeral Many of Long's friends, including some prominent writers, attended his funeral, including novelist Rupert Hughes (uncle of famous aviator and philanthropist Howard Hughes), humorist Irvin S. Cobb, and stage actor George Jessel. However, his wife Lucy did not attend his funeral since she said that she was too ill. His funeral service lasted only eight minutes. Rupert Hughes was the individual who was chosen to deliver the eulogy. Hughes said that \\"[Ray Long had] spent his life putting flowers into the hearts of others\\", and Long's friends all over the world compensated Long by sending him flowers for his funeral.

It is situated about north of Khartoum near Karima. The temple stands near a large bend of the Nile River, in the region that was called Nubia in ancient times. The Temple of Amun, one of the largest temples at Jebel Barkal, is considered sacred to the local population. Not only was the Amun temple a main centre of what at one time was considered to be an almost universal religion, but, along with the other archaeological sites at Jebel Barkal, it was representative of the revival of Egyptian religious values. Up to the middle of the 19th century, the temple was subjected to vandalism, destruction, and indiscriminate plundering, before it came under state protection. History Ram sculpture at Barkal's Amun Temple. Construction of the temple occurred in the 13th century BC. The temple's foundation probably occurred during the reign of Thutmose III, while the temple was shaped during his reign and that of Ramses II. Especially at the time of the Napatan empire, the temple was of great importance for the Kushite kingdom. The Nubian king Piye and subsequent Nubian pharaohs expanded Barkal's Amun temple complex, creating a southern rival to the northern Amun temple at Thebes. Although early Meroe rulers had their own capital, government officials took a coronation journey to the Amun Temple of Jebel Barkal. Here, the king went into the Holy of Holies, where he was confirmed as king by a divine oracle. In the years 25/24 BC, the Romans invaded Nubia during a campaign against the Kushites led by Gaius Petronius. He destroyed the temple and took Jebel Barkal from queen Amanirenas, one of the ruling Kandakes. However, the Romans were unable to make permanent gains and withdrew after razing Napata to the ground. The last large-scale construction works were by the Kushite king Natakamani, who restored some of the Roman destruction, enlarged the temple complex, and renovated the first pylon and other parts of the temple. Architecture and fittings The original temple was relatively small, consisting of one pylon and a courtyard with ten columns. During the Nineteenth Dynasty reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II, the structure included the Second and Third Pylons, a hypostyle court, a hall with annexes, a chapel, and a pronaos and naos complex. Additions included a second temple behind a pylon, another courtyard, probably without pillars, and several chapels. A notable temple renovation and enlargement, attributed to Piye, occurred in three stages. First, the old temple was strengthened by a wall and another small portico. For the second step, a large hall with 50 columns, was built. Only the pillars, foundation walls and entrances were made of sandstone, the remaining walls were of unbaked bricks. Lastly, Piye built a large farm, which was also decorated with columns. The court and the portico each had its own pylon. The whole temple complex became over long. North of the First Pylon, a cache of statues was excavated, which included the headless statue of Tantamani (known also by his Amon name, \\"Tenutamon\\"), Taharqa's successor. Many rulers built additional stele, decorated walls or put up statues in the temple. As the religious center was important to both Egyptians and Nubians, Thutmose III stele contains the inscription, \\"Home of Amun and the Throne of the Two Lands\\"; found at the Amun temple, it is now at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. There are stelea attributed to Horemheb and Seti I. Taharqa built ten colossal figures. Tantamani erected a small shrine in the portico. In the first courtyard, there are pillars attributed to Piye and Harsiotef.

She was registered in Canada and previously owned by Swedish and Norwegian interests as Holmsund and Menominee. In 2011 her intended demolition in Canada proved controversial and proposals were made for her to instead be broken up in Mexico. The intended Mexican contractor collapsed, and so she stayed beached. In December 2017, work was done to patch and seal the ship, and to decontaminate it before the beginning of dismantlement operation. Her demolition was completed in October 2018. Trading career Kathryn Spirit was built as Swedish-flag Holmsund in 1967 by AB Lindholmens varv at Gothenburg, Sweden for SCA Transport, later SCA Transforest, the shipping arm of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget. Holmsund and her two sister ships Tunadal and Munksund were open hatch bulk carriers, with their own gantry cranes, designed for SCA's pulp and forest products exports, in a new integrated transport system utilising the company's own terminals. Holmsund was operated by SCA for some 26 years and then sold to Swedish shipowner Gorthon Lines. In 1997 Holmsund was sold to a Norwegian operator for service between the Great Lakes and Europe, and renamed Menominee. McKeil Marine Ltd of Hamilton, Ontario purchased Menominee in 2006, renaming her Kathryn Spirit and transferring her to Canadian registry. She was primarily used for the transport of bulk commodities on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. In 2007 Kathryn Spirit became the first ship to be used to ship wheat from the Port of Churchill to another Canadian domestic port, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Disposal In 2011, after a period of lay-up, Kathryn Spirit was sold to the Groupe St-Pierre for scrapping. The company decided that they would carry out the demolition at Beauharnois in the Greater Montreal Area, Quebec, on the shores of Lake Saint-Louis. The mayor of Beauharnois opposed the operation, even though it would take place in an area zoned for industry, due to fears about environmental pollution. His concerns were shared by Member of Parliament Anne Minh-Thu Quach. In August 2012, in the face of continued opposition from the municipality, the Quebec Ministry of the Environment and environmental groups, the Groupe St-Pierre decided to withdraw from the demolition project and resold Kathryn Spirit to the Mexican company Recyclajes Ecol√≥gicos Mar√≠timos. The American-owned, Bolivian-flagged tug Craig Trans, built in 1944, was hired to tow her to Mexico, but was detained at Halifax by Transport Canada due to safety deficiencies and poor living conditions. The tug's crew were later repatriated with charitable donations, and the tug arrested by creditors. By May 2013 there were further delays in the departure of Kathryn Spirit, due to water ingress, lack of survey for the voyage and other environmental concerns, and a fear that lower water levels might prevent her departure until 2014. In January 2016 the condition of the ship, unmoved, had deteriorated to a serious extent, causing concern about potential pollution of the St. Lawrence River. A committee made up of federal and provincial representatives suggested that the ship be broken up without moving the ship. In January 2018 work started in Beauharnois, and was ongoing on April 10, 2018 when the vessel caught fire and burned for several hours.

Alleged jihadist career According to The Washington Post, Sakka was suspected of playing a role in a plot to bomb hotels in Amman, Jordan, on 31 December 1999. They reported he was the planner of the truck bomb attacks that killed 57 in Istanbul in 2003; that he was a trusted associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and had led foreign fighters during the battle of Fallujah; and that he aided other fighters in their travels, with funding and false passports. He was captured in Antalya when a bomb exploded in his apartment on 4 August 2005. The Washington Post reported that Turkish security officials asserted he had acknowledged that he had been constructing the bomb, which he intended to use as a suicide bomb when he guided a yacht into a cruise ship that had American GIs. Sakka was represented by Osman Karakan. Karakan said that Sakka had willingly acknowledged his jihadist activities, and remained committed to jihadism‚Äîbut was nevertheless refusing to sign a confession. Sakka is believed to have undergone plastic surgery in order to hide from security officials. The Washington Post reported that he drank alcohol, and hung out with unmarried women, in order to mask the fact that he was a fundamentalist.

It is most prominent in the Pittsburgh area and Pennsylvania in general. The Dictionary of American Regional English defines the term as a \\"general term of disparagement\\". It is an archetypical Pittsburgh word, conjuring feelings of delight among Pittsburgh expatriates. According to Barbara Johnstone, professor of English and linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University, the term has its roots in the northern British Isles, an area that supplied many immigrants to Pittsburgh. It is derived from the verb \\"to jag\\". which means \\"to prick or poke\\". Johnstone said that among local Pittsburghers, \\"Nobody thinks of these derivatives of 'jag' as obscene\\", though non-local fellow Americans often mishear \\"jagoff\\" as the much more offensive slang term \\"jack off\\". Use in media and public events =Politics= On December 8, 2015, Mayor John Fetterman of Braddock, Pennsylvania, declared Donald Trump a jagoff in a press release after Trump called for a ban of all Muslims travelling to the United States. On July 30, 2016, Pittsburgh native Mark Cuban, a technology entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, referred to Trump as a \\"jagoff\\" during a speech in Pittsburgh, endorsing Hillary Clinton for president of the United States. =Movies= The term was often used by Michael Keaton, a native of the Pittsburgh region, in many of his early films, most notably Night Shift and Gung Ho. The term was used in the 2010 Denzel Washington film Unstoppable as a nod to the fact that the movie was filmed in Pittsburgh. The term was used in Martin Scorsese's Casino in a scene where a hitman referred to a target as a jag-off. The target was killed in a series of assassinations that took place to silence people that might have testified against mob bosses that skimmed said casino in movie. The term was used multiple times by characters in Magnolia Pictures' Buffaloed. =Television= SNL writer/actor Seth Meyers, the son of a Pittsburgh native, used the term and a Pittsburghese accent during a sketch entitled \\"Bar\\" in which he also performed a Bill Cowher impression. The term was used on Final Space season one, episode seven. The artificial intelligence, H.U.E., states that \\"KVN is a jag-off, Gary.\\" The term was used in season one, episode twelve of The Good Place, where character Eleanor Shellstrop says to an activist outside a grocery store, \\"look what you made me do, jagoff.\\" The term was used by character Rick Sanchez in the cartoon Rick and Morty, season three, episode eight. Controversies over the term In 2010, Pittsburgh-native and coach of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team, John Calipari raised hackles in the media when he jokingly referred to fellow Pittsburgher John Buccigross as a \\"jagoff\\". In 2012, David Shribman, a Massachusetts native and executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, issued a letter banning the use of the word \\"jagoff\\" anywhere in the newspaper. The decision was mocked by Chris Potter of the Pittsburgh City Paper, noting that Shribman's letter belied an utter lack of understanding of the actual etymology and history of the word, as he had confused it with the more base homophone, \\"jack off\\", common slang for masturbation. In response The Beaver County Times used some form of the term 19 times in a single article, suggesting that Shribman has \\"Jagoffphobia\\".

Vol 5, p.5, 1992 Mutisalah are also found in the Philippines and Borneo. Mutisalah were originally Indo-Pacific beads of orange and orange-red color. The earliest of these beads came from Southern India and have been dated as early as 200 BC. Their manufacture spread to other centers.Manik Manik di Indonesia, Sumarah Adhyatman. p.5 In the 9th-century Buddhist Sailendra dynasty, drawn Indo-Pacific beads, now called mutisalah, were produced by the Sumatran Srivijaya empire These beads were traded into Borneo, Java and to the eastern Indonesian islands until the 13th century. Nieuwenhuis, whose observations date from the turn of the century, reports that the reddish-brown beads, known in the Timor archipelago as mutisalah, and which also occur in South Sumatra, were brought from the Lampong Districts to Timor, where they yielded a high price. Likewise, inhabitants of Kro√© in Benkulen travelled from Sumatra to the west coast of Borneo and traversed the island to sell their ancient beads profitably to the Bahau and other tribes.Nieuwenhuis, A. W., 1904. ‚ÄúKunstperlen und ihre Kulturelle Bedeutung.‚Äù Internationales Archiv f. Ethnographie, XVI:136-154. Archeological evidence from 1000 to 1200 AD shows that this type of bead predominated. From the 13th century they are much less common.Francis 1989:8-9 Chinese-made beads came into use after the defeat of the Srivajaya Kingdom and it is postulated that the Chinese traders took advantage of the scarcity that was a consequence of the changed trade patterns. Chinese coil beads became common in Sumatra, Java and Borneo after the 12th century, but there is little evidence of Chinese trade with the Nusa Tenggara Timur until the Ming dynasty.Hirth, Friedrich and W.W. Rockhill [1911 Chau Ju-Kua: His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade-in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu- fan-~i. Imperial Acad~ of Science,' St. Petersburg (1966 reprint; Paragon, New York) Distribution Mutisalah are found and still treasured as heirloom beads, or beads declaring status and wealth in Sumba, Flores and Timor. They are also in use in Borneo. Mutisalah are found in Sumatra, but there they do not seem to have the same heirloom status. In the Philippines, mutisalah have been found in grave sites from between 100 BC and 500 AD that are known to have been manufactured in Arikamedu, South India. There is little evidence that they came through direct trade, rather they probably changed hands several times before reaching the Philippines.Casal, Gabriel and Regalado Trota Jose, Jr. The people and Art of the Philippines. Los Angeles: Museum of Cultural History, University of California, 1981. p.52 Classification There are two classes of mutisalah. One, the Mutiraja, is owned (and touched) only by royalty. They are reddish-brown or orange, shiny, and heavy in weight. That is, they are the lead-glass Chinese \\"coil\\" beads. The mutiraja used all over Nusa Tenggara Timur are usually quite small. There are larger mutiraja from in diameter which are found only on Sumba and are very rare. The other class is known as mutibatta (orange) or Mutitanah (red-brown). They are somewhat larger than Mutiraja, are dull in luster, and are not as heavy. These are drawn Indo-Pacific beads and are the beads of the commoners. Value In the eastern islands today, mutisalah are saved as heirlooms.Francis, Peter Jr, Beads of the World. p.95 Schiffer Publishing Ltd, The beads are valued differently by cultures on the various islands. In Sumba, Mutiraja are owned (and touched) only by royalty. Mutiraja are worn as necklaces by young princesses, and after marriage, as bracelets, anklets, and rings (in the old days they were also sewn onto clothes). The bride's family gives them to the groom in exchange for 50 to 100 carabao (water buffalo) or horses and some gold. The bride, however, wears the beads and passes them on to her daughter. In Timor, in 1965, a 12-inch long strand of mutisalah equaled the price of a water buffalo.The History of Beads., from 30,000 BC to the Present. Lois Sher Dubin, p.226 In the 1970s, some mutisalah which originated from sites in Sumatra were being exchanged for precious textiles by Haji Baharudin who then sold the textiles to collectors in Japan and the US. Uses In Sumba, mutiraja beads are worn by royalty on special occasions, but if the royal family does not wish to attend some ceremony, they send a servant bedecked with the beads. The servant wears either a Kahanga Hupu, a single strand around the neck and four long strands reaching to the ground terminated with gold coins, or a Papiarang which is similar but a double strand. In Flores, mutisalah may be owned only by the chieftain and are displayed on ceremonial occasions. Common people are forbidden to wear them.Francis, Peter Jr. Beads in Indonesia. Asian Perspectives, Vol 30, no.2. University of Hawaii Press. 1991 In Borneo, among the Maloh people, beads are tied to the wrists of a couple at marriage, and when a new communal house is built, beads are placed in the holes dug for the main posts of the structure.Maxwell, John. \\"The Beaded Textiles of Maloh,\\" in Indonesian Textiles.

He was one of the grandchildren of Musa al-Kadhim (the 7th Imam of Shias). His paternal lineage is as follows: Seyyed Ne'mat Allah son of Seyyed Abd Allah son of Mohammad son of Hossein son of Ahmad son of Mahmoud son of Ghias Aldin son of Majd Aldin son of Noor Aldin son of Saad Allah son of Issa son of Musa son of Abdallah son of Musa al-Kadhim.The mantle of the Prophet: religion and politics in Iran, Roy P. Mottahedeh, Simon and Schuster, 1985, Page 94History of Khuzestan, Seyyed Mohammad-Ali Emam-Shooshtari.  Early life  After finishing primary education, Jazayeri and his brother (Seyyed Najm al‚ÄìDin) traveled to Shiraz ‚ÄìIran to continue his education. He led a poor and difficult life in Shiraz, he had to work hard to be able to study. Therefore, he transcribed books, corrected the transcriptions and wrote glosses on books in order to earn money. Sometimes he worked from night up to morning, then studied his lessons and started teaching up to midday and after that he himself attended one of his masters‚Äô class. He spent three years in this manner in Shiraz. He studied under great teachers in Shiraz: Sheikh Jafar Bahrani (d. 1679), Ibrahim Ibn mullah Sadra, shah Abul Vali Shirazi, Seyyed Hashem Ehsaee, Sheikh Saleh Kazkazani (d. 1686). After marriage he traveled to Isfahan to complete his education. The following are some of his teachers in Isfahan: Seyyed Ahmad Mirza Jazayeri, Mirza Rafi‚Äô Tabatabaei (d. 1668), Sheikh Emad Yazdi, Mohaqeq Sabzewari (d.1678), Sheikh Ali Aameli, Sheikh Horr Aameli (d. 1692), Sheikh Hossein Khansari (d. 1686), Amir Ismail Khatun Abaadi (d. 1704), mullah Mohsen Feiz Kashani (d. 1679) and Allameh Baqer Majlesi some of Allameh Baqer Majlesi Pupils More than 1,000 scholars and researchers have benefited from the advantageous classes of Allameh Majlesi. He has also issued many religious authorizations and licenses for his pupils. The following are recorded as some of his pupils: 1- Sayyed Ne'mat Allah Jazayeri one of the Grandsons of Imam Musa Kazim (7th Imam of the Shias) 2- Jafar son of Abdullah Kamareyee Isfahani 3- Zaynul-Abedin son of Sheikh Horr Ameli 4- Suleyman son of Abdullah Mahuzi Bahrani 5- Sheikh Abdul-Razzaq Guilani 6- Abdul-Reza Kashani 7- Mohammad Baqer Biabanaki 8- Mirza Abdullah Affandi Isfahani [the author of \\"Riyazul-Ulema\\"] 9- Sayyed Ali Khan Madani [the author of \\"Riyazul- Salekin\\" (a commentary on Imam Sajjad's (a.s.) Supplications)] 10-Sheikh Horr Ameli 11-Mohammad son of Ismael Fassaie Shirazi 12-Mohammad son of Hassan, known as Fazel Hindi In Isfahan also he had a poor life but his teacher \\"Allameh Majlesi\\" helped and supported him; Jazayeri also helped him in writing the prominent book \\"Beharul Anwar\\". He stayed four years in Allameh Majlesi's house and gradually started teaching in a school. In 1668, he was invited to Khuzestan ‚ÄìIran by the ruler of Khuzestan (Fath Ali khan). Jazayeri established many mosques and religious schools and trained great students. He was the religious leader of Khuzestan and also south of Iraq. He guided people and tried to abolish the enmity between tribes.Seyyed Nematollah Jazayeri  Students  Jazayeri trained many students such as: Abul Hasan Qaravi Isfahani, Abul Hasan Shushtari, sheikh Ali Jameyi Aameli, Fath Allah Dorfi, Qazi (Judge) Taqi Shushtari, sheikh Muhammad Sabiri, sheikh Muhammad Alamul Hoda Kashani, sheikh Muhammad Najjar Shushtari, Mahmoud Meimandi and many others.  Works  There are left over 55 works of him such as: *Flower of spring *Present of secrets *Exegesis of the Quran *Rare news *Clear light (on the stories of the prophets), *Gardens of virtuous people (on virtues of Imams) *Unique companion (on explanation of monotheism) and many other glosses. Jazayeri was one of the most effective pupils of Allamah Majlesi that turned Sunni's in to Shia's. In the Safavid era, the meaning of the word \\"Mojtahed\\" suggesting \\"the person who attained maturity in the religious issues and who can be imitated\\" also changed. Seyyed Nematollah Jazayeri Al Anvar ol Alnamaniye who was a disciple of Allameh Majlesi who was considered one of the foundation stones of the Shia sect described the Mojtahed concept as \\"the heir of our Prophet, the caliphate of Allah and the speaking language of our God\\" and Mojtahed became the focus of the moral and social assessments. Mojtahed had knowledge about this world and the world which we will pass to and the recovery of the society was entirely in his responsibility. This interesting office reached such a position that the Safavid kings would take even their own crowns from the hand of Faqih or Mojtahed al Asrai.

A light novel adaptation also began publication starting August 8, 2013, featuring illustrations by Ky≈ç Nagiri. =Events= Events helds for the all Aikatsu series as: * Aikatsu Music Festa 2017 * Aikatsu Music Festa 2018 * Aikatsu Series 5th Festival * Aikatsu Orchestra Concert : Orchekatsu * Aikatsu Stars Special Live Tour 2018 : Music of Dream * STAR ANIS Special Live 2015 * BEST FRIENDS Special Live Tour : Thanks OK Reception Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network (ANN) commented that the anime series is \\"really a half-hour commercial for a card game aimed at elementary-aged girls, or at least it seems that way\\", but despite this she noted \\"there's something fun about this show and its toy- bright colors\\". Silverman said Aikatsu! is a show for someone \\"looking for some brainless fun with a toe-tapping yet saccharine soundtrack, you're a seven-year-old girl, or if you just really like the color pink\\". Theron Martin also from ANN described it as \\"essentially a complement to a like-named card game aimed at teen and preteen girls\\". ANN's Carlo Santos agreed that it's a commercial-like anime, but also criticized the animation, saying the \\"quality is barely enough to get by, and the character designs look oddly outdated.\\" Carl Kimlinger's opinion was less negative as he said Aikatsu! \\"isn't terrible by any stretch, but it doesn't make even a desultory effort to differentiate itself from the dozens of other shows that use aspiring idols to sell games and figurines and god knows what else\\" and that \\"character designs also have a lovely sh≈çjo flavor, and the whole series looks just as pink and pretty as can be.\\" He finished telling it will be \\"a highly tolerable diversion\\" for those who like this kind of anime. The film earned ¬•172,727,250 at the Japanese box office on its first weekend. As of February 21, 2016, it had grossed in South Korea.

Juxtaposed controls (in , or ; in ) are a reciprocal arrangement between Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom whereby border controls on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding the train or ferry, rather than upon arrival after disembarkation. With the exception of the Eurotunnel Shuttle route, customs checks remain unaffected by juxtaposed immigration controls and continue to take place upon arrival after disembarkation. Belgium, France and the Netherlands are all member states of the European Union and part of the border-free Schengen Area. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has never participated in the Schengen Area, including when it was a member state of the European Union. As a result, juxtaposed controls aim to increase the convenience and efficiency of border checks when travelling by train or ferry between the Schengen Area and the UK by removing the need for immigration checks on arrival and by streamlining checks on departure. At the same time, juxtaposed controls are intended to detect and prevent illegal immigration. In 2016, there were over 56,000 instances when people were refused entry to the UK at the juxtaposed controls. Rail =Eurotunnel Shuttle= UK Border Force checkpoint at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal, where entry checks are carried out before boarding the train to the UK. In 1991, the Sangatte Protocol was signed between France and the UK, an agreement that provided for border checkpoints to be set up by France at the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal in Cheriton, Kent and for border checkpoints to be set up by the UK at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal in Coquelles, France. The Sangatte Protocol is more formally known as the Protocol between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of the French Republic concerning frontier controls and policing, co-operation in criminal justice, public safety and mutual assistance relating to the Channel fixed link. The Sangatte Protocol was brought into effect in France by Decree No. 93-1136 of 24 September 1993 and in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993. As a result of the Sangatte Protocol, starting from 1994, when travelling from the UK to France by Eurotunnel Shuttle (road vehicle trains), French immigration and customs checks both take place before departing from the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal, rather than on arrival in France. French Border Police and Customs officers have the power to carry firearms and to arrest and detain individuals in the control zone. The UK Border Force does not carry out routine exit checks. Instead, Eurotunnel collects passengers' travel document information during the booking or check- in process, which it sends electronically to the UK Border Force. When travelling from France to the UK by Eurotunnel Shuttle, travellers have to clear both French exit checks and UK entry immigration and customs checks at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal before boarding the train. UK Border Force officers have the power to arrest and detain individuals in the control zone. PARAFE self-service gates are available which eligible passengers (EU, EEA, Andorran, Monegasque, San Marinese and Swiss citizens holding biometric passports) can use instead of a staffed counter to clear French entry immigration checks at the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal and French exit immigration checks at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal. Unlike the juxtaposed controls for the Eurostar and ferry which only consist of immigration pre- embarkation checks, juxtaposed controls for the Eurotunnel Shuttle consist of both immigration and customs pre-embarkation checks. In 2002‚Äì2003, at the UK immigration checkpoint at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal in France, 2,232 people were refused entry into the UK. In November 2019, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, carried out an unannounced inspection of the UK's two short-term holding facilities (STHF) at the Eurotunnel Calais Terminal in France, both of which are managed by private contractor Mitie. The Chief Inspector observed 'weak safeguarding practices for children' and had 'serious concerns about adult safeguarding practice' by the UK Border Force. The Chief Inspector also raised concerns about the routine practice of detaining people in escort vehicles while awaiting the arrival of the French Border Police. He noted that few of the detainees were interviewed (regardless of their age) and their bio-data were rarely taken. Detainees refused entry to the UK would be transferred to the French Border Police, who would then release them outside the terminal area. =Eurostar= French Border Police checkpoint at London St Pancras International station, where entry immigration checks to the Schengen Area are carried out before boarding the train. On 15 December 1993, a tripartite agreement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK. This agreement allowed Belgian officials to carry out pre-embarkation immigration controls at London Waterloo International station and British officials to carry out pre-embarkation immigration controls at Brussels-South station for passengers travelling on direct Eurostar train services between London and Brussels. The tripartite agreement was subsequently brought into effect in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1994, in France by Law No. 94-403 of 20 May 1994 and Decree No. 98-172 of 10 March 1998, and in Belgium by the Law of 29 August 1997.Loi portant approbation des actes internationaux However, the pre-embarkation immigration controls arrangement did not initially apply to Eurostar trains operating between the UK and France. Initially, French Border Police officers checked passengers' travel documents while on board the train before arriving in or after departing from their station in France. No customs checks were carried out on board the train. Starting from June 1998, the French Border Police set up control booths at Paris Gare du Nord, Lille-Europe and Calais-Fr√©thun stations. This led to a gradual phasing out of onboard immigration checks (in 1998, 3,638 onboard checks were carried out, whereas in 2000, only 642 onboard checks were carried out). At Calais-Fr√©thun station, passengers were routinely checked both on arrival and on departure. However, at Paris Gare du Nord and Lille-Europe stations, passengers were only checked on departure and not on arrival. Due to the design of the arrival train platforms at Lille-Europe station, the French Border Police could only stop and check around 11% of the alighting passengers arriving from London. On 29 May 2000, the 'Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol' was signed between France and the UK, an agreement that provided for immigration checkpoints to be set up by France in Eurostar stations in the UK and for immigration checkpoints to be set up by the UK in Eurostar stations in France. The UK was eager to conclude the agreement with France because, for several years, many Eurostar passengers arrived in the UK without adequate documentation and a significant number claimed asylum on arrival. As an illustration, in the second half of 2000, around 4,000 passengers arrived at London Waterloo without the correct documentation. Furthermore, under French law, there was no liability for SNCF, the French railway company, to check the travel documents of Eurostar passengers (in fact, it was illegal under French law for SNCF to carry out documentation checks), which meant that the Eurostar was an easier way for illegal immigrants to travel from France to the UK than other means of transport (for example, in contrast, an airline carrier would be fined a ¬£2,000 penalty for every passenger without adequate documentation who is brought to the UK, which encouraged airlines to check the travel documents of passengers more carefully). The Additional Protocol was subsequently brought into effect in France by Law No. 2001-409 of 11 May 2001 and in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) (Amendment No. 3) Order 2001. On 1 October 2004, an Administrative Arrangement was signed by Belgium, France and the UK to extend juxtaposed controls to Eurostar services between London and Brussels which make a stop in Lille. This was subsequently brought into effect in the UK by the Channel Tunnel (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Order 2004. As a result of the agreements, when travelling from the UK to Belgium or France by Eurostar, immigration entry checks into the Schengen Area take place before boarding the train in the UK, rather than on arrival in Belgium or France. The Schengen immigration entry checks are carried out in the UK stations before embarkation by the French Border Police (which also carries out immigration entry checks on behalf of the Belgian Federal Police for passengers travelling to Belgium). PARAFE self-service gates are available at London St Pancras International station which eligible passengers (EU, EEA, Andorran, Monegasque, San Marinese and Swiss citizens holding biometric passports) can use to clear French immigration checks (instead of using a staffed counter). UK Border Force officers do not carry out routine exit checks. Instead, starting from April 2015, Eurostar security staff scan passengers' travel documents when entering the departure area of the station and send the information (the passenger‚Äôs full name, nationality, date of birth, gender and travel document number, type and country of issue) electronically to the UK Border Force. When travelling from Belgium or France to the UK by Eurostar (except on the lines from Marseille and Marne la Vall√©e- Chessy, see below), passengers clear immigration exit checks from the Schengen Area, as well as UK immigration entry checks conducted by the UK Border Force, before boarding the train. When departing from Paris Gare du Nord, eligible passengers (EU, EEA, Andorran, Monegasque, San Marinese and Swiss citizens holding biometric passports) can use PARAFE self-service gates to clear immigration exit checks from the Schengen Area (instead of using a staffed counter). ePassport gates have been installed by the UK Border Force at both Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels-South, which eligible passengers (UK, EU, EEA, Swiss, Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean, South Korean and United States citizens (as well as other foreign nationals who have enrolled in the Registered Traveller scheme) aged 12 or over holding biometric passports) can use to clear UK entry immigration instead of using a staffed counter. Customs checks on Eurostar passengers remain unaffected by the agreements, and continue to take place upon arrival after leaving the train.Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol, Article 3 Between 2002 and 2003, 2,442 passengers were refused entry into the UK at the UK immigration checkpoints in Paris Gare du Nord and Lille-Europe stations on the basis that they had inadequate documentation. At Calais-Fr√©thun station, 56 passengers were refused entry into the UK at the UK immigration checkpoint there. Northbound passengers on the Marseille line disembark with their luggage at Lille-Europe station, go through immigration and security checks and re-board the train, as Marseille Saint-Charles, Avignon TGV and Lyon Part-Dieu do not have the space or resources to set up juxtaposed control booths there (although the previous service from Avignon Centre did have them). For this reason, the scheduled time of the northbound journey is around 1 hour longer than the southbound journey. This arrangement is informally known as the 'Lille shuffle'. Northbound passengers travelling from Marne la Vall√©e-Chessy station to the UK clear French exit checks before boarding the train, and then UK entry checks at the UK arrival stations. On 4 February 2020, the UK Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that passengers travelling on Eurostar from Amsterdam and Rotterdam to London would no longer have to disembark at Brussels-South station, go through immigration checks and re- board the train before continuing their journey to London. According to the announcement, starting from 30 April 2020, passengers would go through juxtaposed controls in Amsterdam Centraal station before boarding the train, and starting from 18 May 2020, passengers would go through juxtaposed controls in Rotterdam Centraal station before boarding the train. However, the inauguration of juxtaposed controls in Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was subsequently announced that direct service between London, Rotterdam and Amsterdam would start on 26 October 2020. The parties to the 1993 Tripartite Agreement (Belgium, France and the UK) agreed to add the Netherlands as a contracting party by entering into a new treaty (known as the 'Quadripartite Agreement'). Accordingly, on 7 July 2020, the four countries signed the 'Special Arrangement between the Governments of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK concerning Security Matters relating to Trains using the Channel Fixed Link'. On 10 July 2020, the Netherlands and the UK entered into a bilateral agreement ('Agreement concerning Border Controls on Rail Traffic between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom using the Channel Fixed Link'). Lille loophole Belgium and France are both member states of the European Union and the border-free Schengen Area. The United Kingdom was until 31 January 2020 a member state of the European Union, but did not participate in the Schengen Area. Some Eurostar services from Brussels to London made a stop in Lille/Calais. On such trains, passengers who boarded in Brussels and disembarked in Lille would be travelling within the Schengen Area, and therefore not be subject to border checks. The Belgian Federal Police did not permit UK Border Agency officers stationed at the juxtaposed controls at Brussels-South station to question or check the documents of passengers travelling on a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais. On the other hand, passengers boarding the same train in Brussels travelling on a ticket to the UK would be subject to exit checks leaving the Schengen Area and entry checks to the UK at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station. This situation created a loophole (which was commonly referred to as the 'Lille loophole') whereby certain passengers who buy a train ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais and therefore not go through the juxtaposed controls before boarding the train in Brussels, but would remain on the train after Lille/Calais and continue to the UK, thereby leaving the Schengen Area and entering the UK without having undergone the proper border checks. A number of passengers were able to travel to the UK and claim asylum on arrival in the UK using this method. After this loophole came to light in December 2011, Eurostar initially suspended the sale of point to point Brussels to Lille/Calais tickets, while maintaining the sale of season tickets on this route. Subsequently, Eurostar resumed the sale of tickets, but restricted the sale of Brussels-Lille/Calais tickets to 3 daily services. Upon arrival at Lille, the number of Brussels- Lille tickets sold were reconciled with the total number of disembarkations. Security guards conducted ticket inspections on passengers before the trains arrived at Calais, where those without a valid ticket to the UK would be instructed to disembark. In addition to the pre-embarkation juxtaposed controls, the UK Border Force also checked the travel documents of passengers travelling on these 3 services on arrival at London St Pancras International station. In December 2013, Belgium and the UK signed an agreement clarifying that at the juxtaposed controls in Brussels-South station, 'Immigration controls performed by the United Kingdom are only permitted on passengers whose travel destination is stated to be within the United Kingdom'. Further, 'Where a person who on Belgium territory boarded an international train using the Fixed Link and has arrived in the United Kingdom is refused entry, having been found to have avoided United Kingdom immigration controls on Belgian territory by stating that their final destination is intra-Schengen, the authorities of Belgium may not refuse to accept such a person for readmittance'. The agreement entered into force on 1 October 2016. In order to close this loophole, passengers travelling from Brussels to Lille or Calais go through a different departure area in Brussels-South station (bypassing the juxtaposed controls for passengers heading to the UK) and travel in a separate designated carriage (available in standard class only) controlled by security guards, who ensure that all of these passengers disembark at Lille/Calais before the train goes on to the UK. Until 30 January 2017, regular commuters holding a season ticket were exempt from this measure due to the high number of travellers on peak-hour services. After this exemption was removed, regular commuters complained that only one carriage (with 48 seats and standing capacity for 20 people) was allocated for passengers from Brussels to Lille on the peak hour train service departing from Brussels at 17:56. =List of railway stations with juxtaposed controls= ;In Belgium * Brussel- Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi ;In France * Bourg-Saint-Maurice * Calais‚ÄìFr√©thun * Eurotunnel Calais Terminal * Lille Europe * Mo√ªtiers‚ÄìSalins‚ÄìBrides-les-Bains *Paris Gare du Nord ;In the Netherlands * Amsterdam Centraal (originally scheduled to commence on 30 April 2020, but subsequently postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic) * Rotterdam Centraal (originally scheduled to commence on 18 May 2020, but subsequently postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic) ;In the UK * Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal * Ashford International * Ebbsfleet International * St Pancras International Ferry UK Border Force checkpoint in the Port of Dunkirk, where immigration checks are carried out before boarding the ferry to Dover. On 4 February 2003, France and the UK concluded the Treaty of Le Touquet (formally known as the Treaty between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the French Republic concerning the implementation of frontier controls at sea ports of both countries on the Channel and North Sea). This agreement provided for juxtaposed controls on a number of cross-Channel ferry routes. The Treaty was subsequently put into effect in France by Law No. 2003-1368 of 31 December 2003 and in the UK by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Juxtaposed Controls) Order 2003, under the authority of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. France has established immigration checkpoints at the Port of Dover, where the French Border Police carries out immigration entry checks into the Schengen Area on passengers travelling to Calais or Dunkirk. French Border Police officers have the power to carry firearms and to arrest and detain individuals in the immigration control zone in the Port of Dover. On the other hand, the UK Border Force does not carry out routine exit checks at the Port of Dover. Instead, since April 2015, the ferry operator collects passengers' travel document information during the booking or check-in process, which it sends electronically to the UK Border Force. However, coaches carrying organised school groups (consisting of students aged 16 and under accompanied by teachers or other responsible adults) are exempt from having their travel document information collected and sent to the UK Border Force. At present, the UK has immigration checkpoints at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk (previously, the UK also had an immigration checkpoint at the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer). UK Border Force officers have the power to arrest and detain individuals in the immigration control zone in the ports of Calais and Dunkirk. Passengers travelling from Calais and Dunkirk to the UK go through French exit checks as well as UK immigration entry checks before embarkation. Customs checks on ferry passengers remain unaffected by the Treaty and continue to take place upon arrival after leaving the ferry. Therefore, when travelling from France to Dover, although ferry passengers have already gone through immigration checks before departure, when they arrive in the UK, they might still be stopped by customs officers for a customs inspection. Similarly, when travelling from Dover to France, although ferry passengers have already been through immigration checks by the French Border Police at Dover, they might still be subject to a customs check by French Customs on arrival in France. Between 2003 and 2007, 10,766 people were refused entry into the UK by UK immigration officers stationed in Calais. A Joint Operational Coordination Centre has been created at the Port of Calais to strengthen co-operation between the UK Border Force, French Border Police and French Customs. Since 2011, private security officers employed by Eamus Cork Solutions (ECS) work in the freight lanes at the juxtaposed controls at the Port of Calais and the Port of Dunkirk. Their job is to detect people concealed inside vehicles attempting to enter the UK through visual inspections, sniffer dogs, or by equipment including heartbeat monitors, carbon dioxide detectors and scanners. At the UK-France Summit held at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 18 January 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK would provide an additional ‚Ç¨50 million in financial support for 2018 for France to strengthen border security (including fencing, CCTV and detection technology) at the juxtaposed controls at the Port of Calais, as well as to establish accommodation facilities located outside the Calais and Dunkirk areas, such as Reception and Assessment Centres. The two countries also agreed to a treaty (known as the Sandhurst Treaty) with provisions to implement the Dublin III Regulation concerning the treatment of unaccompanied asylum seeking children and to establish a Joint Information and Coordination Centre (in French: Centre Conjoint d‚ÄôInformation et de Coordination, or CCIC). The Sandhurst Treaty entered into force on 1 February 2018, and the Joint Centre became operational on 23 November 2018. The French Minister of the Interior, Christophe Castaner, has stated that if the juxtaposed controls were removed, it would lead to increased waiting times for travellers to clear immigration and customs on arrival. In November 2019, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, carried out an unannounced inspection of the UK's short-term holding facility (STHF) at the Port of Calais, which is managed by private contractor Mitie. The Chief Inspector raised concerns about the routine practice of detaining people in caged escort vehicles that were in 'appalling condition, with ripped out seats' for 'prolonged periods' while awaiting the arrival of the French Border Police. Few of the detainees were interviewed and UK Border Force officers could not state the legal authority under which these detainees were held. Detainees refused entry to the UK would be handed to the French Border Police and then be released outside the port area. No onsite medical care or access to legal advice is provided in the STHF. UK Border Force officers and Detainee Custody Officers (DCOs) employed by Mitie who work at the juxtaposed controls are either bussed in daily across the Channel from their homes in Kent, or they reside four nights a week in a hotel in Calais. Air There are no juxtaposed controls on cross-Channel air travel. Air carriers are required under UK and Schengen rules to perform checks before boarding that passengers possess travel documents to enter the destination country.Schengen Convention, Article 26(1)(b)Council Directive 2001/51/EC of 28 June 2001 supplementing the provisions of Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 (Carriers Liability Directive) Passengers flying from the Schengen Area to the UK undergo Schengen exit checks at the departure airport and entry checks by the UK Border Force at the arrival airport in the UK. For passengers flying from the UK to the Schengen Area, the UK Border Force does not conduct routine exit checks. Instead, the air carrier takes passengers' travel document information during the check-in process, which is transmitted electronically to the UK Border Force. Passengers then go through Schengen entry immigration and customs checks on arrival in the Schengen Area. Implications of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union The House of Lords European Union Committee has observed that the Treaty of Le Touquet led to a 'build-up of pressure in the Calais region of people who seek to come to the UK but who do not fulfil immigration requirements and are unable to seek asylum in the UK from France', and that the 'continuous establishment of unregulated camp sites for people in this position is an irritant in French politics'. As a consequence, after the result of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, there were increased calls in France to scrap the Treaty of Le Touquet and end juxtaposed controls, including from the then French Presidential candidates Alain Jupp√© and Emmanuel Macron, and from the Mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart. However, such calls have since receded, as political leaders in France and the UK have sought to reinforce their commitment to bilateral border cooperation (for example, by entering into the Sandhurst Treaty). At the same time, the Committee has noted that although the agreements establishing juxtaposed controls are 'not formally EU-dependent, the agreements underpinning bilateral border cooperation have undoubtedly been easier to sustain under the shared umbrella of EU membership'. On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the European Union. During the transition period that is set to end on 31 December 2020, the arrangements for juxtaposed controls remain unchanged.

History Constructed between 1806 and 1809 on behalf of Trinity House in Quebec City, the lighthouse was responsible for the improvement and surveillance of the lower Saint Lawrence River. It was among the first lighthouses built in Canada, and was the first built on the banks of the Saint Lawrence.

The longevity of the building and its continued use attest to the success of this design, which proved highly functional, as well as to the quality of materials and construction.

This base was dedicated to Pacific heavy long-range bomber fleet, housing the 444th Berlin Order of Kutuzov 3rd degree and Alexander Nevsky Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, part of the 326th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division, 37th Air Army. A declassified CIA document from 1969 showed this was the only base east of the Urals that had the Tupolev Tu-22 Blinder aircraft. Later in the 1970s onward the regiment consisted of supersonic long-range Tu-22M3 bombers. The 444th Regiment was disbanded in 2009, with some aircraft transferred to the Belaya air base, and others dismantled (removed engines, equipment, and with holes cut in the fuselage). The aircraft carcasses are awaiting final metal cutting. Currently based at the airfield is the aviation commandant of Khurba airbase and the 322 Aircraft Repair Factory (322 ARZ). History On Saturday, April 18, 1942, Captain York's B-25 (serial number 40-2242) landed here after participating in the Doolittle Raid. In doing so, it became the only one of 16 launched B-25s that did not crash or was ditched. The aircraft was confiscated and its crew was interned and interviewed by the commander of the base at that time, Col. Kovalev. They were moved from the base the next morning.

In 1953 the 444th Regiment moved to Vozdvizhenka. It operated Tupolev Tu-4s from September 1951 to 1957 (exact dates Holm), and from that time until 1991-92 Tupolev Tu-16 variants. The Tu-16K was in service from 1975.

Butowski writes that it was disbanded, while Holm says that it was reequipped with Tu-22Ms. Butowski and a range of other sources, including AFM 2007, say the regiment came into existence again, possibly by 1997 by renaming the 132nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment. Holm says instead that on 29 January 1997, the 132nd Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment instead absorbed the 444th Regiment. However, most available sources (AFM and others, including Kommersant-Vlast, 2005) have listed the 444th Regiment in existence until c.2009. The regiment reportedly became known as \\"444th Berlin Order of Kutuzov 3rd degree and Alexander Nevsky Bomber Aviation Regiment¬ª. In 2009 as part of the extensive reorganisation of the Air Force the 444th Regiment was disbanded, and dismantlement of some aircraft began. Others were reportedly transferred to an air base at Belaya. As of 2012, there are no longer any strategic bombers in Primorskiy Krai; the nearest Long Range Aviation base seems now to be the 6952nd Air Base at Ukrainka, in Amur Oblast. About 9 kilometres north of the base is a RTB, repair and technical base; language used exclusively for nuclear weapons maintenance, storage, and assembly. The unit is still active, despite the bomber base being closed.

Detail from a 1710 painting of Cornelius Berenberg (1634‚Äì1711) Berenberg-Gossler coat of arms on a grave at Niendorfer Cemetery, Hamburg The Berenberg family (Dutch for \\"bear mountain\\") was a Flemish-origined Hanseatic family of merchants, bankers and senators in Hamburg, with branches in London, Livorno and other European cities. The family was descended from the brothers Hans and Paul Berenberg from Antwerp, who came as Protestant refugees to the city-republic of Hamburg following the Fall of Antwerp in 1585 and who established what is now Berenberg Bank in Hamburg in 1590. The Berenbergs were originally cloth merchants and became involved in merchant banking in the 17th century. Having existed continuously since 1590, Berenberg Bank is the world's oldest surviving merchant bank. The Berenberg banking family became extinct in the male line with Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822); she was married to Johann Hinrich Gossler, who became a co-owner of the bank in 1769. From the late 18th century, the Gossler family, as owners of Berenberg Bank, rose to great prominence in Hamburg, and was widely considered one of Hamburg's two most prominent families, along with the related Amsinck family. A branch of the family was later ennobled by Prussia as Barons of Berenberg-Gossler (Hamburg was a republic and had no nobility). Several members of the Berenberg and Gossler families served in the Senate of Hamburg from 1735, and Elisabeth Berenberg's grandson Hermann Gossler became head of state of the city-republic. Richard J. Evans describes the family as one of Hamburg's \\"great business families.\\"Richard J. Evans, \\"Family and Class in Hamburg,\\" in D. Blackbourn (ed.), The German Bourgeoisie, p. 122, Routledge, 1993 The Gossler Islands in Antarctica are named for the family. Elisabeth Berenberg and Johann Hinrich Gossler presently have descendants with names including (Berenberg-)Gossler, Paus, Bernstorff and other names. Members of the Berenberg family have founded several other companies. A London branch of the Berenberg family were prominent merchants in the West Indies trade from the 17th century and co-founded the London firm Meyer & Berenberg.Margrit Schulte Beerb√ºhl, The Forgotten Majority. German Merchants in London, Naturalization, and Global Trade 1660‚Äì1815. Berghahn Books, 2014. . Berenberg- Gossler & Partner was Hamburg's leading corporate law firm and later merged into the current law firm Taylor Wessing. History =The Berenbergs in Berg and Brabant= Antwerp in modern Belgium in 1572 The Berenberg family originates from the Bergisches Land region in the Duchy of Berg. Its earliest known ancestor, Thillmann Berenberg, was born on the Gro√ü-Berenberg estate in 1465, and was a cloth merchant. The growing linen industry of Brabant led Thillmann's son, Jan Berenberg (born 1490 in Gummersbach, died 1549 in Lier, Belgium), to take his family to Lier in Antwerp, where he became a burgher in 1515. He was married to Engele Segers, and they were the parents of Paul Berenberg (born ca. 1533 in Lier, died 1623 in Antwerp), who was a cloth merchant in Antwerp and who married Anna Kriekart from Everbroek. Paul Berenberg was the father of Hans (1561‚Äì1626) and Paul Berenberg (1566‚Äì1645). The two brothers married sisters Anna (1557‚Äì1635) and Francina Snellinck (1559‚Äì1642), daughters of the Antwerp merchant Andries Snellinck (1531‚Äì1606) and Fran√ßoise (Francina) de R√©nialme (1539‚Äì1610). The Berenbergs were one of 130 Dutch families that had become Lutheran during the Reformation. During the Eighty Years' War, the family fled Lier and settled in the nearby city of Antwerp (Stade). The family left Antwerp in 1585 as a result of the Fall of Antwerp, when the city was conquered by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. The strongly fortified city, Europe's leading commercial centre at the time, was defended with resolute determination and courage by its citizens, but ultimately fell, and around 60% of the city's pre-siege population fled the city, fearing Spanish massacres or forced conversion to Catholicism. =Grand burghers of Hamburg= Hamburg ca. 1600 Many Dutch refugees settled in Hamburg, among them the brothers Hans and Paul Berenberg. In 1590, they founded the merchant house now known as Berenberg Bank. They were originally cloth merchants and active in the import-export business. In Hamburg, the Berenbergs initially formed part of a Dutch colony and intermarried with the city's leading Hanseatic families, several of which were also of Dutch descent (e.g. Amsinck). While a number of Dutch refugees became Hamburg citizens, Hans and Paul Berenberg were not prepared to take that step. In 1605, the Hamburg council issued a decree that gave the Dutch merchants the same rights as the burghers of Hamburg. Cornelius Berenberg (1634‚Äì1711) Hans Berenberg's son was also named Hans Berenberg (1593‚Äì1640), and was married to Adelheid Ruhlant (1611‚Äì1684), daughter of the advocate R√ºtger Ruhlant (1568‚Äì1630) who was ennobled by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1622, and Catarina de Greve (1582‚Äì1655). Their son, Cornelius Berenberg (1634‚Äì1711), was the first to engage in merchant banking and developed the company into a very successful merchant house and merchant bank. He forged trade links with France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Scandinavia and Russia. Family connections of the Berenbergs were instrumental to the development, especially in Livorno and Lisbon with its colonies of wealthy Dutch merchants.Karl Lanz, Banken der Welt, F. Knapp, 1963 Cornelius Berenberg was also the first Berenberg to take the oath as a Hamburg burgher in 1684; the family thus became part of Hamburg's ruling class of Grand Burghers. Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772), owner of Berenberg Bank Cornelius Berenberg's son, Rudolf Berenberg (1680‚Äì1746), was elected a Senator in 1735. By the mid 18th century, investment banking and acceptance credits comprised a significant part of the firm's activities. Rudolf Berenberg was married to Anna Elisabeth Amsinck (1690‚Äì1748), the daughter of Paul Amsinck (1649‚Äì1706), a merchant of Hamburg and Lisbon, who was descended from the Welser family. They were the parents of Rudolf Berenberg (1712‚Äì61), a merchant in Hamburg, Cornelius Berenberg (1714‚Äì73), a merchant in Livorno, Senator Paul Berenberg (1716‚Äì1768) and of Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772), a co-owner and later sole owner of the Berenberg company. =The Gossler and Seyler families= Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822), co-owner of Berenberg Bank and wife of Johann Hinrich Gossler. Upon her death, the Berenberg family became extinct in the male line. The Berenberg family were merchants, bankers and senators in Hamburg for almost two centuries until the banking branch of the Berenberg family became extinct in the male line. However, Berenberg Bank was passed on to the descendants of Johann Berenberg (1718‚Äì1772) in the female line. After Senator Paul Berenberg died childless in 1768, his brother Johann Berenberg took on his son-in-law Johann Hinrich Gossler (1738‚Äì90) as a partner and eventually sole heir, as he was married to Johann Berenberg's only surviving child, Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822). The Gossler family is known in Hamburg since the 17th century, when Johann Hinrich Gossler's great- grandfather Claus Gossler (1630‚Äì1713) was a Hamburg burgher. The historian Percy Ernst Schramm describes their marriage as a marriage of convenience; she was not considered beautiful, but was intelligent, cultivated, kind, spoke many languages (including Latin) and became an exemplary wife and mother. She survived her husband by 32 years and after his death managed the firm together with her son-in-law.Percy Ernst Schramm, Neun Generationen: Dreihundert Jahre deutscher \\"Kulturgeschichte\\" im Lichte der Schicksale einer Hamburger B√ºrgerfamilie (1648‚Äì1948). Vol. I and II, G√∂ttingen 1963/64.\\"Johann Hinrich Gossler,\\" in Hamburgische Biografie-Personenlexikon, Vol. 2, ed. by Franklin Kopitzsch, Dirk Brietzke, pp. 153‚Äì154Johann Hinrich Gossler (1738‚Äì90), who married Elisabeth Berenberg (1749‚Äì1822) In 1788, Johann Hinrich Gossler bought the Mortzenhaus palace in Alter Wandrahm 101 (later 21). Built in 1621 with a renaissance facade, it was one of the largest and most well known palaces in Hamburg. The building was owned by the Gossler family until the 1880s, when it was demolished to make room for the Speicherstadt. Ludwig Erdwin Seyler (1758‚Äì1836), who married Anna Henriette Gossler (1771‚Äì1836), eldest daughter of Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg's eldest daughter, Anna Henriette Gossler, was married to Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, a son of the famous theatre director Abel Seyler. In 1788, Johann Hinrich Gossler took on his son-in-law as a partner in the firm, and after Gossler's death in 1790, Seyler became head of the firm, which was renamed Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. in 1791. He held several public offices in Hamburg and served as President of the Commerz-Deputation 1817‚Äì1818. During the Napoleonic War, Seyler temporarily moved the headquarters of the Berenberg company to the house of his son-in-law, Gerhard von Hosstrup. L.E. Seyler and Anna Henriette Gossler's children were briefly co-owners of Berenberg Bank, and they have many prominent descendants in Hamburg and Norway with family names such as von Hosstrup, Wegner and Paus. Anna Henriette Gossler (1775‚Äì1842), eldest child of Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg, married to the Berenberg company's longtime head L.E. Seyler Anna Henriette Gossler's younger brother Johann Heinrich Gossler became a partner in 1798, and was elected a senator of Hamburg in 1821. Several other family members also served as senators, with Hermann Gossler becoming First Mayor (a position equal to the federal princes, Bundesf√ºrsten). In 1880, Johann Berenberg Gossler (who had Berenberg as a middle name) and his descendants were granted the name Berenberg-Gossler by the Hamburg Senate. The Berenberg-Gosslers were ennobled in the Kingdom of Prussia (which was technically a foreign country) in 1888 and raised to Baronial rank in 1910.German bank enters UK market, World Finance The Prussian ennoblement was somewhat controversial in the family and in Hamburg, as the grand burghers of Hamburg mostly considered the nobility inferior to Hanseatic families. Renate Hauschild-Thiessen: \\"Adel und B√ºrgertum in Hamburg.\\" In: Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch. 14, 1997, p. 30. According to Richard J. Evans, \\"the wealthy of nineteenth-century Hamburg were for the most part stern republicans, abhorring titles, refusing to accord any deference to the Prussian nobility, and determinedly loyal to their urban background and mercantile heritage.\\"Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg: Society and Politics in the Cholera Years 1830‚Äì1910, Oxford, 1987, p. 560 As Johann Berenberg-Gossler was ennobled, his sister Susanne, married Amsinck, exclaimed \\"Aber John, unser guter Name!\\" Grave of the Gossler family, including Elisabeth Berenberg, Ludwig Erdwin Seyler, Johann Heinrich Gossler and Hermann Gossler In the 19th century, the Berenberg-Gosslers were strongly involved in the industrialisation process in northern Germany and in the North American trade and its finance. In 1847, the Berenberg-Gosslers were the main founders of the Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) together with the merchant house H.J. Merck & Co., and in 1857 they were among the main founders of the Norddeutscher Lloyd. They also financed the ironworks of Ilseder H√ºtte. The houses of Berenberg-Gossler, H.J. Merck and Salomon Heine were also the main founders of the Norddeutsche Bank in 1856, the first joint-stock bank in northern Germany and one of the predecessors of Deutsche Bank.Michael North: \\"The Great German Banking Houses and International Merchants, Sixteenth to Nineteenth Century\\", in: Alice Teichova, Ginette Kurgan-Van Hentenryk and Dieter Ziegler (eds.), Banking, Trade and Industry: Europe, America and Asia from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century, Cambridge University Press, 2011, , p. 46 Since the early 19th century, Berenberg Bank had a close cooperation with Barings Bank of London, and its owners a close personal relationship with the Baring family.Tanja Dr√∂ssel, Die Engl√§nder in Hamburg 1914 bis 1945, pp. 107‚Äì108 During the Nazi era, the Berenberg-Gossler family‚Äîthemselves descended from religious refugees‚Äîespecially Baron Cornelius von Berenberg-Gossler, were strongly involved in helping Jewish-origined friends and associates in Hamburg who faced persecution, securing the release of Fritz Warburg in 1939.G√∂tz Aly, Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der europ√§ischen Juden durch das nationalsozialistische Deutschland: Deutsches Reich : 1938 - August 1939, Oldenbourg Verlag, 2009 Heinrich von Berenberg- Gossler was the last family member to serve as a personally liable partner (until 1979). In Hamburg, the Gossler Park in Blankenese is named after the family. In 18th and 19th century Hamburg, a marriage to a Berenberg/Gossler or the closely related Amsinck family could greatly advance one's social position, as was the case with Hamburg head of state Max Pred√∂hl.Pred√∂hl, Andreas, Das Ende der Weltwirtschaftskrise, Reinbek, 1962Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg, 1987 Wilhelm Gossler (1811‚Äì1895) was the grandfather of the painter and sculptor Mary Warburg, who was married to the art historian and cultural theorist Aby Warburg, a member of the Warburg banking family. Joachim von Berenberg-Consbruch (n√© Consbruch) and other people named Berenberg- Consbruch are not descended from the Berenberg family; he acquired the name by civil name change in Hamburg in 1976. He worked for the bank and his stepfather was a Berenberg-Gossler.

She went missing sometime on 5 November, and her body was found naked and mutilated in an open space the next morning. The dipheko (medicine murder) sparked protests by the students at the Radikolo Community Junior Secondary School (RCJSS), the school where she attended, as well as among the citizens of Mochudi. The protests led to riots in neighbouring Gaborone, prompting the government of Botswana to call in the Scotland Yard. No one has been formally charged with the murder, and an official police report was conducted, but as of August 2012, the results have not yet been released. The murder inspired the stories in Unity Dow's novel The Screaming of the Innocent, Michael Stanley's mystery Deadly Harvest, and Alexander McCall Smith novel The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Background The ritual murder of a person whose body parts are cut off to make muti (medicine) that is used in ceremonies to promote business deals or success is common in Botswana. The British dealt with ritual murder cases when the country was still a protectorate as early as the 1930s, and social scientist Cyprian Fisiy has called witchcraft \\"the primary concern of most African communities\\". Children, especially highly educated students, are the primary targets of dipheko (rituals) because of their perceived potential for success. When social anthropologist √òrnulf Gulbrandsen interviewed several Batswana, one man said that, \\"we have no other way to explain how some people become rich overnight\\". Most accused people in cases of ritual murders recount either being possessed to murder or being threatened by future attacks through boloi (witchcraft) and thus were coerced to kill. Murder In November 1996, anthropologist Charlanne Burke interviewed a student who summarised the murder: Investigation Segametsi's stepfather was arrested after confessing that he and other local businessmen killed the girl, but he retracted his statement, saying that the confession was really a second-hand account. While the named businessmen were arrested, they were released, sparking controversy in Mochudi. In 2008, Sekobye Mokgalo, one of the named businessmen, asked for government compensation for the wrongful conviction. In 2009, he received 10000,000 Botswana pula for damages from the government. Protests In January 1995, students at Radikolo Community Junior Secondary School organized a march at the District Commissioner's office in Mochudi in response \\"perceived [...] government collusion in the practice of witchcraft\\". The march escalated into riots and protesters burned the house of the suspects. The violence continued in Gaborone starting on 16 February 1995. An ad hoc group, the Revolutionary War Council, pressed for justice \\"without [the] state's intervention.\\" The Special Services Group, the riot police of the Botswana Defence Force, used tear gas on protesters in the central business district while students at the University of Botswana stormed an ongoing meeting of the National Assembly of Botswana. President Quett Masire issued a statement in response to the protests: Both rioters and police were injured: more than fifteen protesters were treated for rubber bullet wounds at the Deborah Relief Memorial Hospital, a small boy was killed and a bystander was paralyzed; both by police rubber bullets. A man was later executed by the police for the protests. The Botswana National Front Youth League criticized the government's response to the riots, saying that the military force was \\"not in keeping with democratic practice and may signal the emergence of a police/military state\\".

In the Koƒçevje land registry of 1498 the village had four half-farms; the cultivated area gradually increased, so that by 1574 seven half-farms were recorded in the village. Before the Second World War Pre≈æa had 16 houses, and three Slovene families also lived in the village. The Southern Lower Carniolan Battalion of the Partisan forces was founded here on 16 April 1942. Italians forces burned the village on 27 April 1942 and killed 11 men from the vicinity that they had brought to the village. Church The village church was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Joseph. It stood at the northern edge of the village and there was a cemetery south of the church. The church had a rectangular nave with two side chapels and a narrower polygonal chancel walled on three sides. There was a bell-gable extending above the west wall of the church. The church was built around 1637 and was first mentioned in written sources in 1689 by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor. The church was expanded in the mid- to late-18th century. The building had a gabled shingled roof. The church was destroyed in the 1950s and a gravel road was laid in its place.Ferenc, Mitja. \\"Pre≈æa: Podru≈æniƒçna cerkev sv.

As with its American counterpart, HBO Brazil has premium characteristics, and invests in original programming. It is also the flagship network on HBO Max, the channel package offered by its programmer, HBO Latin America Group, along with the movie-oriented Max channel.  History  The first signs of a Latin American expansion of HBO came with the debut of Selecciones in 1989, a Spanish- language track available during part of HBO's programming in the US. Up to the end of 1991, HBO already had a channel operating in Latin America, although not in Portuguese. The group's initial operations in the region happened with a partnership between Time Warner with Venezuelan-owned Omnivisi√≥n Latin Entertainment (OLE), forming HBO Ol√© Partners in that year. Currently known as HBO Latin America Group, the company still maintains HBO and several other licensed channels. Afterwards, Sony Pictures joined, guaranteeing exclusivity on Columbia and TriStar Pictures releases. Soon after the launch of the Latin American initiative, HBO Ol√© was seeking a partner for its Brazilian arrival. Two large media groups in Brazil, Organiza√ß√µes Globo (Globosat and NET) and Grupo Abril (TVA), were also looking for partnerships with major studios in order to acquire content for their movie channels. HBO was considered by Globo, but the deal never went forward because it'd guarantee only Warner Bros. at the time. The definitive choice was Grupo Abril, which was starting TVA, its cable provider, to join as a minor shareholder. HBO Brazil went on the air on July 1, 1994. HBO also established itself as a programmer of other networks in Brazil. Its first foray was on basic cable, with Sony Entertainment Television. Later, as years passed, more channels and partnerships were accomplished by HBO Ol√© Partners. On TVA, HBO Brazil replaced movie channel Showtime (not related to the American premium network). Abril also assured that HBO was distributed exclusively through TVA. Around the same time, Telecine, from Globosat, was establishing its operations in the country with 20th Century Fox, Paramount, MGM and Universal Pictures. In December 1994, HBO Brazil had its first experimental 3D broadcasts, distributing anaglyph glasses for subscribers and offering additional pairs for one real each. Three-dimensional programming consisted of short movies between regular programs. The network was also the first to adopt multiplexing in Brazil by offering HBO2, with the original channel programming tape-delayed by 6 hours, in March 1995. 1996 marked the arrival of DirecTV Brazil, to be one of its most important partners: by the end of 1999, a 5-year satellite exclusivity contract was signed between HBO Brazil and DirecTV, estimated at about $250 million. In 1997, another studio joined the network: Walt Disney Pictures. That same year, Cinemax, available in the rest of Latin America since 1994, launches in Brazil, totalling 3 premium channels offered. In July 2000, HBO Brazil had a major change in control: Grupo Abril started to dissociate itself from the programmer role, keeping only MTV Brasil and selling its 25% stake back to HBO, valued at around $43 million. In October, now being run directly from abroad, another channel was added: Cinemax Prime ‚Äì this time earlier than the rest of Latin America, which had HBO Plus. Other than new networks, Abril's withdrawal made programming to be determined directly by HBO Latin America Group headquarters in Coral Gables, Florida, leaving only a sales and marketing office in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The package that had HBO Brazil was finally consolidated on December 18, 2003, when HBO Plus and HBO Family became available in Brazil, initially only through DirecTV. With this, it now had five channels: HBO, HBO Family, HBO Plus, Cinemax, and Cinemax Prime, each accompanied by its time-shifted companion (HBO2 among them), totalling 10 channels. On March 16, 2005, HBO Brazil, along with the HBO Max package, finally arrived to other cable providers with the inclusion of its networks on NET, the largest pay TV operator in Brazil. On satellite, Sky Brazil, acquired by DirecTV, ended up getting the channels when both companies merged in 2006. Now, with both exclusivity contracts ended, HBO Brazil was free for negotiation with other providers. However, both NET and Sky conditioned the availability of HBO to the mandatory subscription of rival Telecine channels, and the situation remained that way until December 2009. Its HD simulcast debuted in Brazil on October 1, 2008, through TVA. In 2010, HBO on Demand was announced for Brazil, initially through a partnership with NET, offering content on demand for the channel's subscribers. March 2010 also represented the departure of Sony Pictures as a shareholder and partner of HBO Latin America Group, accompanied by Disney. The group remains only with Time Warner (Home Box Office, Inc.) and OLE. August 2011 came with a loss for HBO, no longer with Walt Disney Studios' catalog in Brazil. Other Latin American countries will remain with Disney's content. The Brazilian transition will occur for two more years ‚Äì meanwhile, the back catalog will stay with HBO, but the premium window will be exclusive to Telecine, starting in October 2011. The announcement came amidst controversies: Telecine claims to now have over 70% of premieres (Disney included), an argument refuted by HBO, which, in turn, says it has over 50% of top-grossing movies. The main issue, however, is that HBO announced that it spontaneously broke up the agreement with Disney to \\"open space for new Brazilian productions,\\" also contradicting Disney's Latin America VP Fernando Barbosa's statement that it was a financial issue, Telecine being \\"more watched and, thus, more profitable.\\" Globosat's general manager, Alberto Pecegueiro, was also quoted as saying that his company maintains good relations with most programmers, with the exception of HBO, which he considers \\"thugs.\\" HBO did not respond.

From the 17th century the Hamburg branch of the family formed part of the city-state's ruling class, the Hanseaten or hereditary grand burghers, who enjoyed legal privileges in Hamburg until 1918. Amsinck has been one of Hamburg's great business families over many centuries, and its members reached the highest positions in Hamburg society, including as senators and head of state. A branch of the family were large plantation owners in Suriname. The Hamburg branch retained a Dutch identity for centuries, often intermarrying with other Dutch-origined patrician families. The family is descended from Johan Amsinck (born ca. 1410‚Äì1430), a burgher of Oldenzaal in 1459. His grandson Rudolph Amsinck (1518‚Äì1582/90) was Mayor of Zwolle. The flowering plant genus Amsinckia is named after the family in honour of the Hamburg head of state and patron of botany Wilhelm Amsinck (1752‚Äì1831).Umberto Quattrocchi (ed.), CRC World Dictionary of Medicinal and Poisonous Plants: Common Names, Scientific Names, Eponyms, Synonyms, and Etymology, CRC Press, 2016, p. 263, Hamburg branch, with branches in Lisbon and London The son of Rudolph Amsinck, Willem Amsinck (ca. 1542‚Äì1618), fled the Netherlands in 1576 and came as a religious refugee to Hamburg, where he became a wealthy cloth merchant. The family in Hamburg often intermarried with other families of Dutch/Flemish descent, and is closely related to other patrician families of Hamburg, such as the Berenbergs/Gosslers.Richard J. Evans, \\"Family and Class in Hamburg,\\" in D. Blackbourn (ed.), The German Bourgeoisie, p. 122, Routledge, 1993 Willem Amsinck was married to Henrica de Rouse and they were the parents of Rudolf Amsinck (1577‚Äì1636), who became a senator of Hamburg, and who was married to Isabeau (Isabella) de Hertoghe (1583‚Äì1636) from Antwerp, whose family formed part of the seven noble houses of Brussels patrician group in what is now Belgium. Their descendants were prominent merchants in Hamburg, Lisbon and other European cities with Dutch merchant colonies, as well as in London. Paul Amsinck (1733‚Äì1812) was Ambassador of the Hanseatic states to the Court of St. James's (the United Kingdom; 1771-1784). In 1802, Wilhelm Amsinck (1752‚Äì1831) became First Mayor of Hamburg and President of the Senate (i.e. head of state of the free imperial city and de facto independent city-state), having been elected to its senate in 1786. Johannes Amsinck (1792‚Äì1879) earned a fortune by trading with newly independent South American states in the early 19th century, and was involved in the establishment of the Vereinsbank Hamburg and the Hamburg America Line (HAPAG). He was married to Emilie Gossler, daughter of Senator Johann Heinrich Gossler.Wasmuth: Hanseatische Dynastien, S. 17. He was the father of Martin Garlieb Amsinck (1831‚Äì1905), a leading ship-owner of Hamburg. Members of the family were also large land-owners in Holstein. The Amsincks were one of the oldest, most prosperous and most respected Hanseatic families of Hamburg; a marriage to an Amsinck or a Berenberg/Gossler could greatly advance one's social position in the 18th and 19th centuries, as was the case with Hamburg head of state Max Pred√∂hl.Pred√∂hl, Andreas, Das Ende der Weltwirtschaftskrise, Reinbek, 1962Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg, 1987 The Hamburg Amsinck family lost most of its fortune during the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic. In Hamburg, the Amsinck Park and the Amsinckstra√üe main road are named for the family. Many family members are buried at the Old Niendorf Cemetery. In Suriname, some former slaves adopted the surname Amsinck or Amzink after their former masters following the emancipation.

Kanda was elected to the legislative assembly of the state of Haryana in 2009 as an Independent representative for the Sirsa constituency. He served for some time as a minister in the Government of Haryana before resigning his post in the wake of legal charges being filed against him. He subsequently founded the Haryana Lokhit Party and stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the state assembly elections of 2014. Background Gopal Goyal Kanda was born on 29 December 1965 in Sirsa, Haryana, India, where his father, Murli Dhar Kanda, was a lawyer. His ancestors were market traders and his surname, Kanda, refers to the iron weights used by such people. He lived with his family in a two-room apartment above their shop. They had connections with an influential local politician, Om Prakash Chautala, and access to Tara Baba (died 2002), a reclusive local spiritual guru whom Kanda has subsequently done much to promote venerate. A school drop-out, according to The Times of India Kanda has been \\"Electrician, shoe shop owner, real estate broker, industrialist, car dealer, Tara Baba devotee, airline owner and politician\\". Kanda's early attempts at business in Sirsa ‚Äì a music shop and various ventures involving shoes ‚Äì were unsuccessful. In 1997, he moved to Gurgaon to enter the real estate business and was able to exploit legal reforms to become a successful broker and, eventually, developer. By 2005, he also had interests in designer clothing production and was an exporter, as well as owning a hotel in Gurgaon, a casino in Goa and various car dealerships. He launched MDLR Airlines around 2006‚Äì2007, but it suspended operations in 2009, after accumulating losses and suffering a 2008 tax raid in which numerous employees were convicted. The airline became a part of Emirates Airlines in October 2010. Kanda is married to Saraswati Devi and has a son and two daughters. He uses the surname \\"Kanda\\" for political and religious purposes, while for business purposes and on official papers his name is Gopal Kumar Goyal. Politics Kanda returned to Sirsa in 2006 with an eye to entering politics. He leveraged the local status of the Chautala family and of Tara Baba, in memory of whom he built a large temple complex. It was during the period after Chautala became Chief Minister in 1999 that Kanda's business career had taken off but Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) party lost the 2005 general elections in Haryana. The relationship with the Chautala family soured when they refused to select Kanda as an INLD candidate in the 2009 state assembly elections, believing that he was incapable of winning. Although he was also friendly with significant members of the Indian National Congress (INC), that party, too, refused him a candidacy. Exploiting his religious affiliations with Tara Baba, he contested instead as an independent and defeated the INLD candidate, Padam Jain, by a margin of 6521 votes. He supported the INC, led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, in the formation of a government. The INC had 40 legislators and needed at least another six to form the government, so Kanda acted as kingmaker and rallied a group of independents in support of Hooda. He was rewarded with a cabinet post and made Minister of State for Home in Haryana. He had at that time ten criminal cases pending against him. When not bound by the Election Commission of India's Model Code of Conduct, which restricts certain activities during election periods, Kanda regularly provided his constituents with free medicines and access to medical services, along with food, water and school books. Supporters claim that Tara Baba declared him to be his spiritual heir. Resignation as minister Kanda was arrested in 2012 and resigned from office in the home ministry in the Government of Haryana. On 5 August 2012, Geetika Sharma, a former air hostess with the MDLR airline had committed suicide. She left two suicide notes,. accusing Kanda and an aide of harassment. She also alleged that Kanda was \\"having an illicit relationship with another woman, Ankita, with whom he has a child\\". Allegations have been made that before her suicide Kanda sent a letter to Emirates saying that she had been a poor employee and had defaulted on a loan, and her family said that he had sent her threatening e-mails using several identities. Kanda denied the allegations and stated that he had encouraged Sharma by sponsoring her on an MBA course. He also said \\"She was also made the chairman of the trust which managed an international school at Sirsa.\\"Gopal Kanda threatened us hours before Geetika committed suicide, alleges family Delhi Police took him in custody, with charges including abetting the suicide, criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation, and sending false electronic messages. Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, said that his former minister not helping the police in the suicide probe was \\"unfair\\". On 15 February 2013, Geetika's mother, Anuradha Sharma also committed suicide. She chose the same method as her daughter and left a suicide note at the same place as her. On 4 March 2014, Kanda was granted bail after a charge of sexual exploitation was dropped by the Delhi High Court. Both the police and Geetika Sharma's brother objected to the grant of bail, alleging that medical records had been forged, the freedom would enable witness interference, and that it could prejudice a future trial. Kanda then sought judicial intervention to prevent media from reporting the case. Return to politics As leader of the Haryana Lokhit Party, which he had formed in May 2014, Kanda contested the 2014 elections in Haryana. He lost to Makhan Lal Singla of the INLD, despite his opponents acknowledging beforehand that his local popularity negated any potential ill effects from the Sharma case. In October 2016, with the Sharma case still unresolved, Kanda and his brother, Govind, were charged in relation to an investigation into alleged illegal property development in Sirsa. Police had been looking into the matter since 2009. Kanda has had other brushes with the law, including a case from 2000 involving cheque bouncing that was still unresolved in 2014, and a 2007 incident when he was discovered in the company of members of the criminal underworld.

Shortly thereafter, he joined mega-talent firm Leber-Krebs as a tour accountant. He worked with such acts as Aerosmith and Scorpions. As a tour accountant with Aerosmith, Mensch came upon the Australian rock band AC/DC, and persuaded them to swap their previous manager, Michael Browning, for Leber-Krebs. Mensch was assigned to manage the band as his first client; he was 26 years old. On the advice of his friend Cliff Burnstein, then at Mercury Records, Mensch targeted the British group Def Leppard. He booked the band as support act on an AC/DC tour. A BBC documentary on the band records their unhappiness with their early managers Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, following a fist-fight between singer Joe Elliott and Martin. The film quotes Mensch as saying Burnstein told him \\"I don't care if they have managers...steal them from another set of managers.\\" The band's drummer Rick Allen recollects that he did approach Mensch, and Mensch signed them to Leber-Krebs. After a disagreement with Leber-Krebs over royalties, Mensch was terminated from that firm and started Q Prime with Cliff Burnstein. Def Leppard was the sole client to come with the new firm.

The rate of the pozzolanic reaction is dependent on the intrinsic characteristics of the pozzolan such as the specific surface area, the chemical composition and the active phase content. Physical surface adsorption is not considered as being part of the pozzolanic activity, because no irreversible molecular bonds are formed in the process. Reaction The pozzolanic reaction is the chemical reaction that occurs in portland cement upon the addition of pozzolans. It is the main reaction involved in the Roman concrete invented in Ancient Rome and used to build, for example, the Pantheon. The pozzolanic reaction converts a silica-rich precursor with no cementing properties, to a calcium silicate, with good cementing properties. In chemical terms, the pozzolanic reaction occurs between calcium hydroxide, also known as portlandite (Ca(OH)2), and silicic acid (written as H4SiO4, or Si(OH)4, in the geochemical notation): :Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ H4SiO4 ‚Üí CaH2SiO4¬∑2 H2O or summarized in abbreviated notation of cement chemists: :CH + SH ‚Üí C-S-H The pozzolanic reaction can also be written in an ancient industrial silicate notations as: : + ‚Üí or even directly: : + ‚Üí Both notations still coexist in the literature, depending on the research field considered. However, the more recent geochemical notation in which the Si atom is tetracoordinated by four hydroxyl groups (, also commonly noted ) is more correct than the ancient industrial silicate notation for which silicic acid () was represented in the same way as carbonic acid () whose geometrical configuration is trigonal planar. Anyway, from the only perspective of pure mass balance consideration, they are equivalent and both are used. The product CaH2SiO4¬∑2 H2O is a calcium silicate hydrate, also abbreviated as C-S-H in cement chemist notation, the hyphenation denotes the variable stoichiometry. The atomic (or molar) ratio Ca/Si, CaO/SiO2, or C/S, and the number of water molecules can vary and the above-mentioned stoichiometry may differ. Many pozzolans may also contain aluminate, or Al(OH)4‚àí, that will react with calcium hydroxide and water to form calcium aluminate hydrates such as C4AH13, C3AH6 or hydrogarnet, or in combination with silica C2ASH8 or str√§tlingite (cement chemist notation). In the presence of anionic groups such as sulfate, carbonate or chloride, AFm phases and AFt or ettringite phases can form. Pozzolanic reaction is a long term reaction, which involves dissolved silicic acid, water and CaO or Ca(OH)2 or other pozzolans to form a strong cementation matrix. This process is often irreversible. Sufficient amount of free calcium ion and a high pH of 12 and above is needed to initiate and maintain the pozzolanic reaction. This is because at a pH of around 12, the solubility of silicon and aluminium ions is high enough to support the pozzolanic reaction.  Activity determining parameters  = Particle properties = Prolonged grinding results in an increased pozzolanic activity by creating a larger specific surface area available for reaction. Moreover, grinding also creates crystallographic defects at and below the particle surface. The dissolution rate of the strained or partially disconnected silicate moieties is strongly enhanced. Even materials which are commonly not regarded to behave as a pozzolan, such as quartz, can become reactive once ground below a certain critical particle diameter. = Composition = The overall chemical composition of a pozzolan is considered as one of the parameters governing long-term performance (e.g. compressive strength) of the blended cement binder, ASTM C618 prescribes that a pozzolan should contain SiO2 \\\\+ Al2O3 \\\\+ Fe2O3 ‚â• 70 wt.%. In case of a (quasi) one phase material such as blast-furnace slags the overall chemical composition can be considered as meaningful parameter, for multi-phase materials only a correlation between the pozzolanic activity and the chemistry of the active phases can be sought. Many pozzolans consist of a heterogeneous mixture of phases of different pozzolanic activity. Obviously, the content in reactive phases is an important property determining the overall reactivity. In general, the pozzolanic activity of phases thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions is low when compared to on an equal specific surface basis to less thermodynamically stable phase assemblages. Volcanic ash deposits containing large amounts of volcanic glass or zeolites are more reactive than quartz sands or detrital clay minerals. In this respect, the thermodynamic driving force behind the pozzolanic reaction serves as a rough indicator of the potential reactivity of a (alumino-)silicate material. Similarly, materials showing structural disorder such as glasses show higher pozzolanic activities than crystalline ordered compounds. = Reaction conditions = The rate of the pozzolanic reaction can also be controlled by external factors such as the mix proportions, the amount of water or space available for the formation and growth of hydration products and the temperature of reaction. Therefore, typical blended cement mix design properties such as the replacement ratio of pozzolan for Portland cement, the water to binder ratio and the curing conditions strongly affect the reactivity of the added pozzolan.  Pozzolanic activity tests  = Mechanical tests = Mechanical evaluation of the pozzolanic activity is based upon a comparison of the compressive strength of mortar bars containing pozzolans as a partial replacement for Portland cement to reference mortar bars containing only Portland cement as binder. The mortar bars are prepared, cast, cured and tested following a detailed set of prescriptions. Compressive strength testing is carried out at fixed moments, typically 3, 7, and 28 days after mortar preparation. A material is considered pozzolanically active when it contributes to the compressive strength, taking into account the effect of dilution. Most national and international technical standards or norms include variations of this methodology. = Chemical tests = A pozzolanic material is by definition capable of binding calcium hydroxide in the presence of water. Therefore, the chemical measurement of this pozzolanic activity represents a way of evaluating pozzolanic materials. This can be done by directly measuring the amount of calcium hydroxide a pozzolan consumes over time. At high water to binder ratio (suspended solutions), this can be measured by titrimety or by spectroscopic techniques. At lower water to binder ratios (pastes), thermal analysis or X-ray powder diffraction techniques are commonly used to determine remaining calcium hydroxide contents. Other direct methods have been developed that aim to directly measure the degree of reaction of the pozzolan itself. Here, selective dissolutions, X-ray powder diffraction or scanning electron microscopy image analysis methods have been used. Indirect methods comprise on the one hand methods that investigate which material properties are responsible for the pozzolan's reactivity with portlandite. Material properties of interest are the (re)active silica and alumina content, the specific surface area and/or the reactive mineral and amorphous phases of the pozzolanic material. Other methods indirectly determine the extent of the pozzolanic activity by measuring an indicative physical property of the reacting system. Measurements of the electrical conductivity, chemical shrinkage of the pastes or the heat evolution by heat flow calorimetry reside in the latter category.

ITV gained the rights for Formula One coverage for 1997 in late 1995 from the BBC and focused on more in-depth coverage, conducting more interviews and gaining access to better camera angles. The coverage was initially presented by Jim Rosenthal with veteran commentator Murray Walker and former racing driver Martin Brundle being the initial commentators before Walker's retirement after the 2001 United States Grand Prix and was succeeded by pit-lane reporter James Allen. Rosenthal left in 2005 and was succeeded by Steve Rider who presented the coverage until ITV ceased to broadcast Formula One after 2008. Formula One coverage returned to the BBC in 2009 for ITV to focus on more extensive coverage of UEFA Champions League football matches. The programme was successful in collecting three consecutive BAFTA awards for sporting coverage but also garnered criticism for showing advertisements during their coverage along with their handling of competitions held by the broadcaster. In December 2015, ITV was rumoured to take over the broadcasting rights from BBC from 2016 onwards, after BBC had terminated its broadcasting contract three years early. However, on 21 December 2015 it was announced that Channel 4 would broadcast F1 alongside Sky. History =1997‚Äì2008= When the BBC lost their rights to broadcast Formula One in late 1995, ITV gained the coverage for 1997. The deal worth ¬£60 million was negotiated by FOM president Bernie Ecclestone. ITV chose to bid for the rights due to constantly being beaten at weekends while the Grand Prix coverage was on. ITV's first broadcast was at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix and was hosted by Jim Rosenthal along with Simon Taylor and Tony Jardine as expert analysts and Murray Walker and Martin Brundle as the commentators. The pitlane reporters James Allen and Louise Goodman stayed on for the whole of ITV's coverage over 11 years. ITV had set about focusing their efforts into more in-depth pre- and post-race analysis, better camera angles and conducting more interviews. Rosenthal, Taylor and Jardine all presented from a studio with a view of the paddock and the studio was transported to all the races. One feature for 1997 was known as 'Inside F1' where a driver would demonstrate a certain piece of equipment on a Formula One car and would summarise what operations the equipment performed along with its effects. There was also a track guide using a computer simulation provided by Psygnosis also for 1997. The post-race qualifying and race coverage was mainly a discussion between the presenter and the experts going over the key facts of what occurred. In the same year, Simon Taylor was left unable to broadcast live after feeling seasick during the Monaco Grand Prix when the team were presenting on a yacht that kept moving around. Sometimes the presenters hosted from the ITV studios for the Asian races due to costs of travelling. In the early years, ITV also showed Murray & Martin's F1 Special, which usually aired on Saturday teatimes at each Grand Prix weekend. Introduced by Murray Walker and Martin Brundle, the programmes featured detailed reports on the day's qualifying session, along with interviews and features with the drivers and team personnel. The programme was slowly phased out in 1999, with fewer specials airing, before being dropped altogether at the end of 2000. ITV also introduced Martin Brundle's hugely popular gridwalk at the 1997 British Grand Prix, where roughly 10‚Äì15 minutes before the start of the race Brundle would walk around the grid interviewing drivers, team personnel, celebrities and whoever else he could find. Brundle had elected not to commentate from some races such as the Canadian Grand Prix in 1997 where he raced at Le Mans and missed the race in 1998. He also elected not to attend the Hungarian Grand Prix on several occasions. When Brundle was absent, different people would stand in the commentary booth, including Derek Warwick, Jody Scheckter, Anthony Davidson and 1996 champion Damon Hill. Steve Rider took over presenting duties in 2006 ITV were not able to show the qualifying for the 1999 French Grand Prix due to a dispute with Formula One Management. FOM President Bernie Ecclestone asked ITV if they wanted live coverage with the broadcaster refusing stating they would show coverage at a later time. Ecclestone apologised in the Sunday Express and the race coverage was unaffected. In a one-off move for the return of the United States Grand Prix in 2000, ITV moved the coverage over to ITV2 as the schedule of the main channel could not occupy the coverage of the race. The 2001 United States Grand Prix was Murray Walker's last in the ITV commentary booth, having missed four other races that season. James Allen moved up from his former role as pitlane reporter to replace Walker in the commentary box with Brundle still commentating as usual and Ted Kravitz inheriting Allen's old role. In October 2002, the BBC had prepared pay ¬£175 million to gain the rights off ITV when their contract was to expire at the end of 2004. In April 2004, ITV signed a six-year extension to their contract worth ¬£150 million. In that same year, the coverage dropped its trackside studio and the presenters and analysts provided the coverage directly from within the paddock, allowing them to be at every race location for the first time ‚Äì in previous years, for certain races, particularly for those held in Asia, the trackside studio was based in London, using satellite link-up to broadcast the race. With the advent of new anti-tobacco advertising laws in the United Kingdom that were placed in force on 31 July 2005, it was feared that Formula One coverage would be blacked out because with the showing of tobacco company logos on television, the broadcaster would face extra charges even in a country where tobacco sponsorship was permitted. In September 2005, it was reported that ITV had secured Steve Rider's services and would replace Rosenthal from 2006 onwards to present coverage of Formula One. Rider made his debut broadcast covering ITV F1 coverage at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix.\\"Rider opts for some driver practice\\" The Times, 4 March 2006; Retrieved 2 April 2006 ITV extended their contract with North One Television for a further five years in an agreement that started at the first round of the 2006 season and would produce over 100 hours of content which also included qualifying and the highlight shows. ITV were the host broadcasters for the British Grand Prix. In March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season so that the broadcaster could focus more on coverage on the UEFA Champions League. The contract to show the sport at the time of announcement was worth ¬£25 million. ITV later announced that they had enacted a clause within their contract enabling them to leave F1 coverage after the 2008 season. Ironically, ITV F1's highest ever broadcast rating came in its final race, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, which attracted 8.8 million viewers, peaking at 12.5 million viewers.http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/11/hamilton_drives_125m_to_itv1.html On 17 November 2008, BBC announced that Martin Brundle would continue his commentary role alongside Jonathan Legard during the 2009 season, while Ted Kravitz would continue his pit-lane reporter role alongside Lee McKenzie. Features =Theme music= ITV's F1 coverage used four different themes throughout its lifespan, each lasting three years. The first theme was a special, untitled, track performed by Jamiroquai which lasted from 1997 to 1999. This theme was commissioned in February 1997 and cost ¬£100,000 to compose. Neil Duncanson, who worked for Chrysalis Sport and was ITV-F1's producer, was a friend of frontman Jay Kay, who is a fan of Formula One. In 2000, Jamiroquai's theme was replaced by \\"Blackbeat\\" by Apollo 440 which lasted until 2002, replaced the following year by a remixed version of \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\" by Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive. The final theme was \\"Lift Me Up\\" by Moby which ran from 2006 until 2008. =Website= The ITV-F1 website was launched in March 1998 as a joint venture between ITV, F1 Racing and Business Net at a cost of ¬£700,000 for the year. Initial content was provided by F1 Racing with news updates from Murray Walker and Martin Brundle. The site was revamped in July 1999 with the addition of a superstore selling Formula One merchandise along with a multimedia content area and a loyalty club. The website was closed in January 2012 citing the joint televised deal between the BBC and Sky as the reason. =Sponsorship= Between 1997 and 2001, ITV's coverage was sponsored by Texaco, who outbid RAC in December 1996. For the first year, the sponsorship promotion was created by Steve Pickard and directed by David Harris who were both from IMP. The sponsorship credits were based upon the speed and excitement of a Formula One team refuelling one of their racing cars with a circular theme involving the Texaco logo. Texaco placed ¬£12 million in the first three years of their contract with ITV. The credits were directed by Darryl Goodrich and produced by Nicolas Unsworth. In September 2001, Toyota signed a four-year deal worth ¬£25 million seeing off competition from Fosters, who previously sponsored the ITV-F1 website. The car manufacturer pulled out at the end of 2003 to focus on brand advertising. The Daily Telegraph signed a one-year ¬£4.5 million deal to take over the sponsorship in 2004. In 2005, LG took over the sponsorship with a ¬£3.5 million contract for a year. Their sponsorship included the promotion of the LG Mobile brand among the aim for younger viewers to watch the programming. For a period in 2006, Swiftcover.com sponsored the coverage from that year's San Marino Grand Prix. The screening of their sponsorship included Formula One drivers who were frustrated whilst speaking over the team radio to chickens in the pit lane. For 2007, Honda took over as the main sponsor which also included Honda's logo being placed onto the ITV-F1 website with the aim to attract younger viewers. The idents for Honda's sponsorship were produced by Honda's creative agency Wieden and Kennedy which built upon the car manufacturers indisputable passion for motor racing. For 2008, Sony signed a deal that was negotiated by OMD UK as the final sponsor of the network's coverage. The amount of sponsorship money was unpublished but was thought to be around ¬£5 million. The idents were developed by fallon with digital and mobile assets developed by Dare. Scheduling All races were broadcast live with occasional reruns in races where the start time was considered early for fans who had elected not to watch at an earlier time. Originally, qualifying sessions for races held in North America were not shown live and were instead screened as delayed coverage, usually beginning at 11:00pm. From 2005, these sessions were shown live, but on ITV2 and ITV3 and in 2006 and 2007 the sessions were screened live on ITV3 and ITV4, with it being repeated on ITV1 later that night. In 2008, all qualifying sessions were screened live on ITV1. When qualifying was split into two sessions from 2003, ITV1 broadcast the Friday session as delayed coverage in a late night slot, usually at around midnight, except for the British Grand Prix, in which the Friday session was shown live. The Saturday session was broadcast live as normal. In 2004, when both qualifying sessions were held on Saturday, only the second session was shown live, with only brief highlights from the first session shown in the build-up. When qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix that year was postponed to Sunday owing to a typhoon alert, neither session was shown live. For 2005, when qualifying was split into a Saturday‚ÄìSunday format, only the Saturday session was shown live, with brief highlights of the Sunday session shown in the race build-up. This format proved unpopular with fans and was scrapped following the first six races that year, with qualifying for the rest of that year reverting to just a single one-lap session on Saturday. The highlights programme lasted for one hour and would normally have started at around 11:35pm depending on the schedule. Production ITV's coverage was originally produced by Mach 1 Productions from 1997 to 1999. In 2000, production was taken over by Chrysalis Sport in association with United Productions. Prior to the start of the 2002 season, United Productions was taken over by Granada Media, making the coverage a Chrysalis/Granada co- production. Chrysalis became North One Television in 2004, which continued to co-produce the coverage with Granada until the end of 2005, before becoming the sole production company from 2006. Awards ITV were awarded three consecutive BAFTA awards for the Best Sports Programme for their coverage of the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix, 2007 Canadian Grand Prix and the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix. Criticism =Showing of advertisements= A major criticism of ITV's coverage was they were permitted to show advertisements during the coverage which promoted a number of complaints from viewers. Many key events in races were not shown as live as a result over the years of the coverage, some of these included: Damon Hill overtaking Michael Schumacher for the race lead at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix, Schumacher's retirement at the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix which handed the drivers' championship to Mika Hakkinen, Schumacher's crash at the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix, Schumacher‚Äôs engine failures at the 2000 French Grand Prix and 2006 Japanese Grand Prix, protester Cornelius Horan running onto the Silverstone circuit during the middle of the 2003 British Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso's engine failure at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton's gearbox troubles at the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix which cost him the championship to Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, and R√§ikk√∂nen's engine failure at the 2008 European Grand Prix. The most serious incident however occurred at the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix when the broadcaster cut to a commercial break during the closing moments of the race which garnered 126 complaints from viewers. Ofcom ruled that ITV breached section 6.7 of the Rules on the Amount and Scheduling of Advertising. The broadcasters also had not shown the post-race press conference segment featuring Jenson Button's comments about the race. ITV repeated the last three laps after the race and as a result of these complaints, the server on their website crashed. An on- air apology was made by Jim Rosenthal before the start of the next race in Spain two weeks later. =Coverage= Many fans of the sport criticised the coverage of the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix when the programme had ended just after the race concluded. ITV made arrangements for the next race that if coverage overran, the show would continue to be shown on ITV4. =Competition= In 2009, Ofcom ruled that ITV's handling of the competition for their last race broadcast had broken competition rules when 139,000 viewers rang a premium phone line charging ¬£1 for a chance of winning the prize. The competition organiser Eckoh was not overseen by the broadcaster. In July 2009, ITV awarded the winner of the competition the prize that was not awarded because the winner's name was not published at the required time. Legacy ITV's F1 coverage helped to pave the way on how motor sport would be broadcast in the modern era. Many of the features such as Martin Brundle's gridwalk and the pre- and post-race analysis were all transferred when the coverage returned to the BBC.

She was born May 20, 1858, in St. Petersburg. Maria Tenisheva is famous as the founder of the Art studio in St. Petersburg, and the Drawing School at the Museum of Russian antiquity in Smolensk, handicraft college in Bezhitsa town, as well as by artistic and industrial workshops held in her own estate of Talashkino.  Biography  Maria Pyatkovskaya was born on May 20, (June 1) 1858 in St. Petersburg. The girl was illegitimate,Dream of Princess Tenisheva and grew up in her stepfather's wealthy house; she was quite a shy girl, despite many governesses, nurses and teachers present in the house. Little Maria was expected to be obedient and restraint. His mother was cold to her, apparently binding to this child the moments of her life which she was trying to forget. When 16-year-old Maria graduated from private school, Rafail Nikolaev, a young lawyer, proposed to her. The idea that the marriage would give her freedom pushed her to give her consent. The couple had a daughter, also named Maria, but the marriage did not work out, as the husband was a gambler. \\"Everything was so gray and ordinary, meaningless,\\" she wrote later. Soon Maria Tenisheva went to Paris to study singing with the famous Marchesi. She had a beautiful soprano. Maria also took her little daughter to France. That was a really tough time for Maria, as her husband refused to grant her permit to leave and her mother also stopped her allowance. Maria took singing lessons with Mathilde Marchesi, and also graphics lessons. Marchesi was sure that her student was born to have the glory of Russian opera singer. Maria was offered to take a tour of France and Spain. But due to a conflict with the entrepreneur, Maria refused to go, moreover, she decided that singing and stage performance were not for her. Upon returning to St. Petersburg, she attended Baron von Stieglitz classes. At the time, Maria studied the history of art and spent time reading books and visiting museums. In 1892, Maria married Prince Vyacheslav Nikolayevich Tenishev, an outstanding Russian manufacturer. However, his relatives did not recognize Maria, and she was not inscribed into the Tenishev genealogy. The couple settled in the Khotylevo estate acquired by Prince Tenishev in Bryansky district, Orel province. The estate was situated on the banks of the Desna river, where the princess founded a one-class school. Princess Tenisheva had great artistic taste. She collected watercolors and befriended famous artists, including Vasnetsov, Vrubel, Roerich, Malyutin, Benois, the sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy, and many others. She set up an art studio to prepare young people for higher arts education in St. Petersburg (1894‚Äì1904), where Ilya Repin taught. Maria Tenisheva was also one of the founders of the Mir Iskusstva (World of Arts) magazine.Word on the patron of the arts: an exhibition devoted to Princess Tenisheva, the Museum of History When traveling with her husband to Europe, the princess had no financial restraints and bought Western European paintings, porcelain, marble sculptures, jewelry, and historic valuables of China, Japan and Iran. When she and her husband went traveling through the old Russian towns of Rostov, Rybinsk, Kostroma, and the Volga region villages and monasteries, the handmade beauty crafted by unknown masters made her start a collection of utensils, clothing, furniture, jewelry, and glassware. In 1893, Maria Tenisheva persuaded her friend, Princess Catherine Svyatopolk- Chetverinskaya, to sell her ancestral estate Talashkino,, and there she quickly created a welcoming, creative atmosphere that attracted many famous artists, musicians, and scientists: Ilya Repin, Nicholas Roerich, Mikhail Vrubel, and many others. Talashkino became the princess' lifework.Tenishev family In September 1895, thanks to the princess' efforts to erect a new building with dormitories, a dining room and a kitchen, a school opened for village children near Talashkino. Orphans had privileged entry, and Princess Tenisheva gave them full pension. In 1919, after the Revolution, Princess Maria Tenisheva, together with her friend, Princess Catherine Svyatopolk- Chetverinskaya, and her assistants, left Russia for France. During her exile in Paris, she wrote her memoir, called \\"Impressions of my life. Memories\\", that covered the period from the late 1860s to New Year's Eve 1917. The book was published only after her death. Princess Maria Tenisheva died on April 14, 1928 in her house \\"Iris Cottage\\", located in the Parisian suburb of La Celle Saint-Cloud. In the obituary, Ivan Bilibin wrote: \\"Her whole life was dedicated to native Russian art, and she has done infinitely much for it.\\"  References  Category:1858 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Russian women painters Category:Russian women artists Category:Russian princesses ","title":"Princess Maria Tenisheva"},{"id":"36654058","text":"Curiosity's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on Mars - Mount Sharp is in the background (September 8, 2012). Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) is one of seventeen cameras on the Curiosity rover on the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Calibration Target of the Mars Hand Lens Imager (September 9, 2012) (3-D image) Overview The instrument is mounted on the rover's robotic arm. It is primarily used to acquire microscopic images of rock and soil, but it can also be used for other images. MAHLI can take true-color images at 1600√ó1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 14.5 micrometers per pixel. MAHLI has an 18.3 mm to 21.3 mm focal length and a 33.8- to 38.5-degree field of view. MAHLI has both white and ultraviolet LED illumination for imaging in darkness or fluorescence imaging. MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimetre distances. This system can make some images with focus stacking processing. MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real-time lossless predictive or JPEG compression. The calibration target (3-D image) for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stairstep pattern for depth calibration. NASA says, \\"The main purpose of Curiosity's MAHLI camera is to acquire close-up, high- resolution views of rocks and soil at the rover's Gale Crater field site. The camera is capable of focusing on any target at distances of about 0.8 inch (2.1 centimeters) to infinity. This means it can, as shown here, also obtain pictures of the Martian landscape.\\" The device is also used to take photos of the rover. One of those photos was considered in 2013 by Discovery News as one of the best space robot selfies.

The club, trading as The Rangers Football Club plc, entered administration in February 2012. It owed substantial amounts to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), who subsequently refused to allow Rangers to exit administration via a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). The Rangers Football Club plc entered liquidation on 31 October 2012. The refusal of the CVA forced the administrators to sell the business and assets of Rangers to a new company, operated by Charles Green. The other member clubs of the Scottish Premier League refused to allow the new company to adopt the league membership of the old company. Green then successfully applied for membership of the Scottish Football League. After obtaining the old company's Scottish Football Association (SFA) membership, Rangers (now trading as The Rangers Football Club Ltd) entered the Third Division (the fourth tier of the Scottish football league system) in time for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Background During the 1990s and 2000s, Rangers regularly posted financial losses. By 2009, Rangers owed between ¬£25 million and ¬£30 million to the Lloyds Banking Group, who had taken over the club's account from Bank of Scotland following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. In October 2009, first-team manager Walter Smith claimed that Lloyds was effectively running the club. Rangers then entered a dispute, known informally as the 'big tax case', with HMRC, regarding their use of employee benefit trusts (EBT) between 2001 and 2010. A tax bill potentially running to ¬£49 million, including interest and penalties, was assessed by HMRC in 2010. Rangers argued that their EBT scheme was a legal method of tax avoidance. The scale of the potential liability led then-chairman Alistair Johnston to admit in 2011 that the club could go out of business and it was a major reason for the club struggling to find a suitable buyer when it was put up for sale in 2009. There was also another ¬£2.8 million tax liability hanging over the club (known as the 'wee tax case') which threatened to prevent any involvement in European football for the following season, although ultimately a UEFA licence was granted as the case was still in dispute at the time. On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3 percent) to Wavetower Limited, a company solely owned by Craig Whyte, for ¬£1. Murray later said that he had sold to Whyte because he had pledged to pay off the bank debt, settle the 'wee tax case' and invest money in the playing squad and stadium. To enable the purchase and to pay off the debt to Lloyds, Whyte borrowed ¬£26.7 million against future season ticket sales from the Ticketus firm. This agreement with Ticketus was reached before the sale of the club had been completed. Whyte failed to disclose that he had been previously banned as a company director for seven years. He began defamation proceedings against BBC Scotland in February 2012 regarding two documentaries about him and his purchase of Rangers, one of which later won a BAFTA Scotland award. A subsequent investigation by the Scottish Football Association found that Whyte was not a fit and proper person to run a football club. After the club entered administration, the administrators stated that there was no evidence of investment from Whyte into the club. Murray later said that he deeply regretted selling the club to Whyte, claiming that he had been \\"duped\\" and if the information had been available to him at the time he would not have done the deal. Administration and liquidation Soon after taking control of Rangers, Whyte failed to remit the pay-as-you-earn tax deducted from his employees to HMRC. On 13 February 2012 Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of Session giving notice of their intention to enter administration. The following day HMRC petitioned the court for authority to appoint their choice of administrator, but this was unsuccessful. Rangers officially entered administration on 14 February 2012, after appointing London-based financial advisers Duff & Phelps as administrators. On entering administration Rangers were deducted 10 points in the 2011‚Äì12 Scottish Premier League, effectively ending their championship challenge. Rangers then failed to submit accounts for 2011 and were therefore not granted a UEFA licence to play in European football in season 2012‚Äì13. In April it was revealed that the club's total debts could exceed ¬£134m. HMRC made clear on 12 June that it would vote against a proposed Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Their formal rejection of the proposed CVA on 14 June meant that Rangers would be liquidated, while the club would have to be reformed within a new company structure. The business and assets of Rangers were sold to Sevco Scotland Ltd, with the accountancy firm BDO due to be appointed as liquidator. Duff & Phelps announced in October 2012 that creditors had approved an end to their administration and that they had applied to the Court of Session for BDO to be appointed as liquidator. This appointment was legally approved on 31 October. In June 2015, BDO proposed an interim payment of ¬£10 million to creditors, between 6p and 7p in every ¬£1 owed. Most of the funds were obtained from a successful legal action against Collyer Bristow, the firm of solicitors that acted for Craig Whyte during his takeover of Rangers. This interim payment was due to be made by the end of July 2015, but was delayed by a claim made by Law Financial Ltd. A further payout to creditors depended on the final result of the dispute with HMRC. A report by BDO published in June 2019, and more widely publicised by The Times newspaper five months later, stated that the amount claimed by HMRC would be significantly reduced from a maximum of ¬£94 million. HMRC dropped a claim for ¬£24 million in penalties, and The Times suggested that the tax component of the debt could also be reduced by up to ¬£30 million. BDO said that discussions with HMRC were ongoing, and that they hoped for a final resolution during 2020. BBC News suggested that creditors, who had received a payment worth 3.9p for every ¬£1 owed, may receive a further 3p. The reduction in the HMRC debt led to some speculation that Rangers could have survived the tax case without entering insolvency, if their board had known the actual extent of the debt before selling the business to Craig Whyte. This speculation was disputed, as the debt due to HMRC was contested, Rangers had other substantial debts (including ¬£18 million to Lloyds Banking Group), and the finance needed to rescue football clubs was not easily available at the time. On 25 June 2012, the Crown Office asked Strathclyde Police to investigate the purchase of Rangers and the club's subsequent financial management. New company Following the rejection of the CVA, the business and assets of Rangers were sold to Sevco Scotland Ltd, a company owned by a consortium led by Charles Green. While the manager, Ally McCoist and a number of players were willing to transfer, other first team players such as team captain Steven Davis, Steven Naismith and Steven Whittaker refused to have their contracts transferred under TUPE regulations and became free agents. This was disputed by Duff & Phelps, who stated that Green purchased the players contracts and registrations. Rangers subsequently agreed a fee for Davis with Southampton, while Charles Green pursued claims in relation to Naismith and Whittaker. Another consortium, led by former Rangers manager Walter Smith, made a last minute bid for the assets. This was rejected by Duff & Phelps, who already had a binding agreement to sell them to Charles Green. Walter Smith's consortium, including Scottish businessmen Douglas Park and Jim McColl, made a ¬£6million offer that was also turned down. Charles Green then offered Walter Smith a role and the opportunity for his consortium to invest in the club. On 19 June 2012, Walter Smith and his consortium pulled out from trying to acquire the relaunched club. Smith's consortium was originally hostile to Charles Green's consortium but stated that \\"We wish the new Rangers Football Club every good fortune.\\" On 20 June 2012, it was reported that two Glasgow businessmen, housebuilders and property developers Allan Stewart and Stephen McKenna were preparing a bid for the club worth about ¬£11m. On 25 June McKenna had a bid of ¬£8.7m rejected. Prominent former Rangers player John Brown had been involved in the bids and made a further attempt to take control by leading a supporter buyout of Green's consortium. Brown left his position as transfer scout after a meeting with Green and told 5,000 demonstrating supporters at Ibrox Stadium not to renew their season tickets, in order to \\"starve\\" them of funds and force them out.Ibrox legend blasts Green regime at Rangers Evening Times, 28 June 2012 Brown challenged Green to show the title deeds to Ibrox and Murray Park, because he suspected that Craig Whyte or Ticketus retained an interest in the assets. Brown also accused Green of \\"surrendering\\" to a plot by Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell, alleging that Lawwell wanted a weak Rangers in the SPL to boost Celtic's own revenues.Green has raised white flag ‚Äì Brown Press Association Sport, 4 July 2012 Charles Green responded by ridiculing what he saw as the posturing of Walter Smith and John Brown: \\"It's not right that every two weeks a Mel Gibson appears, delivers a Braveheart statement, then doesn't deliver anything.\\" Malcolm Murray, installed as Chairman of Rangers, appealed for an end to \\"factionalism\\" and said: \\"The vicious bloodlust must end, not only for Rangers‚Äô sake but for Scottish football.\\" By 6 July 2012, Rangers were reportedly facing serious financial difficulties of its own, because only 250 season tickets had been sold. Major Scottish banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, reportedly \\"concerned at the current uncertainty about the club's future and its backers\\" declined to provide Rangers with the corporate banking facilities it needed. Metro Bank was hired instead. It was reported that primary sponsor Tennent's would remain with Rangers but would renegotiate a substantially smaller deal.Tennent‚Äôs to stick by Rangers newco for now Marketing Week, 6 July 2012 In September 2015 Dave King, the chairman of the new Rangers company, suggested that the old company could be taken out of liquidation and re-used as the Rangers trading company. In February 2017, BDO launched a legal action against Duff & Phelps, claiming damages of up to ¬£28.9 million. Response of Scottish football authorities =Proposed SPL entry= The financial collapse of Rangers resulted in a great deal of discussion within Scottish football. Initially it was proposed by the Scottish Premier League (SPL) that Rangers should be allowed to play in the SPL, despite the failure of the CVA. This failure meant that Rangers' membership share in the SPL had to be transferred to the new company, along with its other assets, and that transaction required the approval of a two-thirds majority of the 12 SPL clubs. Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnson had stated that it was likely that he would vote in favour of re-entry, but after consultation with their fans he decided to abstain. The chairmen of Aberdeen, Hearts, Dundee United, Hibernian, Inverness CT and St Mirren all publicly stated that they were likely to vote against. St Johnstone chairman Steve Brown declared that he would in principle oppose an automatic re-entry depending on the extent of the sanctions and conditions, while Motherwell chose to vote on the basis of fan and shareholder opinion. Newly promoted Ross County were relatively quiet on the issue, claiming that they would take into consideration the views of other clubs before making their decision. When the vote on the share transfer was held on 4 July, it was rejected by a 10-1 majority. Only the old Rangers company voted in favour, and Kilmarnock abstained. Celtic were the only SPL club not to announce their voting intentions prior to the ballot taking place, but later released a statement confirming their \\"no\\" vote and stating that \\"the integrity of the game was of paramount importance\\" and that the \\"decision to refuse access into the SPL was an overwhelming one and demonstrates the depth of feeling amongst everyone involved in Scottish football\\". =SFL entry= Following the vote by rival clubs to reject the application for direct entry of Rangers to the SPL, SFL and SFA executives proposed a direct entry to the Scottish Football League First Division. Scottish Football League clubs felt that they were being forced to deal with a situation which was not of their making. Notable opponents to direct entry included Raith Rovers chairman Turnbull Hutton, who said that lower league clubs were being \\"bullied, rail-roaded and lied to\\" and described the conduct of the governing bodies as being \\"corrupt\\". Clyde and Falkirk also voiced strong disapproval of Rangers entering the First Division, with the Falkirk chairman Martin Ritchie claiming that parachute entry would be \\"totally unacceptable\\". The SFL voted to let the club join as an associate member and placed Rangers in the Third Division. Agreement was subsequently reached on the transfer of SFA membership. Sevco Scotland Ltd agreed to accept all conditions relating to charges against Rangers FC of bringing the game into disrepute, including a 12-month transfer embargo, the payment of all outstanding fines and football debts, and agreement on broadcasting rights. The Scottish Premier League retained its right to the potential application of sanctions, including an investigation into the clubs use of EBTs and any penalties that may be applied as a result of it. The decision allowed the relaunched Rangers to complete their first fixture just two days later, a Ramsdens Cup tie against Brechin City at Glebe Park. Aftermath =\\"New club\\" claims and rulings= As a result of the Rangers business and assets being sold to a new company when The Rangers Football Club plc entered liquidation, the extent to which the sporting identity of the relaunched Rangers can be regarded as a continuation of the club founded in 1872 has been interpreted differently.Rangers sail into uncharted waters amid myriad fears and flaws www.guardian.co.uk, 28 July 2012 Rangers Football Club post-2012 was described by some in the mainstream media as a \\"new club\\", whilst Charles Green maintained \\"this is still Rangers\\", and the SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster stated \\"it is an existing club, even though it's a new company\\". Former Celtic captain Tom Boyd and Donald Findlay, Rangers' former vice- chairman, said they thought the post-liquidation Rangers was a new club. Steven Naismith, one of the players who chose not transfer his contract to the new company under TUPE regulations, justified his position by stating that he had no loyalty to the new regime. Five years later, Naismith retracted his comments and said he had been poorly advised over the situation at Rangers. On 20 August 2012, Falkirk suspended one of their announcers after he referred to the club as \\"the Sevco Franchise\\" (Sevco was the new company's name prior to it being changed to The Rangers Football Club Ltd). Some Celtic supporters were particularly vociferous in their 'new club' assertions, having displayed banners at their stadium on numerous occasions mockingly referencing 'zombies'. In January 2015 a Celtic group paid for a full-page newspaper advertisement announcing that their club would soon play its first fixture against the new club and that the 120-year Old Firm rivalry had ended. In 2013 numerous complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), after Rangers produced marketing materials which stated they were ‚ÄúScotland‚Äôs most successful club‚Äù. Having considered the evidence, the ASA did not uphold the complaints. UEFA had advised the ASA that their statutes allowed for a team to have \\"sporting continuity\\" under different corporate ownership. On entering liquidation, Rangers lost their membership of the European Club Association, and as a new entity they had to reapply for membership. The ECA granted them associate membership (rather than ordinary membership) on the basis that Rangers were a founding member of the Association, and acknowledged that the new entity had acquired the goodwill, which included the history, of the old company. In May 2015, Scottish newspapers published articles which purported that the governing body FIFA had 'stepped in' on the debate, or had even 'insisted' that Rangers were the same club, but the organisation had not made any official comment on the matter. The claims related to an article published in the weekly FIFA magazine, which carried the disclaimer that \\"any views expressed in The FIFA Weekly do not necessarily reflect those of FIFA\\". =Nimmo Smith enquiry and EBT verdicts= In late 2012, the SPL set up an investigation, chaired by Lord Nimmo Smith, into alleged use of dual contracts by Rangers through the EBT scheme. David Murray denied any cheating took place during his ownership of Rangers, while Alistair Johnston and Charles Green questioned the independence of the investigation. The enquiry found that Rangers had deliberately failed to disclose the trust payments in order to withhold information from HMRC and fined the old company ¬£250,000. It had been anticipated that the investigation would revoke honours won by Rangers during the period between 2001 and 2009 when the trust payments were made (three League titles, four Scottish Cups and four League Cups), but this was not done because it was considered that Rangers had not obtained any sporting advantage by withholding information. The First-tier Tribunal verdict in relation to Rangers' use of EBTs was announced on 20 November 2012, with Rangers winning the appeal on a majority verdict. After the verdict David Murray confirmed that Rangers had offered HMRC a settlement of more than ¬£10 million two years previously. Murray also stated that, \\"The biggest question is why the Revenue knew in August 2011 that Craig Whyte wasn't paying national insurance and tax but didn't put him down - this has so many ramifications for business.\\" An Upper Tribunal upheld the decision in 2014, but HMRC appealed to the Court of Session. In November 2015, their appeal that the ¬£47 million-worth of EBT payments made to Rangers employees over nine years were undeclared taxable earnings was upheld by all three judges, which led to further questions as to whether Rangers had gained an unfair sporting advantage by using the scheme. In July 2017, the Court of Session's ruling was upheld by the UK Supreme Court in a final decision. Despite the Supreme Court ruling on the EBTs differing to the verdict in place at the time of the Nimmo Smith enquiry, the SPFL stated there would be no fresh investigation into the matter after receiving no support from the SFA. Celtic were the only club to make a formal request for the matter to be reviewed again, with the chairmen of other clubs expressing their desire for the matter to be put to rest ‚Äì although the fans did not necessarily share this view. In August 2018, players and staff who had received EBT payments from Rangers were advised that they should seek professional advice as HMRC may seek to collect income tax from them if they are unable to collect the relevant liabilities from the liquidated company. =Craig Whyte= In 2013, Ticketus successfully sued Craig Whyte for damages. In September 2014, he was banned from being a company director for 15 years. Whyte was declared bankrupt at the High Court in London in October 2015, following his non-payment of damages awarded to Ticketus. A warrant was issued on 14 November 2014 by the Crown Office for Whyte's arrest in connection with alleged fraud carried out during the purchase of Rangers. Four arrests were also made in England as part of the investigation. On 27 November, Whyte was detained by police in Mexico and was held due to the warrant. On 28 November he appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court; no plea or declaration was made and he was released on bail. On 2 September 2015 Whyte appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court along with Charles Green; Whyte was charged with conspiracy as well as a charge under Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 Section 28(1). On 6 June 2017, after a lengthy trial at Glasgow High Court (with Donald Findlay acting as his defence attorney), Whyte was acquitted of all charges. =\\"Resolution 12\\"= In 2016 a group of Celtic ordinary shareholders canvassed both their club and UEFA to investigate the 2011 decision to award Rangers a licence to play in the Champions League (the place would otherwise have passed to Celtic) despite the presence of the 'wee tax case'. The dispute was referred to as 'Resolution 12', which was the relevant UEFA statute. UEFA confirmed they would take no action as the status of the tax case was not confirmed at the time of the licence being awarded, and by the start of the following season Rangers were already withdrawn from European competitions due to their insolvency. In September 2017, the SFA stated they may be obliged to look into the matter again after the trial of Craig Whyte, during which it was alleged that the Rangers directors knew they would be held liable for the tax amount when the UEFA licence was granted. The SFA issued Notices of Complaint regarding this in May 2018 to Rangers, who issued a blunt statement vowing to contest the matter vigorously, and stating that it was only being pursued due to being \\"directed by individuals intent on harming the Scottish game, Rangers Football Club and its supporters\\". In May 2020, the SFA decided to close the case, as it determined that it did not have jurisdiction in the case (that lay with the Court of Arbitration for Sport) and the financial penalty that could have been levied on Rangers would have been significantly less than the legal costs of taking the action further. =TUPE process= The handling of the TUPE process led to sixty-seven players launching legal action against Rangers via PFA Scotland, while three players claimed constructive dismissal, although it was subsequently found that the PFA had not spoken to the players to see if they wish this raised on their behalf. Rangers made a counter-claim for loss of transfer fee revenue from players who refused to join the new company. The panel set up to consider the cases ruled in April 2013 that Rangers should pay its costs. =Bookmakers= In January 2017, the Court of Session heard an action from Albert Kinloch against bookmakers Coral. The bookmaker had refused to pay out on a bet made by Kinloch that Rangers would be \\"relegated\\" after the 2011-12 Scottish Premier League season. Kinloch said in court that he had placed the bet after learning that Rangers were in financial difficulties. The court found in the bookmakers' favour, ruling that Rangers had not been relegated. =Historic child sexual abuse= BBC Scotland reported in May 2018 that a former youth footballer had contacted Rangers to claim compensation for alleged sexual abuse by Gordon Neely, who was their head of youth development during the 1980s. Writing in response to the claim, Rangers said that their present company had no \\"duty of care\\" for the claimant and advised him that he would need to contact the liquidator of the old Rangers company. The claimant, a Rangers season ticket holder, said he believed that Rangers were morally still the same club despite the change of legal personality. =On-field events= It took the relaunched Rangers four years to climb through the divisions and take their place in the Scottish Premiership for the 2016‚Äì17 season. As well as winning each of the lower division titles and the 2015‚Äì16 Scottish Challenge Cup, they reached the 2016 Scottish Cup Final, losing to Hibernian. In their first season back in the top tier, Rangers finished in third position behind Celtic and Aberdeen and qualified for the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Europa League; the return to European football after a five-year absence ended abruptly with a shock defeat to part-time club Progr√®s Niederkorn from Luxembourg in the opening round.

It was the first of ten instruments to be turned on during the mission. Purpose The first role of RAD was to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase. These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space. Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human travelers on a human mission to Mars, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012. Turned on after launch, the RAD recorded several radiation spikes caused by the Sun. RAD is funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and Germany's Space Agency (DLR), and developed by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t zu Kiel, Germany.NASA ‚Äì RAD Results On 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported the results obtained during cruise, and stated that the equivalent dose radiation for even the shortest round-trip with current propulsion systems and comparable shielding is found to be . This implies a great health risk caused by energetic particle radiation for any human mission to Mars. In addition to assessing the radiation environment at Mars, data from RAD can also be used for the study of space weather. The arrival of coronal mass ejections at Mars can be detected in RAD data through the Forbush decreases that their passage causes in the Galactic cosmic radiation. These measurements have led to the finding that fast CMEs can continue to decelerate even beyond Earth orbit when dragged by slower surrounding solar wind. In September 2017, NASA reported radiation levels on the surface of Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25-times brighter than any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, Solar particle event and associated solar storm in the middle of the month. Astrobiology The radiation sources that are of concern for human health also affect microbial survival as well as the preservation of organic chemicals and biomolecules.First radiation measurements from the surface of Mars. (9 December 2013). Southwest Research Institute. Science Daily. The RAD is currently quantifying the flux of biologically hazardous radiation at the surface of Mars today, and will help determine how these fluxes vary on diurnal, seasonal, solar cycle and episodic (flare, storm) timescales. These measurements will allow calculations of the depth in rock or soil to which this flux, when integrated over long timescales, provides a lethal dose for known terrestrial microorganisms. Through such measurements, scientists can learn how deep below the surface life would have to be, or have been in the past, to be protected. Research published in January 2014 of data from RAD, state that \\"ionizing radiation strongly influences chemical compositions and structures, especially for water, salts, and redox-sensitive components such as organic matter.\\" The report concludes that the in situ \\"surface measurements ‚Äîand subsurface estimates‚Äî constrain the preservation window for Martian organic matter following exhumation and exposure to ionizing radiation in the top few meters of the Martian surface.

The majority of the Turkish occupation troops were killed and the city was plundered. Only a few Turks managed to withdraw to the castle on the rock above the city. After a siege of 1-1/2 days, the remaining Turkish garrison capitulated on 18 June. On 27 June the imperial army met a strong Turkish force of 17,000 men at V√°c under the command of Grand Vizier Kara ƒ∞brahim Pasha, who would eventually drive out the Habsburgs. Although the Turks had entrenched themselves in a favorable position, Karl V opened the fight with cannon fire. The center of the imperial troops was led by Maximilian Lorenz von Starhemberg, and after a rather short fight he knew that the Turkish troops were defeated. V√°c fell to the imperial army the same day. On 30 June the imperial main army entered the city of Pest, to which the Turks had set fire shortly before. After the army crossed the Danube at V√°c, it began the siege of Buda, which was defended by approximately 7,000 Turks. The imperial army, consisting of 43,000 men, began the bombardment of Buda's fortress with 200 cannons on 14 July 1684, the anniversary of the beginning of the siege of Vienna. Field Marshal Graf Ernst R√ºdiger von Starhemberg was assigned to conduct the siege. On 19 July imperial forces took control of the lower part of the town of Buda. However, since too few troops were available to occupy it, Ernst R√ºdiger ordered the houses in that part of the town burned down. Throughout July and August the imperial army made several attempts to attack the fortress, but all were repelled by the Turkish defenders. At the beginning of September, an imperial general reported that the number of soldiers fit for service had shrunk, and morale was low. On 11 September an imperial auxiliary corps reached Buda, providing new momentum to the campaign. On 22 September a Turkish relief army arrived and immediately attacked the besieging forces. The imperial army managed to repel them but was unable to defeat them. The Turkish relief army then engaged imperial troops in repeated nuisance attacks which, coupled with losses caused by the Turkish city garrison, caused a plunge in morale. Ernst R√ºdiger, who was severely wounded and facing sustained criticism from his army, had to be replaced. The final blow was a spell of poor weather conditions throughout October, and the decision was made to withdraw. On 30 October the imperial army withdrew after a siege that had lasted 109 days. Several factors had caused the size of the allied force to shrink to about half its original size: battle losses, dysentery and a fever epidemic, poorly dug trenches and tactical errors in the siege. Capt. Paul Joseph Jakob von Starhemberg and the Christian allies after this failed enterprise had sustained losses of between 24,000‚Äî30,000 men. Ironically, the blame for the failure was laid on the man who had only led the army at the beginning of the siege: Ernst Ruediger von Starhemberg.

Great Bulgaria was originally centered between the Dniester and lower Volga. The original capital was PhanagoriaTheophanes,Op. cit., p. 356-357 on the Taman Peninsula between the Black and Azov seas. In the mid-7th century, Great Bulgaria expanded west to include Avar territory and was centered in Poltava. During the late 7th century, however, an Avar-Slavic alliance in the west, and Khazars in the east, defeated the Bulgars, and Great Bulgaria disintegrated. Successor states included Volga Bulgaria and the First Bulgarian Empire. Origins The etymology of the ethnonym Bulgar is not completely understood; it is difficult to trace the name back earlier than the 4th century AD. It is generally believed to derive from the Turkic verb bulƒüha (to \\"stir\\", \\"mix\\", \\"disturb\\", \\"confuse\\"), possibly suggesting that other Turkic peoples regarded the Bulgars as a \\"mixed\\" people or as \\"rebellious\\". Later Byzantine scholars implied that the Bulgars had previously been known as the Onogurs (Onoƒüur). Agathon wrote about the \\"nation of Onogur Bulƒüars\\", Nikephoros I stated that Kubrat was lord of the Onogundurs, Theophanes referred to them as Onogundur Bulgars and Constantine VII remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves Onogundurs. Variations of the name include Onoguri, Onoghuri, Onghur, Ongur, Onghuri, Onguri, Onogundur, Unogundur, and Unokundur. There are several theories about the origin of the name Onogur. In some Turkic languages on means \\"10\\" and ƒüur \\"arrow\\"; and \\"ten arrows\\" might imply a federation of ten tribes, i.e. the Western Turkic Khaganate. Within the Turkic languages, \\"z\\" sounds in the easternmost languages tend to have become \\"r\\" in the westernmost Turkic languages; therefore, the ethnonym Oghuz may be the source of Oghur; that is, on Oƒüur would mean \\"ten clans of Oghuz\\". Establishment Between 630 and 635, Khan Kubrat managed to unite the Onogur Bulgars with the tribes of the Kutrigurs and Utigurs under a single rule, creating a powerful confederation which was referred to by the medieval authors in Western Europe as Old Great Bulgaria,Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, Historia syntomos, breviarium or Patria Onoguria. According to some scholars, it is more correctly called the Onogundur-Bulgar Empire.Zimonyi Istvan: \\"History of the Turkic speaking peoples in Europe before the Ottomans\\". (Uppsala University: Institute of Linguistics and Philology) (archived from the original on 2013-10-21) Some scholars assume that it stretched as far west as the Pannonian Plain and included among its subjects some of the Pannonian Avars. It is presumed that Kubrat's capital was the ancient city of Phanagoria on the Taman Peninsula. Kubrat's grave was discovered in 1912 at Pereshchepina, Ukraine.Rasho Rashev, Die Protobulgaren im 5.-7. Jahrhundert, Orbel, Sofia, 2005 (in Bulgarian, German summary) =Khan Kubrat= According to the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans, Kubrat was from the royal clan Dulo and a rightful heir to the Bulgar throne.Mingazov S. Kubrat - the Ruler of Great Bulgaria and Ketrades - character of John of Nikiu work - Kazan: Institute of History of Academy of Science of Republic of Tatarstan, 2012 Hermann Zotenberg (1883), while translating John of Nikiu's Chronicles from Old Ethiopian, intentionally replaced the name Qetrades to Kubrat. Since then, the historiography holds a misconception that Kubrat was raised and baptized by the Byzantine court, while John's character Qetrades has no real-life connection to the ruler of the Great Bulgaria Kubrat. Kubrat quickly managed to overthrow Avar domination, extending Onogur influence among the Bulgars in Pannonia in what became known as Hungary. Ultimately, although there is no evidence that the Utigurs were independent of the Onogurs until after Kubrat's empire disintegrated, it is believed he seceded from the Onogurs when they became entangled in dynastic wars. After Kubrat's burial in Mala Pereshchepina, the Khazars, who had triumphed in the collapse of Onoguria, subjugated Kubrat's eldest son and heir Batbayan, forcing his other sons to flee north up the Volga (2nd son Kotrag) and west into the Balkans (4th son Kuber and 3rd son Asparukh) and Italy (5th son Alcek, Alzek)Mingazov S. The Heirs of Great Bulgaria in Western Europe// Philology and Culture. - 2012. - No. 1 (27).- S. 201-207. . Disintegration The events following Kubrat's death are described by the Byzantine Patriarch Nikephoros I. In the times of Emperor Constantine IV, he narrates, Kubrat died and Batbayan, the eldest of his five sons, was left in charge of the state. Under strong Khazar pressure, Kubrat's other sons disregarded their father's advice to stay together in order to resist the enemies and soon departed, taking their own tribes. Old Great Bulgaria disintegrated under Khazar pressure in 668.The Other Europe in the Middle Ages: Avars, Bulgars, Khazars, and Cumans, Florin Curta, BRILL, 2008, , p. 351.  Aftermath  Bulgar settlements in the 6th and 7th centuries Some Bulgars remained in the former Onoguria, under the domination of the Khazars. =Balkars= Some also believe that the present- day Balkars of the Caucasus are the descendants of the Batbayan horde even though they speak a Turkic language of the Kipchak type. =Volga Bulgars= After Kotrag, the leader of the Kutrigurs, took control on the western steppe, Batbayan led them into the upper Volga-Ural region. There they established Volga Bulgaria, at the confluence of the Volga and Kama. As the Volga or Silver Bulgars (Bessermens), they converted voluntarily to Islam in the 9th century. They managed to preserve their national identity well into the 13th century, by repelling the first Mongol attacks in 1223. However, they were eventually subdued, their capital Bolghar city became one of major cities of the Golden Horde of the Mongols and the Bulgars mixed with the Tatars. The citizens of the modern Russian republics of Tatarstan and Chuvashia are considered to be descendants of those Bulgars. =Bulgars in Vojvodina and Macedonia= Kuber ruled in Sirmium over a mixed group of peoples ‚Äì Bulgars, Byzantine subjects, Slavs, and Germanic tribes ‚Äì as a vassal of the Avar Khagan. After a revolt he led his people to Macedonia. There he settled in the region of Keremisia and made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city of Thessaloniki. After this, he disappears from history and his people were later consolidated into the First Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum. =Bulgars in Italy= Other Bulgars, circa 662, led by their \\"Duke Alzeco\\" (Alcek) sought refuge from the Avars with the Lombards and requested land from the Lombard King Grimoald I in exchange for military service \\"for an uncertain reason\\", initially staying near Ravenna and later moving further south. Grimoald sent Alcek and his followers to his son Romuald in Benevento and they were then granted by Romuald land northeast of Naples in the \\"spacious but up till that time deserted\\" towns of Sepino, Bovianum (Boiano), and Isernia, in the present-day region of Molise in the Apennines. Instead of the title \\"Duke\\", Altzek was granted the Lombard title of \\"Gastald\\". Paul the Deacon in his Historia Langobardorum writing after the year 787 says that in his time Bulgars still inhabited the area, and that even though they speak \\"Latin\\", \\"they have not forsaken the use of their own tongue\\". Excavations in the necropolis of Vicenne-Campochiaro near Boiano, which dates from the 7th century, found among 130 burials that there were 13 human burials alongside horses along with artifacts of Germanic and Avar origin. Horse burials are characteristic of Central Asian horse-nomads, and therefore these burials are clearly those of the Bulgar settlers of Molise and Campania.Conte Miltenova, N. - I Bulgari di Gallo Matese - Prefazione e postfazione di Giuseppe Mario Tufarulo Passaporto Editore, Roma, 1993. - C.N.R. =First Bulgarian Empire= After the state disintegrated under Khazar attack in 668, Asparukh parted ways with his brothers and led some of the Bulgars to seek a secure home. He was followed by 30,000 to 50,000 Bulgars.–í–∞—Å–∏–ª –ù. –ó–ª–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ü—ä—Ä–≤–æ—Ç–æ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ –¶–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ï–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ö—É–Ω–æ-–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–¥–º–æ—â–∏–µ —Å. 188.

Located between Versailles and Marly- le-Roi on a 23-hectare (57-acre) walled site, the property is surrounded by moats and has a constructed surface area of 7,000 m2 (75,350 ft2), 5,000 m2 (53,800 ft2) of which are living space. The property pays various tributes to Louis XIV of France, France's Sun King and stands on land which once formed part of the Versailles estate. Khashoggi had previously restored the Palais Rose in Le V√©sinet and the Ch√¢teau du Verduron in Marly-le-Roi. The Chateau Louis XIV was built on the site of the former Chateau du CampLouveciennes mon village, Jacques et Monique La√ø, 1997, ().Le ch√¢teau du Camp, sur le blog de la Tribune de Louveciennes in Louveciennes, with the aim of building a modern house, with hi-tech controls incorporated within a 17th-century aspect, layout, and materials. In 2015, the chateau was purchased by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for US$301 million, a world record for a residential property.  History  In the late 17th century, the property where the current Ch√¢teau Louis XIV was built consisted of several plots of land, chestnut groves and woodland.Ancien ch√¢teau Le Camp √† Louveciennes (Yvelines), octobre 2009, √âtude historique et documentaire command√©e au Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Litt√©rature par l‚Äôagence Bortolussi, architecte en chef des Monuments historiques. In the early 18th century, the royal regiment was in charge of participating in a major excavation project in Marly-le-Roi. They thus decided to set up camp in an existing clearing on these very plots of land. During this period, Louis XIV decided to build a palace in Marly-le-Roi nestled in a lush green setting; a place where he would regularly go to find the peace and quiet that he lacked in Versailles. Later, the Swiss Guards, assigned to ensure the security of the Ch√¢teau de Marly, set up their camp on the property. Also known as the \\"Royal Regiment Camp\\" or the \\"Marly Camp,\\" the camp disappeared in the mid 18th century, and the Ch√¢teau de Marly suffered in the French Revolution. In 1797, during a settlement, the camp and land that were part of the property were sold to Fran√ßoise-Suzanne Guyhon Monthaut who, in turn, sold them to the Vicomte and his wife in 1805. The Vicomte Charles-Louis Terray de Morel-Vind√©, counselor at the royal court in Paris, inherited the property following the death of his grandfather in 1842, and sold it in 1848 to Jean-Pierre Blondi and Ad√©la√Øde Halguin, who had the first house and outbuildings built on the property. The camp property became a large farm. Here, a cavalry regiment and several military companies would sometimes set up camp in what was then called \\"The camp farm\\" until 1863, when Dr Duborgia, mayor of Bougival, purchased and expanded the property. In 1888, Charles-Emile Clerc, the new owner following the death of Duborgia, undertook the demolition of the initial buildings which, over the years, had only undergone a few scarcely noticeable changes. Having acquired several plots of land, Charles-Emile Clerc was able to expand the property, which he transformed into a residential domain with a large house surrounded by extensive wooded grounds. The property remained in the family for over a century. During this time, it underwent a few modifications such as the addition of a stable, a caretaker's house and a number of paths, before eventually being sold to a French couple in 1991. This would then give way to a succession of owners, until the site's purchase and rebuilding by Khashoggi.Un nouveau ch√¢teau Louis XIV √©difi√© non-loin de Versailles, sur le site de l'Express = COGEMAD = The Saudi-born French property developer Emad Khashoggi demolished the building and constructed a new house, built with respect to 17th-century craft traditions.

The property includes an underwater room built into the moats ‚Äì the only one of its kind in Europe. The ceiling of the drawing room has a trompe-l'≈ìil painting inspired by a fresco created by Charles Le Brun for the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte, which took master painters several months to create. This, in addition to the fountain in the gardens, is one of the centerpieces of the ch√¢teau.  The trades and the artisans  Numerous companies certified as Living Heritage Artisans and Companies took part in this project, which enabled them to train new craftsmen. The construction project brought together several age-old trades, which produced the following key works: = Stonemasonry = 860 m3 (30,370 ft3) of massive natural stone divided as follows: * 80 m3 (2,800 ft3) of Lanvignes limestone * 175 m3 (6,000 ft3) of fine Saint-Maximin limestone * 605 m3 (21,300 ft3) of fine Saint-Maximin limestone They were used to make balusters, sculpted tables, fire pots and capitals for sculpted pilasters. On display in the ch√¢teau's Garden √† la fran√ßaise is a stone-sculpted reproduction of the Chariot of Apollo from the fountain in Versailles. The smaller-scale copy of this sculpted group, designed for the king's gardens by the artist Jean-Baptiste Tuby, retained the proportions and details of the original. It was then gilded in gold-leaf. = Marble = The marble was crafted in various styles: delicate marquetry for the floors, mosaics for the garden level, book matched in the bathrooms, sculpted for the monumental statue of Louis XIV and molded for the Grand Si√®cle-style fireplaces. List of marbles used and their place of origin: * Black Saint-Laurent: H√©rault ‚Äì France * Yellow Sienna: Tuscany ‚Äì Italy * Antique Green: Aosta Valley ‚Äì Italy * Cherry Red: Belgium * Collemandina Marble: Tuscany ‚Äì Italy * Salome Marble: Turkey * Red Levante Marble: Liguria ‚Äì Italy * Macauba Quarzite: Brazil * Pink Alpinina : Portugal * Moonstone: Brazil * Pink onyx: Iran * Rouge de France: H√©rault ‚Äì France * Calacatta Topazio : Tuscany ‚Äì Italy * Bamboo Green: Brazil = Cabinetmaking and joinery = Many 17th-century decorations sculpted in wood embellish the interior. One of the centerpieces is found on the monumental entrance door sculpted entirely by hand in oak in high relief, and projects out by 17 cm (6.6 in). It depicts the Sun God on horse-back as a Roman Emperor crowned by Victory. This work was inspired by a model from the War Room at the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. = Clock-making = For the fa√ßade of the ch√¢teau, Emad Khashoggi commissioned clock-makers to create a genuine monumental bronze and enamel clock identical to the one on the fa√ßade of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. = Painting and decor = Several ceilings in the reception halls and master suites depict themes dear to Louis XIV, and which appear at Versailles. The painted ceiling of the cupola in the main drawing room was influenced by a never-executed All√©goire de l‚ÄôAurore conceived by Charles Le Brun for the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte. = Bronze casting = Works include the creation of 17th-century lamps and decorative hardware inspired by numerous archives from the History of France, notably from the 17th century under the reign of Louis XIV. = Iron-working = Works include numerous handmade curved banisters and balustrades reproduced from17th-century spirals and motifs. These assemblages are always created using tenons, mortises or pegs, without the slightest trace of welding, according to the finest French tradition. = Framework = A traditional frame was constructed for the dome, which was assembled the old-fashioned way using a system of tenons and mortises. = Roofing = In keeping with age-old techniques, the roofers hand-crafted the slate roof from Angers. The roof also boasts fire pots sculpted in stone and gilded metal spikes on the roof's ridge beam. = Gardens = The formal gardens of the ch√¢teau The Ch√¢teau Louis XIV, nestled in an authentic lush green setting, is consistent with the standards of the 17th century, and its parks and gardens are no exception. In line with Andr√© Le N√¥tre's theories for the Ch√¢teau de Versailles and the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le- Vicomte, the grounds pay tribute to the French-style gardens. It boasts flower beds and embroidered box hedges, plays on perspective, topiary yew trees clipped into small pyramids, a tree-lined labyrinth, a small farmhouse with goats, a vegetable garden, stables and even an English-style garden on the lower level, all in keeping with the natural outlines of the property where the ch√¢teau is located.
