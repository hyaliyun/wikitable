Five of Drake's crew, including her captain, George Burdon, were killed, and after an hour-long engagement, Drake surrendered to the Americans. Jones was able to evade capture and deliver Drake to Brest, France as his prize on 8 May 1778.

In July 1779, she left Nantes for Brest, under captain Jean- Baptiste Cotton de Chaucy, being chartered by the King of France into a 10-vessel convoy between Brest and the Antillas, escorted by Le Fier-Rodrigue frigate. But the latter was suddenly requisitioned by the French Navy and the expedition was cancelled. Still chartered by the King, between March 1780 and January 1781, the Dra(c)ke (Drak), captain J.B.Cotton de Chaucy, made two trips to America and West-Indies, transporting Rochambeau‚Äôs troops in Charles- Henri-Louis d'Arsac de Ternay's squadron and coming back to France with packets for the King.Samuel Eliot Morison/1959 ¬´ John Paul Jones ¬ª/Archives D√©partementales de Loire-Atlantique:notaire Briand-le-Jeune‚Äôs papers May 1782. -At the beginning of 1781, Jean Peltier Dudoyer prepared in Nantes 5 ships for the V.O.C., Dutch East India Company, in order to go and protect Cape of Good Hope against England. The Drake, captain Marc Antoine Fauvet, was at The Cape in November 1781, joining the de Pernier‚Äôs squadron whose mission was to bring victuals and troops to Suffren‚Äôs fleet at Isle de France (Maurice Island). The Drake came back to the Cape 20.5.1782. There, on 2.9.1782, she was sold to the King of France by Robert Pitot for 849.000 livres and incorporated into the French Navy. She went once more to Isle de France in November, left on 1.12.82 and arrived at Trinquemalay (Ceyland) on 10.3.1783. In the meantime, the Peace was declared and announced to the East-Indian fleet on 29.6.1783. Suffren sailed back home, but de Pernier stayed in the Indian Ocean with 5 ships-of- the line and some frigates and sloops-of-war. From December 1784 to February 1786, the French ‚ÄúFl√ªte Royale Dracke‚Äù, captain Deshayes, was sent by the governor Marquis de Bussy from Pondicherry, India to Bago, Burma, to bring help to the other royal ‚Äúfl√ªte‚Äù the Baleine, captain Flouest, and to try diplomatically to get her out of the River where she was retained by the local authorities, and to allow her to get back to France. That will happen during the Autumn 1785 for we see her leaving the Isle of France on 24 July 1785 and arriving first at Lorient, and then at Rochefort, being decommissioned there on 28.3.1786. As for the Drake, her departure from Bago (P√©g(o)u), which was scheduled for March 1785, could only occur eleven months later, first because of a bill of exchange having not been paid in Pondicherry, and secondly because of a war suddenly breaking out between Burmese and Siamese. Our ship finally arrived at Pondicherry in May 1786 and from there we no longer find any trace of her!

The sect, as described by the author Luigi Natoli in his historic novel I Beati Paoli (written as a series under the pseudonym William Galt in 1909, then re-published as books in 1921 and 1949), resembles an order of knights fighting for the poor and the commoners.The Beati Paoli, by Roberto Savona, Best of Sicily magazine Whereas the novel is fictitious, Sicily's history bears some evidence that the Beati Paoli actually existed. In 1071 feudalism was introduced in Sicily by its conqueror, the Norman lord Roger II de Hauteville.The Middle Ages, Best of Sicily magazine As the nobles started to exploit their feudal rights in the centuries to come, the Inquisition also got a foothold in Sicily. Any action by the commoners that could be interpreted by the state or the church as acts of treason or heresy was punishable by death. Such actions could be unauthorized assemblies or formation of societies with goals other than supporting the current state/church regime. In this environment, several orders and sects rose to existence - albeit a secret one. The Beati Paoli was allegedly formed to oppose both the church and the state, defending the commoners from infringements posed by the regime. They wore black hooded coats and operated at night from their refuge in the remains of the catacombs and underground channels of Palermo. It is not known when the Beati Paoli was established, but the novel by Luigi Natoli sets the scene in the 17th century in the town of Paoli. The origin of the name is also unknown, although some tie it to Saint Francis of Paola, or Beato Paola. The Beati Paoli have the same connotation to many Sicilians as Robin Hood has to Northern Europeans. Today, traces of the Beati Paoli can be found in the Capo district of Palermo, where a square, a street and a restaurant bear their name. Predecessors of the Mafia? In Sicily the Beati Paoli came to be seen ‚Äì both in the popular imagination and in the ideology of mafia groups ‚Äì as a proto-manifestation of the Mafia.Paoli, Organised Crime in Italy, p. 264 Sicilian mafiosi love to portray themselves as the successors of the Beati Paoli, and Cosa Nostra likes to trace its origin to the sect. The novel is still alive in today's Mafia culture and its main characters are models of the ideal-typical sets of attitudes and behaviour of a mafioso. In one of their first confrontations in court, the Mafia boss of bosses Tot√≤ Riina and the turncoat (pentito) Gaspare Mutolo confronted each other referring to the characters of the novel.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 184-85/242 Another pentito, Antonio Calderone, said he was told when he was initiated in Cosa Nostra that a mafioso should \\"follow the example of the Beati Paoli.\\"Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 13  References  Works cited *Gambetta, Diego (1993).

Williams was assigned to the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 14 and Expedition 15. In 2012, she served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33. Early life and education Sunita Williams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya, who reside in Falmouth, Massachusetts. She is the youngest of three children. Her brother Jay Thomas is four years older and her sister Dina Annadj is three years older. Williams' paternal family is from Jhulasan in the Mehsana district in Gujarat, India, while her maternal great- grandmother Mary Bohinc (originally Marija Bohinjec), born in Le≈°e, Slovenia, immigrated to America as an eleven-year-old with her mother, 1891 Slovene emigrant Ursula (Strajhar) Bohinac.Sunita Williams in her maternal ancestors' homeland one more time, Delo, March 26, 2013.Sunita Williams to start her India trip from April 1, The Times of India, March 31, 2013. Williams graduated in Needham High School in Needham, Massachusetts, in 1983. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in physical science from the United States Naval Academy in 1987, and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology in 1995. Military career Williams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987. After a six-month temporary assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she was designated a Basic Diving Officer. She next reported to the Naval Air Training Command, where she was designated a Naval Aviator in July 1989. She received initial H-46 Sea Knight training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 (HC-3), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 (HC-8) in Norfolk, Virginia, with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Provide Comfort. In September 1992, she was the Officer-in-Charge of an H-46 detachment sent to Miami, Florida, for Hurricane Andrew relief operations aboard . In January 1993, Williams began training at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. She graduated in December, and was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and V-22 chase pilot in the T-2. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the SH-60B/F, UH-1, AH-1W, SH-2, VH-3, H-46, CH-53, and the H-57. In December 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer. There she flew the UH-60, OH-6, and the OH-58. She was then assigned to as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on Saipan in June 1998 when she was selected by NASA for the astronaut program. She has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types. Career in NASA Williams wearing an EMU suit, circa 2004 Williams began her Astronaut Candidate training at the Johnson Space Center in August 1998. =STS-116= Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, STS-116 mission specialist, participates in the mission's third planned session of extravehicular activity (EVA) Williams was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) with STS-116, aboard Space Shuttle Discovery, on December 9, 2006, to join the Expedition 14 crew. In April 2007, the Russian members of the crew rotated, changing to Expedition 15 . =Expeditions 14 and 15= Williams became the first person to run a marathon from the space station on April 16, 2007 After launching aboard the Shuttle Discovery, Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. Fellow astronaut Joan Higginbotham cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was brought back to Earth by the STS-116 crew. Williams performed her first extra-vehicular activity on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael L√≥pez-Alegr√≠a. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react. Joan Higginbotham and Williams work the controls of the Canadarm2 in the ISS's Destiny Laboratory On the third spacewalk, Williams was outside the station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by Kathryn C. Thornton for most spacewalk time by a woman. On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16, Peggy Whitson surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes. In early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain. On April 26, 2007, NASA decided to bring Williams back to Earth on the STS-117 mission aboard Atlantis. Although she did not break the U.S. single spaceflight record that was recently broken by former crew member Commander Michael L√≥pez-Alegr√≠a, she did break the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman. Williams served as a mission specialist and returned to Earth on June 22, 2007, at the end of the STS-117 mission. Poor weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral forced mission managers to skip three landing attempts there over a 24-hour period. They then diverted Atlantis to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where the shuttle touched down at 3:49 p.m. EDT, returning Williams home after a record 192-day stay in space. =Marathon in space= On April 16, 2007, she ran the first marathon by any person in space. Williams was listed as an entrant for the 2007 Boston Marathon, and completed the distance in four hours and 24 minutes. The other crew members cheered her on and gave her oranges during the race. Williams' sister, Dina Pandya, and fellow astronaut Karen L. Nyberg ran the marathon on Earth, and Williams received updates on their progress from Mission Control. In 2008, Williams participated in the Boston Marathon again. =Expeditions 32 and 33= COLBERT during ISS Expedition 32 Williams appears to touch the bright sun during a spacewalk conducted on September 5, 2012. Williams was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 15, 2012, as part of Expedition 32/33. Her Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-05M docked with the ISS for a four-month stay at the orbiting outpost on July 17, 2012. The docking of the Soyuz spacecraft occurred at 4:51 GMT as the ISS flew over Kazakhstan at an altitude of 252 miles. The hatchway between the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS was opened at 7:23 GMT and Williams floated into the ISS to begin her duties as a member of the Expedition 32 crew. On the Soyuz spacecraft, she was accompanied by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko. Williams served as the commander of the ISS during her stay onboard ISS Expedition 33, succeeding Gennady Padalka. She became the commander of the International Space Station on September 17, 2012, being only the second woman to achieve the feat. Also in September 2012, she became the first person to do a triathlon in space, which coincided with the Nautica Malibu Triathlon held in Southern California. She used the International Space Station's own treadmill and stationary bike, and for the swimming portion of the race, she used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to do weightlifting and resistance exercises that approximate swimming in microgravity. After swimming half a mile (0.8 km), biking 18 miles (29 km), and running 4 miles (6.4 km), Williams finished with a time of one hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds, as she reported. She returned to Earth with fellow astronauts Yuri Malenchenko and Akihiko Hoshide on November 19, 2012, touching down in the town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. Helicopters joined the search-and-recovery crew to assist them, as their capsule parachuted down some from the planned touchdown site due to a procedural delay. =Commercial Crew program= In July 2015, NASA announced Williams as one of the first astronauts for U.S. Commercial spaceflights. Subsequently, she has started working with Boeing and SpaceX to train in their commercial crew vehicles, along with other chosen astronauts. In August 2018 she was assigned to the first mission flight, CTS-1, to the International Space Station of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner. =Spacewalks= , Williams has made seven spacewalks totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes, putting Williams ninth on the list of most experienced spacewalkers. On August 30, 2012, Williams and JAXA astronaut Hoshide ventured outside the ISS to conduct US EVA-18. They removed and replaced the failing Main Bus Switching Unit-1 (MBSU-1), and installed a thermal cover onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2). Personal life Williams with Slovenian Defense Minister Ljubica Jelu≈°iƒç (2009) Williams at Science City Kolkata in April 2013 Williams is married to Michael J. Williams, a federal police officer in Oregon. The two have been married for more than 20 years, and both flew helicopters in the early days of their careers. They reside together in suburban Houston, Texas. She had a pet Jack Russell Terrier named Gorby who was featured with her on the Dog Whisperer television show on the National Geographic Channel on November 12, 2010.Dog Whisperer: Astronaut Dogs & Mongo , National Geographic Channel, November 12, 2010. In 2012, Williams expressed a desire to adopt a girl from Ahmedabad. In September 2007, Williams visited the Sabarmati Ashram and her ancestral village Jhulasan in Gujarat, India. She was awarded the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Vishwa Pratibha Award by the World Gujarati Society, the first person of Indian descent who was not an Indian citizen to be presented the award. On October 4, 2007, Williams spoke at the American Embassy School, and then met Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister of India. In October 2014, Williams visited Slovenia. During her stay, amongst other things, she paid a visit to the Astronomical Society Vega in Ljubljana. She visited Slovenia again in 2016. On June 7, 2017, the Needham School Committee voted unanimously to name the town's new elementary school the Sunita L. Williams Elementary School. Williams was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. In May 2020, Williams addressed over 500,000 Indian and other international students in the United States in a virtual interview organized by the Student Hub at the Embassy of India, Washington, DC during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020.

It is their only album recorded as a four-piece band (with no keyboardist), and their final album to feature founding member Jon Anderson on vocals. At the departure of keyboardist Igor Khoroshev in 2000, the band agreed to record a new studio album with orchestral arrangements, something they had not done since their second album, Time and a Word in 1970. The album was recorded and mixed using Pro Tools with producer Tim Weidner and orchestral arrangements by Larry Group√© conducting the San Diego Symphony Orchestra. Magnification received mixed reviews from music critics upon release and became one of the band's lowest selling albums, reaching number 71 on the UK Albums Chart and number 186 on the Billboard 200. Its North American release featured a simultaneous release on CD and DVD-Audio formats, the latter with a 5.1 surround sound mix. The album was reissued several times from 2001 to 2004, each with a bonus disc containing previously unreleased live tracks. Yes promoted the album with their Yessymphonic Tour that covered the United States and Europe which featured the band, touring keyboardist Tom Brislin, and an orchestra on stage. Background In August 2000, the Yes line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Igor Khoroshev, finished with their three-month Masterworks Tour across the United States. The tour was met with controversy when Khoroshev was involved in a backstage incident making repeated unwanted advances towards two female security guards. He was later charged with assault and battery and sexual battery, both misdemeanours. Reports of Khoroshev being loud and verbally abusive at his hotel were also made. The incident led to Khoroshev's departure at the tour's conclusion, leaving the band reduced to a four-piece and without a keyboardist. As the band discussed their next move in the latter half of 2000, one aspect covered was their future touring plans which included the idea of playing dates with an orchestra on stage. This sparked an interest from all four members who felt it was a good time to pursue such a musical direction, leading to the decision of recording a new studio album with an orchestra incorporated into their music. Anderson was surprised that Squire and White agreed as he felt the two were always in favour of a heavier rock sound. The undertaking marked the first time the band had worked with an orchestra since they did a similar thing for their second album, Time and a Word (1970). The band shared their idea with their fans when in January 2001, an online vote had been posted on their official website asking them if they wish to see their next tour include an orchestra. Before the album was recorded, Anderson had decided upon the title Magnification regardless of its style or musical content.Bonus Material ‚Äì Dreamtime documentary at 00:32‚Äì00:41 The idea behind the title and the album itself, he explained, \\"eventually became the idea to magnify everything that's good around you in order to magnify everything that is good within\\".Bonus Material ‚Äì Dreamtime documentary at 00:50‚Äì01:02 Production =Recording= In early February 2001, Yes entered Santa Barbara Sound Design, a recording studio in Santa Monica, California to work on a group of demos they had come up with for the album. With Howe based in England, he arrived at the studio after the rest had settled and found they already had \\"industriously started writing music\\" in a similar fashion to when he flew over to work on Keys to Ascension (1996), which made him proud. English engineer and producer Tim Weidner, known for his association with former Yes singer and producer Trevor Horn and artist Seal, was brought in to work on the album at Howe's suggestion as he had worked on his third solo album Turbulence (1991) and praised his approach. By July 2001, the album's title was decided upon. To handle the orchestral arrangements, Yes employed American conductor, composer, and arranger Larry Group√©, a longtime Yes fan since his school days who got word of their plans to possibly make record and tour with an orchestra and got in touch with their management. When Group√©'s name was suggested to the band, Anderson listened to his arrangements on the soundtrack to the drama film The Contender (2000) and enjoyed his musical style and use of harmonies.Bonus Material ‚Äì Dreamtime documentary at 01:14‚Äì01:28 After several meetings with management Group√© finally met the band who after several days observing their work in the studio, supplied him a digital audio tape of three demos they had recorded and returned ten days later with orchestrations he had written for them using computer and keyboard samples at his home studio. It was a success, and Group√© worked on the remainder of the album, \\"doing more new things, adding different harmonies, Moog counterpoints, putting overtures in front of pieces\\", and conducted the final orchestral arrangements with the San Diego Symphony Orchestra. Anderson pitched ideas for the orchestral arrangements and places in the songs where he wished for them to be by playing a MIDI guitar, a process Howe found intriguing. Around a week into the recording process, Weidner convinced the band to switch from using a 48-track analogue machine to digital recording with him operating the digital audio workstation software Pro Tools, and Pro Control for mixing. Both parties found that analogue became difficult to work in as the many changes in arrangements during the song development stage made tape editing increasingly impractical. Weidner recalled some scepticism from the group initially, but got into the process after they realised how flexible the digital system was. Two separate instances of the program were used to record the band and the other to compile and process what was put down. The orchestra was recorded across 40 tracks, causing these tracks to be mixed first prior to the main mixing process. Weidner recalled that lyrics and musical arrangements would change daily and roughly 300 GB of audio had been recorded at its completion. As the stereo mixes were finished, the band agreed to have Weidner use the tracks to create a new mix in 5.1 surround sound which he did with considerable ease using the software. The process allowed him to take advantage of space and not be faced with the constant challenge of Howe's guitars clashing with the orchestra. The majority of effects done on the vocal tracks were done with the Reverb One and Echo Farm TDM plug-ins. In May 2001, the vocals, guitars, and necessary overdubs were finished. Howe entered the project with enthusiasm which soon turned into caution. He later revealed that the album was a problematic one to make, and claimed it was only completed through the \\"relentless efforts\\" from executive producer Jordan Berliant, Weidner, and himself. Though he said the album contained too much music on the disc, he nonetheless said that the band \\"did get it right\\" when the project was complete. As the album was being made, Howe became aware that the orchestra would affect his sound and style of playing which he described as \\"a bit of a rude awakening\\". He also disliked having to restrict his playing in order to accommodate the orchestral passages. With Magnification being the first album to feature him as the sole guitarist since Keys to Ascension 2 (1997), he was pleased with the absence of another player interfering.Bonus Material ‚Äì Dreamtime documentary at 11:13‚Äì12:08 Having finished his acoustic solo album Natural Timbre (2001) two weeks prior to working on Magnification, Howe realised he was \\"carrying a lot of expertise\\" in regard to the acoustic guitar which greatly influenced his acoustic playing on it, leading to \\"some good pictures\\" as a result.Bonus Material ‚Äì Dreamtime documentary at 12:08‚Äì12:26 =Songs= \\"Can You Imagine\\" features Squire on lead vocals with Anderson on backing vocals. It was originally recorded as a demo in 1981 for the proposed supergroup XYZ featuring Squire, White, and Jimmy Page. \\"In the Presence Of\\" originated from a passage that White played on a piano in the studio which Anderson noticed and wished to develop it further for the album. White came up with it several years prior to recording. One track features Squire and White playing an organ together and was recorded in a recording session that White recalled was particularly funny. White agreed with an interviewer that some of the lyrics in \\"Spirit of Survival\\" were uncharacteristically dark and what he described as \\"pretty eerie\\", particularly in the wake of the September 11 attacks that occurred on the album's scheduled release day in North America. =Artwork= In a departure from their previous album, Yes chose not to work with English artist Roger Dean and assigned Bob Cesca to design the artwork. However, the cover retains the band's logo that Dean originally designed in 1972. Release Magnification was released on 10 September 2001 by Eagle Records in the United Kingdom, under a license agreement between Beyond Music and the band's company, Yes LLC. It was originally scheduled for release in North America by Beyond and Yes LLC on 11 September 2001, however plans were affected following the terrorist attacks that occurred in New York City on the same day.Squire, Chris. Classic Artists: Yes (2007). Image Entertainment. As a result, the release was rescheduled for 4 December 2001. Chances of the album's success were hampered further after Beyond Music went out of business one month after it was put out. Magnification reached number 71 on the UK Albums Chart and number 186 on the Billboard 200 and lasted one week on both charts. In the wake of the September attacks, Yes offered \\"We Agree\\" as a free download as a tribute to those affected. Longtime New York Post music critic Dan Aquilante wrote a positive review of the album for the newspaper and described what Yes sounded like with an orchestra: \\"Uplifting, optimistic music that's lush without the mush\\". He concluded the album may change the mind of those who had \\"said no to Yes\\" in the past. Howard Cohen gave the album two stars out of five for The Knight Ridder Tribune and thought that despite the lack of a \\"killer tune\\" on it, he rates it as one of the band's more listenable releases. In her review for Dayton Daily News, Lisa Knodel believed the album is a \\"delight\\" for fans of the band and went so far to call it \\"groundbreaking\\". She thought Groupe's arrangements \\"create drama, painting a musical landscape for the mind and moving from moments of inner peace and chaos\\" which helped the group avoid creating \\"elevator music\\". Knodel picked \\"Magnification\\", \\"We Agree\\", and \\"Give Love Each Day\\" as stand out tracks. =Reissues= The album has been reissued five times. In 2001, it was released in its standard version and three two-disc limited editions in the US, each version sold in Borders, Best Buy, and F.Y.E. and Trans World branches, respectively. Each bonus disc contains different live tracks recorded on the Masterworks and Yessymphonic Tours. A new two-disc Special Edition of the album was released in June 2002 in the United Kingdom with alternate artwork, the second disc being a HDCD CD-ROM containing further live tracks, the promotional video to \\"Don't Go\\", a live performance of \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" from the Yessymphonic Tour, and an interview with Anderson. In the United States, a version on DVD-Audio with a 5.1 surround sound mix was released by Rhino Records on 30 July 2002, containing extended sleeve notes and bonus audio and video content. Magnification was included in the Yes compilation album Essentially Yes (2006). Tour Yes supported Magnification with their Yessymphonic Tour of North America and Europe between July and December 2001 with the band accompanied by an orchestra for each show. The tour marked the band's first ever concerts in Russia. Time was limited, leaving preparations with the live orchestra to begin while the album was still being mixed. The North American leg featured a different orchestra at each concert, while the European leg had the European Festival Orchestra, formed of young musicians, touring with the band with conductor Wilhelm Keitel. The first several gigs of the tour featured Groupe as conductor. To play the necessary keyboard passages in the setlist, the band hired American keyboardist Tom Brislin. \\"Magnification\\", \\"Don't Go\\", and \\"In the Presence Of\\" were performed live, the latter receiving a particularly welcoming response from audiences; to Howe, \\"like a classic Yes number\\". The two shows at Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam were recorded which was released as the 2002 DVD and 2009 CD Symphonic Live, the video directed by Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. Former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was invited to perform with the band for the recording of Magnification and the tour, but he declined as he already had gigs booked in South America. He rejoined the group in April 2002. Track listing All songs by Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White. Personnel Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.

For example, a player with 3‚ô• 4‚ô• 5‚ô£ 6‚ô† is open-ended, because a deuce or a seven would give the player a straight. This situation is also called an outside straight draw or double-ended straight draw as the cards needed to complete the straight are cards which are on the outside (both ends) of the current hand, as opposed to an inside draw such as 2‚ô¶ 3‚ô† 4‚ô† 6‚ô• or A‚ô£ 2‚ô£ 3‚ô£ 4‚ô¶, which can only be completed by a five. The term originated with draw poker but is also used in games like Texas hold'em. Seven-card games like hold'em and stud also allow the possibility of double belly-buster draws, also called double-inside or two-way draws, which, like an inside draw, a card is needed within a series to fill. But unlike simple inside draws, two ranks can fill the hand. An example of this is A‚ô• 3‚ô• 4‚ô£ 5‚ô†7‚ô£, in which a deuce fills the inside straight A2345, and a six would fill the inside straight 34567. These terms are also used for straight flush draws. 2‚ô• 3‚ô• 4‚ô• 5‚ô• is a straight-flush draw, since A‚ô• and 6‚ô• will create straight flushes. Such hands are optimal drawing hands, since the player has up to fifteen outs (nine cards remaining in the suit, six cards which complete the straight but not the flush).

Other terms include persona death and player death.\\"Some old-timers prefer the expansion persona death. Exceedingly old-timers might even use player death, but at least we're trying to break the habit.\\" (Bartle 2003, p416) Some video games offer a hardcore mode that features this mechanic, rather than making it part of the core game. Permadeath is contrary to games that allow the player to continue in some manner, such as their character respawning at a nearby checkpoint on \\"death\\", resurrection of their character by a magic item or spell, or being able to load and restore a saved game state to avoid the death situation. The mechanic is frequently associated with both tabletop and computer-based role-playing games, and is considered an essential element of the roguelike genre of video games. The implementation of permadeath can vary depending on the type of game. In single-player video games A player, having died in NetHack, is asked if they would like to know more about the unidentified possessions they had been carrying Most arcade games (such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man, for example) have permadeath, so the term is usually used in reference to role-playing games where it is less common. Few single-player RPGs exhibit death that is truly permanent, as most allow the player to load a previously saved game and continue from the stored position. The subgenre of roguelike games is an exception, where permadeath is a high- value factor of these games. While players can save their state and continue at a later time, the save file is generally erased or overwritten, preventing players from restarting at that same state. They work around this by backing up save files, but this tactic, called \\"save scumming\\" is considered cheating. The use of the permadeath mechanic in roguelikes arose from the namesake of the genre, Rogue. Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy, the developers of the game, initially did not have save capabilities, requiring players to finish the game in one session. When they did add a save feature, they found that players would repeatedly reload a save file to obtain the best results, which was contrary to the game design‚Äîwhich they \\"wanted [realism]\\"‚Äîso they implemented code to wipe the save file on reloading to prevent this. This feature is retained in nearly all derivatives of Rogue as well as more recent \\"roguelike- like\\" titles like Spelunky and FTL: Faster Than Light. Implementations of permadeath within roguelikes may vary widely. Casual forms of permanent death may allow players to retain money or items while introducing repercussions for failure, reducing the frustration associated with permanent death. More hardcore implementations delete all progress made. In some games, permadeath is an optional mode or feature of higher difficulty levels. Extreme forms may further punish players, such as The Castle Doctrine, which has the option of permanently banning users from servers upon death. Players may prefer to play games with permadeath for the excitement, the desire to test their skill or understanding of the game's mechanics, or out of boredom with standard game design. When their actions have repercussions, they must make more strategic and tactical decisions. At the same time, games using permadeath may encourage players to rely on emotional, intuitive or other non-deductive decision-making as they attempt, with less information, to minimize the risk to characters which they have bonded with. Games using permadeath more closely simulate real life, though game with a strong narrative element frequently avoid permadeath. Permadeath of individual characters can be a factor in party-based tactical role-playing games, including the X-COM series, the Fire Emblem series, and Darkest Dungeon. In these games, the player generally manages a roster of characters and controls their actions in turn-based battles while building their attributes, skills, and specializations over time. If these characters fall in combat, the character is considered dead for the remainder of the game. It is possible to return to a previous save game state in these games before the death of the character, but require the player to repeat the battle to continue, risking the loss of the same or other characters. Some games require an optional permadeath mode to be turned on to provide a more difficult challenge to the player, often associated with earning additional achievements. Egosoft's space combat simulator X3: Terran Conflict and its expansion pack X3: Albion Prelude each have a small number of Steam achievements that require playing in \\"Dead-Is-Dead\\" mode, while Paradox Development Studio's grand strategy titles Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, Hearts of Iron IV, and Stellaris all require \\"Ironman\\" mode to earn any achievements. Each of these cases require an unmodded game, a sustained connection to a central server, and even a momentary connection loss costs the playthrough its ability to earn achievements. Doom (2016) has a difficulty setting called \\"Ultra Nightmare\\" that, once the player dies, ends their playthrough and forces the player to restart the game from the beginning. In multiplayer video games =In mass multiplayer online role- playing games= Permadeath in multiplayer video games is controversial.\\"It's [permanent death is] the single most controversial subject in virtual worlds.\\" (Bartle 2003, p415) Due to player desires and the resulting market forces involved, Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (such as World of Warcraft) and other multiplayer-focused RPGs rarely implement it. Generally speaking, there is little support in multiplayer culture for permadeath.\\"Existing virtual world culture is anti-PD.\\" (Bartle 2003, p444) Summarizing academic Richard Bartle's comments on player distaste for permadeath,\\"Dr. Bartle finally interrupted the conversation by trying to bring the conversation back to a player's perspective: 'Do you want permadeath or pedophilia? Both seem equally attractive to most players.'\\" (Quote is on second page) Engadget characterized fans of MMORPGs as horrified by the concept. For games that charge an ongoing fee to play, permadeath may drive players away, creating a financial disincentive to permadeath.\\"The most frequently cited reason against permadeath is, of course, player investment, which put succinctly says, 'We never want to give players a reason to stop paying us $10 bucks a month.' ‚Ä¶ Due to the intricate coding complexities and the‚Ä¶ unique nature of sharing a space with other players, it‚Äôs hard enough to prevent these catastrophic events from occurring. Why on earth would we want to give you a choice as to whether or not to start a new character, or cancel your account altogether?\\" (Schubert 2005)\\"Not only will they [players] say they'll leave when it [permanent character death] happens, some of them actually will leave.\\" (Bartle 2003, p424) Diablo II, Diablo III, Minecraft, Terraria, and Torchlight II are mainstream exceptions that include support for an optional \\"hardcore\\" mode that subjects characters to permadeath. Sacred and Sacred 2 similarly feature or have featured a similar \\"hardcore\\" mode. Star Wars Galaxies had permadeath for Jedi characters for a short period, but later eliminated that functionality.\\"For a few months, one type of \\"Star Wars\\" character, the rare and powerful Jedi, could be permanently killed. But when players began singling out Jedi characters for vicious attacks, Jedi players cried out for help, and last month LucasArts abandoned permadeath, a company spokeswoman said.\\" (Glater 2004) Proponents attribute a number of reasons why others oppose permadeath. Some attribute tainted perceptions to poor early implementations.\\"This is primarily due to imperfect early implementations and bad customers service decisions; nevertheless, the legacy is there.\\" (Bartle 2003, p444) They also believe that confusion exists between \\"player killing\\" and permadeath, when the two do not need to be used together.\\"Many of the benefits that advocates of PKing cite are primarily due to PD; some of the strongest objections to PKing are due to its PvP element, rather than to PD.\\" (Bartle 2003, p416) Proponents also believe that players initially exposed to games without permadeath consider new games from that point of view.\\"If they [players] began with a virtual world that had no PD, they'll judge your virtual world from that standpoint.\\" (Bartle 2003, p424) Those players are attributed as eventually \\"maturing\\", to a level of accepting permadeath, but only for other players' characters.\\"Even if they are 'mature enough' for PD, they're [sic] attitude is analogous to the way that people in the real world view public transport. ‚Ä¶ So it is with PD: It's fine when it happens to you, but not so fine when it happens to me. (Bartle 2003, p424) The majority of MMORPG players are unwilling to accept the penalty of losing their characters. MMORPGs have experimented with permadeath in an attempt to simulate a more realistic world, but a majority of players preferred not to risk permadeath for their characters. As a result, while they occasionally announce games that feature permadeath, most either remove or never ship with it so as to increase the game's mass appeal.\\"Certain high level monsters would also have the ability to perma-kill a player character. [...] In retrospect, though, that one just seems crazy.\\" Proponents of permadeath claim the risk gives additional significance to their in-game actions. While games without it often impose an in-game penalty for restoring a dead character, the penalty is relatively minor compared to being forced to create a new character. Therefore, the primary change permadeath creates is to make a player's decisions more significant; without it there is less incentive for the player to consider in-game actions seriously.\\"Then, the fact that the whole experience [play without permanent death] is vacuous begins to nag at them.\\" (Bartle 2003, p431) Those seeking to risk permanent death feel that the more severe consequences heighten the sense of involvement and achievement derived from their characters.\\"By having a strong death penalty, such as permadeath based on life points, then one feels the thrill of battle and exuberance of a battle won.\\" \\"Without PD (it can also mean \\"permadeath\\"), there's no sense of achievement in a game.\\" (Bartle, \\"Column 2\\") The increased risk renders acts of heroism and bravery within the gameworld significant; the player has risked a much larger investment of time. Without permadeath, such actions are \\"small actions\\".\\"Without PD, 'small actions' are steps on a treadmill and 'done well' means you move slightly faster than people who have 'done badly.' Heroism is no such thing‚Äîit's just another example of a 'small action.'\\" (Bartle 2003, p431) However, in an online game, permadeath generally means starting over from the beginning, isolating the player of the now-dead character from former comrades. Richard Bartle described advantages of permanent death: restriction of early adopters from permanently held positions of power,\\"In virtual worlds [without permanent death], this is called sandboxing ‚Äî the people who are first to positions of power keep them. There is no opportunity for change.\\" (Bartle 2003, p426) content reuse as players repeat early sections,\\"In a virtual world with no PD, you only get to experience a body of content once.\\" (Bartle 2003, p427) its embodiment of the \\"default fiction of real life\\", improved player immersion from more frequent character changes, and reinforcement of high level achievement.Bartle summarizes these points in Bartle also believes that in the absence of permanent death, game creators must continually create new content for top players, which discourages those not at the top from even bothering to advance.Powerful PCs aren't retired because \\"That [retiring the PC], however, is too much like PD for many players to stomach.\\" To satisfy these players, additional high end content is continuously added. When this is done, \\"Newbies (and not-so-newbies) feel they can never catch up. The people in front will always be in front, and there's no way to overtake them. The horizon advances at the speed you approach it.\\" (Bartle 2003, p426) Proponents of permanent death systems in MMORPGs are a relatively small sub-section of the hardcore gaming community. These players are often interested in additional challenges provided by games that attempt greater realism in their simulation. These players will often seek less- restricted social and economic environments catering to a greater range of player-versus-player interaction and risk-versus-reward scenarios. Those players who prefer not to play with permadeath are unwilling to accept the risk of the large penalties associated with it. The penalty often means a great deal of time spent to regain lost levels, power, influence, or emotional investment that the previous character possessed. This increased investment of time can dissuade non-hardcore players.\\"It [permanent death] leaves no room for error, and the tension of the game kills the enjoyment for casual gamers.\\" Depending on the design of the game, this may involve playing through content that the player has already experienced. Players no longer interested in those aspects of the game will not want to spend time playing through them again in the hope of reaching others to which they previously had access. Players may dislike the way that permadeath causes others to be more wary than they would in regular games, reducing the heroic atmosphere that games seek to provide.\\"The more harsh your death penalties are, the less likely that your player base will take risks and interesting chances.\\" (Schubert 2005) Ultimately this can reduce play to slow, repetitive, low-risk play, commonly called \\"grinding\\".\\"And just like that, your game is considered grindalicious, as your players bore themselves to death.\\" (Schubert 2005) Most MMORPGs do not allow character creation at an arbitrary experience level, even if the player has already achieved that level with a now-dead character, providing a powerful disincentive for permadeath. Permadeath guilds may exist in multiplayer games without this feature, such as Dungeons & Dragons Online. Players voluntarily delete their characters based on the honor system. In 2019, Dungeons & Dragons Online instituted an permadeath event that ameliorated some of the disincentive of losing character progress. A temporary \\"hardcore\\" server was instituted. Dead characters could not be revived, but after the conclusion of the event, players could transfer the character to one of the game's regular servers, retaining its level, abilities, and most of its equipment. =In multiplayer battle games= Permadeath is essential in player-versus-player battle games, such as last man standing games and battle royale games, since the goal of such games is to be the last character or team surviving on the battlefield by eliminating everyone else, or the enemy team. In other games Few non-electronic role-playing games give players the opportunity to resurrect characters, although older combat-oriented games, including the most popular game, Dungeons & Dragons, sometimes do. Dungeons & Dragons implementation of death would go on to influence early computer role- playing games, such as The Bard's Tale. Even within those games where death is possible, the frequency of permadeath varies greatly, based on the desires of the Gamemaster and the play group as a whole. Similarly, because of the freedom of the Gamemaster to modify rules, some Gamemasters choose to add it to games that normally lack it. Others may subtract it from games where it is normally present. For most games with character resurrection, characters typically pay a price to be restored. The price is often an in-game fee paid to a non-player character with magic or technology capable of restoring the character. The fee may be paid by the character in advance, or by other characters. In many games, the effort required to create a character is decidedly non-trivial, giving players a significant incentive to avoid permadeath. Unlike MMORPGs, new player characters can be created at a power level equivalent to the remaining party, to allow the new character to meaningfully contribute to a game in progress. Games of other genres, most notably early arcade-oriented, casual, platformers, and others (where the savegame functionality is usually not available) often feature a version of permadeath where the player is given a fixed (but sometimes replenishable) number of avatars (or \\"lives\\"). Following the loss of one avatar, the player usually loses progress through the current location; after the loss of the last available avatar, the player loses progress through the entire game (i.e., see the Game Over screen). Examples include Super Mario Bros., Digger, Pac-Man, and various Breakout clones. A unique variation of this was Square's 1986 fantasy shoot 'em up game King's Knight, which featured four characters, one per stage, where the player must keep them alive before they join to face the final boss. When a character dies prematurely, it is a permanent death, and the game shifts to the next character in their own stage.Gems In The Rough: Yesterday's Concepts Mined For Today, Gamasutra References Bibliography  * Schubert is game designer whose massive multi-player game credits include Lead Designer on Meridian 59, work on Ultima Online, Lead Designer for the sequel to Ultima Online. * * Category:Video game terminology ","title":"Permadeath"},{"id":"2377193","text":"Dovyalis hebecarpa, with common names Ceylon gooseberry, ketembilla, and kitambilla, is a plant in the genus Dovyalis, native to Sri Lanka and southern India.

In 1993 the album Roffer dan Ooit was released, and in response to the violent subject matter of the lyrics, one radio DJ accused the band of \\"playing ghetto\\": > Op deze CD staat bijvoorbeeld ook de Osdorp Posse, he. Een crew die in het > Nederlands, het Amsterdams rapt. En zij doen daarop onder andere het nummer > \\"Moordenaar!\\" Ja, ik denk dat dat niet echt bijdraagt aan het serieus nemen > van hip-hop want dat is toch een beetje ghetto'tje spelen. > This CD also contains, for example, the Osdorp Posse. A group that raps in > Dutch, actually the Amsterdam dialect. And they also perform the song > \\"Murderer!\\" Yes, I think that this does not contribute to taking hip-hop > seriously, because it is a bit like 'playing ghetto.' The same year a new album was released, Vlijmscherp, and on this album the group commented about their treatment in the Dutch media. In one of the songs from the album, \\"Ghetto'tje spelen\\" (\\"Playing ghetto\\"), the aforementioned radio DJ was dissed by Def P. Due to the explicit nature the group were banned all over the Dutch radio and both public and commercial radio stations refused to air music from Osdorp Posse. This did not imply the end of Osdorp Posse, but a dramatic change in style and in 1995 Afslag Osdorp was released, which was considered by many as their finest album in which social issues like prostitution, real love, domestic abuse and religion were covered. In 1996 the band played with death metal band Nembrionic which resulted in Briljant, Hard en Geslepen in which hip hop and metal were combined. In 1998 they started their own record label, Ramp Records. Osdorp Posse managed to get their first Top-10 hit in 2000 with the single \\"Origineel Amsterdams.\\" In 2008 the Osdorp Posse decided to prepare their last album and tour. The double CD called \\"2 Decennia\\" was released on November 13, 2008, and contains a disc with remixes of Osdorp Posse tracks and a best-of compilation disc with six new tracks, which were recorded at the LAB13 Media studio in Almere, The Netherlands. Their tour of Holland and Belgium in 2009 was their farewell. Post 2009 Def P is currently (2011) performing as the leader of Def P & Beatbusters, an outfit blending hip hop and ska; they had a minor hit in 2001, and released a second album, Hard op weg, in 2011. In 2011 Def-P released the third \\"onderhonden\\" album with fellow mc's Casto, Das and Jerome XL (together with Jerome XL he also forms the rap duo Digibombers ) Discography =Albums= * Osdorp Stijl (Osdorp Style) (1992) * Roffer dan Ooit (Rougher than Ever) (1992) * Vlijmscherp (Razor Sharp) (1993) * Afslag Osdorp (Exit Osdorp) (1995) * Briljant, Hard en Geslepen (Brilliant, Hard, and Sharpened) (1996) * Geendagsvlieg (None Day Fly) (1997) * Oud & Nieuw (Old and New) (1998) * Kernramp (Nuclear Disaster) (2000) * Tegenstrijd (Contradiction) (2003) * Hollandse Hardcore Hiphop Helden (Dutch Heroes of Hardcore Hiphop) (2005) * LAOS Projects (Laberinto & Osdorp Posse) (2007) * 2 Decennia (2008) (2 CD) =Singles= * \\"Hardcore Leeft\\" (March 1994) * \\"Ongeplugd\\" (December 1994) * \\"Origineel Amsterdams\\" (2000) * \\"Chemoderniseerd\\" featuring Blind Justice (2000) * \\"Ik Eerst/Jongens Uit De Industrie\\" (2003) * \\"Fok Jou!\\" (2003) References External links * Official site Category:Dutch hip hop groups Category:Sibling musical groups ","title":"Osdorp Posse"},{"id":"2377234","text":"Juliusz Machulski (born 10 March 1955 in Olsztyn)Juliusz Machulski at the Polish Internet Movie Database is a Polish film director and screenplay writer. Son of noted actor Jan Machulski, Juliusz became notable for his comedies ridiculing the life in communist-ruled Poland of the 1970s and 1980s.  Biography  Juliusz Machulski was born 10 March 1955 in Olsztyn, Poland, to parents, Jan Machulski and Halina Machulska. In 1973, he moved to Warsaw, where he was admitted to the Polish Philology faculty of the Warsaw University. However, in 1975 he moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he graduated from the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Film School. His film debut was Vabank (1981), a comedy describing a story of two Polish gangsters of the 1930s. The film was a striking success, as was the science-fiction comedy Seksmisja of 1984. Often seen as either a golden child or enfant terrible of the Polish cinema, Machulski quickly became one of the most popular Polish directors, both in Poland and abroad. His Seksmisja, although significantly shortened by the Soviet censorship, was one of the most popular pictures shown in the Soviet Union in mid-1980s. Kingsajz, a fantasy comedy made in 1987 remains one of his most important movies till date due to its great social significance. It is in many ways similar to Seksmisja but Kingsajz's message is stronger and more evident. It was also released at the time when anti-communistic society was very enthusiastic about pictures of that kind. Slogans from the film were appearing on many real walls, much to police's irritation. His ventures just after 1989 were still popular with the masses but none of them was critically acclaimed. His pictures of that time are often called \\"rude\\" in opposition to his earlier \\"intelligent\\" work. After his Matki, ≈ºony i kochanki, a television series many judged the end of director who failed to adapt to new environment. In 1997 he proved those opinions to be wrong when his Kiler became a huge hit and is now considered as cult movie along with its sequel, Kiler-√≥w 2-√≥ch. Both movies are crime comedies about a simple taxi driver taken by a police for a famous killer. Since 1988 Machulski served as the headperson of Zebra Film Studio, he also briefly appeared in a number of films as an actor. On December 10, 1998 he was honoured with his own star paved in the Piotrkowska Street in ≈Å√≥d≈∫.

Uses  Methacholine is primarily used to diagnose bronchial hyperreactivity, which is the hallmark of asthma and also occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is accomplished through the bronchial challenge test, or methacholine challenge, in which a subject inhales aerosolized methacholine, leading to bronchoconstriction. Other therapeutic uses are limited by its adverse cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia and hypotension, which arise from its function as a cholinomimetic.  Pharmacology  It is highly active at all of the muscarinic receptors, but has little effect on the nicotinic receptors. Methacholine has a charged quaternary amine structure, rendering it insoluble to lipid cell membranes. Clinically, this means that it will not cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and has poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is broken down at a relatively slow rate within the body, due to its relative resistance to acetylcholinesterases. Methacholine has a Œ≤-methyl group which provides selectivity towards muscarinic receptors as compared to nicotinic receptors. The quaternary ammonium group is essential for activity. The ester makes it susceptible to the enzyme acetylcholine esterase.  Contraindications  Use of methacholine is contraindicated in patients with recent heart attack or stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, known severe airway disease, or an aortic aneurysm. It may be used with caution by nursing or pregnant mothers and patients taking certain medications for myasthenia gravis.

Functional requirements may involve calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Behavioral requirements describe all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements, these are captured in use cases. Functional requirements are supported by non-functional requirements (also known as \\"quality requirements\\"), which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, security, or reliability). Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form \\"system must do ,\\" while non-functional requirements take the form \\"system shall be .\\" The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design, whereas non-functional requirements are detailed in the system architecture. As defined in requirements engineering, functional requirements specify particular results of a system. This should be contrasted with non- functional requirements, which specify overall characteristics such as cost and reliability. Functional requirements drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system. In some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of functional requirements. The hierarchy of functional requirements collection and change, broadly speaking, is: user/stakeholder request ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí use case ‚Üí incorporate. Stakeholders make a request; systems engineers attempt to discuss, observe, and understand the aspects of the requirement; use cases, entity relationship diagrams, and other models are built to validate the requirement; and, if documented and approved, the requirement is implemented/incorporated. Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more functional requirements. Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the functional requirements that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case. Process A typical functional requirement will contain a unique name and number, a brief summary, and a rationale. This information is used to help the reader understand why the requirement is needed, and to track the requirement through the development of the system. The crux of the requirement is the description of the required behavior, which must be clear and readable. The described behavior may come from organizational or business rules, or it may be discovered through elicitation sessions with users, stakeholders, and other experts within the organization. Many requirements may be uncovered during the use case development. When this happens, the requirements analyst may create a placeholder requirement with a name and summary, and research the details later, to be filled in when they are better known.

From the early 1950s until her death in 2018, she was one of Sweden's best known and popular singers. She represented Sweden in the 1961 Eurovision Song Contest in Cannes with the song \\"April, april\\". She was also well-known for the song \\"√Ñr du k√§r i mej √§nnu Klas-G√∂ran?\\" (\\"Are You Still In Love With Me, Klas-G√∂ran?\\"). Early life and career Lill-Babs was born Barbro Svensson in J√§rvs√∂, north of Stockholm. She lived with her parents, Ragnar and Britta Svensson, for nine years in a small cottage without running water. She first sang in a church at age 11. Her first public appearance was with a colleague of her father accompanying her on the accordion. Svensson's first public performance was at Barnens dag in J√§rvs√∂ 1953. Soon after, she started singing with Lasse Sch√∂nning's orchestra. She was \\"discovered\\" when she sang on the radio program Morgonkvisten (\\"Early Morning\\") in 1954. Simon Brehm, a musician and record producer, liked her and took her to Stockholm where she made her professional singing debut at the Bal Palais restaurant. Brehm was Svensson's manager until his death in 1967. He gave Svensson her stage name \\"Lill-Babs\\", a play on words as a connection to the older, and at that time better known, singer Alice Babs. She released her first music album in 1954, a grammophone record with two songs: \\"Min mammas boogie\\" (\\"My Mamma's Boogie\\") and \\"Svar till 'Ung och k√§r'\\" (\\"Answer to 'Young And In Love'\\"). Soon afterwards, finding herself pregnant, she returned to J√§rvs√∂ and gave birth to a daughter Monica. Lill- Babs and The Beatles as guest stars on Drop-In, 1963 Lill-Babs made her television debut in 1957 and her first folkpark show using her birth name in 1958. She visited every folkpark in Sweden during her long career In 1959, Lill-Babs performed Stikkan Anderson's song \\"√Ñr du k√§r i mej √§nnu Klas-G√∂ran?\\" (\\"Are You Still In Love With Me, Klas-G√∂ran?\\"); her recording of it became a major hit. She made her theater debut in 1958 in the play Fly mig en greve (\\"Fly Me a Count\\") at N√∂jeskatten theater.

She participated in Melodifestivalen three times in 1960, 1961 (her own two songs did not win) and in 1973 without winning. In 1969, she participated in the Norwegian Melodi Grand Prix without winning. Soon after Eurovision, she launched a career in West Germany, where she acted in several films. She also released two English-language solo singles for the United States market. Lill-Babs met The Beatles in 1963 when she was the main guest star on the teen music show Drop-In broadcast on Sveriges Television (SVT). The then-unknown band asked for her autograph. Lill-Babs performed several shows in bars at Berns in Stockholm, Tr√§dg√•r'n in Gothenburg and Kronprinsen in Malm√∂. Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA wrote and produced her 1971 hit song \\"Welcome to the World\\". The four future members of ABBA sang on it. Also in the 1970s she played in a Kar de Mumma revue at Folkan, and played Annie Oakley in the musical Annie Get Your Gun at Scandinavium arena in Gothenburg. Television Lill-Babs was the main guest on H√§r √§r ditt liv (\\"Here's Your Life\\") on 26 December 1983 when the host Lasse Holmqvist surprised her in the studio with a long line of ex-boyfriends.

In 2017 and 2018, she acted as a lesbian character Gugge in two seasons of the SVT series Bonusfamiljen; the series' script had to be changed following her death. A two-part documentary was broadcast on TV4 in 2017 called Lill-Babs, Leva livet (\\"Lill-Babs, Live Life\\"), which presented her life and career. Death and tributes Lill-Babs died on 3 April 2018 after suffering from cancer and heart failure. On the day of her death, both SVT and TV4 changed their programming so that programs about Lill-Babs could air.

Due to the differing role of women in past society, special rules grew relating to the blazoning of arms for women. The rules for women and heraldry developed differently from place to place and there is no one single rule that applies everywhere. In general, arms of women were most likely depicted not on shields but on lozenges or ovals. Different rules exist that depend on the woman's marital status and a married woman would also often make use of her husband's arms in addition to those from her family. In both the English and the Scottish systems of heraldry these differences remain active. Characteristics =Escutcheons, crests, and other heraldic elements= Heraldry has its origins from associations with warfare and the age of chivalry. The traditional shield was also associated with war and so women did not usually display familial arms on escutcheons. Rather, they could display these on various other shapes: more commonly the lozenge, an oval, or a cartouche. The crest‚Äìa device that sits atop the shield on an armorial achievement‚Äìlikewise was not accorded to heraldic devices of women as these had associations with warfare. =Transmission= In many heraldic traditions, arms generally are passed patrilineally. In other nations, in Canadian heraldry for example, women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of sex. By tradition =British Heraldry= The coat of arms of Baroness Thatcher: in some heraldic traditions, the arms of women are displayed in a lozenge, as opposed to a shield. In English, Scottish and Northern Irish heraldry, a woman may bear arms by inheritance from her father or by grant to herself. When unmarried, she displays her arms on a lozenge (a diamond shape) or on an oval or oval-like shape. Traditionally, a woman does not display her arms on a shield, as the shield originated with knights and warfare, and is thus viewed as fitting for a man, but not a woman. The arms of the Duchess of Cambridge (right) impaled with those of her husband, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (left) When married, a woman has the option of uniting her arms with those of her husband in what are called marital arms; their arms are impaled, meaning they are placed side by side in the same shield, with those of the man on the dexter (left, as seen from the front) and those of his wife on the sinister (right, as seen from the front). If one spouse belongs to the higher ranks of an order of chivalry, and is thereby entitled to surround his or her arms with a circlet of the order, it is usual to depict them on two separate shields tilted towards one another, this is termed \\"accoll√©\\". Coat of Arms of Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester who is a heraldic heiress. Depicting her father's arms imposed over those of Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, her husband. A married woman may also bear either her own arms or her husband's arms alone on a shield with the shield charged with a small lozenge to distinguish her from her husband. A widowed woman usually displays the impaled arms on a lozenge-shaped shield, unless she is a heraldic heiress (see below). Heraldic Heiresses If the woman is an heraldic heiress, her arms are shown on an inescutcheon of pretence, which is a small shield in the centre of her husband's arms. When widowed, instead of showing the impaled arms on a lozenge, she continues to use her marital arms, but placed on a lozenge or oval. In England and Northern Ireland, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.Friar 1993, p. 181. In Scotland however, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.Burnett 1997, p. 46. =Canadian Heraldry= In Canadian heraldry, women and men are treated equally for heraldic purpose, reflecting Canadian equality laws. It is therefore common to display the arms of women on shields, rather than on a lozenge or oval, but a woman may still choose to have her arms displayed on a traditional shape. In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the thirteenth century; this is now normally done by the system of marks or brisures set up by the early Tudor herald John Writhe. Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used; in any case, when the heir succeeds (in Canada, the first child, whether male or female, according to strict primogeniture), the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms.

Biography He was the son of Anna van der Meij and Christiaan Hartsoeker (1626‚Äì1683), a Remonstrant minister in Moordrecht near Gouda. His father took the family to Alkmaar in 1661 and finally to Rotterdam in 1669. Nicolaas started to make a living as a lens maker in Rotterdam, and was instructed in optics by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In 1674, he and a fellow student, assisted by Van Leeuwenhoek, were the first to observe semen, a situation that would later lead to a priority dispute between Hartsoeker and Leeuwenhoek over the discovery of spermatozoids. In 1677, Hartsoeker met Christiaan Huygens and initiated him in the making of lenses. In June 1678, Hartsoeker accompanied, in the role of an assistant, Huygens on a trip to Paris, where they made a great impression with their microscopes. However, Huygens failed to mention Hartsoeker even once in a subsequent publication in France, leading to a fall- out between the two. Hartsoeker returned to Rotterdam, where his parents still lived and where he married Elisabeth Vettekeucken in October 1680. His business as an instrument maker and wine merchant failed and, after the death of his father in August 1683, he moved his family in 1684 to Paris, where he made instruments for the Paris observatory and the academy. Hartsoeker also came up with contrivances for aiming very large aerial telescopes originally popularized by Huygens. He remained there until 1698. Illustration of homunculi in sperm, drawn by Hartsoeker in 1695. It is often said that in 1694, while observing human sperm through a microscope, Hartsoeker believed that he saw tiny men inside the sperm, which he called homunculi or animalcules. However, he only postulated their existence as part of his Spermist theory of conception and never claimed to have seen them. The 1694 \\"Essay on dioptrics\\", in which this hypothesis appears, was a highly lauded book, in fact tackling several misconceptions of the time. For example, Hartsoeker disavows the contemporary position (e.g. of Robert Hooke) that with refractor telescopes one soon would be able to see man-sized creatures on the moon, if any in fact existed. At the end of the century, Hartsoeker had become quite famous. In 1699 he was elected member of the French Academy of Sciences and in 1704 of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, in both cases as one of the first foreign members. Czar Peter met him in Amsterdam and offered him the chair of mathematics in St Petersburg. Hartsoeker did not accept, but the czar did finance an observatory for him in Amsterdam. Later, in 1704, Hartsoeker accepted the offer of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine to become \\"first mathematician and honorary professor of philosophy\\" at the University of Heidelberg. The last years of his life were spent in Utrecht.

From 1957 until 2002, he published both fiction and non-fiction texts which include novels, poems, essays, a biography, and manuscripts for cartoons and animated films.  Biography  Jensen was born in Trondheim. He first made his debut as a novelist in Oslo in 1955 with the novel Dyretemmerens kors, but he later burned the remaining unsold books. In 1958 he and his then girlfriend, later wife, Marianne Ihlen, lived on the Greek island of Hydra, where Jensen developed a friendship with the Canadian musician and poet Leonard Cohen. After Jensen left Ihlen and their son, Axel Jr., Cohen and Marianne lived together on Hydra for a couple of years and later moved to Montreal. There is widespread belief that the character Lorenzo in the novel Joacim (1961) is modeled after Cohen, but Jensen also told Cohen that Lorenzo was modeled after the Swedish novelist G√∂ran Tunstr√∂m. After some time, Jensen returned to Norway and settled in Fredrikstad. There, Noel Cobb, an English poet and student of psychology, came to interview him. Cobb became sexually involved with Jensen's girlfriend Lena. Jensen then left Fredrikstad to live in London. Jensen suffered from severe depression after the break-up with Lena, but in London, he met the psychiatrist R. D. Laing and received therapy from him. After recovering, Jensen worked as an assistant at the institution Kingsley Hall. Laing remained a close friend for the rest of his life. While attending an environmental conference in Stockholm in 1972, Jensen met Pratibha, whom he married in India. After returning to Sweden, the couple lived in Vaxholm, outside Stockholm, where they bought an old freighter, built in 1905, which they renamed S/Y Shanti Devi. The ship was named after Pratibha's mother and means \\"The Goddess of Peace\\". After restoring the ship with the help of good friends and its former crew, they finally set course for England in 1984. Unfortunately, due to a storm at sea, they were forced to seek harbor in Oslo after a short, hazardous journey. When Jensen arrived in Oslo, he met his old friend, the writer Olav Angell. Together, they wanted to transform Oslo into a city renowned for happenings on the scene of international literature. The plan was soon put into action, and Jensen became the front figure in a project which later developed into the Oslo International Poetry Festival (OIPF), occurring in 1985 and 1986. On 10 August 1990, Shanti Devi set course for what would be its final destination in √Ölefj√¶r, outside Kristiansand. There, Jensen and Pratibha settled in a hundred-year-old schoolhouse and, some years later, they sold their old ship. In the last ten years of his life, Jensen was severely disabled from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He gradually became paralyzed, losing all his motor-coordination abilities. Later, relying on a breathing-aid to breathe, he could neither write nor speak. During this period, he also led a tough campaign against what he termed \\"the health machinery\\" for the right to be nursed in his own home. Jensen wrote several essays and articles on this subject. Before the public health service provided the help he needed, private funding to pay for nursing was arranged by his close friends, including Leonard Cohen. His wife also used all of her available energy to nurse her husband until he drew his last breath in his home in √Ölefj√¶r. In 1996, he received the Fritt Ord Honorary Award.  Writing style  Apart from his first symbolistic novel, Dyretemmerens Kors, Jensen's early novels mostly depict young men that attempt to break away from their social and cultural backgrounds. These novels include Icarus: A Young Man in Sahara (1957) (a new 1999 edition is illustrated by Frans Widerberg), A Girl I Knew (1959), and Joacim (1961). Some critics have argued that these early novels are influenced by Beat authors like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs. The reason for this is that the novel's male main characters often try to escape from their obligations in a Western capitalistic society. Instead, they try to replace their former life with some sort of undefined spiritualism and fail miserably in their attempt. Later, Jensen departed from the realism in his early novels and began to move in a new direction by writing science fiction, poems, essays, and manuscripts for cartoons. In this experimental phase, he produced manuscripts for the psychedelic comic-strip Doctor Fantastic (published in the newspaper Dagbladet between March and July 1972), the science fiction comic strip collage Tago (1979), the animated movie Superfreak (1988), and a manuscript for a comic novel which is a caricature-rendering of the life of the French playwright and founder of pataphysics, Alfred Jarry. In the same period, Jensen also published a poem-collection with a hindu theme called Onalila ‚Äì A Little East West poetry (1974), an essayistic novel called Mother India (1974), and three autobiographical novels named Junior (1978), Senior (1979), and Jumbo (1998). Jensen is perhaps most famous for having written the science fiction novels Epp (1965), Lul (1992), and And the Rest is Written in the Stars (1995), illustrated by Pushwagner. With these novels, Jensen created a dystopian vision of the future, much in the tradition of Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury. Nevertheless, Jensen's novels also differ from these authors since the tragic vision in his novels is supplemented with comedy, setting an ambiguous and absurd tone. In this way, Jensen's novels are similar to the satirical and parodic novels of Jonathan Swift and Kurt Vonnegut. Besides his fiction, Jensen also published a series of articles and essays which focused on three main political and social issues. His collection of essays, God Does Not Read Novels. A Voyage in the World of Salman Rushdie (1994), is a critique of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie and a defense of freedom of speech. Another political text is the article A Children's Disease, published in the anthology The Collective Fairytale. A Book about Norway, Europe and the EU (1994). This article discusses Norway's role as a future member in the European Union. The third main issue that was of great concern to him was how sick and disabled people are treated in a modern bureaucratic society. Two books containing articles on this subject was therefore published ‚Äì The Deafening Silence (1997) and The Patient in the Centre (1998). All the articles are an account of how it is to suffer from ALS and at the same time not receive adequate help from the Norwegian welfare state. Among his political writings, Jensen also found the time to write a biography on G. I. Gurdjieff, titled Guru ‚Äì Glimpses from the World of Gurdijieff (2002). In addition to this, Jensen co-wrote his autobiography, Life Seen From Nimbus (2002), with Peter M√¶jlender. Jensen received a literary prize from the Austrian Abraham Woursell Foundation in 1965 for his novel Epp. In 1992, Jensen was given the annual literary award from the Norwegian publishing house Cappelen for his novel Lul. For his essays on Salman Rushdie, he received the Carl von Ossietzky award from the International PEN club in 1994 and an award from The Freedom of Expression Foundation in Norway.

Whether e.g. Kaarina should be included is unclear. Historically also the inland was included. The sub-region consists of the majority Finland-Swedish former municipalities of Dragsfj√§rd, Houtsk√§r, Ini√∂, Kimito, Korpo, Nagu, Pargas, and V√§stanfj√§rd, all of which are located in the archipelago around the city of Turku (√Öbo in Swedish), in the Archipelago Sea. The sub-region has a population of 22,774 (2004), of which 63.6% are Swedish-speakers. It is one of the major concentrations of Swedish- speakers in the country, together with coastal Ostrobothnia, southern Nylandia, and the √Öland Islands. The only city in the sub-region was Pargas, which accounts for more than a half of its population. There are over 20,000 islands in the area, mostly sparsely inhabited, and many people from around Turku and Helsinki have summer residences there. Politically the sub-region, like other areas in Finland with a Swedish-speaking majority, is largely ruled by the Swedish People's Party (SFP) which received 57 per cent of the vote in the last municipal elections in 2004. The archipelago municipalities were merged to form the two new municipalities V√§st√•boland and Kimito√∂n on January 1, 2009.

Although each ride may have a different name, all share the same premise of vehicles traveling through space by spinning around a central monument. As each form of the attraction appeared, new designs and locations have been implemented to fit with changing schemes of several Tomorrowlands. History =Disneyland= In 1956, the first rocket-spinner attraction opened at Disneyland and was known as the Astro Jets. The attraction was made by Klaus Company Bavaria and similar to several versions found in traveling carnivals. The \\"jets\\" made a 50-foot circle around a large red-checkered rocket and guests were able climb upwards of 36 feet in their ride vehicles from the ground level they were boarded at. The attraction stood between the Submarine Voyage and Rocket to the Moon. The name Astro Jets was changed in 1964 when United Airlines, as a new park sponsor (sponsoring \\"The Enchanted Tiki Room\\"), contended the name was free advertising for American Airlines' coast-to-coast Astrojet service. After this dispute, the name was changed to Tomorrowland Jets. The name lasted until September 1966, when the attraction was closed to make room for the new renovated Tomorrowland. The attraction returned in August 1967 as the Rocket Jets. This version was located on top of the new PeopleMover platform, and was accessible from ground level via an elevator. The focal point of this version was its replica Saturn V/NASA-themed rocket in the center. This version remained open until 1997, when it closed for renovations with the rest of Tomorrowland. The new form of the attraction opened one year later as Astro Orbitor at Disneyland. The new version is a replica of the Orbitron, Machines Volantes at Disneyland Paris. The Astro Orbitor at Disneyland was planned to be placed where the Rocket Jets were, but weighed too much for the current building. Instead, it was relocated to the entrance of Tomorrowland, and placed on ground level, thus making the ride the new focal point as guests step from the main plaza of Disneyland into Tomorrowland. One concept drawing had guests boarding the attraction underground and others had the center of the attraction featuring a water moat (similar to the \\"Dumbo the Flying Elephant\\" attraction in Fantasyland). Neither ideas were ever carried out. The mechanism for Rocket Jets on top of the PeopleMover was re-used as a kinetic satellite-themed sculpture known as the Observatron, built from the same skeletal structure. The Observatron was originally planned to come to life every fifteen minutes and appear to summon signs from the skies, while a selected soundtrack (such as selected music pieces from Space Mountain and Le Visionarium at Disneyland Paris) would play over Tomorrowland. However, the mechanism has been prone to failure and occasionally will be inactive for periods of months or only play sporadically on certain days. It is unknown if the Observatron still functions. In April 2009, the Astro Orbitor at Disneyland closed for refurbishment and was stripped down to its skeletal structure.http://www.mousetimes.com/forums/showthread.php?p=388350#post388350 It reopened in June 2009 with a silver, blue, red, and gold trim color scheme. =Magic Kingdom= Astro Orbiter at Magic Kingdom No form of the attraction existed in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World until 1974, three years after the park's opening, when Tomorrowland underwent a massive expansion including the creation of Space Mountain, a new location for the Disneyland- attraction, Carousel of Progress, and the WEDWay PeopleMover. The Star Jets were considered the focal point of Tomorrowland due to its soaring, spinning rockets and central location. This version of the attraction was based on the Disneyland version, in both location (on top of the PeopleMover platform) and in style (both feature a large Saturn V rocket as the centerpiece). However the attraction vehicles were different from any other previous form as they were much larger and featured a flatter back-end and larger tail fins. While Disneyland's Rocket Jets resembled actual rockets, the Magic Kingdom's Star Jets appeared more like space shuttles. Each of the 12 open-air vehicles was attached to the central axis by a 20-foot arm. The vehicles held up to two passengers who circled round and round, 60 feet above the ground, while controlling their ascent and descent with a metal control stick. On January 10, 1994, the original Star Jets closed in order to undergo a complete makeover as part of the New Tomorrowland. The attraction was re-designed and re-opened on April 30, 1994, as the Astro Orbiter, part of the complete renovation of the park's Tomorrowland section. The attraction featured a highly stylized iron-work tower in lieu of the center rocket along with various planets on the outside of the attraction as to appear as if the rockets were weaving between the planets. The ride at the Magic Kingdom does 11 rotations per minute and averages 1.2 million miles a year. In the 1994-2009 narration for the Tomorrowland Transit Authority, the ride was referenced as the \\"League of Planets Astro Orbiter.\\" =Tokyo Disneyland= Star Jets at Tokyo Disneyland before it was removed in 2017 The version prepared for Tokyo Disneyland debuted with the park in April 1983, sharing its name (\\"Star Jets\\") and design with the first Magic Kingdom version. Even though the park does not have a PeopleMover attraction, designers nonetheless placed their attraction atop an elevated platform similar to that at Florida's Magic Kingdom. This attraction closed on October 10, 2017. =Disneyland Park (Paris)= The opening of Euro Disneyland in April 1992 marked a significant change in the design of Tomorrowland. Known as Discoveryland, the land took on a retro-science-fiction style inspired by some of Europe's greatest writers, such as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. As such, Orbitron's central axis resembles a bronze 19th century rotating planetarium instead of a rocket. This design was exported to the Disneyland Resort in California when Tomorrowland was renovated in 1998. This was also the first version of the attraction to be installed at ground level instead of atop an elevated platform. =Hong Kong Disneyland= Like the other international Disneyland parks, Hong Kong Disneyland opened in September 2005 with its own version, known as the Orbitron, a modified version of the Parisian one. In order to improve the attraction's capacity, the rockets became \\"flying saucers\\" and were made large enough to accommodate an average of four riders per saucer, in two rows of two riders. =Shanghai Disneyland= It is known as Jet Packs at Shanghai Disneyland. It opened on the same day as Shanghai Disneyland opened, June 16, 2016.

Currently the monastery is located in Kholmogorsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia, inside the nature protected area, Siya Zakaznik. The monastery takes its name from the Siya River, a tributary of the Northern Dvina. This river route allowed the monks to travel to the Solovetsky Monastery and other centres of spiritual life. There was also a station on the trade route connecting Archangel (the main sea port of Muscovy) and the Russian capital of Moscow. Following the saint's death in 1556, the monastery grew on the salt trade with Western Europe and developed into one of the foremost centres of Christianity in the Russian North. Ivan the Terrible and his son Feodor granted it important privileges and much land. By 1579, the monastery owned 50 versts of ploughlands stretching towards Kargopol. In 1599, Boris Godunov exiled his political opponent Feodor Romanov to this remote monastery. While many of his relatives were starved to death in other cloisters, Feodor took monastic vows and the name Philaret and was eventually raised to the dignity of hegumen (abbot) of the monastery. Later he became the Patriarch of Moscow, and his son Mikhail established the Romanov dynasty of Russian tsars. In the 17th century, the monastery continued to prosper. The large katholikon was constructed over the years 1587‚Äì1608. The tent-like church and refectory were completed by 1644, and the belfry was added in 1652. The monastic library was one of the richest in Russia and included such books as the Siysky Gospel from 1339 and the 16th-century album of 500 Western religious etchings adapted to Eastern Orthodox canonical requirements. Its treasury was famed for its collection of medieval jewelry. In 1764, the monastery owned more than 3,300 male peasants. In 1923, the monastery was disbanded. Both library and treasury were taken to Moscow or Arkhangelsk. The medieval buildings were used as a sanatorium and a kolkhoz. The monks were readmitted to the grounds in 1992 and immediately began emergency repair works.

History  Vestas traces its roots to 1898 when Hand Smith Hansen bought a blacksmith shop in , West Jutland, that operated as a family business. After the second world war Vestas was founded in 1945 by his son Peder Hansen as \\"Vestjysk St√•lteknik A/S\\" (West-Jutlandish steel technology). The company initially manufactured household appliances, moving its focus to agricultural equipment in 1950, intercoolers in 1956, and hydraulic cranes in 1968. It entered the wind turbine industry in 1979 and produced wind turbines exclusively from 1989. In 1997, the company placed in production the NTK 1500/60. The product was designed by Timothy Jacob Jensen and received the German IF Award and the Red Dot Award. The company's North American headquarters was relocated in 2002 from Palm Springs, California to Portland, Oregon.

At that time, Vestas employed about 400 in Portland and committed to add at least 100 more employees there within five years; the new building will have space for up to 600 workers. The company moved its Portland offices to the new headquarters building, a renovated historic building, in May 2012. In February 2009, the company announced the production of two new turbine types, the 3-megawatt V112 and 1.8-megawatt V100. The new models were to be available in 2010. In July 2009, Vestas announced its manufacturing operations on the Isle of Wight in England would close due to a lack of UK demand, affecting 525 jobs there and 100 in Southampton. Approximately 25 workers at the wind turbine factory on the island occupied the administration offices in protest on 20 July 2009, demanding nationalisation to save their jobs. In August 2009 Vestas hired more than 5,000 extra workers for its new factories in China, the United States, and Spain.

He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1964. Until recently, Berlin was Graham Perdue Professor of Anthropology at the University of Georgia, where he was also director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and co-director for the Laboratories of Ethnobiology. His work alongside Paul Kay on the 1969 publication of Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution built on the ideas of Lazarus Geiger in the field of color terminology research and has been highly influential in anthropology, linguistics and cognitive sciences. Berlin and Kay concluded that the number of basic color terms in the world's languages are limited and center on certain focal colors, assumed to be cognitively hardwired. He led the Maya ICGB project, a bioprospecting consortium, supported by the Biodiversity Program for the National Institutes of Health, which was closed in 2001 after accusations of failure to obtain adequate informed consent from the Maya community from which he obtained indigenous knowledge. These allegations were primarily driven by a Canadian- based political activist organization, known at the time as RAFI. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981. Works in ethnobiology Berlin is well known in the field of ethnobiology, or the study of how people name, use, and organize the names and the knowledge about the plants and animals around them. He also further focused on Folk biology, a sub field of ethnobiology, which refers to the biological classification and reasoning particular to a cultural group. Understanding societies‚Äô interactions with their environment is vital to understanding the culture of the people. Berlin‚Äôs contribution to the evolution of ethnobiology as a field has been invaluable to many anthropologists. Considering \\"a series of landmark publications concerning ethnobiological classification, Berlin has remained a prime architect of the descriptive and analytic frameworks now widely regarded as standard and major theory.\\"(1994)Hays, T. (1994). Book Reviews. Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 4(1), 74-75. =Covert Categories and Folk Taxonomies (1968)= In 1968, Berlin, Breedlove and Raven studied the botanical ethnography of the Tzeltal Maya people of Chiapas, Mexico. They published an article titled Covert Categories and Folk Taxonomy.Berlin, B., Breedlove, D., & Raven, P. (1968). Covert Categories and Folk Taxonomies. American Anthropologist, 70(2), 290-299. They found a way to determine, with a high degree of reliability, the major outlines of the named taxonomic structure of the plant world for Tzeltal speakers. Tzeltal is one of the Mayan languages spoken in Mexico, in which most linguists distinguish six different regional dialects. In this study, they found many cultural and meaningful categories related by inclusion that are not conventionally labeled. In their language, the different plants in each category all have a common word structure that puts them apart from all of the other plants. They found that you cannot trace the words back to a single source where all plant names are included. In most languages, they have a \\"unique beginner\\" that you can trace the names back to. What Berlin and his colleagues found is that plants and animals are thought of as two separate unnamed classes. In plant taxonomy, the highest level is not a \\"unique beginner\\" but is instead represented by four major lexemes or units. These four levels are trees, vines, grasses, and herbs. There are more minor classes that include cacti, agaves, bamboos, etc. There are also very few midlevel plant categories. All of the Tzeltal specific taxa (those that which include no other members) fall into the different major and minor sublevels in their taxonomy. But, it is odd to note that the midlevel category hihte, or \\"oak\\", contains the plants sikyok and cikinib which neither share the same linguistic structure with their \\"parent plant.\\" To test the hypothesis they first went through the community, observed, and recorded information from their informants comments of the plants in their natural habitats. When they went out into the field to collect data, they noticed that some of 10,000 specimens that were located in the same named contrast set were closely related than others. They take into account the uses of the certain plants including food, herbs, firewood and so on. A second method that was used helped with searching for possible subgroupings within contrast sets of large numbers was to determine the extent to which informants subdivided lists of plant names. To do this, they wrote the names of different names of plants and animals on slips of papers and then gave them to their informants. After doing this, the informants then put the slips of papers into groups that were most like each other. The results showed that they had no trouble placing them in the different categories of \\"plants\\" and \\"animals.\\" This also showed that though they did not have a word for it they did know of the existence of \\"plants.\\" After this, they broke down the taxonomy even further by giving them different \\"plant\\" names and asking them the same question, as before they had no problem labeling each plant into the different groups or categories. After they established that they understood the existence of subgroupings, they used three different procedures to find out how they define the features of certain plants. The first procedure was called the triads test in which the informants chose which item out of a group of three was the most different. The results indicated how they group things together based upon similarity. The second procedure involved constructing folk keys. The keys are used to help distinguish the different plants from the other based upon the traits. They then used these to get a better understanding of why certain plants were put in certain places in their taxonomy. First they would give the informants the names of plants that they had earlier grouped together (when the researchers gave them the slips of papers with names on them), then they were asked to create a key that would help distinguish each plant from each other. In doing this, the informants showed how they make their divisions between plants and decide which group to put them in. Finally, they conducted a study consisting of paired comparisons of all the items in a particular set of plant names. The informants were asked to compare all the logical pairs in different sets and make logical comparisons and differences amongst them. Characteristics such as stem growth, size and shape of the stem and leaves, and fruit size and shape were all utilized when making the comparisons. This showed Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven what the \\"definitions\\" were for a set of terms and they were then able to bring together the like terms that were the most similar according to the informant in question. This study showed what the Tzeltal people deem as the most important features to them when they decide to on certain plants to take care of and plant for their very immediate survival. This results from this study shows that things that do not have names for the Tzeltal speakers still exist in their eyes. The hierarchies generated by their studies are not arbitrarily spaced, which therefore clearly implies a taxonomic structure. The plants still have a part in their lives and they still identify with them even though they may not have a name. The process of having a given a name to certain life forms in their ecology shows just how much these people are attached to their surroundings. It also shows what to them is considered a life form and what is not. The study proves that we should not take shallow taxonomic hierarchies for granted and should have further studies concerning them to show that the different languages go deeper than we actually let on to them. The study helps outline three great studies that others can use to set up their own studies. It can help researchers understand why sometimes it is hard to identify where the midlevel on a taxonomy hierarchy is or even if it exists at all in a certain community. =General Principles of Classification and Nomenclature in Folk Biology (1973)= One of the first works Berlin published in relation to the budding field of ethnobiology was also one of his more influential: General Principles of Classification and Nomenclature in Folk Biology (1973)Berlin, B., Breedlove, D., & Raven, P. (1973). General Principles of Classification and Nomenclature in Folk Biology. American Anthropologist 75(1), 214 - 242. was coauthored with Dennis Breedlove of the California Academy of Sciences and Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden. In this journal article, Berlin and team intended to illustrate three hypotheses they felt were properly supported by the data they had acquired during the research they completed. First, it is possible to isolate organisms into linguistically recognized groups called taxa, or classes. Second, these taxa can be further broken down into no more than five smaller classes called taxonomic ethnobiological categories. These smaller categories are defined in terms of certain criteria, such as having certain linguistic or taxonomic feature that are recognizable. They continued to describe how these organisms, flora or fauna, belonging to each of these categories can be arranged into a complex taxonomic hierarchy. The five ethnobiological categories are as follows: unique beginner, life form, generic, specific, and varietal. Most, if not all organisms can be placed taxonomically into these categories. They turned their attentions to the formal linguistic structure of the lexemic nomenclature of the plants and animals and to which taxa each of these organisms belong to. After laying out the criteria and division of the taxa and lexemes, they used the information to discuss the Tzeltal and how they have a nomenclature system incredibly similar to that of Western botany‚Äôs division of plants. The data they had obtained studying the Tzeltal and the lexemic system used to name plants was found to conform, with only a few exceptions, to the hypotheses Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven had laid out. Finally, they attempt to show how the principles demonstrated by the research suggest they can be applied to many ethnobiological classification systems since they are general. \\"While data on some aspects of ethnobotany and ethnozoology, especially the uses of plants and animals, are available from a wide variety of sources, good materials on the classificatory principles underlying folk biological taxonomy and nomenclature in non-Western societies are sadly lacking (1973). Berlin, Breedlove and Raven began to encourage and emphasize the importance in gaining ethnobiological information regarding nomenclature and utilizing the principles they laid out to increase our knowledge of potentially general cognitive categorizing, the people who use these taxonomic systems, and how these systems can influence our view of the environment around us. In a following article published in the American Ethnologist (1976),Berlin, B. (1976). The concept of rank in ethnobiological classification: some evidence from Aguaruna folk botany. American Ethnologist, 3(3), 381-399. Berlin attempted to address some criticisms he had encountered regarding the ethnobiological concept of category, hereafter also referred to as rank, by applying some of his previous principles to new information on biological classification of the Aguaruna. Some claim the boundaries to determine ranks are arbitrary or that there is no validity to the rank concept. The conclusion of the report stated, \\"[‚Ä¶] the vast majority of conceptually recognized plant classes in Aguaruna are easily accommodated into one of the proposed ranks in a natural and straightforward fashion. These data suggest that ranks are neither arbitrary nor a mere typological cataloging device invented for the convenience of the ethnographer. On the contrary, the Aguaruna‚Äôs view of the plant world provides additional support for the hypothesis that the concept of rank is fundamental to all systems of folk biological classification\\" (1976). =Ethnobiological Classification (1992)= One of Berlin‚Äôs most well known contributions to ethnobiology is his 1992 book, Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies.Berlin, B. (1992). Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies. Princeton: Princeton University Press. In this book, Berlin analyzes the widespread commonalities in classification and naming purposes of the local flora and fauna among traditional, non-literate societies. It helps develop and reaffirm the \\"universalist\\" approach to ethnobiology. He explains the \\"basic principles\\" that he feels form the groundwork for a comparative ethnobiology. He also talks about the three main levels of classification; generic, specific, and higher-order. He wants to stress the importance of prototypes and the fact that \\"perceptual motivation\\" underpins not only genera, but also intermediate and life form categories, although he points out that he understands that the life form categories does not neatly reflect biological taxa. In another part of the book, he explores the patterned variations in ethnobiological knowledge. He brings up an interesting suggestion that ethnobiological nomenclature is not necessarily arbitrary, but often reflects some aspect of the inherent quality of the organism. \\"Brent Berlin maintains that these patterns can best be explained by the similarity of human beings' largely unconscious appreciation of the natural affinities among groupings of plants and animals: people recognize and name a grouping of organisms quite independently of its actual or potential usefulness or symbolic significance in human society\\" (2009). This implies that the ability and want to categorize is nearly innate in humans. This claim challenged some anthropologists‚Äô beliefs that one‚Äôs sense of reality is determined by culture; that the subjective and unique view one has of their surroundings is controlled little by the world around the individual. He argues throughout the book against his colleagues that only natural species that have \\"evident utility for man have been named.\\" He constantly argues against a neo-malinowskian functionalism. He makes humans out to seem as simply contemplative materialists unknowingly seeking out only the things that will ensure our happiness and survival and leaving everything else to be on its own for its own survival. He also focused on the structure of ethnobiological classification based on individual nomenclature systems he has researched or seen at work firsthand. He addressed the processes at work to affect the evolution of ethnobiology and the systems involved. Berlin has received a lot of praise on this book. In reference to the book, Terence Hays says, \\"Here, Berlin deals straightforwardly and systematically with his major critics, acknowledging that ‚Äòthe patterns recognized nearly two decades ago must now be restated in light of new evidence and new theoretical insights that have emerged since that time‚Äô\\" (1994:3). =Medical Ethnobiology of the Highland Maya (1996)= Some of Berlin‚Äôs more recent work is focused on medical ethnobiology and modern Mayan populations. In 1996, in collaboration with his wife, Elois Ann Berlin, he published a book entitled Medical Ethnobiology of the Highland Maya of Chiapas, Mexico: The Gastrointestinal Diseases.(1996)Berlin, B., & Berlin, E. (1996). Medical Ethnobiology of the Highland Maya of Chiapas, Mexico: the Gastrointestinal Diseases. Princeton: Princeton University Press. In this work, Berlin and Berlin focus on two specific Maya speaking groups, the Tzeltal and the Tzotzil. As opposed to focusing on the standard ritual and symbolism approach to understanding the medicinal properties of Mayan healing, the book‚Äôs focus is on the ethnobotanical approach. The Tzeltal/Tzotzil have a wealth of knowledge regarding symptomatic diseases and the medicinal herbs that alleviate the symptoms associated with these diseases. Some of the most devastating diseases that affect these people are gastrointestinal diseases. Berlin and Berlin outline the symptomology, treatment, ingredients of the herbs administered, and even the classification of these diseases. Over the time that they researched, they began to realize that the administration of these herbs were condition specific were extremely effective if the condition was known to those treating. In 2008, Brent Berlin and Elois Ann Berlin were recognized by the Society for Economic Botany. They received the Distinguished Economic Botanist Award. \\"‚ÄòThe work of Brent Berlin and Elois Ann Berlin over the last four decades has led to major theoretical advances in cognitive and medical Ethnobiology,‚Äô said Rick Stepp, a member of the council of the Society for Economic Botany.\\"(2008)Williams, P. L. (2008, February 28). Public Affairs, News Bureau. Retrieved March 26, 2010, from University of Georgia: http://www.uga.edu/news/artman/publish/printer_080228_Berlins.shtml Brent Berlin has generated information and new techniques of analyzing data that has influenced many well established members of the field and up and coming students who strive to be an asset to the social sciences. Works on color In the book, Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution (1969),Berlin, B, & Kay, P. (1969). Basic color terms: their universality and evolution. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press. a collaboration between Berlin and Paul Kay, they used around 100 different languages to see how many basic color terms for each language are universal. The data they present states that there are around 11 universal basic color terms for languages in which there are always terms for white and black present in all languages. They depicted a set of stages which state that if there are 3 color terms presented, this is attributed to include red, also. There are several more steps in which other colors are then added until there are languages with 8 or more basic color terms. In one experiment, they used painted chips with several different color hues and told the speakers in their native language to point out the basic color in the focal point and the outer hues they also connect it to. This helped them gauge what difference in hues of colors people from different languages appropriated with each basic color term. Because of the fact that there are many different names for colors in each society, the data helped note what the basic terms for simple colors were and how many different hues they connected to those basic colors. Berlin also studied the classifications of color for the Aguaruna people of north-central Peru. In this research, he found out that a majority of these people match up with the stage three color views from the 1969 work, in which the Aguaruna have names for black, white, red, and a color they call grue. In his article, Aguaruna Color Categories (1975),Berlin, B, & Berlin, E.A. (1975). Aguaruna Color Categories. American Ethnologist, 2(1), 61-87 he discusses the findings of how they classify and name colors. When he mentions that they have the color grue, he states that it is a \\"GRUE [green + blue],‚Ä¶it appears to be blue rather than green\\"(1975). Although the majority of the people he studied matched up with this third stage of color classification and naming, there were others that often had the names to multiple other colors and were attributed to knowing more Spanish than the others. In their native language, it is possible that they did not have words for all of the colors that are available to use in Spanish. During their research, they soon noticed that there was no specific name for the word \\"color\\" in the Aguaruna language. Often, they had an easier time when speaking with the bilingual people that also knew Spanish. This helped them compile an early list of 10 color terms in both Spanish and Aguaruna. Instead of depending solely on the painted chips like they did in the previous experiment, they \\"began presenting items of natural or artificial object and asking...‚Äôwhat stain does it have‚Äô, a question provided us by a bilingual teacher\\"(1975). He mentioned later that they were able to find objects of all colors except pink and brown and that this type of color naming procedure helped the participants answer more quickly and was more enjoyable during the study. In addition to this way of color questioning, they also brought some painted cards because they could not find painted chips and used those along with the objects. During the research, they presented the colored objects and asked which types people associated with certain colors, in no particular order, and wrote the results down. After this questioning, they presented cards with different colors and told the participants to choose a focal point for various colors and point out how many cards they attributed to each color. In their findings they noticed how people that were monolingual in Aguaruna only recognized names for the basic white, black, red, and grue while others that spoke a little or were bilingual in Spanish knew the names of many more colors presented. In his findings on the topic of color terminology among the Aguaruna, he noticed that people with access to different languages outside of the community have picked up various names for colors from a different language and brought them into the community in order for some to have access to multiple color terms they might not have had in their own language. Bioprospecting and the Maya ICBG controversy In 1998 Berlin and his wife, Elois A. Berlin, founded an International Cooperative Biodiversity Group - the Maya ICGB. The group was intended as a combined bioprospecting and research cooperative between the University of Georgia where the Berlins were employed, a Mexican university, a Welsh pharmaceutical company and a newly created NGO called PROMAYA supposed to represent the Indigenous Maya of Chiapas. The aim was to collect and document the ethnobotanical knowledge of the Maya peoples of Chiapas, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with regards discovering, patent, produce and market medicines based on Maya ethnobiological knowledge. The NGO PROMAYA was established as a foundation through which the project could share rights and benefits with the indigenous holders of the medicinal knowledge. Soon after being initiated the project became the subject of harsh criticisms by indigenous activists and Mexican intellectuals who questioned how knowledge obtained from individual Maya could be patented by researchers or foreign pharmaceutical companies, how the PROMAYA NGO established by the Berlins and under their control could be considered representative of the many different Maya communities in Chiapas, and how it was possible for the knowledge that had been collective property of the Maya peoples to become suddenly privatized without the prior consent of each of the individual initial holders of the knowledge. The Berlins argued that the establishment of the NGO was the only feasible way of managing benefit sharing with the community and of obtaining prior informed consent, and they that since the traditional knowledge was in the public domain among the Maya no individual Maya could expect remuneration. As tensions mounted the Mexican partner withdrew its support for the project, and later the NIH, which caused the project to be closed down in 2001 - without having been able to produce any results. The Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between bioprospecting and biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for bioprospectors.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1907 to 1910, and again from 1914 to 1922. Williams was a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and briefly served as a cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. Born at Ysceifiog in Flintshire, Wales, the son of Thomas Williams and Hannah Phillips, Williams was educated at common schools. After reaching the age of thirteen, he worked in the lead means and farmed and then came to Canada in May 1881 with \\"absolutely no capital\\". After living in Hamilton, Ontario, where he worked on a farm, for a year and a half, he moved to Manitoba in November 1882 to become a farmer. He remained in this vocation until 1906, and served for a time as director of the Melita Farmers' Elevator Company. Williams also served as president of the local Grain Growers' Association and Agricultural Society and was reeve for the Rural Municipality of Arthur. Williams first sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1903 provincial election, running in the southwestern constituency of Arthur. He lost to Conservative incumbent Allen Thompson by forty-eight votes. Thompson retired at the 1907 election, and Williams defeated new Conservative candidate Amos Lyle by a margin of three votes (536 to 533). Williams served as an opposition member for the next three years. In the provincial election of 1910, Lyle defeated Williams by 175 votes to regain Arthur for the Conservatives. Control of the riding shifted again in the 1914 campaign, when Williams defeated Lyle by sixty-six votes. He again served as an opposition member. Early in 1915, the governing Conservative Party of Rodmond Roblin was forced from office amid scandal. The Liberals won a landslide victory in the 1915 provincial election, and Williams was elected by an increased margin in Arthur. After this election, he served as a backbench supporter of Norris's ministry. In the 1920 election, Williams defeated Farmer candidate Duncan Lloyd McLeod by only ten votes. Norris's Liberals were reduced to a minority government in the 1920 election, and had difficulty passing legislative initiatives in the next two years. The government was defeated in the legislature in early 1922, and elections were called for later in the year. Williams was called on to play a prominent role in the campaign, and was promoted to cabinet on June 6, 1922 as Minister of Agriculture. The Liberals were defeated by the United Farmers of Manitoba in the 1922 provincial election, and Williams lost his seat to McLeod by 353 votes. He resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Norris ministry on August 8, 1922. In the 1925 federal election, Williams run for the House of Commons of Canada as the candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in Souris. He finished third against Progressive candidate James Steedsman. In 1928, Williams was named Canadian commissioner of immigration for Wales. He was married to Clementine Rogers in 1892.

It is a safety feature, designed to allow systems to continue operating, or at least to not fail catastrophically, in the event of a system breach. It does this by stopping or greatly restricting the flow of hydraulic fluid through the fuse if the flow exceeds a threshold. The term \\"fuse\\" is used here in analogy with electrical fuses which perform a similar function. Hydraulic systems rely on high pressures (usually over 7000 kPa) to work properly. If a hydraulic system loses fluid pressure, such as due to a burst hydraulic hose, it will become inoperative and components such as actuators may collapse. This is an undesirable condition in life-critical systems such as aircraft or heavy machinery, such as forklifts. Hydraulic fuses help guard against catastrophic failure of a hydraulic system by automatically isolating the defective branch. When a hydraulic system is damaged, there is generally a rapid flow of hydraulic fluid towards the breach. Most hydraulic fuses detect this flow and seal themselves (or restrict flow) if the flow exceeds a predetermined limit. There are many different fuse designs but most involve a passive spring- controlled mechanism which closes when the pressure differential across the fuse becomes excessive. Many gas station pumps are equipped with a velocity fuse to limit gasoline flow. The fuse can be heard to engage with a \\"click\\" on some pumps if the nozzle trigger is depressed fully. A slight reduction in fuel flow can be observed. The fuse resets instantly upon releasing the trigger. Types There are two types of hydraulic fuses. The first one acts like a pressure relief valve, venting in case of a pressure surge. The second is more or less like a check valve. The only difference is a check valve is in place to prevent upstream fluid from coming back and venting out. A fuse is in place before the venting area and stops fluid from venting forward of it. Hydraulic fuses are not a perfect solution to fluid loss. They will probably be ineffective against slow, seeping loss of hydraulic fluid, and they may be unable to prevent fluid loss in the event of a catastrophic system failure involving multiple breaches to hydraulic lines. Also, when a fuse activates it is likely that the system will no longer function as designed, as hydraulically-actuated devices may be present in the section isolated by the fuse. Depending on the system, hydraulic fuses may reset automatically after a delay, or may require manual re-opening. Forklift main hoist cylinders are usually equipped with a fuse built into the hose adapter at the base of the cylinder that resets immediately upon stopping the flow. In dam spillways In the design of a spillway for a dam, a fuse plug is a water retaining structure designed to wash out in a controlled fashion if the main dam is in danger of overtopping due to flood, and if the normal spillway channel is insufficient to control the over topping.

Many challenges involve falling into water or mud on failure. The below list contains the names of Games in the UK version of the show, and are followed up by their MXC names. Note that neither the British or American names are accurate translations of the Japanese names. A *Animuddle: Mixed up on the ground are many pieces from giant jigsaw puzzles of animals. On the whistle, the contestants all have to run over and grab a piece for themselves. As soon as they have a bit, they must find the other contestants who have a piece that slots correctly into theirs. Each puzzle is made up of four pieces of jigsaw. If the contestants manage to find the three other people who will put together their picture, they have to complete their jigsaw. If they're right, the group sit down with their pieces strapped to their heads, so from above you can see the completed picture of their animal. Whoever is in a group with a completed puzzle when the final whistle blows wins, and goes through to the next game. Any contestants who haven't completed their puzzle are out. There are some jigsaw pieces that won't fit with any others, so whoever picks these are guaranteed to lose. *Avalanche: The contestant has to get to the top of a steep uphill channel while avoiding giant boulders being rolled down towards them. In the walls at the side are several gaps. To avoid a boulder, the contestant can try to hide in these gaps until it has passed. This isn't easy though, as there are Guards waiting in the gaps to try and push the contestant back out. Once a contestant has left a gap it closes up, so they can't get back in again. If a contestant manages to get all the way to the fortress at the top of the hill they win, and are through to the next game. However, if they get hit by a boulder, even if it doesn't send them rolling down the hill, they lose. Along with the boulders, the Guards also throw down smaller rocks to make climbing the hill even harder. Ball Cupping Bridge Ball B *Ball Cupping: To start the game, the contestant has to hit a ball into the top of a giant pachinko machine. As soon as they've hit the ball they must pick up a bowl and run down the flight of stairs to the side of the machine. Now the contestant has to wait on a narrow pathway at the bottom, between the machine and a mud pit, for the ball to fall out. The aim is to catch it the ball in their bowl. As they can't see where the ball is getting knocked around too, the General shouts out directions (\\"left\\" or \\"right\\") to help guide the contestant. The ball will drop out over the mud pit. The contestant must dive for it, and catch the ball safely in their bowl to win the game. If the ball ends up in the mud, they lose. In the family special version of the game the children hit the ball into the machine and stay up the top to shout directions, while the parents run down the stairs to try and catch the ball. *Big Bird: Dressed as a bird, the contestant is pulled along a wire in the air towards a platform opposite to the one they start on. Halfway through their journey is a big rabbit. They have to try and pick up this rabbit with their feet, and hold onto it until they reach a nest just in front of the finish platform. If the contestant manages to drop the rabbit into the nest they win the game. If they miss the rabbit, drop it, or miss the nest, they lose and get a face full of steam. To make things even harder, Popcorn fire balls from the cannon to try and knock the rabbit out of the contestant's feet. Originally no balls were shot at the contestants but the nest they had to drop the rabbit in was smaller. *Bite The Bun: Many buns, and other bread-based food, are hanging in plastic bags from ropes in the air. The contestants have to pull one off for themselves by only using their mouths. To stop the contestants from using their hands they have a rubber ring around their bodies, keeping their arms pinned to their sides. Later the ring was swapped for a sack that was tied over the contestants to keep their arms inside. The bags are all hanging at different heights, making some of them hard to reach. To get the high up buns contestants have to climb up onto the backs of others. Whoever doesn't have a bun when the time is up loses, and is out of the game. *Blueberry Hill (Regular version): Contestants have to make their way up a ramp, but are only allowed to move when the guard at the top (usually Yousichi/'Dennis') isn't looking. This is made hard by the giant Daruma costumes they are wearing. When the guard is facing the other way he chants \\"Daruma-san ga koronda\\" (meaning \\"The Daruma fell down\\"). This lets the contestants know how much time they have to move and when they should stop. As soon as the guard finishes the chant he turns around. Anyone he catches moving will be pushed down the hill and are out of the game. Any contestants that manage to get all the way to the goal at the top of the hill, without being spotted moving, wins. Once the game was played downhill, so there was the risk of toppling forwards as you came down to the goal. In the couples' version of the game the pairs are attached to each other by a rope tied around their ankles. This means that both contestants in the pair must make it up the hill without being seen moving; and also means that if one of them falls they'll take the other tumbling down with them. *Blueberry Hill (Parents-Kids version): This game is only played in family specials. Five parents at a time, dressed as giant Darumas, each stand on a remote controlled platform and are driven by their children. The kids have to steer their parents around a track to the finish line. The track has many corners to make it more difficult to manoeuvre the platforms around it. There's also a steam spray that goes off when someone is near it, in an attempt try and make the parents lose balance. As the parents are dressed as Darumas, it's hard for them to balance on the moving platforms. If at any time they fall off they are helped back up onto the platform (the child can't move it while their parent isn't on top), restarting where they fell. The game is played as a race, with fastest contestants to get across the finish line winning the game. *Boulder Dash (V1): 'Boulder Dash' was the first part of 'Uphill Garden' from the first episode of Takeshi's Castle. The contestant has to get straight across a hill to the other side to be able to continue on with the game. If they slip down to the bottom of the hill they lose and are out. To make things difficult, the hill is really muddy so it's very hard to keep your footing and not slide down. The Guards also add a further obstacle by throwing rocks and logs down the hill to try and knock the contestants off their feet. *Boulder Dash (V2): This game is a lot like 'Avalanche'. Three contestants at a time have to try and get to the top of a ramp without getting knocked down by giant boulders being rolled towards them. The ramp is a lot wider than the path in 'Avalanche', so the contestants can dodge the boulders if they're quick enough. Whoever manages to get to the top of the hill wins. *Brat Sack: 'Brat Sack' is a family special game. All the children are tied up inside bags with only their arms sticking out. When the game begins, the parents have to find their own kid; but they aren't able to see into the bags. Once they think they've found their own child, the parents must take the bags across the finish line. Only when they're across the line can they open the bag and let, hopefully, their own child out! *Bridge Ball: The contestant has to cross a thin wobbly bridge to the other side. While they're on the bridge, Guards will fire balls at them, from a cannon, to try and knock them off. Originally there were two cannons used to shoot at the contestants. In a variation of the game several rocks are attached to the bridge to make crossing even harder. This means that the contestant can't just run straight across - they have to stop and climb around the rocks. Later the rocks were removed and now Guards only fire balls from one cannon. However, now the contestant has to carry their own golden ball. At the beginning of the bridge the contestant has to catch a golden ball, which is shot to them by the General. While crossing the bridge the contestant must hold onto the ball at all times; as if it drops, and they lose it, they can't continue. If the contestant does drop the ball they have to make it all the way back to the General so he can fire them another one. Anyone who makes it across the bridge, with the golden ball in hand, wins. *Bridge The Gap: There are two planks, both rotating anti-clockwise in the air. The aim is to walk across both of these to reach the finish platform, without falling off. The contestant has to step onto the first plank and quickly walk across it to the other end. There they must wait for it to move under a row of hanging mats. If they don't make it to the end of the plank quick enough then these mats will knock them off. As soon as it has passed under the mats, the contestant has to run back to the opposite end of the plank again. Here they must wait for the second plank to reach them and quickly, but carefully, step onto it. As the planks are moving past each other in different directions, it's hard to keep your balance as you cross from one to another. Once onto the second plank they must walk to the other end, wait for it to go under another row of hanging mats, go back to the opposite end again and, when it reaches the finish platform, jump off to win the game. The first version is played over foam mats covered in powder, while the second version is played over water. *Buggy Me: Six players at a time have to race against each other through an obstacle course. When the starting pistol is fired, the contestants first dash to a mini hurdle and crawl under it. After that, they have to stay low and make their way under a net. Now they must get up and run to a tub of white powder, which they have to stick their heads in to pick up a sponge with their mouth. Once they have a sponge they can grab one of the envelopes that are hanging in the air, and open it. Inside is a number from one to six. This tells the contestant which of six rickshaws they have to pull along to the finish line. There are passengers waiting in the rickshaws. If the contestants are lucky the passenger may only be a cuddly toy; but if they're unlucky they'll pick one with Animal, Kibaji or Strong sitting inside - making it a lot harder to pull along. The first two contestants across the finish line win. C *Catch It (V1): A group of contestants are all dressed in giant foam baseball outfits, waiting to catch a baseball. A Guard, usually one half of Popcorn, hits a baseball high into the air over the 'pitch'. Once the ball has been hit, the contestants have to run over to where they think it will land and try and be the one to catch it. They all have a baseball glove to help. The contestant that catches the ball wins. Several balls are hit up for the same group of contestants, so they have more than one chance to win. In special versions of the game the contestants all have nets on long poles. A bigger ball is shot into the air, from a cannon, and they have to try and catch the ball in their net to win. *Catch It (V2): The contestant starts behind a set of saloon doors, at the end of a giant pit of mud. A football is then fired into the air, over the mud, from a cannon. As soon as the ball is shot, the contestant has to run out into the mud pit and try to catch it. The wet mud makes moving quickly very difficult. If the contestant catches the ball they win the game; but if they miss it, or it bounces out of their hands, they lose. Snow Ball: In special episodes the game was occasionally played in snow. Dry Ball: In the Monster special episode the game was played on big mats on dry ground, as the costumes made moving quickly hard enough anyway. *Cheeze-Berry Hill: This game is exactly the same as 'Blueberry Hill', except the contestants are dressed as giant potatoes. Contestants have to make their way up a ramp, but are only allowed to move when Yousichi at the top isn't looking. When Yousichi is facing the other way he chants \\"Jagaimo-san ga koronda\\" (meaning \\"The potato fell down\\"). This lets the contestants know how much time they have to move and when they should stop. As soon as Yousichi finishes the chant he turns around. Anyone he catches moving will be pushed down the hill and are out of the game. The first five contestants that manage to get to the top of the hill, without being spotted moving, win. *Corn Cob Trip: 'Corn Cob Trip' is much the same as 'Mushroom Trip', except the contestants have to hold onto a giant corncob. The contestants start on top of a platform, at the edge of a pool of water, where they have to grab onto a giant corncob. When they're holding on, the corncob starts to fly across the water - constantly spinning around as it goes. At the opposite end of the pool is a small platform floating on the water. Once they reach this platform the contestants have to let go and land on it. If they manage to land on the mat, and stay on it, they win the game. There is a small hole in the side of the cob to help the contestants hold on with one of their hands. The female contestants also have a rope to help them grip. Dominoes Dragon Lake D *Deep Float: From their starting point on the beach, the contestants must run into the water and swim out to a small platform floating in the sea. Once they reach the raft they must climb on and stay on. Whoever is on the platform when the final whistle blows wins, goes through to the next game. Waiting on the raft are two Guards who will try to stop the contestants climbing aboard. There's also a giant statue on top taking up a lot of room. The contestants can throw off whatever they need to make more space for themselves - including the guards! *Die or Pie: To begin, the contestant has to roll a giant die. The number they roll tells them which hole in a giant cake they must get into. Hole one is the closest to the 'Pie-Chucker' while hole six is the furthest away. Once in a hole the contestant has to lower the lid so that only their head is sticking out. Now the 'Pie-Chucker' throws a custard pie at them. If they get hit, and covered in cream, they're out. But if the pie misses them, they win! *Dino Ride: The contestant has to ride the 'Gettasaurus', a dinosaur version of a Bucking Bronco, as a pink bat moves across the room along a wire in the air. They have to shoot this bat with a water pistol while riding the dinosaur. The bat only flies straight across the room and then back again once. If contestant manages to wet the bat enough it'll drop to the floor and they've won the game. However, if they miss, and don't wet it enough, it'll fly back into the hole it came from and the contestant will lose. They'll also lose if they fall off the dinosaur at anytime during the game. As a punishment for losing, the contestants may get sprayed with steam by Rock-kun. *Dominoes: The contestant has to run across the top of a row of 16 giant dominoes to reach the finish platform. They need good balance, but also speed, as the dominoes are very easily toppled. Once one falls it will knock all the rest down too. If a contestant manages to make it across all 16 dominoes they win the game. If they fall off, they lose. In the family version the parents and kids are connected together by a rope. The parent has to run across the top of the 16 dominoes as usual, but now the kid also has to run across 16 smaller dominoes alongside them. As they're tied together, the pair have to both keep good balance and timing to make it across. *The Dragon Lake: There are several different versions of 'Dragon Lake'. In any version, the aim is to use a rope to swing from one platform to another. If the contestant manages to land on the second platform they win the game. If they miss, or fall off the rope, they lose. Version one was played in the first episode. The contestant has to swing from one platform to another straight in front of them, over a container of shredded paper. On the other side of the landing platform was a slope. If the contestant slides down here, without landing on the flat part of the platform first, they lose. The game then moved to a wet, muddy pit. The landing platform this time is a small 'tree trunk'. If the contestant manages to land on this trunk they win, then cross a bridge to the next game. The third version actually includes a Dragon and a Lake! The contestant starts off on the Dragon platform and has to swing and land on a small round platform in the middle of a lake. After this the game changed slightly. In 'New Dragon Lake', instead of swinging to a platform straight ahead, the contestant has to swing in a semi-circle to reach the small landing platform to the right of where they start. They get a run-up before swinging off to give them more chance to swing far enough around. A special giant version was played in the sea. Starting from very high up, the contestant has to use a rope to swing over to a small floating platform and drop down onto it. If they manage to hold on they win the game. *Drop In The Ocean: 'Drop in the Ocean' is the first half of the starting game for the final episode, which starts on the beach. A helicopter flies over and drops hundreds of coloured balls into the sea. There are eight colours: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, white and black. The colours are later used in the second half of the game, 'Sandscript', but don't matter in this part. The contestants each have to grab a ball for themselves to be able to continue. Anyone who doesn't manage to get a ball before time is up is out of the game. E *End Bell: The contestant starts on a raft at the top of a slope, which is then pushed down and into the water below. When they've hit the water, the contestant has to keep their balance on top as it glides over the lake towards a slippery slope. At the top of this slope is a belfry. Once at the slope, the contestant has to run up it to try and get into the belfry. If they can manage this they ring the bell inside to signify that they've won the game. But if the contestant falls into the water at any time they lose. *Extinction: The Guards dress in animals costumes that have big hinged heads. On each contestants' turn, one of these animals wanders across a shooting range. The contestant, who is a few meters away, has to use the General's cannon to fire balls at them - trying to knock off the animal's head. There are a few rocks and trees for the Guards to hide behind, but they usually spend most of their time taunting the contestants. If a contestant manages to shoot off the animal's head they win the game. But if the animal gets to safety on the other side of the shooting range, with its head still in place, the contestant loses and gets locked in a cage. Final Fall F *Final Fall: 'Final Fall' is used to further whittle down the remaining contestants before the 'Show Down' and is usually only used if too many people have completed the challenges prior. One at a time the contestants run through a tunnel, avoiding the 'Boxing Monster' who is waiting at the exit, to reach five holes in the ground. They have to choose a hole and jump down it. Three of the holes are safe and will take the contestant through to the 'Show Down', but hiding down the other two are Katsuo and Makoto. If a contestant chooses one of these two wrong holes, the Guard down it will stop them getting any further and they'll be out game. *Fish Food: The contestant has to balance on a surfboard as it is pulled along a narrow runway. Stood over the runway are four small arch-shaped fish, and two big shark mouths. When they reach a fish the contestant has to jump over it, and land back on the board. When they reach a shark they must duck down low to go through its mouth. Along the journey they'll first come across a fish, then a shark, then two more fish, a second shark, and a final fish before reaching the beach at the end. If the contestant manages to reach the beach, while still on the surfboard, they win the game. *Flag Down: A team of contestants play against a team of Guards. Each of them has a pole with a flag on top. When the game begins; half of each group has to try and grab the other team's flag, while the rest of them have to try to protect their own flag and hold their pole upright. The first team to pull down their opponents' flag wins. If the team of contestants pull down the Guard's flag first they win, and move onto the next round. But if the Guards grab the contestants' flag first they lose, and are out of the game. *Foot Loose: Laid out on the ground are many pairs of footwear. These range from shoes to sandals, tin can stilts to giant feet. The contestants all run over, grab a pair, and put them on their feet. Once they've got the footwear on, the contestants need to quickly make their way to the finish line. To make things harder, along the way to the goal is a big sticky area. When the contestants step on this they'll get stuck to the ground. The more unconventional the footwear the harder it is to move over this glue. The contestants who are too slow in reaching the finishing line lose, and are out of the game. *The Fortress: The contestants all enter a secret garden and have to search for golden balls. The balls are hidden all over the garden, some easier to find than others. Some, for example, are hanging from trees, in a mouldy pond and under boxes, while others are a lot harder to find; buried in the ground, hidden inside trees or even down the costumes of the human Guard-en ornaments. Contestants that have their own golden ball by the end of the game move onto the next round. Anyone who doesn't have one is out. Part of The Gauntlet. G *The Gauntlet: 'The Gauntlet' is a real life video game. The contestants need to beat a pink mushroom, which is travelling on a track above the course, to the goal to win. If they fall off at any time it's game over. When the game begins the mushroom timer will start moving. The contestant first has to run past three Ghoulies (Guards there to put them off) to reach a conveyor belt. The belt is moving backwards so the contestant has to move quickly to get along it. While they're crossing, a boulder will be rolled down from above to try and knock them off. Next the contestant has to jump over a rotating centipede turnstile and then bounce off a trampoline, up into a pit of foam pieces. Now they must cross a narrow beam while avoiding being knocked off by a wrecking ball that is swung at them. Then, to cross a gap in the course, they have to step onto a spinning plank and leap off the opposite side to carry on. Penultimately, the contestant has to cross a much longer beam - this time while avoiding three wrecking balls. Finally they need to use a rope to swing across a stretch of water to reach the goal. If the pink mushroom reaches the goal before the contestant, Strong, Animal or Kibaji will come out of their cage and chuck the player in the water and out of the game. In a one-off modified version of the course the conveyor belt was removed, the trampoline was replaced by two 'High Rollers', and the spinning plank was replaced with a row of 16 monkey bars. *Giant Maze: This is a giant wooden maze in Kyoto. The contestants all enter at the same time and have to find their way to the exit. Hiding inside are Strong and Kibaji. They'll try to put the contestants off, and also board up the exit when the time is up. All the contestants that manage to make their way out of the exit before the final whistle move onto the next game. Everyone still stuck inside has lost, and is out. *Go Nuts (V1): While wearing an acorn costume, and with their feet tied together, the contestant has to make their way along a narrow curvy path. If they make it safely onto the round platform at the end of the path they win; but if they topple off they lose. *Go Nuts (V2): The contestant has to make their way up a steep hill while avoiding giant nuts that are being rolled down towards them. To make things harder, the contestants are wrapped in padding and a straw mat to make it difficult to move very easily. The hill is also covered in thick foam, which makes it harder to climb. If a contestant manages to make it into the red goal area at the top of the hill they win. But if they end up rolling down the hill, after getting hit by a nut or just by losing balance, they lose. Getting hit by a nut doesn't automatically mean a contestant has lost, but it's likely it will knock them off of their feet anyway. *The Great Wall: All the contestants have to try and climb over a tall wall to make it into the castle grounds. Once up, they have to slide down a slope on the other side; sometimes ending up in water traps or pools of mud. Any contestant that hasn't managed to get over the wall before the whistle blows has lost, and is out of the game. *Grid Iron: The contestant has to run down a small American football pitch to reach the End Zone, while carrying a ball. Several Guards, dressed in big foam uniforms, will try to stop them on the way. The contestants can't step over the pitch's edge or they'll be out automatically. The game starts in a couple of different ways. In the first regular version the General throws the ball to the contestant. They have to catch it and then start running. In the second version the ball is placed in the middle of the pitch. When the whistle blows, the contestant and a Guard run to grab it. The contestant has to get there first or else they'll have to try and get the ball off of the Guards, which is dangerous as they could get caught. To win, the contestant has to get into the End Zone with the ball. If they get there without the ball they haven't won. If the Guards catch the contestant it's the end of the game, and the player loses. The Guards are slightly hampered by the costumes they're wearing, which makes it a bit easier for the contestant to avoid them. The men face seven (originally eight) Guards, while the women face five. On one occasion the contestants had to pick a card, numbered from one to eight, at random. The number they picked was the number of Guards they had to avoid. The second time and third the game was played, five contestants took part at once. They all had to run and pick up a ball each from the middle of the pitch, and then try to get past 10 guards. The contestants that managed to get to the End Zone, with a ball of their own, won the game. In the family special version the parent and child both run at the same time. They have to keep passing the ball between each other as they go, still while avoiding the Guards. H *High Rollers: The contestant has to make their way over cylinders that are positioned above water, each slightly higher or lower than the previous one. The rollers aren't fixed still, so will spin around when stepped on. The contestant needs to move quickly, and have good balance, so that they're not rolled off. If they fall into the water they lose. By making it onto the platform at the end of the Rollers the contestant wins the game. To begin with there were only three Rollers that needed to be crossed. This was increased to five, and then to seven. *Home Run: The contestant has to cross a tall balancing beam while trying to avoid giant baseballs being swung at them. To make balancing and moving harder, the contestant is dressed in a giant foam baseball uniform. As they cross, Animal will try and knock them off by swinging three giant baseballs, tied on ropes, at them. Even the slightest knock on their giant costume can make the contestant spin and fall, so they need to move carefully. If a contestant reaches the finish platform, at the end of the beam, they win the game. *Honeycomb Maze: This is a maze made up of many identical hexagonal rooms. The rooms have six doors, one in each wall, which all open outwards and inwards. However some of the doors in some rooms are dummies, which don't open, as they're against outside walls. The contestant enters the maze at the top right and has to try to find the exit, which is at the bottom left. Waiting inside are two \\"Black-Handed, Black- Hearted\\" Guards (usually Strong and Kibaji) who are trying to find the contestant. The contestant needs to avoid the Guards, because if they get caught they'll have their face covered in black paint, get thrown out of the maze, and will have lost the game. There are several exits all along the left and bottom sides of the maze, but only one is correct. If the contestant comes out of the wrong door they'll fall into a pool of water and will have also lost the game. If a contestant manages to make it through the maze, avoiding being caught by the guards, and exits through the correct door they win. The maze began with 12 rooms; 4 x 4. Later the size was increased to 20 rooms, 5 x 4, and a third Guard was added (usually Animal) to increase the difficulty. In family special episodes the children stand on a platform above the maze. They have to shout out instructions to direct their parent through, avoiding the Guards, to the exit. This family variation was later used in regular episodes. This time the General shouts out the directions to the contestants. I *Indestruct-a-ball: The contestant is curled up and shut inside a big plastic ball. Jo, with the help of the Boxing Monster, then rolls them into a giant pachinko machine. At the bottom of the machine are five skull boxes. If the contestant ends up in one of these boxes they have lost the game; but if they roll down between them, ending up in the goal area underneath, they win. *In The Sack: 'In the Sack' is a couples' special game. All the couples are split up into men and women. The men all start behind a sheet on one side, and the women all start behind a sheet on the opposite side. When the starting whistle is blown, everyone has to run out and try to find their partner. Once a couple has been reunited they have to go and lie on a bed. There are only 55 beds, which isn't enough for every couple. Only one couple can be on any one bed, so the contestants have to move quickly to ensure that they grab one for themselves. When all the beds are filled the whistle is blown. All the couples on a bed go through to the next round, while the others that are still standing lose and are out. J *Jetskid: The contestant lies on a bodyboard at a starting line in the sea. On go, the board is pulled along by a speedboat. The contestant has to try and stay on the board as it is pulled through two lines of buoys, and then up over a ramp. If they manage to hang on, they then have to wait until they reach a floating finish platform and leap off onto it. If the contestant lands safely, and stays on the finish platform, they win. If they fall into the water at anytime they lose the game. The boat pulls the bodyboard at varying speeds. Sometimes it moves extremely fast, but other times very slowly, so good balance is needed at all times. K *Karaoke: The contestant has to go into a karaoke bar and step up onto the stage. A song starts to play and they have to sing along. If the contestant entertains the customers and, more importantly, the bar's boss, they win the game and are taken through to the back room by the Bunny/Geisha Girls. But if the boss is unhappy, and doesn't enjoy the performance, he will get his bouncer to throw the contestant out and they'll have lost the game. The contestants don't know what song they'll get before it starts to play, so they might not know the words. If this happens they can try to make up their own lyrics, or just dance along. However, in this case, they'll have to be very good to amuse the boss. In later episodes the boss is replaced by a steaming statue. If a contestant isn't good enough the statue will blow its top and the Black-Handed, Black-Hearted bouncers will storm onto the stage and blacken the contestant's face. *Knock Knock (V1): 'Knock Knock' began as the second half of 'Skipping Stones'. After crossing the lake, the contestants are faced with a wall that has four doors in it. One of the doors is real, but the others aren't. The contestant has to run full-speed at a door. If it's made of paper they will burst through it and will have won the game. If they choose a wrong door, which is solid, they will bounce straight off and lose. A second wall was then added behind the first. If a contestant makes it through the first wall they then have to choose another door in the second wall. If they're lucky again, and they choose a paper door, they'll go through the wall and win. If they choose wrong they won't get through, and they'll have lost. The walls were then removed from 'Skipping Stones' and made into game of their own. The number of walls the contestants have to get through were doubled to four. Now they have to choose four paper doors, one in each wall, to make it all the way through and win. This time not all the wrong doors are solid. Some are made from paper, but have a net fixed behind. If a contestant runs through one of these they'll be caught in the net and also lose the game. If the contestants make it through the second wall they'll usually be confronted with the Boxing Monster (Jumbo Max in earlier episodes). They will need to make their way past him to continue on. If the contestants choose wrong this time they'll end up getting a pummelling from the Monster. *Knock Knock (V2): This is the starting game version of 'Knock Knock'. Here there is a row of ten walls. Each wall has eight doors in it. Behind the tenth wall is a long bath of powder. All the contestants, at the same time, run full-speed at the doors. If they run into a paper door they'll burst through and continue onto the next wall; but if they choose a wrong door they'll bounce off again. By choosing a wrong door the contestant's aren't out - they can continue trying doors until they make it through, or just go through a door that has already been opened. Behind some of the paper doors are nets. If the contestants run through these they'll get trapped and will have to go back out and use another. Also behind some of the correct doors are pools of water. After breaking through, the contestants will end up falling in and getting slowed down. The Emerald Guards are waiting behind the ninth wall to slow the contestants down and push them back into the water pools. After making it through all ten walls the contestants will reach the bath of powder. Buried in the powder are many balls. The contestants have to grab a ball for themselves. There aren't enough for everyone though, so the contestants need to make their way to the end as quickly as they can to make sure they get a ball. When the final whistle blows, everyone who has their own ball moves onto the next game. Everyone without one goes out. In the couples' version only the men play the game. The women wait at the end with a pink half of a heart each. In the bath of powder are many blue half-hearts. The men have to grab a piece each and then fit it together with their partner's piece. Between them, the couples have to have made a full heart when the whistle blows to move on. If a couple doesn't have a full heart they are out of the game. In the family special version, the walls are split in half. The children run through one side, with four doors, and the parents run through the other side, also with four doors. At the end, the kids have to find a saucer in the powder and the parents have to find a bowl. The pairs must have a bowl and saucer set each to move onto the next round - if not they're out. L *Leap Frog: The contestant stands on a board at the top of a tall ramp, holding onto a handrail for balance. The board is then pushed down the ramp into the pond below. Floating on the pond is a giant lily pad. As they hit the water, the contestant has to jump off of the board and land on the lily pad. If they make it onto the pad, and stay on, they've won the game. If they fall in the water they have lost. *Line Up: Many rolled up bibs hang from ropes in the air. When the game starts, all the contestants have to run out from behind a set of doors and grab a bib for themselves. They then need to unroll it and put it on. All the bibs have one of six characters on; either \\"Fu\\", \\"un\\", \\"ta\\", \\"ke\\", \\"shi\\" or \\"jou\\". When they're wearing a bib, the contestants have to find five other people, each with a different bib. When they're in a group with a different character each, the contestants have to line up to spell out \\"Fuun Takeshi Jou\\" (\\"Operation Takeshi's Castle\\"). Once in the right order they must tie their legs together, just like in a three-legged race - except this is a seven-legged version! Then it's a race to the finish line. All the groups that get past the finish line before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Anyone who wasn't quick enough and didn't get into a group, therefore not reaching the finish, has lost and is out. Mushroom Tip M *Match Maker: Laid out on the ground are many big polystyrene shapes, and many mats with matching shapes cut out of them. When the game begins, all the contestants have to run out from behind a set of doors and grab a shape. Once they've got a shape, the contestants have to go over to the mats and try to find the one that their shape fits into. If they can find the matching mat, they slot their shape into the hole and sit on it to signify that they've finished. Everyone who is sitting on their shape, correctly slotted into the right mat, when the final whistle blows goes through to the next round. Anyone who hasn't managed to get their shape into a mat loses and is out of the game. Some shapes don't have a matching mat at all, so if a contestant is unfortunate enough to pick one of these they've got no chance of moving on. In a special episode Match Maker was played on the beach. All the mats were laid out on the sand, while the shapes were placed on a floating children's playground in the sea. On the starting whistle, all the contestants have to swim out to the playground and get a shape each. They then have to swim back to shore with their shape to try and find the matching mat. *Midoriyama Marathon: All the contestants begin at the start line in front of the castle. When the General fires the starting pistol the race begins. The contestants first have to dash out of the 'car park' and down onto the road outside. Here the first obstacle is to jump over five small hurdles. Next is a long net on the ground that needs to be crawled under. After the net, many tyres are laid out along the road. The contestants have to pick their way through these to reach three sets of mats, which are spaced out along the next section of road. On each of these mats the contestants have to do a forward roll. After these it's a long run around the connecting roads. The roads loop back on their self, so the contestants end up back at the three mats again. Just as before, they have to do a forward roll on each. Then it's back through the tires, and then another crawl under the net. Finally they need to run up a set of steps to reach the finishing line at the top. The contestants who finish the course in fastest time move onto the next round. *Muddy Waters: On the starting whistle, all the contestants run up over a hill and down into a giant thick muddy puddle. They need to wade as fast as they can through the water to reach the other side. The slowest contestants to reach other side of the water are out of the game. *Mudskippers: All the contestants have to crawl, wade, and drag themselves through the thick mudflats of the Ariake Sea. Halfway through the mud are red and blue banners hanging from wires in the air. The contestants need to reach up and grab one of these to be able to move onto the next round. Anyone who doesn't have a banner by the time the final whistle blows loses, and is out of the game. *Mud Slide: 'Mud Slide' is set up like a baseball game. The contestant starts at first base. The ball is pitched, purposely missed by the batter, and caught by the catcher. As soon as the catcher has the ball the contestant has to run to second base. Between the first and second base is a pit of thick mud that the contestant has to run, or slide, through. If they reach the second base before the fielder touches it with the ball they win the game. However, if they're too slow, or get caught in the mud, and don't reach second base before the ball they're forced out and the contestant loses. *Mushroom Trip: The contestant starts on a high platform, at the edge of a lake, and has to grab onto the stalk of a giant mushroom. Once they're gripped on, the mushroom starts flying over the lake - constantly spinning around as it goes. The contestant needs to hold on until they reach a platform on the other side of the water. Here they have to let go and drop onto this finish platform. If they manage to land safely, and stay on the platform, they win the game. If they slip off and fall into the water, at any time, they've lost. The first finishing platform was really big, and raised off the ground. This was then changed to a much smaller mat that floats on the water, making it harder to land safely. To help grip on, there is one small handhold hole in the stalk. Women also get a rope to wrap around the stalk for extra grip. N *Nautiball: 'Nautiball' is volleyball played on a big floating platform in the sea. The contestants play in groups of five. The group begins by picking a card out of a box to find out which team they'll be playing against. The opposing teams, also of five members, include Emerald Guards, a women's volleyball team and women in swimming costumes. The first team to reach three points are the victors; so the contestants need to beat their opponents in order to win the game. O *Oh Deer: Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. They begin the race on deer-tricycles. First they have to pedal up and over a bridge, and then carry on until they reach a 'Slippery Wall'. Now they have to leave their tricycles behind and try to run up the slope. When they've reached the top of the wall, the contestants have to slide down the other side and pick up a giant bat. Jo places a ball on this bat, which they have to keep balanced on top as they make their way over to a giant hat. If they drop the ball the contestants have to stop, re-balance it, and then carry on. Once at the hat they have to tip the ball into it. Next the contestants run over to a giant maple leaf that has shoulder straps attached to it. They need to put it on their back and then finally walk across a balance beam. If they fall off at any time they have to step back on where they fell. The first contestant to reach the finishing line at the end of the balance beam wins. *Oh Ma Ha Beach: Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. They begin on a floating starting mat in the sea. When the whistle blows, the contestants have to leap across a row of six smaller slippery floating platforms. They then must jump into the sea and swim to the shore. When they reach the shore, the contestants need to slip a ring around their waists. Attached to the ring is a big rake, which also has tyres tied to the end during the men's races. They have to run up the beach while dragging the rakes behind them, until they reach a loop of plastic. Now the contestants need to take off the rake and get in the middle of the plastic loop. Inside these they must to roll up the beach (like a tank track) over to a 'Slippery Wall'. Finally the contestants have to climb this wall, which has water running down it, to reach the goal at the top. The first contestant to reach the goal wins. *On Yer Bike: In 'On Yer Bike', five contestants race each other around a track on children's tricycles. When the starting flag is waved, the contestants have to cycle along to, and up, a seesaw. When there's enough weight on the other side it will tip down allowing the contestants to carry on along the track. Anyone who hasn't got onto the see-saw will have to wait for it to tip back down the other way to be able to progress. After turning a corner, the track goes uphill and gets very narrow. As contestants pass over the top of the hill, steam blows up from under the track. This fogs the contestants' view, and shocks some, so they need to be careful to keep balance. The track ramps back downhill into a corner. At this corner is a pond. If the contestants come down the ramp too fast they'll end up rolling off of the track and into the water. Finally, the contestants cycle around the rest of the turning track to reach a second seesaw. Again, this will tip up when enough weight is on the raised end, allowing the contestants to reach the finish line. The contestant that reaches the finish line first is the winner. P *Pipe Down: The contestant starts on a platform raised several stories in the air. Connected to this is a long fabric tube that leads down to the ground. The contestant has to get into the tube and slide down inside it. Near the bottom is an opening in the material. Under this is a platform floating on a lake. When they reach the opening, the contestant has to drop out of it and try to land on the platform. If they time it right, they'll land safely on the platform and win the game. But if they're too fast, or too slow, the contestant will end up in the water and will have lost. *Poles Apart: The contestant starts on a high platform at the edge of a lake. In the middle of the lake is a floating mat. Using a pole, the contestant has to volt across the lake and land on the mat. If they judge it right, and land on the mat without falling off, they win the game. If they miss, and end up in the water, they lose. *Prod: Before the game, the contestant has to blindly pick a coloured ball out of a box. The colour of ball they pick represents the Guard they'll be fighting against. In the middle of a pool are two small round platforms, a short distance from each other. The contestant stands on one of these platforms while the chosen Guard stands on the other. Each of them has a long lance with a big rounded end on. On the whistle, the contestant and Guard have to push and prod each other with their lances - trying to knock each other off of the platforms. If the contestant manages to push the Guard into the water they win the game; but if the guard pushes them off first, the contestant has lost. *Puck Over: Five contestants play this game at once. They all begin by choosing one of five cards at random. The cards are numbered 1 to 5, and the number they pick corresponds to their position in the game. The contestants sit on a giant puck, and have a snowman-shaped case put over the top of them. The snowmen are arranged in a triangle shape on a round icy platform. 3, 4 and 5 are the back row, with 1 and 2 making the row in front. In front of all of them is one snowman with no one inside. From the top of a slope, which is also covered in ice, Animal pushes down another giant puck towards the snowmen. As it hits the group it will send them sliding around. Any contestants, inside their snowmen, that are knocked off the edge of the platform lose the game. Any contestants fortunate enough to remain on the platform win the game. Q *Quake: Five contestants at a time, dressed as old people, enter a room and have to sit on a pile of cushions each. When they're all sitting, the room begins to shake. The contestants have to try and stay balanced on their cushions until the 'earthquake' ends. If they fall off at anytime, they lose. Any contestant who has stayed balanced on top of their cushion pile when the game ends has won. In the couples' special version, the women have to kneel on top of the men's backs. If they can stay balanced on their partner, until the room stops shaking, they win the game. In the family version the children have to balance on top of their parents, who are dressed as turtles, for the duration of the earthquake. Rope The Run Way R *Rat Race: All the contestants at once race through this obstacle course, which is made up of three other Takeshi's Castle games. The contestants begin at the starting line and, when the whistle is blown, have to try and get over a 'Slippery Wall'. Once over the first wall, there is a second one to scale. After the Walls, the contestants enter the 'Honeycomb Maze'. As usual, they have to get from the entrance to the exit while avoiding Kibaji and Animal. To help them through, Jo is standing on top of the maze to shout out directions. Finally, only if they have made it out of the right exit in the maze, the contestants must cross the 'Skipping Stones'. They have to choose the right stones to make it across the lake, avoiding the sinking ones. Any contestant that makes it across the water, without falling in, reaches the finish line and wins the game. *Rice Bowl Downhill: The contestant sits in a giant bowl at the top of a wet slope. Two guards at the top of the hill (usually Popcorn) push the bowl down it, towards a pool at the bottom. The contestant has to stay balanced inside the bowl as it slides down the hill and hits the water at the bottom. If they are still inside when the bowl ends up floating in the pool they win the game. If the contestant falls out at any time they lose. In couples' and family special episodes the pairs have to sit in the bowl together. Both of the contestants have to stay inside the bowl at all times to win. *Ride The Wave: In 'Ride the Wave', contestants have to ride a bicycle, which looks like a whale, around a track. To make things harder, Guards (Strong and Kibaji, or Popcorn) are constantly firing balls at the bikes, from a cannon, to try and knock the contestants over. When the starting whistle is blown, the contestant rolls down a short ramp and has to cycle around a long snaking path. Once they reach the end they then turn a corner. Around the corner is a straight section with rounded lumps on. The contestant has to be careful to keep their balance as they ride through these. Around the next corner is a longer path covered with many rounded sticks, laid long-ways across the track. If the contestant makes it over this path, they turn a 180-degree corner and have to cycle down another long path, back in the opposite direction to the one they've just ridden down. This path has fewer sticks on it than the previous one. Lastly, it's a final corner turn to reach the finish line. If the contestant manages to reach the end of the track, they win the game; but, if they fall over at any time, or get knocked over by the cannon, they lose. The track was later modified. In the second version the rounded lumps were replaced by several of the sticks across the path. As the contestants cross these, steam is sprayed into their faces to deter them. Make it past here and the contestants turn the corner into the final straight. Along this path is a seesaw. The contestant has to cycle up it, and then ride it down on the other side to carry on, avoiding some rounded lumps that may be placed after it. Finally they turn a corner to reach the finish line. In a special episode the game was played on an ice rink. This time there is just one long path to cycle down; but because the contestants are riding over ice it is slippery, so hard to stay upright - especially with balls being fired at the bikes. *Ro-Jim-Bo: In 'Ro-Jim-Bo', the contestants play Janken-pon (Rock- Paper-Scissors) against an Emerald Guard. The contestant stands on a platform, with the Guard on another next to them. Music begins to play and the contestant and Guard have to dance. When the music ends both of them have to show their chosen sign (a fist for rock, a flat hand for paper or a sideways 'V'-sign for scissors). As in a normal game; rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If the contestant beats the guard they win; but if the guard beats them, the contestant loses and is lowered down into a pit of steam. *Roller Derby: Six contestants play at a time. All of them are dressed as horses, and wear roller skates. When the General fires the starting pistol the race begins. The contestants have to skate out from their starting blocks and race to the finish line at the end of the road. The first two contestants to reach the finishing line win the game, the other four lose. In later games four (then reduced to three) small hurdles, each slightly higher than the previous one, were added in the middle of the road. The contestants have to step over these hurdles to carry on, dragging the back legs of their costumes (which are also on wheels) over as they go. *Roll Out The Barrel: 'Roll Out the Barrel' is a life-size game of Pop Up Pirate. The contestant sits on a disk on top of a massive barrel, in front of a slide. In the side of the barrel are slots, numbered one to six. The contestant has choose three numbers, one at a time, by standing a numbered card (1 ‚Äì 6) of their choice in front of them. Once they've chosen a number, Jo will push one of the giant swords into the corresponding slot. Four of the slots are safe, but two of them will end the game. If the contestants have chosen one of the two losing slots, pushing the sword in will cause the top of the barrel to pop-up and the contestant will be tipped down the slide and into the lake at the bottom. If they end up in the water the contestant has lost the game. If the slot they choose is safe, the contestant chooses a second number. Again, if this is wrong they'll slide into the water and lose; but if this is safe too they have to choose one final number. If the third number the contestants choose is also safe they have won the game. In the family special version, the parents sit on top of the barrel while the children choose the slots and push the swords in. The first time the game was played the contestants had to choose four numbers, so had to find all the safe slots to win. *Roll The Dice: 'Roll the Dice' is a couples' special game. Before the game, the couple is asked to decide whether they want to roll for an odd or even number. After they've chosen, both contestants get into giant dice. Their helmets stick out the top forming the number ones. The first contestant, inside the dice, is rolled down a slope into the playing area. After they have stopped rolling at the bottom, their partner is pushed down from another slope to the right. The numbers that have been rolled on the two dice are added together, to find out if the total is an odd or even number. If it's odd and the couple chose odd, or if it's even and the couple chose even, they win the game. If the total is the opposite type of number to the one the couple chose, they lose. *Rope: 'Rope' is the first version of 'Bridge Ball'. The contestant has to get across a long rope that stretches horizontally across a ravine. If the contestant makes it to the other end of the rope they win the game. If they fall off they lose. In the latter versions of this game, the Guards shoot balls at the contestants, from a cannon, to try and knock them off. *Roulette: When the game begins, all the contestants run out from behind a set of doors and over to a bath of powder. Buried in the powder are many disks. Written on each disk is either a number from 0 to 36, \\"Odd\\", \\"Even\\", \\"Black\\" or \\"Red\\". Once they have a disk, the contestants have to go and sit on the corresponding space on a giant roulette table. When everyone is in place, Jo spins a roulette wheel. The contestants sitting on the chosen number are scraped away and are out of the game. The contestants sitting on red or black and odd or even are also out, depending on what the 'winning' number is. All the other contestants move onto the next round. *The Run Way (V1): The contestant sits in a round sledge at the top of a runway. To begin the game, Popcorn push the sledge down the track. As the contestant is sliding along, several boards are turned around at the side of the runway. Each board has a number or mathematical sign on, so together all the boards make up a long sum. The contestants have to quickly work out the equation as they reach the end of the track. When they stop at the end the contestant has to tell Youshichi the answer to the sum. If they've got the answer right they win the game. However, if they get the answer wrong, or take too long working it out, the end of the runway will collapse and the contestant will be dropped into a pit of powder or mud below and lose the game. *The Run Way (V2): Starting at the beginning of an icy runway, the contestant has to run up and jump on a giant curling rock to slide along on it. They have to make it to, and stop in, the goal at the end of the runway to win the game. Along the way the path gets narrower, wider, and then narrower again; so the contestant has to slide as straight as they can to avoid falling off the edge. Also, as the rock moves along, Katsuo and Makoto sweep the ice in front of it trying to put the contestant off. If the contestant falls off of the runway at any time they lose the game. If they don't push off hard enough they won't reach the goal and will also lose. If they push too hard they'll slide over the goal and fall off the end, again losing the game. Skipping Stones S *Samurai Back: Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. On the whistle, the contestants run out of the stating doors wearing samurai costumes. First they have to walk across a balance beam, which is made more difficult by the long trousers. When they're across the beams, the contestants have to take off the costumes and put a bucket, with shoulder straps, on their back. Balls are shot into the air from a cannon. The contestants have to catch one of the balls in their bucket before they can move on. Once they've got a ball, they take off the bucket and climb over a mini 'Great Wall'. When they've over, they slide down the other side to reach a small hurdle with a plate of food behind it. The contestants need to put their feet on the hurdle and, only using their mouth, pick up the three pieces of food. When the food is in their mouth, the contestants must get up and put a mask on the back of their heads. Finally they run backwards (so the mask is facing forwards) along a track to the finish line. The first contestant to reach the finish line wins. * Sand Flee : All the contestants at once race through this obstacle course on the beach. When the game begins, the contestants have to run over to where many buns in bags are hanging from wires in the air. As in 'Bite the Bun', they need to grab a bun with their mouths ‚Äì although this time there is nothing stopping them from using their hands. Once they have a bun, the contestants must crawl under a long net on the ground. On the other side of the net is a big area of sand where hundreds of silver balls are hidden. When they reach this area, the contestants have to dig in the sand to find a ball for themselves. After they've found one they must run to the finish line with it. When they're at the finish the contestants open up the ball. Inside is a piece of paper. If the paper has a red circle on it the contestants have won the game. However, if they don't get a circle they need to run back to the digging area and try to find another ball. If they do find another they can run back to the finish line and open this one, again repeating the process if needed. All the contestants that have a red circle by the time the final whistle is blown move onto the next round. Everyone who doesn't have one is out of the game. *Sandscript: 'Sandscrpit' is the second half of the starting game for the final episode. The contestants are split into eight groups, according to the colour of ball they picked up in 'Drop in the Ocean': red, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, white and black. The General stands on a platform and calls out a Japanese character. He then picks a ball at random from a box. The colour of ball he picks determines which group gets that character. This is done seven times for seven characters: \\"se\\", \\"me\\", \\"ru\\", \\"ta\\", \\"ke\\", \\"shi\\", and \\"jou\\". The team that doesn't get picked out of the box automatically moves onto the next round. When the whistle blows, each team has to run over to their giant piece of paper and arrange themselves into the shape of their character. They need to do this correctly so that the phrase \\"Semeru Takeshi Jou\\" (\\"Attack Takeshi's Castle\\") can be read from above. When the time is up, the teams are judged on their formation by a calligraphy expert. The team determined the worst loses, and is out of the game. *Shoot 'N Loot: 'Shoot 'N' Loot' was played at the end of the final episode, instead of the 'Show Down'. It was a chance for the last remaining contestants to win prizes, including: a satellite dish, a Game Boy, a suitcase, a CD Walkman, a bike, a camcorder, a trip to Hawaii, and a pair of sandals. To try and win, the contestant has to shoot small balls from a machine at the prizes moving along on conveyor belts. The booby prizes are stuck to boards and move along at the back, making them the easiest to hit. The other prizes are written on smaller boxes; the middle prizes in blue, and the better prizes in red. There is also a million yen on offer. This is written in gold on a small box, and moves along at the back faster than any of the other prizes, making it a lot harder to hit. The contestant wins all of the prizes that they manage to knock off of the conveyor belt. *Show of Hands: In the first version of 'Show of Hands' ten contestants play the game at the same time. All the contestants are dressed as hands. Spread out around the playing area are many giant cards, each with a different Hiragana character on. The teacher reads out a statement and the contestants have to run and find the correct answer. Once they've found the card with the right answer on they have to fall face-first on top of it. The first person to fall onto the correct mat wins. There are several questions for each group, so the contestants have more than one chance to win. After a few episodes the characters on the cards were replaced with numbers. Now mathematical questions are read out and the contestants have to find the correct answer to the sum. In the second version of the game only five contestants play at once. The other five people are now Emerald Guards, dressed as blue hands. As before, a mathematical question is asked and all the players have to try and be the first to fall onto the correct answer. However, if a Guard gets to the answer first they win and this is one less chance for a contestant to clear the game. In a one-off version, instead of questions being asked, short clips of music are played. The contestants have to identify the song and jump onto the card that shows its correct title. In a special version the game was played in the mud flats of the Ariake Sea. This time, instead of full costumes, the contestants just have a giant foam hand over one of their hands. Ten contestants play at once, and all have to crawl through the mud to reach the right answer. To first person to put their giant hand on the correct mat wins. *Single Roller: A big cylinder is laid on a metal track, above water. The contestant stands on top of the cylinder and has to move it along the rails to the end. The track slopes slightly downhill, it then flattens off towards the middle before turning into a steeper slope near the end; so the contestant needs excellent balance to stay on top as the cylinder rolls down. If the contestant manages to stay on the cylinder, until the end of the track, they can leap off onto the finish platform and have won the game. If they fall off at any time they lose. *Skittles: Ten contestants play this game at once. Before starting they each pick a card, numbered from one to ten, at random. The number they pull tells the contestants which pin position they will take. The higher the number you pick the further to the back of the group you are - number one being right at the front. All the contestants are dressed as a giant bowling pins and have their legs tied together, to make standing upright harder. Once they're in position on the alley, a giant bowling ball is rolled down a ramp towards the contestants. Any contestant that gets knocked over has lost the game. Anyone who manages to stay standing wins. *Skipping Stones: The contestant has to cross a lake by using stepping-stones. All the stones look identical, but only some of them are solid. The other stones aren't supported and will sink when trodden on. If the contestant manages to get across the lake, without falling in the water, they win the game. In some early games a 'Knock Knock' wall is added to the bank on the other side of the lake. If a contestant manages to get across the water they are faced with a wall that has four doors in it. Two of the doors are real, but the other two aren't. The contestant has to run full-speed at a door. If it's made of paper they will burst through it. If not, they bounce straight off and lose. The contestant has to make it through the wall to win the whole game. Later, a second wall was added behind the first. The contestant now had to get through a correct door in both walls to win the game. *Sling Swing Fling: The contestant hangs in a harness in the air. When the game begins they are pulled along over a pool. Floating in the middle of the pool is a bowl with a ball in it. When they're near enough, the contestant needs to pull a cord that will drop them down on a bungee rope so that they can grab the ball. If the contestant manages to get the ball, they have to quickly throw it into a giant pot that's positioned at the end of the pool. If the ball goes in they win the game. If they miss, or didn't manage to pick up the ball in the first place, the contestant loses and gets dunked, and their face blackened, by the Sea Goblin. *Slipped Disks: This is the second line of defence on the edge of the castle grounds and often happens immediately after The Great Wall challenge. A bunker with water pistol-wielding Guards inside, in front of, and on top of it. The contestants are all armed with water pistol and have paper rings stuck to their helmets. On go, they all rush over to the bunker and have to climb over the top of it. As they're climbing over, the Guards will try and break the contestants' rings by shooting them with water. If a contestant's ring gets broken they have lost and are out of the game. The guards also have rings that the contestants can try to break. If a Guard's ring does get broken they can't shoot anymore. All the contestants that manage to get over the bunker, without having their ring broken, move onto the next game. *Slippery Wall: All the contestants have to try and climb up this steep slippery slope to make it into the castle grounds. There are ropes place at the top of the wall to help, but the contestants have to get most of the way up the slope to reach them. Once up, they have to slide down the slope on the other side; usually ending up in water traps or pools of mud. Any contestant that hasn't managed to get over the wall before the whistle blows is out of the game. The final time this game was played; many balls were hanging from wires in the air above the slope on the back of the wall. This time, once the contestants have climbed up, they have to grab a ball on their way down the other side. The contestants need to have a ball of their own to move on. Anyone who doesn't get one loses and is out of the game. *Slip Way: 'Slip Away' is a family special game though has cropped up from time to time on the regular programme. The child lays on an aeroplane bodyboard at the end of a long platform. The parent has to push the board along the runway to try and get it to stop in the goal area at the end. If the parent pushes too hard they'll slide their child straight off the end of the runway, into the water below, and lose the game. If they don't push hard enough they won't reach the goal, will come up short, and the child will get pushed off into the water by Okada the Evil Crow ‚Äì also losing the game. If the parent judges the force just right, their child will end up positioned over the goal area and they win the game. There is a board at the end of a long platform. The contestant has to run up and jump on the board to slide along the runway. The aim is to end up on the arrow, or in the goal area, right at the end of the runway. If the contestant pushes off too hard they'll slide straight off the end, into the water below, and lose the game. If they don't push off hard enough they won't reach the goal, will come up short, and will get pushed off into the water by Okada the Sea Goblin ‚Äì also losing the game. If the contestant judges the force just right, and ends up positioned over the arrow/goal area, they win the game. *Snow Lane: Two contestants at a time race each other through this obstacle course. On the starting whistle, the contestants have to get down low and pull themselves through tracks in the snow. After this they have to jump down into a big hole, and then climb out again on the other side. Once out there's a second hole to jump into, and climb out of again. Next is a hill made of snow. The contestants have to put on fat, 'Blueberry Hill'-like, fox costumes and run up the hill, trying not to topple over and roll back down again. At the top of the hill the contestants take off the costumes and sit on a rubber doughnut-shaped sledge. They have to slide down the other side of the hill, and keep going until they reach the finish line. The first contestant to reach the finish wins. *Space Invaders: Starting at the top of a hill, the contestant sits in a cable car with a laser gun. Positioned down the hill are several Guard-staffed stations. All the stations have a sensor on. As the cable car moves down the hill the contestant has to try and shoot a sensor on one of the stations. If the contestant manages to hit one of the Guard's sensors, all the stations will go up in smoke, they win the game and move onto the 'Show Down'. However, the Guards fight back. In the first version there are four active stations, and the Guards on these shoot balls from cannons. On the contestant's cable car are two targets - one on each side. If a Guard hits one of these targets with a ball, the car goes up in smoke and the contestant loses the game. In the second version there are five active stations. The guards on these also have a laser gun each. On the contestant's cable car is a sensor. If a Guard hits the sensor the car will go up in smoke, the contestant loses and is out of the game. The contestants don't need to hit a Guard's sensor to win. If they manage to make it all the way down the hill, without having the target/sensor on their cable car hit, the contestant automatically wins and moves onto the 'Show Down'. *Square Maze: The 'Square Maze' is the earlier version of the 'Honeycomb Maze'. The maze is made up 12 square rooms, 4 x 3, that all look exactly the same. The rooms have four doors, one in each wall, which all open outwards and inwards. However some of the doors in some of the rooms are dummies, which don't open, as they're against outside walls. The contestants enter the maze at the top right and have to try to find the exit, which is at the bottom left. Waiting inside are two \\"Black-Handed, Black-Hearted\\" Guards who are trying to find the contestant. The contestant needs to avoid the guards, because if they get caught they'll have their faces covered in black paint, get thrown out of the maze, and will have lost the game. If a contestant manages to make it through the maze, avoiding being caught by the Guards, they win the game. Originally there was only the one exit, but later a second was added to the top left room. If the contestant goes through this one they don't win, but lose and end up in a pool of water. A second wrong exit was then added next to this, with the pool extended along to cover this door too. In family special episodes the children stand on a platform above the maze. They have to shout out instructions to direct their parents through, avoiding the Guards, to the exit. In a special one-off version of the game the contestants and Strong (the only guard in the maze) were blindfolded. The game is played as usual, with the contestant having to find their way from the entrance to the exit without being caught. For this blindfold version, four of the doors inside the maze are locked shut so they could not be used. This makes navigating through the maze even tougher and more confusing. *Stock Pot Racing: On the whistle, all the contestants have to try and climb over a small slippery slope. Once they've made it up, they slide down the other side. Next there is a long net on the ground that contestants have to crawl under. Standing on top of the net are Guards, trying to stop the contestants moving through. On the other side of the net are a lot of big vegetables. Contestants have to grab one and take it into a giant cooking pot. All the contestants that make it into the pot, with a vegetable of their own, before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Everyone else is out. *Streets Ahead: On the whistle, all the contestants have to try and climb over a small slippery slope. Once they've made it up, they slide down the other side. Next there is a long net on the ground that contestants have to crawl under. Standing on top of the net are Guards, trying to stop the contestants moving through. On the other side of the net are a lot of big vegetables. Contestants have to grab one and take it into a giant cooking pot. All the contestants that make it into the pot, with a vegetable of their own, before the final whistle blows move onto the next game. Everyone else is out. *Stuff Diving: Several contestants play this game at once. A question is asked and the contestants have to dive underwater to find a card or mat with the correct answer on. In the first version, groups of eight contestants play the game in a hot tub. The answers are all written on cards at the bottom of the tub. The first contestant to find the card with the correct answer to the question on wins. In the second version, ten contestants at a time play in a swimming pool. At the bottom of the pool are many numbered mats. A maths equation is read out and the contestants all have to dive into the pool to and try to find the mat with the correct answer on. The contestant that grabs the right mat and brings it up to the surface wins. To make diving harder, the contestants all have to wear floats around their waists. There is more than one question for each group, so the contestants get several chances at winning the game. *Sumo Rings: There are five different coloured sumo rings: red, blue, yellow, green and purple. Each has a different guard inside. To begin, the contestant picks a ball at random out of a box. The colour of the ball they pick corresponds to the colour of a ring, telling them which Guard they have to fight. Now it's a straightforward sumo match. The fighters have to try and get their opponent on the ground or out of the ring to win. Some Guards are a lot easier to beat than others. Regular fighters include 'Spud' (a guard in a big Konishiki Yasokichi head costume) who is the easiest to beat, Shin Suganuma (a weedy little guard), and pro sumo wrestler Shinoburyo (/'Porker', a fat guard) who is the hardest to win against. In the family special version the parent and child fight the chosen guard at the same time. The game was changed once for a special version. After the contestant picks a ball to determine their opponent, both of them have to stand back-to-back on a small round platform in water. When the fight begins, the Guard and contestant have to try and push each other off by only using their bums. Contestants pushed off into the water lose the battle. But if they manage to get the Guard off first they win. T *Take It Snow: Many 'snowmen' are positioned between the starting and finishing platforms. The contestant has to get to the finish platform by stepping across the heads of the snowmen. Some of the heads are fixed still, but others are loose so will roll off when trodden on. If the contestant manages to get to the finish platform, without falling to the ground, they win the game. *Toboggoff: The contestant sits on a rubber doughnut-shaped sledge at the top of a snow-covered slope, and is then pushed down it. After sliding down the slope the contestant has to stay on the doughnut as it speeds over several bumps to reach the finish line. In a one-off version the game is played down a tall snowy hill, with the goal situated at the bottom. If a contestant falls off at anytime before reaching the goal they lose. If they manage to stay balanced on top until passing the finish line, they win the game and move onto the next round. *Tug of War: In the first version of 'Tug of War', contestants play as a team. There are four ropes leading underneath a barrier. The team has to choose one of them without being able to see who is on the other end. Once they've picked a rope the wall is lifted and their opponents are revealed. When the General blows his whistle the tug of war begins. The team that can pull their opponents over the centre line first wins the game. In the second version of the game contestants play one at a time. There are five ropes to choose from, each leading through a set of doors. When a contestant picks a rope the whistle is blown and the war begins, without them knowing who, or what, they're tugging against. The contestant has to try and pull their opponent over a line on the opposite side of the wall. If they succeed in doing this, the whistle is blown again, and they have won the battle. However, if the contestant is pulled over the line on their side of the wall they lose the fight. Once the war is over the door is opened so the contestant can see what they were tugging against. *Turtle Hurtle: A long bridge of slippery turtle-shaped platforms are floating in the sea. On the whistle, the contestant has to start running over them to try and reach the finish platform at the other end. If the contestant falls in the water at any time they lose the game. A few seconds after the whistle is blown a guard is released from a cage on the starting platform, and takes chase after the contestant. The contestant needs to be quick, as if the guard catches them they'll be thrown into the water. If the contestant manages to make it over all the turtles and onto the finishing platform, without being caught or falling off, they win and move onto the next game. *Turtle Soup: 'Turtle Soup' is a family special game. Dressed as turtles, the parent has to crawl along a narrow snake pathway, in the middle of a lake, while carrying their kid on their back. To make this harder, the parent is blindfolded so the kid need to direct them. To begin they crawl down a short ramp. About halfway through the path goes in a big curve and gets even narrower. After this it widens up slightly again, to the width it was before, and ends with another ramp to crawl up to reach the goal. If the parent can make it all the way to the end of the snake, with their child still on their back, they've won the game. However, if the child slips off and into the water, or they fall into the water themselves, they've lost. U *Uphill Garden: The contestant starts at the bottom of the hill with a water pistol and a paper ring stuck on their helmet. They need to climb up the hill to reach the fort at the top; but coming down the other way, trying to stop the contestant, is a guard dressed in a costume. The guard also has a ring and a water pistol. As they reach each other, the contestant and guard must try and break each other's rings by shooting water at it. If the contestant breaks the guard's ring first they win, and can go through the fort at the top of the hill to move onto the next game. However, if the guard breaks the contestant's ring first they've lost the fight, and are sent back down the hill. In later episodes the rings were moved from the helmets and onto the water pistols. On one occasion all the contestants had to climb the hill together while battling 12 guards. The contestants had to break all the guards' rings to win the game. *Up The Creek: The contestant gets into a box that is suspended over a pit of mud. Once inside they have to use a pulley to move themselves along. In the middle of the mud pit is a platform, which the contestant has to try and position their box above. However, because they can't see whereabouts they are its all down to guesswork. Once they think they're over the platform, the contestant has to pull a lever to open the floor. If they're in the right place they'll fall onto the platform and win the game. If they haven't pulled themselves far enough, or have gone too far, they'll drop into the mud and lose. V *Velcro Fly: The contestant wears a suit with Velcro on the front, and starts on a platform at the side of a pool. On the other side of the pool is a big board covered in fuzzy material. Using a trapeze on a long rope, the contestant has to swing over the lake, let go of the rope, and try to stick themselves onto the board. If the contestant manages to stick on the wall, and stay there, they have won the next game. If they don't stick, or don't even reach the wall, they'll fall into the water and will have lost. As extra humiliation for losing, in most games, a Guard (usually Animal) will blast the losing contestants with a fire hose. W *Walk The Plank: This game is only played in couples' and family special episodes. There is a row of ten planks floating in a lake. The pairs need to cross the water by stepping from one plank to another. The two contestants have to step on opposite ends of the planks. If weight is just put on just one side of a plank it will tip up; so the contestants need to step onto each plank at the same time as each other to keep it balanced. If the pair make it to the platform at the end of the row of planks, without falling in the water, they win the game. *Wet Paint: At the beginning of the game the General spins a wheel, which has ten (eight, the second time the game was played) different kanji characters on it. The contestant fires a crossbow at the wheel as it is spinning. The character that the arrow hits is the one they'll have to draw. Now, the contestant has to pick up a giant brush that has been dipped in paint. On the whistle, the contestant has to run up a slippery slope to reach a white square - in which they have to draw their character. They only have 30 seconds to do this in. If they slip back down, the contestant can keep running back up until they have finished drawing or the time has run out. If the contestant manages to complete the character within the 30 seconds they win, and move onto the next game. If they don't manage to draw it in time the contestant loses and Strong and Kibaji, who are standing at the top of the slope, will wash the drawing, and the contestant, away. *Whack The Stack: 'Whack the Stack' is only played in family special episodes. The child sits on top of a stack of three big disks, while the parent stands at the side with a giant mallet. The parent has to first whack the middle disk so that it flies out from the stack. The child needs to jump up as their parent hits the disk - letting it move out without taking the one above with it. If they manage to do this successfully, the top disk will drop down onto the bottom disk and the child will end up back on top. Next, the parent has to knock out the bottom disk. Again the child needs to jump at the right time to allow this to happen. If they get it right again there will just be one disk left, with their child sitting on top, and the pair will have won the game. If the tower falls over, or the child falls off at any time, the game is over and the pair has lost. *Wipe Out: From the starting platform; the contestant steps onto a surfboard that circles around, above a lake, in the air. They must balance on the surfboard until they reach a big pink fish. The contestant has to jump over the fish and land back on the moving surfboard. Next, they ride it a bit further until they come to a platform. They must step up onto the platform where a guard (usually Youshichi dressed as Pocahontas) is waiting. The contestant has to quickly get to the other side of the platform and, as soon as the surfboard comes out form underneath, step back onto it. If they don't get back on the board the guard will throw the contestant off, into the water, and out of the game. Once back on the surfboard the contestant has to jump over a second fish, land back on the board again, and then finally leap off onto the finishing platform. If the contestant makes it onto the finish platform they have won the game; but if they fall into the water at anytime they lose. In the couples' version the man completes the first half of the game while the woman waits on the guard's platform. The man has to reach the platform and tag his partner so she can jump onto the board and finish the game. Y *Yellow Brick Road: There is a row of five doors. The contestant has to choose one of these and go through. Through the door is a yellow path, which the contestant must follow until they reach a junction with another road leading off of it. Now they have to cross over onto this adjoining path. The contestant has to keep doing this; following the paths and changing direction at every junction they come to, until they reach one of five slides. Now they have to climb up the steps, being chased by Strong and Kibaji to speed them up, and go down the slide. One of the slides leads to dry land, Hawaiian dancers and the next game. The other four will drop the contestants into pits of mud. If the contestant has ended up at the right slide, they will have won and will be congratulated upon their arrival at the bottom. However, if they've gone down a wrong slide they'll end up deep in a pit of mud and have lost the game. End Games * Show Down (V1): In Version 1 The contestants that have chosen a safe hole in 'Final Fall' follow the tunnel and come out of a hole in the ground in front of the castle. Each contestant is armed with a water pistol and has a paper ring stuck on their helmet. When the General gives the command, all the contestants have to rush over to the castle, cross the drawbridge, and try to storm it. Their aim is to reach Takeshi at the top of the castle. However, to stop them getting to the top, the Guards are positioned all around the castle. They also have water pistols and rings on their helmets. On their way up, the contestants need to protect their rings to stop the Guards shooting them with their water pistols. If a contestant's ring gets broken they are out of the game and have to leave the castle. The contestants can fight back though. If they break a Guard's ring he cannot shoot anymore. If any contestant manages to reach the top of the castle, with their ring intact, they have to try to break Takeshi's own ring to win. Originally Takeshi's ring was also on his helmet, but was much smaller than anyone else's and therefore harder to hit. He then moved into a wheeled turret, with his ring stuck on top of its roof. It is now much bigger than before, but the turret constantly slides from side- to-side making it harder to hit. If Takeshi's ring is broken the castle has been stormed and the contestant, and the General, has won. But if all the contestants have their rings broken it's the end of the game, and the General and his army have lost. * Show Down (V2): In Version 2 The contestants that have chosen a safe hole in 'Final Fall' follow the tunnel and come out the pipe in front of the castle. They then go and board a motorised cart each (or, if there are a lot of contestants through, some must share a cart). Each cart has a paper ring on the front, and every contestant is armed with a water pistol. On the opposite side of the \\"car park\\" to the contestants are the Guards. They share five carts of their own, which also have a ring on the front. There are usually two or three Guards in one cart, and every guard has a water pistol. There is one other cart on the Guards' side ‚Äì Takeshi's cart. Takeshi's cart is much bigger than everyone else's, but also has a ring on the front. The water pistol in this cart is also much bigger and much more powerful than the others. On the General's command the game begins, and the contestants and Guards drive into battle. The contestants' aim is to break the ring on the front of Takeshi's cart with their water pistols, but they need to avoid having their own ring broken in the process. The Guards try to stop the contestants succeeding by aiming at their rings. If a contestant's ring is broken they are out of the game, and have to stop. The contestants can fight back though. If they break a ring on a Guards' cart, that cart has to stop. If a contestant manages to break the ring on the front of Takeshi's cart, the contestant, and the General, wins the game. But, if all the contestants have their rings broken it's the end of the game and the General and his army have lost. * Show Down (V3): In the later episodes the water pistols and rings are replaced with laser guns and sensors. Instead of having a bigger gun, Takeshi's cart now has two regular laser guns. Exactly the same rules as before apply. If a sensor on the front of a cart gets hit, the cart goes up in smoke, and they're out of the game. Again, the contestants have to aim for the sensor on the front of Takeshi's cart. If they manage to hit it the contestant, and the General, wins the game. But if the Guards hit all the contestant's sensors first, the General and his army have lost. In the laser version the General also takes part in his own special cart. If he manages to hit Takeshi's sensor, without having his own sensor hit first, the game is won. In family and couples' specials both contestants in a pair ride in the same cart. One of them drives while the other shoots. Takeshi sometimes tries out different tactics. For example; only sending in one cart at a time, sending out a guard dressed as a cart (complete with sensor and laser gun) to run around shooting, and even sitting in an aeroplane high in the air. When Takeshi is in his plane he can shoot the contestants' sensors down on the ground with his laser gun, but he doesn't have a sensor himself so cannot be stopped. As always, the contestants have to aim for the sensor on his usual big cart, which is still being driven around below, to win. *Ultimate Showdown: The 'Ultimate Showdown' is the last game in the obstacle course special episode. When the General blows his whistle, the contestant first has to run through a long pit of thick mud - pushing through hanging mats as they go. Next it's over to 'Skipping Stones', where they have to cross the lake as usual ‚Äì stepping from one stone to another, trying to avoid the sinking ones. If the contestant falls off they're allowed to swim to the end. Next they have to use a rope to swing over 'Dragon Lake', landing on a platform in the middle. If they miss the platform they can again just swim to the edge and carry on. After this, they have to push a big ball up the 'Uphill Garden' hill and then run over to 'Bridge Ball'. As normal, the contestant has to cross the wobbly bridge while Kibaji and Jo shoot balls at them - this time from two cannons. There is no golden ball to carry. If the contestant falls off at any time they must go back to the start of the bridge and try again. This is the only obstacle that has to be completed properly. After crossing the bridge it's a dash over to the bottom of the 'Rice Bowl' hill. Here the contestant has to strap a big wind-catcher on their back and climb up the hill while a giant fan is blowing towards them. Once at the top of the hill the contestant has to take off the wind-catcher, run all the way back down and then over to the finish line in front of the castle. The fastest man and fastest woman to complete the course each win a million yen.

He was also a senior writer for ESPN.com. Biography =Early career= Clayton began covering sports while still a student at Churchill Area High School. Starting with the Pittsburgh Steelers' training camp, he covered the team in twice-weekly dispatches in the St. Marys, Pennsylvania Daily Press. He later wrote for Steel City Sports, a weekly publication in Pittsburgh. In 1975, Steel City Sports changed into Score! Pittsburgh and Clayton was a staff writer, covering the Steelers. He also served as a stringer for a number of radio networks, including AP Radio, and covered games, providing the network with sound clips from locker room interviews after games involving Pittsburgh's professional sports teams. Clayton graduated from Duquesne University in 1976, and later worked for The Pittsburgh Press. He had done part-time work for the paper while attending college. In May 1978, Clayton was sent to cover a Steelers mini-camp in place of the Presss regular Steelers beat writer, Glenn Sheeley. While there he discovered and reported a rules violation which would cost the team a draft pick. The affair was dubbed \\"Shouldergate\\" by Clayton. Clayton became persona non grata for some time in his hometown for his role in the affair. Clayton eventually worked his way up to become the Steelers beat writer at the Press, before leaving the paper in 1986. He moved across the country and began covering the Seattle Seahawks for The News Tribune in Tacoma, Washington. It was at this time that he began appearing in NFL segments on Seattle sports radio station KJR (AM) on host Nanci Donnellan's program \\"The Fabulous Sports Babe\\". When Donnellan's show was picked up by ESPN for national syndication, Clayton came along as an NFL correspondent. =ESPN= In 1995, Clayton joined ESPN as a reporter and later added to his duties a weekly radio show during the NFL offseason. He hosted the show with former NFL quarterback Sean Salisbury; the show included \\"Four Downs,\\" a debate with Salisbury over current NFL issues. Their debates often became quite heated, with Salisbury referring to Clayton as the \\"Cryptkeeper\\" and \\"Mr. Peabody\\", mocking his geeky and \\"eggheaded\\" appearance and voice, and Clayton responding by calling Salisbury \\"Mr. Backup\\" based on his limited playing time during his NFL career. There is debate as to seriousness of the animosity between Salisbury and Clayton. He was let go from ESPN on May 31, 2017. =Radio programs= Clayton remained a frequent contributor to KJR (AM), and hosted its \\"Sports Saturday\\" show on Saturday mornings. He is a regular caller to sports-talk radio stations around the country. Because of the transition to all-sports of KIRO (AM) Seattle, Clayton moved his show to the new ESPN station. =Awards and honors= Clayton received the Dick McCann Memorial Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007. This distinction puts him in the \\"writer's wing\\" of the Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the sports hall of fame of his alma mater, Duquesne University, in 2001.

She recorded one more album for Motown on its newly-created rock label Weed entitled CC Rides Again (1969). The Belgian label Marginal released a CD of \\"Soul Sounds\\" made from the original master tapes (with unaltered mixes) and it contains the songs from Soul Sounds, 5 songs from CC Rides Again and 3 unreleased singles. A 50-track double-CD from Universal Music was released in 2005 entitled Chris Clark: The Motown Collection includes Soul Sounds, C.C. Rides Again, and many unreleased Motown recordings. A reissue and remastered version of the Soul Sounds album was released by the Reel Music label in April 2009, the first time the album was issued on CD in the U.S. Clark became famous in England as the \\"white negress\\" (a nickname meant as a compliment), because the six-foot platinum blonde, blue-eyed soul singer toured with fellow Motown artists, who were predominantly black. Clark co-wrote the screenplay for the 1972 motion picture Lady Sings the Blues starring Diana Ross, which earned her an Academy Award nomination. During the early 1970s, she was an executive with Motown's Film and Television Production Division in Los Angeles. In 1975 Clark was the Creative Assistant on the motion picture Mahogany. Ultimately Clark served as Head of Creative Affairs for Motown from 1981 to 1989. Clark performed the song \\"The Ghosts of San Francisco\\", written by R. Christian Anderson and John Thomas Bullock, for the feature film When the World Came to San Francisco in 2015.When the World Came to San Francisco film details, imdb.com; accessed January 29, 2016.

History Atmos Energy Corporation's history dates back to 1906 in the Panhandle of Texas. Over the years, through various business combinations and mergers, the company became known as Pioneer Corporation, a large diversified West Texas energy company. In 1981, the company was incorporated and became a fully regulated natural-gas-only distributor. In 1983, Energas, the natural gas distribution division of Pioneer, was spun off and became an independent, publicly held natural gas distribution company. In October 1988, Energas changed its corporate name to Atmos Energy Corporation and its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol Atmos Energy has grown through acquisitions, its most recent acquisition was the distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company in October 2004.

In what was largely seen as a power struggle between himself and head coach Bill Cowher, Donahoe left the team following the 1999 season. In 2000, Donahoe took on a job at ESPN.com for the following year. Before the 2001 season, Donahoe was selected to replace John Butler as general manager of the Buffalo Bills, as well as take over the position of team president from a retiring Ralph Wilson. Wilson, while still maintaining ownership of the team, wanted to step aside from the day-to-day operations of the franchise, and chose Donahoe to take his place. After the 2005 season, Donahoe was fired. The team had been 31‚Äì48 during his tenure with the team from 2001 to 2005, and he drafted only three playersAll in 2001 who would go on to make the Pro Bowl with the team.

Other uses  Although the word is derived from the Arabic word mawla, it adopted different meanings as it travelled from Arabia to Persia, Turkey, Africa and the Indian subcontinent. = Persian use = In Iran and Turkey the word normally refers to Rumi (Persian pronunciation Mowlana) (Turkish pronunciation Mevlana). = Africa = This word has been borrowed into the Swahili language, where it is used also as a title of respect for revered members of a community, religious or secular, roughly equivalent to the English \\"Sir\\". In the mostly Muslim region of West Africa, the root has been proposed as a source for the words Mallam (Hausa language) and Maame (Wolof language), which are used to denote Islamic scholars, or in areas practising folk Islam or folk magic, a local shaman. Among the Hausas the word Mallam is additionally used as equivalent of English Mr. A more likely explanation for this word (and for the Swahili mwalimu) is the Arabic word mu'allim (), which in Moroccan Arabic is pronounced \\"m'allam\\" and means ‚Äòteacher‚Äô or ‚Äòmaster‚Äô in a Qur'anic school.  Difference in titles Mullah and Maulvi among Muslims in South Asia  In the Central Asian and South Asian / Indian subcontinent context, where \\"Mullah\\" does not carry a formal sense, Maulana is often the word of choice for addressing or referring to Muslim religious scholars that are respected, while Mullah is used often derogatorily for people the speaker considers to be more rabble-rousers than scholars. Although the words Maulvi and Maulana are interchanged in the Indian Subcontinent as a title of respect, Maulana is more often associated with formal qualification following study at a madrassa or darul uloom and Maulvi is usually more a general title for religious figures. In Bangladesh, in the government Aliyah madrassa system, Maulvi is also associated with formal degrees for those who have passed the course of Maulvi (basic), Maulvi Alim (intermediate) or Maulvi Fazil (advanced).

They are formed for technical reasons so that members enjoy rights or benefits that would remain unavailable to them outside a formally recognised parliamentary group. Ireland In D√°il √âireann (the lower house of the Irish national parliament, the Oireachtas), prior to 2016, only parliamentary groups with seven TDs or more had full speaking rights under the house's standing orders. This meant that smaller parties and independent politicians would be unable to speak as often as parties with enough deputies to form their own groups. Prior to 1997, a technical group automatically came into being if there were seven or more independent TDs. From 1997, a group of TDs must agree to form a group. Under standing orders, only one technical group could exist at any time, with at least seven members and comprising a majority of deputies who are not members of another group in D√°il √âireann. In the wake of the 2016 Irish general election, which saw a significant increase in the number of TDs elected as independents or from small parties in the 32nd D√°il, the D√°il standing orders were extensively revised to reduce the minimum number for formation of a parliamentary group from seven TDs to five, and to allow multiple technical groups to exist in parallel. Recent examples of technical groups include: *27th D√°il: a group of nine deputies formed in 1992. *29th D√°il: a loose federation of 22 opposition deputies. *30th D√°il: a technical group was not created initially after the 2007 general election, because there were only five potential members ‚Äì Sinn F√©in's four deputies and the left-wing independent Tony Gregory. Most outgoing independents from the 29th D√°il lost their seats, Sinn F√©in was reduced to four, the six Green Party TDs became part of the government and three out of the four remaining independents made confidence-and-supply arrangements with the government. The election of Pearse Doherty of Sinn F√©in in a 2010 by- election allowed the formation of a group of seven, comprising the five Sinn F√©in TDs and the left-wing independents Finian McGrath and Maureen O'Sullivan. *31st Dail: after the 2011 general election, 16 of the 19 independent and United Left Alliance TDs agreed to form a technical group. Catherine Murphy was the group's whip, while Maureen O'Sullivan was assistant whip. Finian McGrath resigned as chairman in October 2012 when Mick Wallace rejoined the loose group, against the wishes of many of its members. The independent TDs who chose not to join this technical group were: Michael Healy-Rae, Michael Lowry and Noel Grealish. *32nd D√°il: Standing orders were revised to allow multiple technical groups to coexist. One group was formed between the three members of the Social Democrats and the two members of the Green Party. Another technical group was formed around the four members of Independents 4 Change, together with the non-party TDs Catherine Connolly, Thomas Pringle and Maureen O'Sullivan. A third group called the Rural Independents Group was also formed, comprising 7 members. European Parliament Political groups of the European Parliament are required by that parliament's standing orders to have a coherent \\"complexion\\" of political principles. Despite this rule, a \\"Technical Group of Independents\\" comprising members from dissimilar political ideologies has been formed on two occasions: from 1979 until 1984 and between 1999 and 2001. Such was the mixed nature of the latter group that it drew the disapproval of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which attempted to disband the group within months of its creation; after legal appeals, the disbandment was finally confirmed by a ruling of the European Court of Justice, making it unlikely that technical groups will reappear within the European Parliament in the future.  France  In France, during the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents, that is elected without formally belonging to a campaign party. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of Action Lib√©rale and the Radical-Socialist Republican Party). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an apparent√©, or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work. However, long before this the development of parliamentary committees during the First World War created an incentive to belong to a parliamentary party. As there were fourteen main parliamentary committees, and spaces for them were distributed to parliamentary parties first and independents last, the smaller parties and independents began to either attach themselves informally to a main political party (such loose associates of parliamentary parties were termed apparant√©s), or to band together to create ad-hoc technical groups for the duration of the legislature. In 1932, for instance, the French Chamber contained four technical groups: the left-of- centre Independent Left, with 12 deputies drawn from the Alsatian regional Communist and Radical parties as well as independent deputies of socialist or Radical temperament; the centre-rightconservative-liberal Independents of the Left, with 26 deputies; the right-wing agrarian Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action, with six deputies; and the far-right monarchist Independent Group, with 12 deputies. These four technical groups thus accounted for almost 10% of parliamentary seats.

The ‚Äúcall park‚Äù feature is activated by pressing a preprogrammed button (usually labelled ‚ÄúCall Park‚Äù) or a special sequence of buttons. This transfers the current telephone conversation to an unused extension number and immediately puts the conversation on hold. (This is called parking the call; and the call is said to have parked onto a certain extension. Essentially, call parking temporarily assigns an extension number to an incoming call.) The telephone system will then display the extension number of the parked call so that the call can later be retrieved. At this point, the telephone system will often provide an option for the person to make an announcement through a public address system (often consisting of some or all of the telephone sets and or overhead paging speakers controlled by the telephone system). Making such announcements in such a way is referred to as paging. To access the paging system, the user must enter the paging access code or press the \\"page\\" button on the telephone, and announce the call parked extension. An example would be at a grocery store where the bakery has a call parked. The user would say \\"Bakery you have a call parked on 627\\" and the bakery department would then dial 627 to access the call on hold. A set time is then provided for any person to retrieve the call by dialing the extension number of the parked call on any telephone set. If no one picks up the parked call within the set time, the telephone system may ring back the parked call. This transfers the parked call back to the person who originally parked the call. Uses of call parking Call parking is often useful in buildings with many offices or with more than one floor, and with most of the areas having access to one or more telephone sets. *If the desired called party is not the person who picked up the call, and the desired called party is at an unknown location, the person who picked up the call may park the call and then use the public address system to page the desired called party to pick up the call. *During a conversation, a person may need to go to another office for some reason (for example, to retrieve an important file); parking the call allows this person to continue the conversation after arriving at the other office.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the NXT brand under the ring name Roderick Strong. He is a member of the faction called The Undisputed Era (alongside Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, and Kyle O'Reilly). He is known for his 13-year tenure with Ring of Honor, where he is a former one-time ROH World Champion, a two-time ROH World Television Champion, and a one-time ROH World Tag Team Champion with Austin Aries. He is also known as the second ROH Triple Crown Champion. He debuted as The Jester on the Floridian independent circuit before quickly changing to his current name. He worked for IPW Hardcore and NWA Florida, before debuting for ROH in September 2003. In mid-2004, Strong joined forces with Alex Shelley, Austin Aries, and Jack Evans, collectively known as Generation Next. As part of Generation Next, Strong won the ROH World Tag Team Championship with Aries. Strong later turned on Aries, forming a new faction, the No Remorse Corps with Davey Richards and Rocky Romero. During this time, he was also competing for ROH's sister promotion, FIP, and debuted for PWG. Strong has also toured Japan with Dragon Gate and Pro Wrestling Noah and had a brief stint in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2005. In FIP, he has won the World Heavyweight Championship three times, and the Tag Team Championship twice, once with Erick Stevens and once with Rich Swann. In PWG, he is a one-time World Champion and a three-time World Tag Team Champion, having held the title with Davey Richards, Pac, and Jack Evans with each reign respectively. In addition, he is the only wrestler to win PWG's annual Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament with two different partners (PAC in 2007 and Evans in 2008). After signing with WWE, Strong initially debuted in NXT as a babyface before turning heel and joining the Undisputed Era, where he became a two-time NXT Tag Team Champion (both with O'Reilly) and a one-time NXT North American Champion. Early life Lindsey was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, but relocated to Florida at a young age. Following a troubled childhood, Lindsey graduated from Riverview High School, where he played American football. He attended the University of South Florida on an academic scholarship. Lindsey majored in business for two years before dropping out. Professional wrestling career = Early career (2000‚Äì2005) = In the autumn of 1994, Lindsey's father, a collegiate wrestler, began training as a wrestler under Jim Neidhart. After Lindsey attended several training sessions and met Harry Smith, a third generation wrestler, he decided to become a wrestler. Lindsey was also trained by his father, Neidhart and a number of other wrestlers in Tampa, Florida and debuted in 2000 as The Jester on the Floridian independent circuit for the RWA. Strong wrestled his first match for the Independent Professional Wrestling promotion, competing in a twenty-man cruiserweight Battle royal. He was initially one-third of a stable known as \\"Risk Factor\\" with The Kamikaze Kid and Kid Lethal before he formed a tag team with his trainee and kayfabe brother, Sedrick Strong. The Strong Brothers defeated Wrongful Death (Naphtali and Dagon Briggs) for the IPW Tag Team Championship on June 28, 2002 in St. Petersburg, Florida. They held the title until September 20, when they lost to Naturally Marvelous (Scoot Andrews and Mike Sullivan) in a steel cage match in which Roderick suffered a concussion. After Sedrick cost the Strong Brothers a number of matches, Roderick turned into a villain on February 8, 2003, betraying Sedrick and aligning himself with the Alliance of Defiance, a dominant villainous stable. After IPW closed down in late 2003, Strong began working for NWA Florida, a promotion which had had a working relationship with IPW for two years. Strong defeated David Babylon for the Florida Unified Cruiserweight Championship on July 19, 2003, in St. Petersburg. While Strong was champion, the title was renamed the Florida Unified Junior Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Jerrelle Clark in a four-way match on December 13, 2003 in St. Petersburg. Clark vacated the title on January 10, 2004, after winning the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, and Strong defeated Mikey Batts for the vacant title on February 21 in the New Alhambra Sports and Entertainment Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He lost the title to Sedrick Strong on April 29, 2004, in New Port Richey, Florida. In addition to wrestling for NWA Florida, Strong served as the head trainer of the territory's wrestling school. On January 13, 2005, Strong made a one-off appearance in World Wrestling Entertainment's SmackDown episode. On the episode, Strong was defeated by Kurt Angle in Angle's \\"3-Minute Hometown Hero Challenge\\". =Ring of Honor= Generation Next (2003‚Äì2007) Strong joined the Pennsylvania-based Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion in September 2003. On May 22, 2004, at Generation Next he formed a stable known as Generation Next with Alex Shelley, Austin Aries and Jack Evans. Generation Next quickly dominated the ROH roster, declaring themselves the future of wrestling. After defeating several others, they defeated CM Punk, Ace Steel, John Walters and Jimmy Jacobs (mentored by Ricky Steamboat) on October 2 at The Midnight Express Reunion. Strong began punctuating his ring style with stiff offense while acting as the enforcer of Generation Next. In November 2004 he formed a regular tag team with Evans, and on December 26 he, Evans, and Aries threw Shelley out of the group when he refused to resign as leader. Strong and Evans continued to team throughout early-2005, but were unable to win the ROH Tag Team Championship. On September 24 at 2005 Survival of the Fittest, Strong defeated Samoa Joe, Jay Lethal, Generation Next teammate Austin Aries, and Colt Cabana to win the titular event, thus earning himself another shot at the ROH World Championship in the future. On October 1 at Joe vs. Kobashi, valet Jade Chung aligned herself with Strong (and the remainder of Generation Next) after he defeated her former client, Jimmy Rave.

This villainous group is known as The Decade. On January 4, 2014, Strong was defeated by the returning A.J. Styles. Throughout 2014, Strong was ousted from The Decade after falling out with Adam Page, Strong then fended off an attack from Page and Whitmer to set up a match for Final Battle, and as a result, became a fan favorite once again.

After the ROH/NJPW events, Strong garnered high praise from wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, reporting that both Tanahashi and Nakamura were giving him \\"rave reviews\\". Following the ROH/NJPW events, Strong set his sights on the ROH World Championship. At Best in the World, Strong defeated Michael Elgin and Moose in a three-way match to become the number one contender to the ROH World Championship. Strong received his title match at Death Before Dishonor XIII, challenging Jay Lethal (also the ROH World Television Champion), but was unsuccessful as the match went to a 60-minute time-limit draw. After failing to capture the title, Roderick Strong began campaigning for a match against IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada, the only one of the top three NJPW talents (alongside Hiroshi Tanahashi and Shinsuke Nakamura) he had yet to wrestle. Okada accepted the challenge, setting the two up for a match at Field of Honor, where Okada was victorious.

Strong was successful in the match, capturing the TV title for the second time. Being a champion, Strong was placed on the Champions team with Lethal and the Kingdom against the new All-Stars team (after Styles and ACH had both been injured the previous night), turning the six-man tag team match into an eight-man tag team match. Strong's team was victorious, with Strong and Lethal being the only two remaining in the match. After the match, Strong had a stare-down with both Styles and Lethal. After being injured during the Survival of the Fittest tournament, Strong issued an open challenge for the upcoming Final Battle pay- per-view event, which was accepted by Bobby Fish, who had defeated him in a match on September 12.

It served alongside the regular army under Federal control several times, most notably during World War I, World War II, and the Cold War from 1950. Its home area is Southwestern Pennsylvania. As a National Guard unit, its main purpose is to assist the State Government in response to events which require more manpower or specialist skill that traditional first responders cannot provide, such as in large scale riots, and natural disasters. However, when in Federal service alongside the regular army its main purpose is to provide communications support to the units it is attached to. Lineage of the 28th Signal Battalion It was organized 12 September 1908 in the Pennsylvania National Guard at Pittsburgh as Company A, Signal Corps. It was redesignated 1 October 1912 as Field Company A, Signal Corps and redesignated again on 14 February 1916 as the Wire Company, Field Battalion, Signal Troops. It was mustered into federal service 29 June 1916 at Mount Gretna; mustered out of federal service 18 January 1917 as Company B, Field Battalion, Signal Troops. Again Mustered into federal service on 23 July 1917 at Pittsburgh as Company B, Field Battalion, Signal Corps; drafted into federal service 5 August 1917. It was Reorganized and redesignated 11 October 1917 as Company B, 103d Field Signal Battalion, an element of the 28th Division and demobilized 20 May 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey. It was reorganized by LTC Sidney A. Haderling and Major Walter A. Hardie and federally recognized 16 December 1921 in the Pennsylvania National Guard at Pittsburgh as the 28th Signal Company and assigned to the 28th Division (later redesignated as the 28th Infantry Division (United States)); inducted into federal service 17 February 1941 at Pittsburgh. and inactivated 27 October 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Reorganized and federally recognized 10 October at Pittsburgh, and ordered into active federal service 5 September 1950 at Pittsburgh. The 28th Signal Company (NGUS) organized and federally recognized 18 August 1953 at Pittsburgh. It was released 15 June 1954 from active federal service and reverted to state control; federal recognition concurrently withdrawn from the 28th Signal Company (NGUS). It was then expanded, reorganized, and redesignated 1 June 1959 as the 28th Signal Battalion with headquarters in Pittsburgh. Location of headquarters changed 1 August 1961 to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania., Retrieved 28 June 2019 In 1968, the battalion was called upon for the riots in Pittsburgh which followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In 1974, the battalion patrolled the streets of Pennsylvania and provided a communications net during the violent independent truckers strike. It has been called out for winter storms, floods and tornadoes on several occasions. In November 1993 the battalion was issued new equipment. Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) is the Army standard equipment for corps and below. The fielding took place during a three-week annual training period at Fort Indiantown Gap, PA. This was a massive undertaking which required approximately two years of planning and two years of fielding and training.

Established on 19 July 1979, it houses a representative sample of the Southern Andean Yungas biodiversity in good state of conservation. Located at the Ledesma Department on the eastern slopes of the Calilegua hills. and with an area of , it is the largest national park in the Argentine Northwest. History This area was occupied a long time ago by native groups. Their settlements were located in the lower knoll, near the farming grasslands. The archaeological pieces and sites found in the park, such as pottery and polished stone axes, are related to the communities that inhabited the Yungas region. From the 15th century on, this territory was occupied by the Incas. At present, this region is inhabited by Kolla communities. The park has a beautiful landscape, which you can see when transiting the Provincial Route 83 that runs through it. Along the route, you see three different environments: the jungle foothills, mountain forest and mountain woods, each with their own characteristic vegetation. It is also possible to see certain species of birds and mammals in particular, which makes this site an ideal place to observe wildlife, especially birds, about 270 species were identified and its estimated that 230 more could inhabit the area, which makes Calilegua the home of 50% of all bird species in the country and a paradise for birdwatching. The park is home to the jaguar, the largest South American predator, along with other cats like the jaguarundi, the ocelot, the puma and the pampas cat. The largest mammal in the Yungas, the tapir, also inhabits the reserve. Calilegua National Park and nearby towns offer a wide range of activities, with varying degrees of difficulty. The tours relate to ecotourism and active tourism, but the area offers a strong cultural imprint and you may visit several towns where the local contact is a highly valued experience for those interested in ethnic diversity and the discovery of local cultures. Climate The park has a subtropical climate with a dry winter season. Mean temperatures fluctuate between in winter to in summer. Summers are hot with temperatures reaching up to . In contrast, occasional frosts can occur at the high altitudes. The park receives of precipitation per year with most of it falling between November to April. During these months, rainfall is often intense.

It examines long time frames using a multidisciplinary approach based on combining numerous disciplines from science and the humanities, and explores human existence in the context of this bigger picture. It integrates studies of the cosmos, Earth, life, and humanity using empirical evidence to explore cause-and-effect relations, and is taught at universities and primary and secondary schools often using web-based interactive presentations.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4e9AQVlcJTQdxGeeApugAEomCc02lchm Historian David Christian has been credited with coining the term \\"Big History\\" while teaching one of the first such courses at Macquarie University.

It explores common themes and patterns. Courses generally do not focus on humans until one-third to halfway through, and, unlike conventional history courses, there is not much focus on kingdoms or civilizations or wars or national borders. If conventional history focuses on human civilization with humankind at the center, Big History focuses on the universe and shows how humankind fits within this framework and places human history in the wider context of the universe's history.Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 2008, Vol. 33, No. 2, Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. Published by Maney Conventional history often begins with the development of agriculture in civilizations such as Ancient Egypt. Control of fire by early humans predating both agriculture and civilization Unlike conventional history, Big History tends to go rapidly through detailed historical eras such as the Renaissance or Ancient Egypt. It draws on the latest findings from biology, astronomy, geology, climatology, prehistory, archaeology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, chemistry, psychology, hydrology, geography, paleontology, ancient history, physics, economics, cosmology, natural history, and population and environmental studies as well as standard history. One teacher explained: > We're taking the best evidence from physics and the best evidence from > chemistry and biology, and we're weaving it together into a story ... > They're not going to learn how to balance [chemical] equations, but they're > going to learn how the chemical elements came out of the death of stars, and > that's really interesting. Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self- contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history. Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the human race. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the Information Age, a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing. Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter- gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers. An account in The Boston Globe describes what it polemically asserts to be the conventional \\"history\\" view: > Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They > hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried > spears. Once in a while they scratched pictures of antelopes on the walls of > their caves.

It began when we > finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology. Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis. Advocates sometimes view conventional history as \\"microhistory\\" or \\"shallow history\\", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the \\"long march of human existence.\\" However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the \\"grand narrative\\" of Big History as a \\"clich√© that gets thrown around a lot.\\" One account suggested that conventional history had the \\"sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder.\\" It emphasizes long-term trends and processes rather than history-making individuals or events. Historian Dipesh Chakrabarty of the University of Chicago suggested that Big History was less politicized than contemporary history because it enables people to \\"take a step back.\\" It uses more kinds of evidence than the standard historical written records, such as fossils, tools, household items, pictures, structures, ecological changes and genetic variations. =Criticism of Big History= Critics of Big History, including sociologist Frank Furedi, have deemed the discipline an \\"anti- humanist turn of history.\\" The Big History narrative has also been challenged for failing to engage with the methodology of the conventional history discipline. According to historian and educator Sam Wineburg of Stanford University, Big History eschews the interpretation of texts in favor of a purely scientific approach, thus becoming \\"less history and more of a kind of evolutionary biology or quantum physics.\\" Others have pointed out that such criticisms of Big History removing the human element or not following a historical methodology seem to derive from observers who have not sufficiently looked into what Big History actually does, with most courses having one-third or half devoted to humanity, with the concept of increasing complexity giving humanity an important place, and with methods in the natural sciences being innately historical since they also attempt to gather evidence in order to craft a narrative.Baker, D. (2012). \\"Big History\\". Times Literary Supplement, (5713), 6. Currently, the Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, whose decolonial vision of history, economics and Science has opened new questions. In this sense, the transdisciplinary and biomimetics research of Javier Collado represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of native peoples, such as Indigenous peoples in Ecuador. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, spirituality, art, emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the history of science, specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the complexity sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of shamanism with ayahuasca and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet. In the same way that Fritjof Capra carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina is nourished by the worldview of their ancestor to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples. Themes Radiocarbon dating helps scientists understand the age of rocks as well as the Earth and the Solar System. Big History seeks to retell the \\"human story\\" in light of scientific advances by such methods as radiocarbon dating, genetic analysis, thermodynamic measurements of \\"free energy rate density\\", along with a host of methods employed in archaeology, anthropology, and world history. David Christian of Macquarie University has argued that the recent past is only understandable in terms of the \\"whole 14-billion-year span of time itself.\\" David Baker of Macquarie University has pointed out that not only do the physical principles of energy flows and complexity connect human history to the very start of the Universe, but the broadest view of human history many also supply the discipline of history with a \\"unifying theme\\" in the form of the concept of collective learning.Baker, David. \\"Collective Learning: A Potential Unifying Theme of Human History\\" Journal of World History (2015) vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 77‚Äì104 Big History also explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view. Big History seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang and explore the core transdisciplinary theme of increasing complexity as described by Eric Chaisson of Harvard University. =Time scales and questions= Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. David Christian believes such \\"radical shifts in perspective\\" will yield \\"new insights into familiar historical problems, from the nature/nurture debate to environmental history to the fundamental nature of change itself.\\" It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, iron emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war. The discipline addresses such questions as \\"How did we get here?,\\" \\"How do we decide what to believe?,\\" \\"How did Earth form?,\\" and \\"What is life?\\" According to Fred Spier it offers a \\"grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms\\" and helps students to become scientifically literate quickly. One interesting perspective that arises from Big History is that despite the vast temporal and spatial scales of the history of the Universe, it is actually very small pockets of the cosmos where most of the \\"history\\" is happening, due to the nature of complexity.John Green (David Baker, scriptwriter) Crash Course Big History: Exploring the Universe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi30zjQhtWY =Cosmic evolution= Cosmic evolution, the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the epic of evolution and astrobiology); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang ‚Üí Milky Way ‚Üí Sun ‚Üí Earth ‚Üí humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans) has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by astronomers and astrophysicists. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of natural history‚Äîa single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth. The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably Heraclitus, are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of Robert Chambers, Herbert Spencer, and Lawrence Henderson. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life‚Äîin short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. Harlow Shapley widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it \\"cosmography\\") in public venues at mid-century,Palmeri, J., \\"Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution,\\" in Cosmos & Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context, Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. and NASA embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited astrobiology program. Carl Sagan,Sagan, C., Cosmos, Random House, 1980, Eric Chaisson,Chaisson, E., Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life, Atlantic Monthly/Little, Brown, 1981, Hubert Reeves,Reeves, H., Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique, √âditions du Seuil, 1981 Erich Jantsch,Jantsch, E., The Self-Organizing Universe, Pergamon, 1980 and Preston Cloud,Cloud, P., Cosmos, Earth, and Man, Yale Univ. Press, 1980 among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.Chaisson, E.J., Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature, Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., Cosmos & Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context, NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. Dick, S. and Strick, J., The Living Universe, Rutgers University Press, 2004 One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at Harvard University since the mid-1970s.Chaisson, E.J.,\\"Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,\\" in From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology, Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), University of California Press, Berkeley, 2013. =Complexity, energy, thresholds= Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier‚Äîyet both are correct. These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs: ::Phases: physical evolution ‚Üí biological evolution ‚Üí cultural evolution ::Epochs: particulate ‚Üí galactic ‚Üí stellar ‚Üí planetary ‚Üí chemical ‚Üí biological ‚Üí cultural This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in physical cosmology. Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are Eric Chaisson's research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, thermodynamic systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.Chaisson, E.J.,Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature, Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. Chaisson, E.J.,\\"Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,\\" Complexity, Vol. 16, p. 27, 2011.Chaisson, E.J.,\\"Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,\\" Complexity, Vol. 17, p. 44, 2011. The observed increase of energy rate density (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an expanding universe that still obeys the cherished second law of thermodynamics and thus continues to accumulate net entropy. As such, ordered material systems‚Äîfrom buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings‚Äîare viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.\\"The Natural Science Underlying Big History,\\" The Scientific World Journal, v. 2014, 41 pp., 2014; . One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the absolute energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate density for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x1033 erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x1033 g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).Chaisson, E.J., \\"A unifying concept for astrobiology,\\" International Journal of Astrobiology, Vol. 2, p. 91, 2003. Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of \\"one damn thing after another\\". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.Chaisson, E.J., \\"Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,\\" in Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?, Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), Cambridge Univ. Press, 2013. Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.Spier, F., Big History and the Future of Humanity, Wiley- Blackwell, 2010 David Christian, in an 18-minute TED talk, described some of the basics of the Big History course. Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a \\"threshold moment\\" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile. Some of Christian's threshold stages are: In a supernova, a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as iron and gold to form. # The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second. # Stars are born. # Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system. # Earth is created. # Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the Goldilocks conditions, with neither too much nor too little energy. # Humans appear, language, collective learning. Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the biosphere with the powerful weapons that have been invented. In the 2008 lecture series through The Teaching Company's Great Courses entitled Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity, Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity: # The Big Bang and the creation of the Universe about roughly 14 billion years ago # The creation of the first complex objects, stars, about 12 billion years ago # The creation of chemical elements inside dying stars required for chemically-complex objects, including plants and animals # The formation of planets, such as our Earth, which are more chemically complex than the Sun # The origin and evolution of life from roughly about 4.2 billion years ago, including the evolution of our hominine ancestors # The development of our species, Homo sapiens, about 250,000 years ago, covering the Paleolithic era of human history # The appearance of agriculture about 11,000 years ago in the Neolithic era, allowing for larger, more complex societies # The \\"modern revolution\\", or the vast social, economic, and cultural transformations that brought the world into the modern era # What will happen in the future and predicting what will be the next threshold in our history =Goldilocks conditions= The Earth is ideally located in a Goldilocks condition‚Äîbeing neither too close nor too distant from the Sun. A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the Goldilocks principle, which describes how \\"circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist,\\" as emphasized by Spier in his recent book. For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of hydrogen, sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause nuclear fusion. Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water that permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds. Somewhat in contrast, Chaisson has maintained for well more than a decade that \\"organizational complexity is mostly governed by the optimum use of energy‚Äînot too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it\\". Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.Chaisson, E.J., \\"Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,\\" Complexity, v. 9, p. 14, 2004. =Other themes= Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as gene mapping to learn more about the origins of humanity. Advances in particular sciences such as archaeology, gene mapping, and evolutionary ecology have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources. One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to \\"upend\\" the conventional practice in historiography of relying on written records. Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting climate change throughout history, by such methods as slash-and-burn agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the Industrial Revolution. A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as coffee and tobacco, as well as other means such as religious rites or romance novels. His view is that culture and biology are highly intertwined, such that cultural practices may cause human brains to be wired differently from those in different societies. Another theme that has been actively discussed recently by the Big History community is the issue of the Big History Singularity. Nazaretyan A.P. 2017.

Big History is more likely than conventional history to be taught with interactive \\"video-heavy\\" websites without textbooks, according to one account. The discipline has benefited from having new ways of presenting themes and concepts in new formats, often supplemented by Internet and computer technology. For example, the ChronoZoom project is a way to explore the 14 billion year history of the universe in an interactive website format. It was described in one account: In 2012, the History channel showed the film History of the World in Two Hours. It showed how dinosaurs effectively dominated mammals for 160 million years until an asteroid impact wiped them out. One report suggested the History channel had won a sponsorship from StanChart to develop a Big History program entitled Mankind. In 2013 the History channel's new H2 network debuted the 10-part series Big History, narrated by Bryan Cranston and featuring David Christian and an assortment of historians, scientists and related experts. Each episode centered on a major Big History topic such as salt, mountains, cold, flight, water, meteors and megastructures. History of the field =Early efforts= Alexander von Humboldt in 1843 Astronomer Carl Sagan While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, Alexander von Humboldt's book Cosmos, and Robert Chambers' 1844 book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation were seen as early precursors to the field. In a sense, Darwin's theory of evolution was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist Julian Huxley originated the term \\"evolutionary humanism\\", while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin examined links between cosmic evolution and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, Eric Chaisson explored the subject of cosmic evolution quantitatively in terms of energy rate density, and the astronomer Carl Sagan wrote Cosmos. Thomas Berry, a cultural historian, and the academic Brian Swimme explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond organized religion. The famous 1968 Earthrise photo, taken by astronaut William Anders, may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies. The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the Cold War and the Space Race. Some early efforts were courses in Cosmic Evolution at Harvard University in the United States, and Universal History in the Soviet Union. One account suggested that the notable Earthrise photo, taken by William Anders during a lunar orbit by the Apollo 8, which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the environmental movement but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest. The French historian Fernand Braudel examined daily life with investigations of \\"large-scale historical forces like geology and climate\\". Physiologist Jared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel examined the interplay between geography and human evolution; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the Eurasian continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate. In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist Preston Cloud of the University of Minnesota, astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at Evergreen State College in Washington state, and Harvard University astrophysicists George B. Field and Eric Chaisson started synthesizing knowledge to form a \\"science-based history of everything\\", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books. In 1980, the Austrian philosopher Erich Jantsch wrote The Self-Organizing Universe which viewed history in terms of what he called \\"process structures\\". There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear. In 1991 Clive Ponting wrote A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter \\"Foundations of History\\" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period. Sometimes the terms \\"Deep History\\" and \\"Big History\\" are interchangeable, but sometimes \\"Deep History\\" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself. =David Christian= One exponent is David Christian of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.Christian was also affiliated with San Diego State University in California.San Diego State University He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989. He developed a college course beginning with the Big Bang to the present in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a Teaching Company course entitled Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity, with 24 hours of lectures, which appeared in 2008. Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the University of Amsterdam and the Eindhoven University of Technology, college courses were offered. In 1996, Fred Spier wrote The Structure of Big History. Spier looked at structured processes which he termed \\"regimes\\": Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist Bill Gates, who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian: =Educational courses= By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world. Cynthia Stokes Brown initiated Big History at the Dominican University of California, and she wrote Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present. In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject. A course description reads: The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, University of California Press published Teaching Big History, a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke. Teaching Big History. University of California Press, 2015. Big History is taught at the University of Southern Maine. Barry Rodrigue, at the University of Southern Maine, established the first general education course and the first online version, which has drawn students from around the world. The University of Queensland in Australia offers an undergraduate course entitled Global History, required for all history majors, which \\"surveys how powerful forces and factors at work on large time-scales have shaped human history\\". By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a \\"coherent form of research and teaching\\" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines. Philanthropist Bill Gates is a major advocate of encouraging instruction in Big History. There are efforts to bring Big History to younger students. In 2008, Christian and his colleagues began developing a course for secondary school students. In 2011, a pilot high school course was taught to 3,000 kids in 50 high schools worldwide. In 2012, there were 87 schools, with 50 in the United States, teaching Big History, with the pilot program set to double in 2013 for students in the ninth and tenth grades, and even in one middle school. The subject is a STEM course at one high school. There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by philanthropist Bill Gates from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students. =International Big History Association= Founding members of the International Big History Association gathered at Coldigioco, Italy in 2010 The International Big History Association (IBHA) was founded at the Coldigioco Geological Observatory in Coldigioco, Marche, Italy, on 20 August 2010.

Cayetano Arellano had occupied a high position in Aguinaldo's government. He worked with the Americans under General Otis and re-established the Audiencia Territorial as the Supreme Court. He served as Chief Justice from 1901 until his retirement on April 12, 1920, making him the longest serving chief justice in Philippine history. Early life Historical marker installed for Arellano in 1970 at the site of his birthplace. He was born in Udyong (now Orion), Bataan to Servando Arellano, a working Spaniard and Crispora Lonz√≥n, a meeting in Bataan. He started as a working student in Colegio de San Juan de Letran. After finishing his high school he transferred to University of Santo Tomas, where he finished his Bachelor of Philosophy in 1862 and Bachelor of Theology in 1867, he then continued studying and finished law in 1876. During the Spanish regime, he was appointed as a Magistrado Suplente of the Audiencia Tribunal de Manila. He later become the Chief Justice of the Provisional Supreme Court created by the military in 1899. Arellano, together with Pedro Paterno, Benito Legarda, Florentino Torres and Felipe Buencamino, testified before the Schurman Commission that the Philippines was not yet ready for self-rule. They together form the Federal Party to \\"promote the annexation of the Philippines as a state\\". In lieu of this objective, they petitioned the U.S. Congress to create representation, as well as a Philippine Congress and a federal Court. Upon the onset of the American civil government in 1901, William Howard Taft appointed Arellano as the first Supreme Court Chief Justice. Personal life He was married with housewife Rosa Bernas with daughter Asuncion B. Arellano.

McKittrick wrote the screenplay while working as a waiter. The script was initially sold in a film deal to Artisan Entertainment, but was released by Lions Gate Entertainment (which purchased Artisan in 2003). Producers Chris Moore and Jeff Balis of Live Planet's Project Greenlight fame also took notice of the project and assisted. The film made over US$6,000,000, more than twice the budget of the film, in its opening weekend.  Plot  Dean (Justin Long) has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his directionless life. Dean's roommate and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his prot√©g√©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex- girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddimus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride). The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the \\"Penis Showing Game,\\" which was referred to informally as the \\"penis game\\" in some movie reviews, including the Toronto Star and BBC in film reviews from 2005 and 2006 respectively). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. Minutes before the restaurant closes, however, Chett and his girlfriend come in for dinner and leave Dean a hefty tip out of pity. This prompts Dean to quit his job--turning down an assistant manager position Dan offered him at the beginning of the film--to seek a more promising future. When the shift ends, the staff head to a party at Monty and Dean's house. At the party, Monty - who has a predilection for sleeping with teenage girls - is able to resist having sex with Natasha, although he says they will have sex the following Wednesday, when she will be 18. Calvin attempts to fix his relationship problems, and Mitch finally speaks, calling out his coworkers on their problems and quitting. He concludes by giving them all The Goat from the \\"Penis Showing Game\\", which Raddimus had told him earlier would instantly grant him god- status. Sure enough, Monty swears his undying allegiance to Mitch, telling Dean he's been \\"replaced.\\" The film ends with the staff talking about the incident with Mitch, and Dan showing up at a disgruntled customer's house after Natasha gave him the wrong address to the party on purpose.  Cast  Critical reception Waiting... received mixed to mostly negative reviews. , the film holds a 30% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 92 reviews with an average rating of 4.18 out of 10; the site's consensus states: \\"Waiting... is a gross-out comedy that's more gross than comic.\\" Metacritic gave the film a 30/100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a 1.5 stars out of 4 claiming that \\"Waiting... is melancholy for comedy\\".  Box office The film grossed over double its budget during the opening weekend with $6,021,106 in 1,652 theaters. It opened at #7 in the U.S. box office. Its total gross was $18,637,690 with $16,124,543 within the U.S. and $2,513,147 in foreign markets.  Soundtrack  The original score for the film was composed by Adam Gorgoni. A soundtrack was released and is available only through the iTunes Store.

The engine sits just forward of the transom while the drive unit (outdrive or drive leg) lies outside the hull. Operation The drive unit (outdrive) carries power from the inboard engine, typically mounted above the waterline, outboard through the transom and downward to the propeller below the waterline. The outdrive resembles the bottom half of an outboard motor and is composed of two sub-units: an upper containing a driveshaft connected through the transom to an engine which transmits power to a 90-degree-angle gearbox; and the lower containing a vertical driveshaft receiving power from the upper unit gearbox, transmitted through another 90-degree-angle gearbox to the propeller shaft. The boat is steered by pivoting the outdrive, as on an outboard motor; no rudder is needed. The outdrive is pivoted up for trailer travel and between uses to avoid fouling. The outdrive can be matched with a variety of engines in the appropriate power range; upper and lower units can often be purchased separately to customize gear ratios and propeller RPM, and lower units are also available with counter-rotating gearing to provide balanced torque in dual-drive installations. Sterndrive engines are similar to those used in true inboard systems. Historically the most popular in North America were \\"marinised\\" versions of Chevrolet and Ford V-8 automotive engines. In Europe diesel engines are more popular, ranging up to 400 hp in models such as the Volvo Penta D6A-400. Other brands of sterndrive include MerCruiser (produced by Brunswick Corporation's Mercury Marine, which also manufactures outboard motors). Mercruiser have a slightly larger market share in the USA, while in Europe Volvo Penta has an approximate 80% market share. History The history of stern drive power begins in the First World War with the production of the MAS of Isotta Fraschini, with two counter-rotating propellers. In 1948, Mercury Marine engineer Charlie Strang mated an aluminum car racing engine to the lower unit of an outboard motor, creating a marine propulsion system more powerful than the outboard motors available at the time. During the 1950s, he and fellow engineer Jim Wynne worked at Mercury under founder Carl Kiekhaefer, who was initially dismissive of and opposed to a technology that would later capture 80% of the market. In 1959 Wynne left Kiekhaefer and in less than 90 days developed his own stern drive, which he subsequently patented. The first commercial introduction of sterndrives was the Volvo Penta \\"Aquamatic\\" at the 1959 New York Motor Boat Show. Kiekhaefer introduced a MerCruiser outdrive in 1961 at the Chicago Boat Show. By 1962, 16 manufacturers were producing sterndrives. There was also the Outboard Marine Corporation (O.M.C.); however, due to several patent wars, O.M.C. ceased production. Characteristics Advantages of the sterndrive system versus outboards include higher available horsepower per engine and a clean transom with no cutouts for the outboard installation and no protruding powerhead, which makes for easier ingress and egress for pleasure boat passengers, easier fishing and easier retrieval in rescue situations. Advantages of the sterndrive system versus inboards include simpler engineering for boatbuilders, eliminating the need for them to design propshaft and rudder systems; ease of trailering and shallow water maneuvering (with the drive trimmed up); also, a significant space savings with the engine mounted all the way aft, freeing up the boat's interior volume for occupancy space. This is of particular significance to consumers who are interested in \\"pocket cruisers,\\" boats which have amenities like a head, a galley, and separate sleeping quarters in a boat less than 30 feet in length. The main disadvantages of sterndrives versus straight inboards is that they are more exposed. There are hoses, rubber bellows and oil lines in the water which can be damaged. There are also more components in the water which are exposed to corrosion. Maintenance on I/Os is more complicated than outboards in several ways, less in others. While sterndrive engines are not as readily removable as smaller outboards, larger outboards (which combine both large powerheads and outdrives) are bigger, bulkier, and heavier than separate engine and outdrive components on sterndrives. Sterndrive engine compartments may be cramped; however components are neither as tightly engineered nor physically as compressed and densely packed as outboards, which all must fit under a streamlined integrated cover. With both inboards and stern drives there is a fire and explosion hazard from gasoline fuel vapors within the engine compartment. Typically these boats must run a blower for several minutes prior to starting the engine, and when idling or moving below cruise speed. The blower exchanges the air within the engine compartment with fresh outside air. Because of their practical advantages and attractive cost, sterndrives have become extremely popular especially for use in pleasure boats, and there are many models of boats for which sterndrive power is the only available propulsion offered.

During their initial UK tour of April 1996, with contemporary punk bands PMT and The Filth, The Loonies were billed as \\"a vicious headbutt between Johnny Moped and Jello Biafra\\". The band was featured in the UK's Channel 4 documentary, Punx Picnic. The Bus Station Loonies were the first band to set the official world record for the most concerts/gigs performed in 12 hours (25 different shows) on 29 Sept 2001 in and around Plymouth, Devon, UK raising money to buy musical equipment for pupils of the Dame Hannah Rogers (special needs) school in Ivybridge, Devon. The band featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, until 2006, when the record was beaten.

He played in Major League Baseball from to , originally as a catcher before converting to an outfielder and designated hitter later in his career. Downing spent the majority of his baseball career as a member of the California Angels, helping them win their first American League Western Division title in and then two more division titles in and . When he left the Angels in 1990, he was the team's all-time leader in almost every major offensive category. Downing was inducted into the California Angels Hall of Fame in 2009. He also played for the Chicago White Sox and the Texas Rangers. Baseball career = Chicago White Sox (1973‚Äì1977) = Downing played at Magnolia High School in Anaheim, California, and was originally cut from his high school team. Although he was on the \\"taxi squad\\" as a bullpen catcher, he failed to make the team at Cypress College.Halo Magazine, Vol. 1 Book 1, 1986 However, he had an impressive showing at an \\"all comers\\" Chicago White Sox tryout, and scout Bill Lentini signed him as an amateur free agent on August 19, 1969. His early career with the White Sox (1973‚Äì1977) was not so promising. On the first pitch of his first inning in his first Major League game, he severely damaged his knee making a diving catch near third base, sliding down the dugout steps and landing on the 60-day DL. He hit .225 as a rookie catcher (1974), and .240 in his second year, with seven home runs in 138 games. = California Angels (1978‚Äì1990)= Downing was dealt along with Chris Knapp and Dave Frost from the White Sox to the California Angels for Bobby Bonds, Richard Dotson and Thad Bosley on December 5, 1977. The trade allowed him to return home to Southern California and avoid the pressures of Chicago fans' expectations. It also gave his career new life. Although his 1978 numbers were uninspiring (.255 batting average, 7 home runs, 46 runs batted in), in the offseason he committed to serious weight training and in 1979 dramatically changed his batting stance, and hit .326 (third in the American League). He also made the AL All-Star team for the first and only time. A broken ankle in 1980 forced him to move from catcher to the outfield beginning in 1981 because his offense was so valuable. Although his range was not great for an outfielder, Downing's hard work and steady hands allowed him to play the entire 1982 and 1984 seasons without making an error.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/downibr01.shtml He also set a pair of AL records with 244 errorless games by an OF (5/25/81 ‚Äì 7/21/83), and most chances (330) in an errorless season (1982). His continued weight training helped him hit 20+ home runs in six of the seven seasons from 1982 to 1988. In 1985 Downing played himself when Louise Jefferson sneaked into the Angels' locker-room looking for Reggie Jackson in an episode of The Jeffersons. When he played his last game for the Angels after 13 seasons, he was their career leader in games, at bats, runs, hits, total bases, doubles, home runs, runs batted in, singles, extra base hits, hit by pitches, sacrifice flies and bases on balls. On April 9, 2009, Downing was to be inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame along with former teammate Chuck Finley before the start of the game that day. However, due to the death of Angels rookie pitcher Nick Adenhart, the ceremony and game were postponed until August 27, 2009.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-aug-28-sp-angels- fyi28-story.html = Texas Rangers (1991‚Äì1992)= Downing played his final two seasons with the Texas Rangers as a designated hitter. He retired at age 41, getting his last hit on the last day of the 1992 season ‚Äì a single off Angels' pitcher Bert Blyleven. He finished his career with a .267 average, 275 home runs, 1073 runs batted in, and 1188 runs scored. He was an American League All-Star in 1979 when he hit .326 with 12 home runs, 75 runs batted in, and 81 runs scored. His best all-around season came in 1982 when he hit 28 home runs, had 84 runs batted in, scored 109 runs and hit .281. Downing set single-season career highs with 95 runs batted in during 1986 and 29 home runs, 110 runs scored and an American League-leading 106 walks in 1987.

Benson and her band rose to fame in the 1940s, headlining variety theatres and topping the bill at the London Palladium, and became the BBC's resident house band. Early years Benson was born on 11 November 1913 in Holbeck, Leeds, the daughter of Douglas Rolland \\"Digger\\" Benson and his wife Mary Jane Mead. Her father, a musician who played several instruments including trombone for the Leeds Symphony Orchestra, began teaching her the piano at the age of five. She played at working men's clubs from the age of eight, billed as Baby Benson, and performed on BBC Radio's Children's Hour aged nine. Ivy's father had ambitions for her to become a concert pianist, but she was inspired to become a jazz musician after hearing a Benny Goodman record and learned to play clarinet and alto saxophone. She left school at 14 and took a job at the Montague Burton factory in Leeds, putting aside half a crown from her wages each week to save up for her first saxophone. She supplemented her income by playing in dance bands in the evenings. Career Benson joined Yorkshire-based six-piece band Edna Croudson's Rhythm Girls in 1929, touring with them until 1935, after which she toured with various bands including Teddy Joyce and the Girlfriends where she became a featured soloist. She moved to London in the late 1930s and formed her own band. Their first significant engagement was performing with the all-female revue Meet the Girls, which starred Hylda Baker. During the Second World War, opportunities for female musicians opened up as many male musicians were enlisted into the armed forces. The band became the BBC's resident dance band in 1943, and were top of the bill at the London Palladium for six months in 1944. In 1945 the band were the first entertainers invited to perform at the VE Day celebrations in Berlin at the request of Field Marshal Montgomery, and on Christmas Day that year they performed for a live BBC Radio broadcast from Hamburg immediately after the King's speech. Benson and her band also toured Europe and the Middle East with the Entertainments National Service Association entertaining Allied troops, headlined variety theatres and performed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Benson's band had a high turnover of musicians, as they frequently left to marry G.I.s they met while touring. She once commented, \\"I lost seven in one year to America. Only the other week a girl slipped away from the stage. I thought she was going to the lavatory but she went off with a G.I. Nobody's seen her since.\\" In the 1950s, she played summer seasons at Butlins holiday camps and Villa Marina on the Isle of Man. She continued to lead the band until the early 1980s, adapting to changing tastes by adding pop tunes to the band's repertoire in the 1960s. Reproduced in The band played for overseas-based servicemen until the 1970s. Towards the end of her career the band played mostly private functions as dance halls and variety theatres declined. The band disbanded in 1982 after a final performance at the Savoy Hotel, briefly reforming in 1983 for a performance on Russell Harty's television show to celebrate Benson's 70th birthday. =Film and television appearances= In 1943 Benson appeared as herself with a speaking role in the feature film The Dummy Talks, which starred Jack Warner. She and the band were scheduled to take part in a BBC Television broadcast in 1946, but were forced to cancel 48 hours before they were due to go on air following a dispute with the Stoll Theatres Corporation, who she was contracted to. Stoll advised her that she faced a ban from their theatres, saying that they considered that television \\"will be a great detriment to the theatre\\". Benson and the band appeared on the television series The Music Box in 1957. She was the subject of an episode of the UK tribute show This Is Your Life in 1976. Personal life Benson married theatrical producer Caryll Stafford Clark in 1949; they were divorced in 1951. In 1957 she married Top Sergeant Brantley Callaway of the United States Air Force, whom she met while performing in a summer season on the Isle of Man. The marriage ended after she refused to accompany him when he returned to the United States in 1963 and they were divorced in 1964. An operation left her unable to have children. Later years Benson retired to the seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, occasionally entertaining local holidaymakers on the electric organ. A few months before her death in 1993 she became close friends with the actor Sean Pertwee. Pertwee had sought her advice about his upcoming portrayal of a troubled trombonist and drag queen in the film Dirty Weekend. She suffered a heart attack at her home and died on 6 May 1993, aged 79. Honours Ivy Benson Blue Plaque Benson was made an honorary fellow of Leeds Polytechnic in 1988, the only significant honour she received during her lifetime. In 2011 she was commemorated by Leeds Civic Trust with a blue plaque placed at her childhood home in Cemetery Road, Holbeck. Ivy Benson has a ward named after her in Clacton Hospital. Cultural references In 1984 The Silver Lady, a play by Liane Aukin based on Benson's life, was staged at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Benson and her band have been suggested as a possible basis for Alan Plater's TV film The Last of the Blonde Bombshells and play Blonde Bombshells of 1943, in which a woman reunites her wartime all- female band.

It is governed as a unitary state under a presidential representative and democratic and a constitutional republic where the President functions as both the head of state and the head of government of the country within a pluriform multi-party system. The government has three interdependent branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. The powers of the branches are vested by the Constitution of the Philippines in the following: Legislative power is vested in the two- chamber Congress of the Philippines‚Äîthe Senate is the upper chamber and the House of Representatives is the lower chamber. Executive power is exercised by the government under the leadership of the President. Judicial power is vested in the courts with the Supreme Court of the Philippines as the highest judicial body. Legislative power The legislative power is vested in the Congress of the Philippines which consists of the Senate of the Philippines and the House of Representatives. The upper house is located in Pasay City, while the lower house is located in Quezon City. Both are in Metro Manila. The district and sectoral representatives are elected for a term of three years. They can be re-elected but they may not run for a fourth consecutive term. Senators are elected to a term of six years. They can be re-elected but may not run for a third consecutive term. The House of Representatives may opt to pass for a vacancy of a legislative seat, which leads to a special election. The winner of the special election will serve the unfinished term of the previous district representative, and will be considered as one elective term. The same rule also applies in the Senate, however it only applies if the seat was vacated before a regular legislative election. The current President of the Senate is Vicente Sotto, III, while the current Speaker of the House of Representatives is Alan Peter Cayetano. Legislative power: National government *Senate *House of Representatives Local government *Sangguniang Panlalawigan *Regional Legislative Assembly *Sangguniang Panlungsod *Sangguniang Bayan *Sangguniang Barangay Executive power The highest official is elected separately from the President by popular vote.

Ophidicism (an act associated with ophidiophilia) is a sexual act in which a woman inserts the tail of a snake or eel in her vagina or anus, and receives pleasure as it wriggles to get free. It can be dangerous in that some reptiles carry salmonella. Ophidicism has been documented as being practiced (as well as many other sexual acts) in Ancient Greece.

The company also owned and operated power generation assets. It previously operated under the name UtiliCorp United, Inc. The company at one time ranked #33 on the Fortune 500 list. On February 6, 2007, the company announced plans for a merger valued at $1.7 billion to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. In conjunction with the merger Black Hills Corporation is to acquire its Colorado electric utility and the Colorado, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska gas utilities for $940 million. The merger closed on July 14, 2008, and Aquila now operates under the name Black Hills Energy. History =Solomon Valley Milling Company= Aquila has its roots in the Solomon Valley Milling Company founded in 1902 by Lemuel K. Green in Osborne, Kansas. The steam mill used to process flour and Green discovered he could sell electricity. In 1908 sold the mill and bought the H. M. Spalding Electric Light Plant in Concordia, Kansas. Prior to Green's purchase the plant generated power only dawn to midnight and was closed on Sundays. Green bought power from another flour mill and began selling power to neighboring towns. =Green Power & Light Company= In 1916 he sold the plant to the A.E. Fitkin & Company in New York City for $550,000. He then bought the Reeder Light, Ice & Fuel Company in Pleasant Hill, Missouri and renamed the company Green Power & Light Company. He then built Baldwin Lake which was used for hydroelectric power as well as provide water for the community. =West Missouri Power Company= In 1922 looking to expand with a generating plant at Clinton, Missouri he took the company public under the name West Missouri Power Company. Its chief rival in the Kansas City metropolitan area was Kansas City Power & Light. The company continued to expand through southwest Missouri. =Missouri Public Service Company= In 1926 he sold it to the Fitkin Group again which merged with the Missouri Public Service Company. Green retired to Escondido, California where bought a orange grove. He died in 1930. The Public Utilities Act of 1935 broke up utilities. Green's son Ralph Green bought controlling interest in Missouri Public Service. Green was to bring in Middle West Corporation, Missouri Gas & Electric Service Company and City Light and Traction Company of Sedalia, Missouri. =UtiliCorp United Inc.= Ralph Green died in 1962 and his son Richard Green took the helm. Richard Green, Jr. took over in 1982. The latest Green looked to expand it beyond its Missouri base and it was renamed UtiliCorp United Inc. in 1985. It bought People's Natural Gas, Northern Minnesota Utilities, West Virginia Power, West Kootenay Power and Light in British Columbia, and Michigan Gas Utilities. In 1989 it assigned its unregulated gas operations to a newly created subsidiary, Aquila Energy Corp. The acquisitions were done by issuing stock and reducing Green family control. In 1991, Centel sold its electric utility holdings in Kansas and Colorado to UtiliCorp for $345 million which operated under the name WestPlains Energy. Before then, Centel in Colorado was known as Southern Colorado Power Company which was later changed to Centel Electric-Southern Colorado Power Division. Centel in Kansas was previously Western Power and Gas which was changed to Centel Electric-Western Power Division. In 1992 the company entered into a joint venture to distribute and market natural gas in the United Kingdom. From 1995 to 2000 it bought interest in utilities in New Zealand and Australia. In some markets Utilicorp placed electric and phone bills on the same bill. West Virginia Power was sold to Allegheny Energy in 1999, becoming part of its Monongahela Power subsidiary. =Aquila, Inc.= In 2001 UtiliCorp spun off Aquila but then bought it back in 2002 and then renamed the entire corporation Aquila, Inc. Aquila's stock price peaked at $37.55 in May 2001 and it ranked #33 on the Fortune 500. The stock plummeted to $6.75 in July 2002 in the wake of the Enron scandal which had called into question business practices of all electric utilities. In 2004 five lawsuits were filed in federal court alleging that Aquila's board of directors steered employees into heavily investing their retirement savings in company stock. On Jan. 26, 2005, these suits were folded into a single class action alleging top company officials violated the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act requiring that employers manage employees retirement programs responsibly. The company settled the case for $10.5 million in April 2007. 66,000 of the company's customers in Missouri lost power for several days in the Mid-December 2007 North American Winter storms. The company began selling its assets and dropped to 891 on the Fortune list in 2007. In 2007 its electric assets in northwest Missouri were acquired by its historic rival Kansas City Power & Light (via its new parent Great Plains Energy) for $1.7 billion. Its gas properties, as well as its electric service area in southeastern Colorado (including Pueblo), were acquired by Black Hills Corporation. In 2006, Aquila Networks sold the Kansas electric properties to Mid-Kansas Electric Company (a cooperative). The Mid-Kansas Electric Company consists of six electric cooperatives: Lane-Scott Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Dighton), Prairie Land Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Norton), Pioneer Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Ulysses)(the old Aquila territory for Pioneer is operating as Southern Pioneer Electric Company), Victory Electric Cooperative Association, Inc. (Dodge City), Western Cooperative Electric Association (WaKeeney) and Wheatland Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Scott City) The Kansas gas operations were sold to Empire District Electric Company.

It belongs to the application layer of the Internet protocol suite. EForward uses a three-part (client-server-client) model, capable of handling any file type without further processing.  Overview  Eforward was created in 1992 and in 1999 was assigned the IP port number 2181 by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The protocol continues to be used under the Secure Easy IM (Seim) name. Originally the protocol was peer to peer but was changed to client server with peer to peer features. The protocol has both encrypted and unencrypted modes. The encryption is highly automatic and has been patented. EForward uses one port, 2181, in either TCP or UDP mode to transfer files between a client and the server. The major objective of the protocol is to provide a known level of service: The documents sent from one client to another should never be in an unknown state, at any time. This is done by having the server keep track of the state of all the messages, and having it be the definitive status keeper. The other objective of the protocol is to allow clients to connect at their convenience for either sending or receiving data: They can send to any other client at any time, and receive any messages they have been sent to them at any time. Alternatively, they can be notified by the server when they have new messages. = Stages = In general communication via EForward happens in three stages: # Client A sends a message for Client B to the server. # Client B is notified by the server that there are new messages for it. # Client B retrieves the message from the server. = Uses = EForward is designed specifically to transport documents between companies, particularly when the loss of a document cannot be allowed. Currently it is primarily used by the shipping/transport industry to handle shipping instructions and messages between shipping companies, ports, manufacturers and resalers.

It is the oldest religious order dedicated to education, and the main occupation of the Piarist fathers is teaching children and youth, the primary goal being to provide free education for poor children. The Piarist practice was to become a model for numerous later Catholic societies devoted to teaching, while some state-supported public school systems in Europe also followed their example. The Piarists have had a considerable success in the education of physically or mentally disabled persons. Some notable individuals taught at Piarist schools include Pope Pius IX, Goya, Schubert, Gregor Mendel, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko and Victor Hugo. History =Joseph Calasanz= Joseph Calasanctius (also known as Joseph Calasanz or Jos√© de Calasanz, and whose religious name was Josephus a Mater Dei), was born in 1557. He founded the first Catholic teaching order and had it initially recognized as a religious congregation by the Holy See on 6 March 1617.Piarist Fathers USA Province Calasanz, a native of Peralta de la Sal in the Spanish province of Huesca in Aragon, was born on 11 September 1557. He was the youngest of eight children, and he studied at Lleida and Alcal√°, and after his ordination to the priesthood on December 17, 1583, by the Bishop of Urgel, he moved to Rome (1592) where he organized, in 1607, a brotherhood. In November 1597, he opened the first free public school in Europe at Santa Dorotea. While it was considered a school of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, it was unique from the 22 other schools of the Confraternity, which just taught Catechism classes. The school opened by St. Joseph Calasanz also taught secular subjects. The Pious Schools expanded and were financially supported by Popes Clement VIII and Paul V. St. Joseph suffered a crippling accident, but it did not stop him.Mershman, Francis. \\"St. Joseph Calasanctius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 26 Jun. 2013 On 6 March 1617, the Piarist Fathers became an independent congregation called the \\"Pauline Congregation of the Poor of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools\\" when Pope Paul V issued his brief \\"Ad ea per quae.\\" On 25 March 1617, Calasanz and fourteen other priests became the first members of the new community when they received the religious habit.\\"About the Piarist Fathers\\", The Piarist Fathers' Appalachian Mission Calasanz was placed in charge of the new congregation, and he changed his name to Joseph of the Mother of God, thus inaugurating the practice of dropping the family name on entering the religious life.\\"History of the Order\\", The Piarist Fathers The new congregation was the first religious institute dedicated to teaching. To the three usual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, the new congregation added a fourth vow, that of dedication to the Christian education of youth, especially the poor. Soon the Pious Schools began to expand outside of Rome. In June 1616, St. Joseph Calasanz opened a foundation of the Pious Schools at Tusculo in the summer resort of Frascati. The school, which is still in operation, opened in August 1616, and St. Joseph brought to it a painting of the Mother of God, Our Lady of Grace. He then opened schools in Narni (1618), which is located 42 miles from Rome and is where he completed writing his Constitutions, Moricone (1619), Magliano (1620), and Norcia, Carcare, and Fonano (all 1621). The congregation was made a religious order 18 November 1621 by a brief of Pope Gregory XV, under the name of Congregatio Clericorum Regularium Pauperum Matris Dei Scholarum Piarum. The term \\"Pauline\\" was dropped by this pope, although it had been part of the original name due to Pope Paul V. The constitutions were approved 31 January 1622 by Gregory XV, and had all the privileges of the mendicant orders conferred upon it, Calasanz being recognized as general superior, his four assistants being Blessed Pietro Casani, Viviano Vivani, Francesco Castelli and Paolo Ottonelli. On May 7 of the same year the novitiate of St. Onofrio was opened. The Order began growing rapidly. It soon expanded into Liguria, and between 1621-1632, established schools at Carcare, Savona, two at Genoa, and a short-lived one at Carmagnola. The first Piarist province was established in 1623 in Liguria. The Roman Province would be formally established in 1626. Meanwhile, in Rome, Cardinal Tonti gave a property to St. Joseph, which opened in 1630 with 8 students as Collegio Nazareno. It soon became the flagship school of the Pious Schools in Rome. There was a failed attempt in 1625 to establish schools in Naples, but after another attempt, the Province of Naples would be established in 1627. Between 1630-1641), several schools were opened in Tuscany. They were closed briefly following an outbreak of the plague, but they were soon reopened, and Tuscany would become a province in 1630. One of the most famous of these schools was the school at Abacus, which emphasized mathematics and science. It also offered an Algebra course for adults, and it opened a School for Nobles. In 2007, the four Italian provinces merged into a single Italian Province.[Saint Joseph Calasanctius.Madrid: Paseo De La Direccion 5, 17 Jul. 1974] Next, the Pious schools expanded into Central Europe. Cardinal Dietrichstein invited the Pious Schools to come to Moravia, which is now part of the Czech Republic. On April 2, 1631, the Laurentine School was opened in Nikolsburg (Mikulov) with eight teachers and nine students. Within a week the number of students increased to sixteen, and within a month there were over 100 students. In 1634, a novitiate was opened in Lipn√≠k nad Beƒçvou, and in 1640 a school was opened in Litomysl in Bohemia. The first Piarist province established outside of Italy was the Province of Bohemia and Moravia, which was established in 1634. Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski was instrumental in bringing the Pious Schools into Poland and Hungary, which soon became the countries with the two largest number of Piarist Foundations in Central Europe, with 28 foundations in Poland and 29 in Hungary. In 1642, King Ladislaus IV invited the Pious Schools to establish a foundation in Warsaw, followed by a school in Podolinec. The Piarist Province of Germany and Poland was established in 1642. Prince Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski introduced the Order into Poland, and he is considered the creator of the Province of Hungary, which came about from the school in Podolinec, located on the boundary line with Poland. The first Piarist school was opened in Hungary in 1642. The Pious Schools next expanded to the two large islands off the coast of Italy where they opened houses in Palermo and Messina in Sicily and then opened two houses at Cagliari in Sardinia. There was one attempt to open a house in the homeland of the founder during his lifetime. In 1637, the order tried to open a house in Guissona in Spain, but the first actual house to open in Spain opened forty years later, in 1677, in Barbastro. The first Spanish province was the Province of Aragon, which was established in 1742. The Province of Catalonia was established in 1751, as was the Province of Austria. Three more provinces would be added in Spain, one in each of the next three centuries: Castile (1753), Valencia (1833), and Vasconia (1933). Added to them was the General Delegation of Spain in 1929.[Ordo Scholarum Piarum Catalogus Generalis. Apud Curiam Generalem, Piazza de' Massimi 4, 1 Sept. 2014], The pedagogical ideal of Saint Joseph Calasanctius of educating every child, his schools for the poor, his support of the heliocentric sciences of Galileo Galilei, the scandals and persecutions of some of his detractors, and his life of sanctity in the service of children and youth, carried with them the opposition of many among the governing classes in society and in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. In 1642, as a result of an internal crisis in the congregation and outside intrigues and pressures, Calasanz was briefly held and interrogated by the Inquisition. According to Karen Liebreich, problems were exacerbated by Father Stefano Cherubini, originally headmaster of the Piarist school in Naples who sexually abused the pupils in his care. Father Stefano made no secret about at least some of his transgressions, and Calasanz came to know of them. Unfortunately for Calasanz as administrator of the order, Father Stefano was the son and the brother of powerful papal lawyers; no one wanted to offend the Cherubini family. Father Stefano pointed out that if allegations of his abuse of his boys became public, actions would be taken to destroy the Piarists. Calasanz, therefore, promoted Father Stefano, to get him away from the scene of the crime, citing only his luxurious diet and failure to attend prayers. However, he knew what Cherubini had really been up to, and he wrote that the sole aim of the plan \\"... is to cover up this great shame in order that it does not come to the notice of our superiors.\\"Karen Liebreich, Fallen Order:Intrigue, Heresy and Scandal, London, 2005 Superiors in Rome may have suspected, but it seems that they bowed to the same family ties that had bound Calasanz. Cherubini became visitor-general for the Piarists, able to conduct himself just as he wanted in any school he visited. The Piarists became entangled in church politics, and partially because they were associated with Galileo, were opposed by the Jesuits, who were more orthodox in astronomy. (Galileo's views also involved atomism, and were thought to be heretical regarding transubstantiation.) The support for Cherubini was broad enough that in 1643, he was made the head of the order and the elderly Calasanz was pushed aside. Upon this appointment, Calasanz publicly documented Cherubini's long pattern of child molestation, a pattern that he had known about for years. Even this did not block Cherubini's appointment, but other members of the order were indignant about it, although they may have objected to Cherubini's more overt shortcomings. With such dissension, the Vatican took the easy course of suppressing the order. In 1646, the order was deprived of its privileges by Pope Innocent X, but the order was restored ten years later by Pope Alexander VIII. Calasanz, who died on 25 August 1648, was beatified in 1748, and canonized in 1767. He was declared \\"Universal Patron of all the Christian popular schools in the world\\" by Pope Pius XII, in 1948, because he had the glory of opening \\"the first free tuition, popular, public school in Europe\\" (Von Pastor) and had proclaimed the right to education of all children, fought for it, and was persecuted because of this. =The Piarist Order Expands= The Piarists first established a community outside the continent of Europe in 1767 when the Piarist Father Basilio Sancho was appointed as the 17th Archbishop of Manila in 1765, having been recommended for the position by King Charles III. Sancho and four other Piarists arrived in Manila in March 1767. The four other Piarists helped Archbishop Sancho plan the First Provincial Synod of Manila. Archbishop Sancho established a Diocesan Seminary in which the first native diocesan priests were trained. The Piarists worked in the seminary as well as at St. Joseph's School, which had previously been run by the Jesuits. Following Archbishop Sancho's death in 1787, the Piarists returned to Spain. They wouldn't return to the Philippines until 1995, and they now have communities on the islands of Luzon, Cebu, and Mindanao. Two attempts were made to establish a Piarist presence in the Caribbean in the 19th century. Following the Spanish War of Independence, which ended in 1812, many Piarists left Spain and went to Cuba, where they worked in various ministries. Bishop Anthony M. Claret asked the Piarists to establish a college for the formation of Cuban teachers in Guanabacoa, and the first canonical foundation established in the Americas was in Cuba in 1857. In 1941, the first Piarist Cuban novitiate was opened in Guanabacoa, all previous Cuban novices having gone to Spain for their novitiate. In 1897, the Piarists established the first teacher's college in Puerto Rico in Santurce, but the fathers returned to Spain following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The Piarists would return to Puerto Rico in June 1956 to work at Our Lady of Montserrat parish in Salinas and at The Catholic University of Puerto Rico in 1960. The parish was quite large with 20,000 parishioners, and after the Piarists left the parish in 1961, eight Piarists began teaching Cuban refugee children. The Provincial Delegation of New York and Puerto Rico was erected on August 30, 1960, and the House of Ponce was canonically established on November 26, 1960. The Piarists opened a community in San Juan in 1966. Meanwhile, the Piarists from Spain began establishing communities throughout Central and South America, establishing vice-provinces in Colombia (1956), Brasil (1958), Central America (1960), Chile (1960), and Venezuela (1960). The first Piarist Province in the Americas was established in 1964 in Argentina, which was followed by the establishment of the Piarist Province of the United States (1975) and Mexico (1990). The Piarists established a presence in Bolivia in 1992, which became a Vicariate in 2007. In 2017, the Piarists opened a House in Peru. The Piarists established their first school in the United States in New Orleans in the early 20th century, but it did not last long. They would try again in New Orleans in 1963, but after one year they departed. It would not be until the beginning of World War II that they would succeed in establishing a foundation in the United States. In the summer of 1940, a Spanish Piarist, Fr. Enrique Pobla went to Los Angeles to examine the possibilities for a foundation. In October 1944, Archbishop John Cantwell of Los Angeles offered the Piarists the care of St. Martha Parish in Vernon, and Fr. Pobla celebrated his first Mass at the parish on the Saturday before the Solemnity of Christ the King. In May 1947, the Piarists were offered the care of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in Pasadena, and in 1951, the Archbishop entrusted to them Mary Help of Christians Parish in east Los Angeles. The rectory was too small, so in 1953, they purchased a house near the parish for $15,500. It was the first property owned by the Piarists in California. In 1955, Fr. Angel Torra became the first Piarist assigned to teach at a diocesan high school. In 1960, Cardinal McIntyre entrusted them with St. Bernard High School in Playa del Rey.Jose P. Burgues,\\"The Piarist Fathers in the U.S.A. 60 Years of Service\\", Miami, 2007 Following the second world war, Piarists from eastern Europe were sent to the United States, with the first four arriving in Los Angeles in 1949, but the archbishop said that he did not have work for them to do since they could not speak English well. Meanwhile, Bishop John O'Hara of Buffalo was contacted by two different Piarists and said that he would welcome the Piarists into his diocese. Father Joseph Batori arrived in New York City on June 16, 1949, and after a couple of days left for Lackawanna, where there were many Hungarian refugees living in the area. He was assigned to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish, where he celebrated daily Mass and assisted on weekends, and he taught Latin at Bishop Timon, a diocesan high school. More Hungarian Piarists soon arrived, and after the summer of 1950, Bishop O'Hara offered the Piarists the use of a farmhouse in Lackawanna. By the end of the year, there were eleven Piarists (nine from Hungary and two from Poland) living in the farmhouse as a community, and they called themselves \\"The Founding Fathers.\\" Father Batori found a house that he liked in Derby, that had been designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and in 1951, it became the first canonical Piarist house. On May 8, 1954, Father Louis Kovari became the first Piarist ordained in the United States. That same year, the Piarists established a House of Studies in Washington, D.C., and the following year, the Piarists bought the former Lea Estate in Devon, PA and opened Devon Preparatory School in it the following year. The following year, the Piarists opened a School for Gifted Children in Buffalo. In 1961, Bishop Coleman Carroll of Miami offered the Piarists Cardinal Gibbons High School, which had just been built in Fort Lauderdale. The Province of the U.S.A. was established in 1975, and in 2011 it merged with the Vice Province of New York and Puerto Rico to become the Province of the United States and Puerto Rico. In 1990, Back in New York City, in 1953, the Piarists were given permission to reside in the rectory of St. Nicholas Church, and in 1957, Cardinal Spellman gave his permission to create a canonical house. The Piarists bought the building, and they owned it until 1978 when they were entrusted with Annunciation Parish in upper Manhattan. The Piarists were entrusted with St. Helena Parish and St. Helena School in the Bronx in 2014. Africa is the most recent continent on which the Piarists established communities and schools. The Piarists first went to Africa in 1963, establishing an Apostolic Mission in the Senegal, which became a vice- province in 1997 and then the West African Province in 2013 along with Guinea- Gabon. They began working in Equatorial Guinea in 1970, and in 1990, some priests from Poland began working in the Cameroon, which became a vicariate in 2000, a vice-province in 2007, and the Central African Province in 2013. The two newest African countries in which the Piarists opened communities are the Congo in 2014 and Mozambique in 2017. =Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools= The order was restored in 1656 by Pope Alexander VIII who revived the congregation but without its earlier privileges, such as solemn vows granted by Gregory XV and added to the simple vows an oath of perseverance in the congregation. In addition to the usual three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The privileges of the order were successively restored in 1660, 1669 and 1698. In 1669, Pope Clement IX restored the Piarists to the condition of regulars. The Piarists are exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and subject only to their general superior, who is elected every six years by the general chapter. A general procurator with four assistants resides at Rome. In virtue of a brief of Alexander VIII (1690) they ceased to be discalced. The members are divided into professed, novices and lay brethren. The professed usually add the letters \\"Sch.P.\\" or \\"S.P.\\", which means \\"Pious Schools,\\" after their name, to connote the name of the order, Scholarum Piarum. Their habit is very similar to that of the Jesuits, a cassock closed in front and a cincture with hanging bands on the left side, although they usually follow the local customs regarding clerical apparel. Their two mottos are Ad majus pietatis incrementum and Pietas et Litterae. Today, there are over 1,400 Piarist religious found chiefly in Italy, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Latin America, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. There is also a growing number of Piarist lay associates. The Order is currently present on five continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, and South America) and in 36 countries. In 2017, the Order will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the religious community on March 25, 1617, by St. Joseph Calasanz, as well as the 250th anniversary of the canonization of St. Joseph Calasanz, which took place on July 17, 1767. Pope Francis imparted a special Apostolic Blessing on 27 November 2016, the opening day of the Jubilee Year. He also declared that a special Plenary Indulgence would be granted in all churches, chapels, shrines, and parishes where the Piarist Fathers are present to all of the faithful on the occasion of a jubilee celebration, provided they have fulfilled the other necessary requirements to gain the indulgence. Education Before the course of study was regulated by the state, a Piarist establishment contained nine classes: reading, writing, elementary mathematics, schola parva or rudimentorum, schola principiorum, grammatica, syntaxis, humanitas or poesis and rhetorica. One of the most famous Piarists, priest Stanis≈Çaw Konarski, was the reformer of the Polish education system in the 18th century. To honor his faithful duty, the Polish King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski created the Sapere Auso medal. The order's influence led to the subsequent establishment of many other congregations dedicated to education. There are eleven religious teaching orders now in existence that are based on Calasanz's ideas. The founder and order have also had influence on many great educators, such as Saint Jean-Baptiste de la Salle in the eighteenth century, and Saint John Bosco, his great admirer, in the nineteenth century. The influence of the pious schools served as the model for state public school systems in some European countries. The order has educated many important figures in modern history, including a number of saints like Saint John Neumann and Saint Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, figures like Pope Pius IX, Victor Hugo, Haydn, Schubert, Johann Mendel, and a dozen Nobel Prize winners like George Hevesy and George Olah. Motto The motto of the Piarist Fathers is \\"Pietas et Litterae\\" (Piety and Learning), and at the bottom of most Piarist documents are the initials \\"AMPI,\\" which when translated mean \\"For the Glory of God and the Service of our Neighbor.‚Äù The special Piarist motto for the 400th anniversary jubilee year in 2017 is \\"to educate, announce, and to transform.\\".

Written by Wilder and Charles Brackett, the film is about a brash American gramophone salesman in Austria at the turn of the twentieth century who tries to convince Emperor Franz Joseph to buy a gramophone so the product will gain favor with the Austrian people. The Emperor Waltz was inspired by a real-life incident involving Franz Joseph I of Austria. Filmed on location in Jasper National Park in Canada, the film premiered in London, Los Angeles, and New York in the spring of 1948, and was officially released in the United States July 2, 1948. In 1949, the film received Academy Award nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Music, as well as a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Written American Musical. Plot At the turn of the twentieth century, traveling salesman Virgil Smith (Bing Crosby) takes multiple journeys to Vienna, Austria hoping to sell a gramophone to Emperor Franz Joseph, whose purchase of the recent American invention could spur its popularity with the Austrian people. At the same time, Countess Johanna Augusta Franziska von Stoltzenberg-Stolzenberg (Joan Fontaine) and her father, Baron Holenia, are celebrating the fact their black poodle Scheherezade has been selected to mate with the emperor's poodle. As they depart from the palace, they meet Virgil and his white fox terrier Buttons, whose scuffle with Scheherezade leads to a discussion about class distinctions. When Scheherezade experiences a nervous breakdown, she is treated by veterinarian Dr. Zwieback, who practices Freudian psychology, and he advises Johanna to force her dog to face Buttons in order to dissipate her fear. When the dogs are reunited, romantic sparks begin to fly between not only the animals but their owners as well. They begin to spend a great deal of time together, during which Scheherezade and the salesman's dog mate, unbeknownst to their owners. Virgil eventually convinces Johanna true love can overcome their social differences, and he asks the emperor for her hand in marriage. This is the crucial scene in the picture, and brings the otherwise lightweight movie plot to a higher level. The Emperor is cordial and fatherly with Virgil, and treats him with respect and even a bit of admiration. But he is certain Johanna could never be happy living in Newark, New Jersey. \\"We are not better than you\\", explains the Emperor sadly, \\"I think perhaps you are better than us. But we are like snails: If you take us out of our majestic shells, we die.\\" Finally, the Emperor tells Virgil of the disastrous end to several similar matches he has seen in his long life, and makes him an offer: He will endorse the gramophone‚Äîwhich will lead to enormous sales and profits for Virgil‚Äîonly if he breaks up with Johanna. Virgil refuses, highly insulted, but the Emperor asks him one more question: Are you sure you will be enough for her? The question strikes home, and Virgil decides he loves Johanna too much to take a chance on ruining her life. He lies to her, saying he used her only in order to gain access to the emperor to sell his wares, and walks out apparently uncaring, making himself the villain. Several months later when Scheherezade gives birth to a litter of white puppies with black patches, it is obvious they were sired by Buttons and not, as everyone thought, by the Emperor's poodle. Fearing the Emperor's reaction, Baron Holenia tells the Emperor they were stillborn, and secretly orders them drowned. However, Virgil, who has sneaked into the palace to see Johanna one last time and set the record straight before he leaves for America, rescues the puppies and confronts the Emperor, who he thinks has ordered the drowning. The Emperor demands an explanation from Holenia, chastises him severely, and asks Virgil to give him the puppies. But Virgil is still furious, and continues to berate the Emperor about class snobbery which he sees as the reason Holenia tried to drown the pups. He is so angry that he forgets Johanna is standing there listening and tells the Emperor he never should have agreed to give up Johanna to save her from a commoner's life with him. Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance at all with someone she cannot love. The Emperor agrees to let Virgil and Johanna wed. Cast Production Following the release of The Lost Weekend in late 1945, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett began to collaborate on a film about the problems faced by American military personnel stationed in Europe following World War II. Wilder went to Europe to research the project, but his visits to the concentration camps so disturbed him he returned to Hollywood determined to write and direct a musical comedy instead. He had known Bing Crosby since the crooner's days with Paul Whiteman, and he and Brackett had contributed to Crosby's film Rhythm on the River (1940). Since Crosby was Paramount's leading star and Wilder was the studio's top director, it was easy to convince executives to greenlight a collaboration between the two men. Wilder recalled reading about Valdemar Poulsen, a Danish inventor who had demonstrated a magnetic recording device for Franz Joseph I of Austria in the hope the Emperor would help finance his invention, and he and Brackett used this bit of historical fact as the starting point for their screenplay, which initially was titled Viennese Story.Chandler, Charlotte, Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, A Personal Biography. New York: Simon & Schuster 2002. , pp. 131-135 Principal photography began in Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rockies in the province of Alberta in June 1946. It cost the studio $20,000 to have pines shipped from California and planted on location because Wilder was unhappy with the look of the native trees. He also planted 4,000 white daisies dyed blue so they would photograph better.The Emperor Waltz trivia at Turner Classic Movies Working with Bing Crosby proved to be problematic from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled: \\"Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me.\\" The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine: \\"It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't pay much attention to him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent.\\" Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it \\"as he felt it at the moment\\", and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. \\"Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film\\", Wilder recalled. \\"He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew what was good for him.\\" The Canadian weather proved to be uncooperative, Fontaine was ill for a period of time, and at one point Wilder underwent minor surgery. As a result, the film ran over schedule and budget, and Wilder ran into problems during post-production. It was his first color film, and he was dissatisfied with the way the exteriors had been photographed in Technicolor. He had much of the flora native to the area hand-painted to give it a more authentic look. Although principal photography was completed in September 1946, it wasn't until April 30, 1948 that the film premiered in London. It opened in Los Angeles on May 26, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 17, and went into wide theatrical release in the United States on July 2. Wilder later confessed, \\"The picture didn't come out what I wanted ... I was looking back at my childhood in Austria‚Äîwaltzes, Tyrolean hats, cream puffs‚Äîshutting out what came later\\", a reference to the war-torn Vienna he visited prior to the film's start. \\"I would like to have done the picture as a tribute to Lubitsch. A tribute to Lubitsch, it was not.\\" Score The film's underscore was composed by Victor Young. Bing Crosby had some success with \\"The Kiss in Your Eyes\\", with lyrics by Johnny Burke and a melody from the operetta Der Opernball by Richard Heuberger. Burke also contributed lyrics to \\"Friendly Mountains\\", based on two Austrian yodeling songs, and \\"The Emperor Waltz\\", with music by Johann Strauss II, and he and Jimmy Van Heusen collaborated on \\"Get Yourself a Phonograph\\". The latter song was not used in the final version of the film.\\"I Kiss Your Hand, Madame\\" was by Fritz Rotter and Ralph Erwin, and Arthur Pryor wrote \\"Whistler and His Dog\\". Also heard in the film is \\"Santa Lucia\\", a barcarolle popularized by Venetian gondoliers. Crosby recorded four of the songs for Decca Records in January and March 1947 and they were issued as a 2-disc 78 rpm album titled Bing Crosby ‚Äì The Emperor Waltz. Crosby's songs were also included in the Bing's Hollywood series. Reception The film was placed in 14th in the list of top-grossing films in the US in 1948 taking $3,209,000. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times observed: \\"Picture it all in Technicolor, with the courtiers in flashing uniforms, the ladies in elegant dresses and Bing in an old straw hat, and you have a fair comprehension of the prospect and atmosphere ... Brackett and Wilder have made up with casualness and charm‚Äîand with a great deal of clever sight-humor‚Äîfor the meagerness of the idea. And Bing has provided the substance which the farcical bubble may lack ... Set against gorgeous mountain scenery and richly palatial rooms, The Emperor Waltz is a project which should turn the blue Danube to twinkling gold.\\" Variety said the film \\"has a free-and-easy air that perfectly matches the Crosby style of natural comedy. Co-star Joan Fontaine, better known for heavy, serious roles, demonstrates adaptability that fits neatly into the lighter demands and she definitely scores with charm and talent as the Crosby foil.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker called the film \\"a pleasant bit of spoofing\\", adding, \\"This is ancient stuff, all right, but Bing Crosby, in the role of the phonograph salesman, makes everything seem effortless and diverting, and Joan Fontaine, as the countess, reveals a nice talent for farce.\\" The 1953 Japanese Theatrical Release Poster A later assessment by Channel 4 states, \\"This sweet and sickly fare might just remain as a forgettable little trifle, were it not for the pen and lens of Wilder, one of the greats. There are so few bad Wilder films that one this awful and irredeemable is heart-breaking.\\"Channel 4 review Awards and nominations Edith Head and Gile Steele were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Color Costume Design but lost to Dorothy Jeakins and Barbara Karinska for Joan of Arc. It was the first year an award in this category was presented.

There were no big stars like Jude Law in the current commercial hit 'Hamlet,' there was no marketing campaign that framed the Simon play as a can‚Äôt-miss theatrical event, and there was no wow factor that brought the period piece to life, like the breakneck pacing of the popular farce 'Boeing-Boeing' last year. But the failure also reflects America‚Äôs evolving sense of humor and taste... It actually received good reviews, but the play was shuttered because people, for whatever reason, did not want to see the Simon show about a Depression-era family laughing through the tears.

The new living arrangement is taking its toll on Jack's health, as he has to work two stressful jobs to support the extended family. Meanwhile Aunt Blanche is interested in dating their neighbor, who has a drinking problem, despite Kate's objections; Stanley faces problems with his own job, when he stands up to his somewhat tyrannical boss; cousin Nora, whom Eugene has a crush on, is eager to be a dancer in a Broadway musical, even though the family's circumstances might not allow it; and cousin Laurie, who has heart problems, is a source of annoyance for Eugene. =Characters= *Eugene Morris Jerome, almost 15 *Blanche Morton, 38: Eugene's widowed aunt *Kate Jerome, about 40: Eugene's mother, a strong Jewish matriarch *Laurie Morton, 13: Eugene's younger cousin, has heart problems *Nora Morton, 16¬Ω: Eugene's beautiful older cousin *Stanley Jerome, 18¬Ω: Eugene's older brother *Jacob \\"Jack\\" Jerome, about 40: Eugene's father Awards and nominations *Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play (Broderick, winner; Ivanek, nominee) *Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play (Franz, nominee) *Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play (winner) *Theatre World Award (Broderick, winner) *Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play (nominee) *Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play (Broderick, nominee) *New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play (winner) Jewish Culture Because of Neil Simon‚Äôs own Jewish background and upbringing, much of his work, Brighton Beach Memoirs being a clear example, is semi-autobiographical. Simon infused Jewish humor into Brighton Beach Memoirs and represents Jewish culture in a way that many Jews find comforting and reminiscent of their own families. However through his characters, Simon also shows real American Jews what they look like, offering ‚Äúan unsettling mirror: one in which we watched our community identify as Jews only in the most cursory ways, through humor and cultural touchstones.‚Äù Reception Reviews for the original Broadway production were mixed.

Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout notes that many critics compared elements of Brighton Beach Memoirs to classic American plays including Eugene O'Neill's Ah! Wilderness, Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing, and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. Film adaptation In 1986 the play was adapted into a movie directed by Gene Saks with the screenplay by Neil Simon. The cast featured Jonathan Silverman (Eugene), Blythe Danner (Kate), Bob Dishy (Jack), Lisa Waltz (Nora), Brian Drillinger (Stanley), Stacey Glick (Laurie), and Judith Ivey (Blanche). The film frequently breaks the fourth wall by having Eugene speak directly to the camera. Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"The movie feels so plotted, so constructed, so written, that I found myself thinking maybe they shouldn't have filmed the final draft of the screenplay. Maybe there was an earlier draft that was a little disorganized and unpolished, but still had the jumble of life in it.... The movie was directed by Gene Saks, who directs many of Simon's plays on both the stage and the screen, and whose gift is for the theater. His plays have the breath of life; his movies feel like the official authorized version.

One of its powers was to license plays for publication.Dutton, p. 149 It was instituted by the crown in 1559 to enforce the Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy. John Whitgift, the Archbishop of Canterbury, obtained increased powers for the Court by the 1580s. He proposed and had passed the Seditious Sectaries Act 1593, thus making Puritanism an offence.Long title: An Act For the preventing and avoiding of such great inconveniencies and perils as might happen and grow by the wicked and dangerous practices of seditious sectaries and disloyal persons (35 Eliz., c. 1) The Court reached the height of its powers during the Reformation and was finally dissolved by the Long Parliament in 1641. The court was convened at will by the sovereign, and had near unlimited power over civil as well as church matters. There were also Scottish Courts of High Commission which vied with the General Assembly and lower church courts for authority. One such court was created by King James II on 27 July 1686, which lasted until 26 August 1688. Dissolution by the Triennial Act The Court of High Commission was dissolved by the Triennial Act, passed by Parliament in 1641. The Triennial Act held that the Crown summon Parliament every three years. It also impeached archbishop William Laud, who had been supported by Charles I. Laud's new ideas and prayers had upset the Scots, and when Charles was refused an army from Parliament, which did not trust him, he created his own. This led in part to the English Civil War.

In that year he was tried by the Inquisition for the unlicensed publication of a satirical poem, Il capitolo delle Lodi del Fuso published by Plinio Pietrasanta in Venice 1554, and fined 50 ducats (about 6oz of gold), after which the small publishing company did not long survive. Most of his later works were published by Vincenzo Valgrisi. A mannerist portrait of Ruscelli by his friend Bernardo Tasso found in Il Minturno overo de la Bellezza by Bernardo's son Torquato Tasso. Based on documents on from testamentary bequests, it is known that Ruscelli's wife was Virginia Panarelli, sister of Teofilo Panarelli a doctor with Protestant sympathies who was hanged and burned in Rome in 1572. It is generally accepted that he was Alessio Piemontese (in Latin, Alexius Pedemontanus), a pseudonym under which he wrote an immensely popular book of alchemy first published in 1555, De Secreti Del Alessio Piemontese, which included recipes for alchemical compounds, cosmetics, dyes, and medicines. It was reprinted for over two centuries and translated into numerous languages (French, English, German, Latin, Dutch, Spanish, Polish, Danish). Among his best known works, printed by Vincenzo Valgrisi, were translations of various classics including the Decameron, Orlando Furioso, and a translation of the Geografia of Ptolemy. Among the 69 copperplate maps in his translation of Geografia were 40 then contemporary maps based generally on maps compiled by Giacomo Gastaldi in 1548. He engaged in linguistics, and compiled a Rimario that remained in use until the 19th century.  Works  * Girolamo Ruscelli, Tre discorsi √† M. Lodovico Dolce.

Its western terminus is at SR 269 in Bellevue, where SR 113 is initially concurrent with US 20 and SR 18; its eastern terminus is at the US 6 / SR 2 concurrency in Lakewood. Most of its eastern portion is also in a concurrency with US 20. History SR 113 is an original state highway that originally went from SR 9 (now US 127) at the small town of Latty to SR 15 near Continental. The route's western terminus was extended to the Indiana state line in 1926, replacing SR 194 and part of SR 111, and its eastern terminus was extended to SR 109 north of Ottawa the same year. By 1931, the route had extended to SR 186 near McComb, replacing SR 187. By 1935, the route had extended to SR 18 near Bloomdale. Three years later it was extended again, this time all the way to Bellevue, by overlapping SR 18 and SR 12, then following the Sandusky County/Seneca County line to Bellevue, replacing SR 185. SR 113 was extended to Elyria in 1939, replacing SR 59, and to its current eastern terminus in 1940. In 1959, when the bypass around Fremont opened, SR 113 was rerouted along it, following SR 12 from Bettsville to SR 53, then following that route on the bypass and overlapping US 20 from Fremont to Bellevue, where it continued on its old route to Lakewood. Except for a small stretch of road in downtown Fostoria, SR 113 was now completely concurrent from Bloomdale to Bellevue. Thus in 1970, the route was split into two separate highways. The concurrencies were removed, SR 113 was truncated at Bellevue, and the western part of the route (from the Indiana state line to Fostoria) was recertified as SR 613.

Schwartz in the 1980s. It combines systems thinking with the view that the mind is made up of relatively discrete subpersonalities, each with its own unique viewpoint and qualities. IFS uses family systems theory to understand how these collections of subpersonalities are organized. Parts IFS posits that the mind is made up of multiple parts, and underlying them is a person's core or true Self. Like members of a family, a person's inner parts can take on extreme roles or subpersonalities. Each part has its own perspective, interests, memories, and viewpoint. A core tenet of IFS is that every part has a positive intent, even if its actions are counterproductive and/or cause dysfunction. There is no need to fight with, coerce, or eliminate parts; the IFS method promotes internal connection and harmony to bring the mind back into balance. IFS therapy aims to heal wounded parts and restore mental balance. The first step is to access the core Self and then, from there, understand the different parts in order to heal them. In the IFS model, there are three general types of parts: # Exiles represent psychological trauma, often from childhood, and they carry the pain and fear. Exiles may become isolated from the other parts and polarize the system. Managers and Firefighters try to protect a person's consciousness by preventing the Exiles' pain from coming to awareness. # Managers take on a preemptive, protective role. They influence the way a person interacts with the external world, protecting the person from harm and preventing painful or traumatic experiences from flooding the person's conscious awareness. # Firefighters emerge when Exiles break out and demand attention. They work to divert attention away from the Exile's hurt and shame, which leads to impulsive and/or inappropriate behaviors like overeating, drug use or violence. They can also distract a person from pain by excessively focusing attention on more subtle activities such as overworking or over- medicating. The Self IFS views people as whole underneath their collections of parts. According to IFS, everyone has a true self or spiritual center, called the Self, and everyone has access to it as well as its healing qualities: curiosity, connectedness, compassion, and calmness. IFS therapists first help clients to disengage from their parts and connect with their true Self. From there, they can understand each part and heal it. The aim is to let go of the destructive roles and enter into a harmonious collaboration, led by the Self. IFS emphasizes the spiritual nature of the Self, allowing growth for spiritual development and self-awareness as well as psychological healing. The internal system IFS focuses on the relationships between parts and the core Self. The goal of therapy is to create a cooperative and trusting relationship between the Self and each part. There are three primary types of relationships between parts: protection, polarization, and alliance. # Protection is provided by Managers and Firefighters. They intend to spare Exiles from harm and protect the individual from the Exile's pain. # Polarization occurs between two parts that battle each other to determine how a person feels or behaves in a certain situation. Each part believes that it must act as it does in order to counter the extreme behavior of the other part. IFS has a method for working with polarized parts. # Alliance is formed between two different parts if they're working together to accomplish the same goal. IFS method IFS practitioners report a well-defined therapeutic method for individual therapy based on the following principles. In this description, the term \\"protector\\" refers to either a manager or firefighter. * Parts in extreme roles carry \\"burdens\\", which are painful emotions or negative beliefs that they have taken on as a result of past harmful experiences, often in childhood. These burdens are not intrinsic to the part and therefore they can be released or \\"unburdened\\" through IFS therapy, allowing the part to assume its natural healthy role. * The Self is the agent of psychological healing. Therapists help their clients to access and remain in Self, providing guidance along the way. * Protectors usually can't let go of their protective roles and transform until the Exiles they are protecting have been unburdened. * There is no attempt to work with Exiles until the client has obtained permission from the Protectors who are protecting it. This makes the method relatively safe, even in working with traumatized parts. * The Self is the natural leader of the internal system. However, because of past harmful incidents or relationships, Protectors have stepped in and taken over for the Self. One Protector after another is activated and takes the lead, causing dysfunctional behavior. Protectors are also frequently in conflict with each other, resulting in internal chaos or stagnation. The aim is for the Protectors to trust the Self and allow it to lead the system, creating internal harmony under its guidance. The first step is to help the client access the Self. Next, the Self gets to know the Protector(s), its positive intent, and develops a trusting relationship with it. Then, with the Protector's permission, the client accesses the Exile(s) to uncover the childhood incident or relationship which is the source of the burden(s) it carries. The Exile is retrieved from the past situation and guided to release its burdens. Finally, the Protector can then let go of its protective role and assume a healthy one. Applications IFS proponents claim to have a \\"complete\\" form of individual therapy that is used for the full range of human development, from the healing of trauma to personal and spiritual growth. It has also been applied in the following areas: =Trauma= IFS has been supported by multiple studies to be an effective treatment of trauma. Richard Schwartz developed IFS while working with people who had experienced considerable trauma. By understanding the traumatized Exile, the client learns how to reside in Self and witness the traumatic memory without being flooded by it. In this way the trauma is revisited, processed and healed without the risk of retraumatization. =Couples therapy= IFS proponents claim to have successfully applied the method to couples therapy, investigating the interactions between the parts of the two people and how a part in one person can activate extreme parts in the other. The method incorporates short pieces of individual therapy in a couples session along with work on communicating from Self. =Self-help and peer counseling= Because the Self is the agent of transformation in IFS, the IFS method naturally lends itself to self-help. The method has been taught in self-therapy classes as well as peer counseling for the general public. =Inner critic= Jay Earley and Bonnie Weiss have applied IFS to working with the inner critic, showing how this difficult part is really an IFS protector that one can connect with and transform. Criticisms Some IFS proponents acknowledge that although this psychotherapy model can be effective, there are drawbacks and limitations. Therapist Alexander Hsieh pointed out that the method of self-discovery can take extensive time and effort, which can be multiplied when dealing with multiple family members. Therapist Sharon A. Deacon and Jonathan C. Davis said that working with one's parts \\"can be emotional and anxiety-provoking for clients\\", and that IFS may not work well with delusional, paranoid, or schizophrenic clients who may not be grounded in reality and therefore misuse the idea of \\"parts\\".

The Society of Women Engineers is the world‚Äôs largest advocate and catalyst for change for women in engineering and technology. SWE has over 40,000 members in nearly 100 professional sections, 300 collegiate sections, and 60 global affiliate groups throughout the world. Antecedents The SWE Archives contain a series of letters from the Elsie Eaves Papers (bequeathed to the Society), which document how in 1919, a group of women at the University of Colorado helped establish a small community of women with an engineering or science background. While this organization was recognized within the campus community, it did set the foundation for the development of the Society of Women Engineers. This group included Lou Alta Melton, Hilda Counts, and Elsie Eaves. These women wrote letters to engineering schools across the nation, asking for information on female engineering students and graduates. They received responses from 139 women throughout 23 universities. They also received many negative responses from schools that did not admit women into their engineering programs. From the University of North Carolina, Thorndike Saville, Associate Professor of Sanitary Engineering wrote: \\"I would state that we have not now, have never had, and do not expect to have in the near future, any women students registered in our engineering department.\\" Some responses were supportive of women in engineering, but not of a separate society. Many of the women contacted as a result of the inquiries wrote about their support for such an organization. Besides the Hazel Quick letter from Michigan, there was a reply from Alice Goff, expressing her support of the idea of a society for women in engineering and architecture; \\"Undoubtedly an organization of such a nature would be of great benefit to all members, especially to those just entering the profession.\\" The women in Michigan organized a group in 1914 called the T-Square Society. Although it was not clear if this group was a business, honorary, or social organization, it was proposed as a safe space for women to share and collaborate their ideas comfortably.  History  Though the Society of Women Engineers did not become a formal organization until 1950, its origins are in the late 1940s when shortages of men due to World War II provided the new opportunities for women to pursue employment in engineering. Female student groups at Drexel Institute of Technology in Philadelphia, Cooper Union and City College of New York in New York City, began forming local meetings and networking activities. On April 3, 1949, seventy students attended a conference at Drexel to start organizing. These seventy students traveled from 19 universities. On the weekend of May 27‚Äì28, 1950, about fifty women representing the four original districts of the Society of Women Engineers; New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Boston, met for the first national meeting at The Cooper Union's Green Engineering Camp in northern New Jersey. During this first meeting, the society elected the first president of SWE(the Society of Women Engineers), Dr. Beatrice A. Hicks. The first official annual meeting was held in 1951, in New York City. It wasn't until the 1960s after Russia launched Sputnik and interest in technological research and development intensified that many engineering schools began admitting women. Membership in SWE doubled to 1,200 and SWE moved its headquarters to the United Engineering Center in New York City. After WWII women were discouraged from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts were seen as a patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering were seen as an abnormality. Over the next decade, an increasing number of young women chose engineering as a profession, but few were able to rise to management-level positions. SWE inaugurated a series of conferences (dubbed the Henniker Conferences after the meeting site in New Hampshire) on the status of women in engineering and in 1973, signed an agreement with the National Society of Professional Engineers in hopes of recruiting a larger percentage of working women and students to its ranks. At the same time, SWE increasingly became involved in the spirit and activities of the larger women's movement. In 1972, a number of representatives from women's scientific and technical committees and societies (including SWE) met to form an alliance and discuss equity for women in science and engineering. This inaugural meeting eventually led to the formation of the Business and Professional Women's Foundation (BPWF). In addition, SWE's council resolved in 1973 to endorse ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, and a few years later, resolved not to hold national conventions in non-ERA-ratified states. The Equal Rights Amendment was first proposed by Alice Paul in the 1920s, after women gained the right to vote, and still has not been ratified to this day. In 1973, SWE signed an agreement with the National Society of Professional Engineers to recruit more female engineers and students as members. By 1982, the Society had swelled to 13,000 graduate and student members spread out over 250 sections across the country. The Council of Section Representatives, which in partnership with an Executive Committee had governed the Society since 1959, had become so large SWE adopted a regionalization plan designed to bring the leadership closer to the membership. Today, SWE has over 40,000 student and professional members and continues its mission as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational service organization. The Society of Women Engineers organization exists today largely because the gender balance in engineering does not proportionally reflect population breakdowns of men and women in the United States. Encouragement of female students and promotion of Engineering as a field of study for women is a necessary and fundamental function of the organization. Engineering and related fields are heavily male-dominated, in part because of gender socialization and artificially reinforced gender norms. Theories such as the STEM pipeline seek to understand and balance how different science, math, and engineering fields tend to over- or under-represent different groups of people in this country.  Mission  Its mission statement, is to \\"Empower women to achieve full potential in careers as engineers and leaders, expand the image of the engineering and technology professions as a positive force in improving the quality of life, and demonstrate the value of diversity and inclusion.\\" The organization was open to every gender and background in an effort to support and promote diversity. The Society of Women Engineers, a not-for- profit organization, awards multiple scholarships each year to women in undergraduate and graduate STEM degree programs. In 2019, SWE disbursed nearly 260 new and renewed scholarships valued at more than $810,000. SWE's CEO and executive director Karen Horting stated that SWE \\"could not have such a successful program without our corporate and foundation partners and generous individuals who support our scholarships, and our hope is to continue to grow the program and provide financial resources to those studying for a career in engineering and technology.\\"  Archives  While developing the society, the organizers had assembled masses of information that they decided to assemble into archives. The committee for these archives was established in 1953 and is currently located at the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Some of the media includes information about a short- lived society involving both architects and engineers from 1920. The archives include the history and creation of SWE as an organization and the history of women's involvement in engineering. Due to these collections of women's work on scientific projects, the archives show an alternate perspective on events such as the 'Space Race'.  Current Work  Capt. Paz B.

In 1954, the journal was superseded by the SWE Newsletter, a magazine format that focused primarily on SWE and industry news. In 1980, it was again renamed, this time to US Woman Engineer. In 1993, the title was changed yet again to SWE and this remains their current periodical title with the subtitle 'magazine of the Society of Women Engineers'. The fifth volume of SWE was published in 2011 to celebrate the society‚Äôs 60th anniversary and to explore SWE's history in more depth using its archives.  Archives  Located at Wayne State University‚Äôs Walter P. Reuther Library in Detroit, Michigan, USA, the Society's archives were established in 1957 by the Archives Committee, who voluntarily collected and maintained the Society's records. In 1993, SWE designated the Walter P. Reuther Library as the official repository of its historical materials. Located within the Carey C. Shuart Women's Archive and Research Collection, the Houston Area Section of the Society of Women Engineers contains correspondence, business and financial records, photographs, and publications of the organization.

A sleeveless shirt is a shirt manufactured without sleeves, or whose sleeves have been cut off. Sleeveless shirts are worn by people of either gender, depending on the style. They can be used as undershirts, worn by athletes in sports such as track and field and triathlon, or as casual wear attire during humid weather. Types = Tank top = In the United States and Canada, it is commonly known as a tank top, tank shirt, muscle shirt, and also wifebeater, guinea tee, or dago tee (\\"guinea\\" and \\"dago\\" being American ethnic slurs for people of Italian ethnicity). The term wifebeater reportedly became synonymous for an undershirt after a criminal case in 1947. A Detroit native named James Hartford Jr. was arrested for beating his wife to death. News outlets printed a photo of Hartford in a stained undershirt and referred to him as \\"the wife beater.\\" In the UK, especially when used as an undershirt, it is known as a vest (compare the American usage of \\"vest\\"). Another term is singlet, used in England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia, parts of Hawaii, and French-speaking Belgium. In France, it is commonly called a marcel after Marcel Eisenberg, who first started large-scale production of the shirts for Parisian porters during the mid-19th century, or more formally a d√©bardeur, meaning \\"docker\\", \\"porter\\" or \\"stevedore\\". In Russia, it is generally referred as mayka, but is also colloquially known as alcoholichka. In the Philippines, a sleeveless shirt is called a sando. In addition to being worn as an undershirt, it is also often worn at home due to its effectiveness in providing relief from the country's humid climate. In Bengal, it is called a sando-genji or just genji. In much of India, it is known as a banian and is used extensively as an undershirt to absorb sweat and prevent its penetration to outer layers of clothing. In addition to athletic usage, tank tops have traditionally been used as undershirts, especially with suits and dress shirts. They are sometimes worn alone without a dress shirt or top shirt during very warm and/or humid weather, mainly in North America where the climate is warmer and more humid in the summer. Tank tops are often worn alone under very casual settings, as lounge wear, and/or while completing yard work or other chores around the home. A woman wearing sleeveless top. The build of a tank top is simple: the neck and armholes are often reinforced for durability. One usually has large armholes and neck holes and a neckline that can reach down as far as the bottom of the chest. (Women's tank tops have smaller holes, to conceal their breasts). They are also sometimes made long to make tucking into a pair of jeans/shorts easier. In almost all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. A tank top worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of ribbed cotton. A tank top consists of a sleeveless shirt with low neck and different shoulder straps width. It is named after tank suits, one-piece bathing suits of the 1920s worn in tanks or swimming pools. The upper garment is worn commonly by both men and women. =Camisole= A camisole being used as a blouse. A camisole, also called just cami, is a sleeveless undergarment for women, normally extending to the waist. They often have spaghetti straps. Originally worn as an undershirt, like the A-shirt they have become increasingly used as warm-weather outerwear. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton. =Dudou= A dudou (), known as a y·∫øm in Vietnamese contexts, is an item of East Asian and Southeast Asian clothing resembling a silk apron or bib but traditionally used as an undershirt or bodice to flatten the figure and, medicinally, to preserve stomach qi. Beginning around the year 2000, Western and Chinese fashion has also begun incorporating them as a sleeveless and backless shirt for women. =Halter top= A halter top is a sleeveless shirt in which a strap goes around the back of the neck, leaving the upper back uncovered. Halter tops are worn mainly by girls and women. =Muscle shirt= A sleeveless T-shirt, also called a muscle shirt, is the same design as a T-shirt, but without sleeves. Some sleeveless T-shirts, which possess smaller, narrower arm holes, can be worn by both women and men, but those with larger, wider arm holes are primarily worn by men, since the larger arm holes would expose the breast under certain circumstances. They are often worn during athletic activities or as casual wear during warmer weather. They are colloquially known as shooter shirts in the southern United States. They were quite popular in the 1980s and were commonly associated with surfers and bodybuilders (hence the name \\"muscle\\" shirt) and often bore the names and logos of gyms. Such shirts without logos are now more commonly worn as casual wear. =Tube top= A tube top is a shirt with no sleeves or shoulders, essentially a tube that wraps around a woman's torso. Some versions cover most of the torso while others leave a large midriff. In British and Australian English, they are informally known as boob tubes.

Painting by Ciro Ferri (S√£o Paulo Museum of Art, S√£o Paulo). Ciro Ferri (1634 ‚Äì 13 September 1689) was an Italian Baroque sculptor and painter, the chief pupil and successor of Pietro da Cortona. He was born in Rome, where he began working under Cortona and with a team of artists in the extensive fresco decorations of the Quirinal Palace (1656‚Äì59). He collaborated with Cortona and completed for him the extensive frescoed ceilings and other internal decorations begun in the Pitti Palace, Florence (1659‚Äì65). His independent masterpiece is considered an extensive series of scriptural frescoes in the church of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore (Bergamo). Also well known is his an altarpiece of St Ambrose Healing the Sick in the church of Sant'Ambrogio della Massima in Rome. In 1670, he began the painting of the cupola of Sant'Agnese in Agone in central Rome, in a style recalling of Lanfranco's work in the dome of Sant'Andrea della Valle; but died before it was completed in 1693 by his successor Sebastiano Corbellini. He executed also a large amount of miscellaneous designs, such as etchings and frontispieces for books; and served as an architect as well. Ferri was appointed to direct the Florentine students in Rome, and Gabbiani was one of his leading pupils. As regards style, Ferri ranks as chief of the grand manner of Cortona, as opposed to the more sober and spare style promulgated by Andrea Sacchi, and continued by Carlo Maratta and others. The 1911 Britannica refers to this as the so-called Machinists movement. Among the many pupils and assistants were Ambrogio Besozzi, Camillo Gabrielli, Marziale Carpinoni, Filippo Maria Galetti, Benedetto Luti, Giovanni Battista Marmi, Pietro Montanini, Giuseppe Nasini, Giovanni Odazzi, Tommaso Redi, and Urbano Romanelli. Ciro Ferri became a member of the Accademia di San Luca on 3 June 1657. His ciborium for the high altar of Santa Maria in Vallicella is a masterpieces of 17th-century bronze decorative sculpture. He continued under the patronage of the Medici, when together with the sculptor Ercole Ferrata, Ferri the painter led the Medici Academy in Rome, established in 1673 by Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany. Among the pupils sent there from Florence were Anton Domenico Gabbiani, Giovanni Battista Foggini, Atanasio Bimbacci, Carlo Marcellini, and Massimiliano Soldani BenziBy Giovanni Gaetano Bottari, Contributor Fratelli Pagliarini, Published 1766, Appresso Niccol√≤ e Marco Pagliarini, Original from Oxford University Digitized Jan 31, 2007; page 190. . Ferri was also responsible for the Reliquary of the Arm of St. John the Baptist which is found in the St John's Co-Cathedral in Malta. Ciro Ferri contributed five illustrations to the missal of Pope Alexander VII Chigi, which was published in 1662.

In 17th and 18th century Europe, it was a popular form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen. History Peep show in Golestan Palace, Tehran Peep shows,Thomas Weynants, \\"From the Rarekiek, 17th. & 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television\\" also known as peep box or raree show (\\"rarity show\\") can be traced back to the early modern period (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer Leon Battista Alberti is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the magic lantern that could project images. In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera. Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken recitation that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes. Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland. Some artists from the 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, like Pieter Janssens Elinga and Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room. From around 1700 many of these \\"perspective boxes\\" or \\"optica\\" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives. From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the zograscope, which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box. Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the dissolving views that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show. In the early 18th century perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as Holland machines. The Dutch brought the first such device to Japan in the 1640s as a gift to the sh≈çgun, but the devices became popular only after the Chinese popularized them about 1758, after which they began to influence Japanese artists. 19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including la yang p'ien (). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with puppets or pictures outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes. In Ottoman Syria a form of peep show called sanduk al-ajayib (\\"wonder box\\") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. Sanduk al- ajayib stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.* Mair, Victor H. Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988. Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or masques, court ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures. A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938 Raree shows were precursors of toy theatres, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to optical toys like Chinese fireworks, the diorama, the stereoscope and the magic lantern. Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the masques and pageants of their time. Similar media Early motion pictures were presented in peep boxes, such as the kinetoscope and the mutoscope. Erotica Although the travelling raree show usually didn't feature erotic material, many media similar to the peep box did. These provided voyeuristic entertainment through secret, hidden erotic imagery. Among the early peep box motion pictures were many erotic shorts, for example: What the Butler Saw. These remained relatively popular for decades after the introduction of cinemas. Later on, pornographic film and erotic performances were often presented as a peep show.

It is one of the oldest fonts shipped with Macintosh operating systems. The original version was a bitmap font, but later versions were converted to TrueType when that technology became available on the Macintosh platform. Because this Macintosh font is not commonly available on other platforms, many users find Verdana, Microsoft Sans Serif or Arial to be an acceptable substitute. Geneva was originally a redesigned version of the famous Linotype typeface Helvetica; the TrueType version of the font is somewhat different. Helvetica is named after the Latin name for Switzerland, home country of its original designer Max Miedinger; Geneva is Switzerland's second-largest city. The bitmap version varied by appearance in different sizes; in smaller sizes, the lowercase i, j and l had serifs on the top, the lowercase y was parallel, the centre vertex of the uppercase M was much higher, and the 3 had a flat top. Larger sizes of the font depicted said characters as how they appear in the TrueType version. From Mac OS 8.5 onwards, the bitmap version removed said serifs from the lowercase i, j and l and the lowercase y became angled like in the TrueType version, but the 3 kept the flat top. The bitmap designs are still available on newer versions of the Terminal app. Geneva's long s and R rotunda, both descended from traditions in medieval writing. Unusually for neo-grotesque faces, the current version of Geneva includes a basic set of ligatures and the archaic long s and R rotunda as optional alternates. A slightly modified version of Geneva known as Simple can be found in the Apple Newton operating system.

D. Cooley's published scepticism about the cherished opinion of the role of Cornwall as source of Phoenician tin, was reprinted in 2008. Ancient geography Herodotus (430 BC) had only vaguely heard of the Cassiterides, \\"from which we are said to have our tin,\\" but did not discount the islands as legendary.Herodotus, iii. Later writers ‚Äî Posidonius, Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus, v.38.4, places the Cassiterides off the northern coast of Hispania StraboStrabo, III.5.11, calls them \\"islands in the sea\\" \\"opposite\\" Hispania to the north and twice goes out of his way to enumerate them separately from Britain (II.5.30; III.5.11). and others ‚Äì call them smallish islands off (\\"some way off,\\" Strabo says) the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula, which contained tin mines or, according to Strabo, tin and lead mines. A passage in Diodorus derives the name rather from their nearness to the tin districts of Northwest Iberia. Ptolemy and Dionysios Periegetes mentioned them ‚Äì the former as ten small islands in northwest Iberia far off the coast and arranged symbolically as a ring, and the latter in connection with the mythical Hesperides. The islands are described by Pomponius MelaDe Chorographia, III.39 as rich in lead; they are mentioned last in the same paragraph he wrote about Cadiz and the islands of Lusitania, and placed in Celtici. Following paragraphs describe the √éle de Sein and Britain. Probably written in the first century BC, the verse Circumnavigation of the World, whose anonymous author is called the \\"Pseudo-Scymnus,\\" places two tin islands in the upper part of the Adriatic Sea and mentioned the market place Osor on the island of Cres, where extraordinarily high quality tin could be bought.CHURCH AND STATE REVIEW, edited by the VENERABLE ARCHDEACON DENISON, Volume III., page 36, published at the Office, No. 13, Burleigh Street, Strand, W.C., London 1863.Jadranski Zbornik, svezak 8, str. 356, Povijesno dru≈°tvo Istre, Povijesno dru≈°tvo Rijeke, Povijesno dru≈°tvo Hrvatske, Izdavaƒçko poduzeƒáe \\"Otokar Ker≈°ovani\\", 1973. Pliny the Elder, on the other hand, represents the Cassiterides as fronting Celtiberia. At a time when geographical knowledge of the West was still scanty, and when the secrets of the tin trade were still successfully guarded by the seamen of Gades (modern Cadiz) and others who dealt in the metal, the Greeks knew only that tin came to them by sea from the far West, and the idea of tin-producing islands easily arose. Later, when the West was better explored, it was found that tin actually came from two regions: Galicia, in the northwest of the Iberia, and Devon and Cornwall in southwest Britain. Diodorus reports: \\"For there are many mines of tin in the country above Lusitania and on the islets which lie off Iberia out in the ocean and are called because of that fact the Cassiterides.\\" According to Diodorus tin also came from Britannia to Gaul and thence was brought overland to Massilia and Narbo.Diodorus, v.38.4: \\"And tin is brought in large quantities also from the island of Britain to the opposite Gaul,55 where it is taken by merchants on horses through the interior of Celtica both to the Massalians and to the city of Narbo, as it is called.\\" ' Neither of these could be called small islands or accurately described as off the northwest coast of Iberia, and so the Greek and Roman geographers did not identify either as the Cassiterides. Instead, they became a third, ill- understood source of tin, conceived of as distinct from Iberia or Britain. Strabo says that a Publius Crassus was the first Roman to visit the Tin Islands and write a first-hand report. This Crassus is thought to be either the Publius Licinius Crassus who was a governor in Hispania in the 90s,Christopher Hawkes, \\"Britain and Julius Caesar,‚Äù Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124‚Äì192; also J.S. Richardson, Hispaniae: Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218‚Äì82 BC (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 159 online. T. Corey Brennan, in The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), vol. 2, p. 501 online, believes the expedition to the Cassiterides was \\"a purely scientific trip.\\" or his grandson by the same name, who in 57‚Äì56 BC commanded Julius Caesar's forces in Armorica (Brittany),Theodor Mommsen, History of Rome (1894), vol. 4, p. 63 = R√∂mische Geschichte (1889), vol. 3, p. 269; T.

Modern attempts at identification Modern writers have made many attempts to identify them.R. Dion, \\"Le probl√®me des Cassiterides,\\" Latomus 11 (1952) pp 306‚Äì14. Small islands off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula, the headlands of that same coast, the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, and the British Isles as a whole, have all in turn been suggested, but none suits the conditions. Neither the Iberian islands nor the Isles of Scilly contain tin, at least in significant quantities. It seems most probable, therefore, that the name Cassiterides represents the first vague knowledge of the Greeks that tin was found overseas, somewhere in, off, or near Western Europe. Gavin de Beer has suggestedGavin de Beer, \\"Iktin\\", The Geographical Journal 126.2 (June 1960:160‚Äì167), p. 166. that Roger Dion had solved the puzzleDion, \\"Le probl√®me des Cassit√©rides,\\" Latomus 11 (1952:306-14) by bringing to bear a chance remark in Avienus' late poem Ora maritima, which is based on early sources: the tin isles were in an arm of the sea within sight of wide plains and rich mines of tin and lead, and opposite two islands ‚Äî a further one, Hibernia, and a nearer one, Britannia. \\"Before the estuary of the Loire became silted up in late Roman times, the Bay of Biscay led into a wide gulf, now represented by the lower reaches of the river BrivetBrivet: Le Brivet est une rivi√®re de Loire-Atlantique, dernier affluent de la Loire, traversant les Marais de Grande Bri√®re. and the marshes of the Bri√®re, between Paimboeuf and St. Nazaire, in which were a number of islands. The islands and shores of this gulf, now joined together by silt, are crowded with Bronze Age foundries that worked tin and lead; P√©nestin\\"The village of Penestin on the headland south of the estuary of the Vilaine in Brittany means the tin cape\\". (de Beers 1960:162). and the tin headland are just north of them; and there can be no doubt that the famous tin islands were there.\\" De Beer confirms the location from Strabo: the Cassiterides are ten islands in the sea, north of the land of the Artabrians in the northwest corner of Hispania. E. Thomas from the French BRGM showed in a 2004 report that tin mines were probably operated by the Romans at La Hye, near Plo√´rmel.E. Thomas et al., Carte G√©ologique de la France - Plo√´rmel, BRGM, 2004, see p 88-90 This tin might have transited down the Oust river and the Vilaine river to the sea, where it could be transferred on seagoing ships, possibly at P√©nestin, giving some support to de Beer's suggestion above.

Taxonomy A Sumatran short-tailed python Python curtus was the scientific name proposed by Hermann Schlegel in 1872 for a python with a short tail from Sumatra. The type locality is Sumatra.McDiarmid, R. W., Campbell, J. A., Tour√©, T. 1999. Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, vol. 1. Herpetologists' League. 511 pp. (series). (volume). Description The arrangement of labial scales identify this illustration as Python brongersmai The Sumatran short-tailed python has narrow subocular scales between the bottom of the eye and the top of the labial scales. The parietal scales do not join each other. P. curtus and P. breitensteini can be distinguished by the frontal and parietal scales on the tops of their heads. In both P. brongersmai and P. breitensteini, the parietal scales join. Adults grow to in length and are heavily built. The tail is extremely short relative to the overall length. The color pattern consists of a beige, tan, or grayish-brown ground color overlaid with blotches that are brick- to blood-red in color.Mehrtens, J. M. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Distribution and habitat The Sumatran short-tailed python occurs in Sumatra, Riau Archipelago, Lingga Islands, Bangka Islands, Mentawai Islands and Kalimantan. It inhabits rainforests, marshes, swamps, and the vicinity of river banks and streams. Diet They feed on a variety of mammals and birds. Reproduction Oviparous, females seldom lay more than a dozen large eggs (however, much larger clutches have been reported). The female remains coiled around the eggs during the incubation period, and may shiver to produce heat. However, this action requires energy and the female will only do so if surrounding temperatures drop below 90 ¬∞F. The hatchlings emerge after 2.5 to 3.0 months and are about in length. Uses The species is kept as an exotic pet. They are often regarded as unpredictable and aggressive, but captive-bred individuals tend to be more docile than wild-caught specimens. The Sumatran short-tailed python has been extensively harvested for leather; an estimated 100,000 individuals are taken for this purpose each year. The commercial trade regards this as a single species. Authors who elevate these island populations to species note that skins are readily distinguished.

History  In 2005, the MGM Grand Detroit Casino was the subject of a possible sale when parent company MGM MIRAGE announced that it was acquiring rival casino company Mandalay Resort Group, owners of the MotorCity Casino. Due to Michigan state gaming laws prohibiting casino owners from acquiring or owning more than one casino in the state, MGM Mirage was forced to sell either the MGM Grand Detroit or the MotorCity casino. MGM MIRAGE had several serious buyers for the MGM Grand Detroit, but ultimately sold the MotorCity Casino to Marian Ilitch. On December 13, 2005, the Michigan Gaming Control Board approved MGM Grand's plans for a permanent casino with of casino space, 401 hotel rooms, and an eight-story self-parking garage to be located on John C. Lodge Freeway and Bagley Street, three to four blocks from the temporary casino. The facility has of meeting space for conferences and live performance seating for 1,200. The Casino is also rebuilding 3rd Street into a two way boulevard to facilitate traffic movement around the site. The permanent casino opened its doors to the public on October 3, 2007. The grand opening celebration attracted Hollywood stars. A Celebrity Poker Match was taped there for a televised release at a later date.

It is capable of handling nearly two dozen file formats, including all the most common formats, as well as password-protect archives and work directly with CD-R/RW drives. It is presented in two editions: standard and suite. While the suite edition includes optional modules of the ZipGenius project (oriented to experts and power-users), the standard setup package simply includes the main ZipGenius application. ZipGenius was first released as Mr. Zip 98 to a strict group of users, and renamed ZipGenius in March 1998. In April 1999, its first public release was made. ZipGenius's latest release is version 6.3.2.3112 (), containing many fixes, the majority of which are bug fixes not visible at first glance. Features ZipGenius features include: support for TWAIN devices (scanners and digital cameras), file extraction to CD/DVD burner (only under Windows XP), an FTP client (FTPGenius), and ZGAlbum. ZGAlbum allows users to create slideshows with pictures, which can be loaded from a folder or imported through a TWAIN device. ZipGenius also fully integrates with Windows Explorer shell. User interface and functions have been placed in multiple locations. Program functions can be accessed either from a menu of buttons on the main toolbar, or from a drop-down menu. They can be customized to suit user preferences. ZipGenius 6 is capable of opening a variety of formats commonly used with Linux, such as RPM, TAR, TAR.GZ, TGZ, GZ and 7Z. As regards data security, the archive history file is encrypted, the most recently used files list can be enabled (always or per-session) or disabled, and CryptoZip 2.1 gives encryption algorithms to lock user archives. Users can create self- locking/self-erasing archives and can choose to encrypt files with one of four algorithms (CZIP, Blowfish, Twofish, Rijndael AES). Also, CZIP files no longer depends on ZipGenius because users can create executable CZIP (.EXE) files which will allow the user to send encrypted archives to people who do not use ZipGenius. ZipGenius is hosted at zipgenius.it, but in 2008 the WinInizio Software team put zipgenius.com online to offer an international website for users not speaking Italian. On July 1, 2009, website ZipGenius.it has been totally redesigned upon the MODx web application. On July 6, 2009, ZipGenius 6.1.0.1010 was released to the public. Current release is 6.3.2.3116 since February 1, 2017. Release 6.3.2.3117 is set to be published during summer 2020 and it will be the last release in the 6.x series because the Project ZipGenius X development has started and the first application, CZIP X, has been released. Later in 2020, the main ZipGenius X app will be released. File formats ZipGenius is able to handle the open source UPX executable compressor, which is used to compress ZipGenius main executable. If UPX.exe is in ZipGenius program folder, users will get an extra compression level while creating new ZIP archives: Brutal+UPX. Many executable files (EXE, DLL, OCX) are distributed as they are after code compilation, so they may have a larger size than necessary. ZipGenius supports the 7-Zip compression format, conceived by Igor Pavlov, which can compress files more than standard ZIP or RAR compression formats. ZipGenius supports OpenOffice.org/StarOffice documents. OpenOffice.org applications produce their own files in a special format: they are .ZIP archives with a custom file extension containing some XML files, which OpenOffice.org programs merge to rebuild the original documents. ZipGenius complies with this feature, and allows users to manage those files as if they were common ZIP files. In addition, users can optimize them: OpenOffice.org does not use the maximum compression level available for .ZIP format, but ZipGenius does. When users optimize an OpenOffice.org document with ZipGenius, the gain is from 5 to 10 KB of size reduction (depending by the content of the OpenOffice.org file) because ZipGenius will recompress the document with the \\"Brutal\\" compression level.

Fiske (born Irving Louis Fishman; March 5, 1908 ‚Äì April 25, 1990) was an American playwright, writer, and public speaker.He worked for the Federal Writer's Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s, where he was a writer and rewrite man on The WPA Guide to New York City, in print today. He corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, wrote an article now considered a classic, \\"Bernard Shaw's Debt to William Blake,\\" and translated Shakespeare's Hamlet into Modern English. He and his wife Barbara Fiske Calhoun co-founded the artist's retreat and \\"hippie commune\\" Quarry Hill Creative Center, on the Fiske family property, in Rochester, Vermont. Biography Fiske was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant Jewish family from Georgia, Russia, and Romania. He graduated from Cornell University in 1928. He had two brothers, Milton and Robert, and a sister, Miriam. Milton was a Bohemian, like Irving, and a classical composer, like his hero, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with whom he shared a birthday. Fiske wrote for H. L. Mencken's American Mercury. On January 8, 1946, Fiske married Barbara Fiske Calhoun. In 1946, he and his wife, both wildly unconventional bohemian intellectuals, used wedding money to buy the farm in Rochester\\"Notable deaths last week,\\" Daily Herald (May 3, 2014). that later became Quarry Hill Creative Center, in Rochester, Vermont.‚ÄúIrving L. Fiske, 82: Created Community for Workers in Arts,‚Äù The New York Times (May 1, 1990)Sherman, Michael, Gene Sessions, and P. Jeffrey Potash. Freedom and Unity: A History of Vermont (Montpelier, VT: Vermont Historical Society, 2003). . Sherman, a respected historian and teacher at Vermont College, credits Quarry Hill and The North Hollow School with being a model for the many alternative schools that sprang up in Vermont in the 1970s and onward. Fiske joined Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky in a First Amendment-based defense of the Beat Generation coffee houses along Second Avenue in the East Village; certain business owners there objected to the use of \\"obscenity\\" in the Beat poetry being read there by poets like Ginsberg and many others. Ginsberg, Orlovsky, Fiske, and others won the case, and the right for poets to use any language they considered a part of their art. In the mid-1960s, Barbara opened a storefront, The Gallery Gwen, in New York's East Village. There Barbara showed her paintings, along with those of others, and Irving began to give public talks on Tantra, Zen, Sufism, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, and atheism, among many other things. Irving became well known around the Village, and was soon speaking to standing-room- only audiences. Many associated him with R. Crumb's character Mr. Natural.Spiegelman, Art. MetaMaus (New York: Pantheon, 2011), pp. 24‚Äì25: \\"...my hippie girlfriend's father, Irving Fiske ‚Äî the Mr. Natural of the commune I was involved with...\\" Irving spoke out in favor of people finding their own creative path in life, enjoying themselves, being free of guilt and shame, and children's rights. He wrote letters for young men who were conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. Irving was known in the Village as \\"The Forest Wizard,\\" (someone had given him a card on the street one day and he made it a part of his persona); and in Florida, where he had a cabin on a lake, he was known as \\"The Socrates of the Ocala National Forest.\\"Stacy, Mitch. \\"Author Irving Fiske, 'Socrates of Ocala Forest,' dies at 82,\\" The Gainesville Sun (April 1990). Fiske would also speak in colleges and churches on the East Coast, such as Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. Hundreds of young people, including many who became well-known, such as Art Spiegelman (who dated Fiske's daughter Isabella) and Stephen Huneck, began to visit Quarry Hill Creative Center. Many stayed to build houses; Quarry Hill is now the oldest and largest alternative lifestyle group in Vermont, and one of the largest in New England.Hartmann, Thom. The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight (New York: Three Rivers Press / Random House, 2004), pp. 309-11, 315 ‚Äî calls Quarry Hill \\"The oldest \\"intentional community in Vermont\\" A controversial figure, in the 1970s, when his cabin in the Ocala Forest was burnt by arsonists, and the authorities did not give him a permit to rebuild, he launched a legal and media battle, claiming that the authorities were prejudiced against the young people he brought there as his friends, most of whom had long hair. He eventually got the permit and rebuilt the cabin. Fiske and his wife divorced in 1976. After a period of some tension, he and Barbara reached a state of friendliness and mutual support, with the shared desire to see Quarry Hill continue. With the assistance of her son, William, and others, Barbara created a corporation to own the land. Fiske ‚Äî who went on with all the activities that entertained him and promoted a more sane future for humanity for as long as he lived ‚Äî became well known in the counterculture both in the United States and elsewhere. He died of a stroke in Ocala, Florida, on April 25, 1990. Irving Fiske's centennial was celebrated in Vermont and in Florida in 2008. = Hamlet in Modern English = Fiske's translation of Hamlet into modern English was never published, but was performed in public a number of times. In 1947, Fiske filed a lawsuit against Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock for infringing upon Hamlet in Modern English. In 1945, Hitchcock had announced plans to make a modern-language version of Hamlet. Although the project was dropped, Fiske claimed Hitchcock and Grant had plagiarized Fiske's concept, and sought damages of $1.25 million (later reduced to $750,000). The case was eventually heard in October 1954 by New York Federal Court Judge William Bondy. After 11 days of testimony, Judge Bondy halted the trial and directed the jury to find the case \\"not proven.\\" Fiske was later ordered to pay $5,000 towards Hitchcock's legal costs. Fiske's translation of Hamlet was considered controversial. In the 1960s, John Ciardi, who did not approve of the translation, reprinted excerpts in the Saturday Review.Ciardi, John. \\"Translating 'Hamlet,' \\" Saturday Review (August 3, 1963). Most Saturday Review readers wrote in favor of the translation; as did such notable figures as William Saroyan, Orson Welles, Henry Miller, Upton Sinclair, Aldous Huxley, and George Bernard Shaw.Dotson, Kevin. \\"Irving Fiske, noted for essays, modern version of Hamlet; at 82,\\" The Boston Sunday Globe (April 29, 1990).

Today \\"gas flow computers\\" as such have become uncommon, since gas flow computing is a subfunction of a data acquisition and control program implemented with programmable logic controller (PLCs) and remote terminal unit (RTUs); with the rise of smart transmitters in the early 1980s, these functions have also been incorporated within the field transmitters themselves. The \\"gas flow computer\\" senses a mixed \\"dry\\" gas stream flow rate plus gas temperature and pressure. The most common method of measuring gas flow is via differential pressure across an orifice plate inserted into a flow metering pipe. As the differential pressure is not directly proportional to the gas flow rate, a flow computer algorithm is required to convert the differential pressure reading into a flow rate (may include square root extraction to linearize the input). Since gas is compressible and affected by temperature, the gas temperature and pressure must also be monitored and compared to a specified standard temperature and pressure within the algorithm. This is referred to as volumetric flow measurement. Next we need to calculate mass flow AGA3 based upon the specific gravity of the gas. Since a natural gas stream contains a mix of various hydrocarbon gases of different specific gravities, mole percentages must be determined via a gas sample analysis. The mixed gas stream will also contain some inert gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Therefore the gas flow computer also requires the entry of mole percentages for each gas component. Based on accurate mass flow calculations it becomes possible, based upon the energy content of each gas component, to calculate energy flow, i.e., API 14.5 (GPA 2172) since each gas component contains different energy content. These values in joules (or calories or Btus) are typically built into the gas flow computer algorithm. Therefore energy flow metering is our ultimate goal since this is where the true value is for the client. Also these mineral reserves are taxed based upon energy content. The inert gases such as nitrogen have no value. (Some inert gases actually have negative value, most notably carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, as they require extra equipment to remove from the natural gas, and costs are incurred in their disposal.) Other input parameters include contract hour as well as location latitude and altitude above sea level, isentropic exponent and type of materials used in the metering device to optimize the accuracy of calculations. In summary the gas flow computer requires approximately 30 initial input parameters in conjunction with \\"near realtime\\" gas flow, pressure and temperature sensing. In addition to providing volumetric, mass and energy flow data, the gas flow computer also provides date and time, instantaneous, hourly and daily data. The gas flow computer typically stores date/time stamped volume records in RAM for up to 35 days in order to provide sufficient time for a host system to retrieve the records as well as to allow time for human intervention if this retrieval fails to occur. The flow computer generally tracks modifications to flow parameters (e.g. orifice plate size or gas analysis data) in an \\"Audit Trail\\" that identifies the modified parameter, the time and date of the value change, the old and new values, and may identify the person making the change. The data log format and contents vary slightly by flow computer manufacturer, with all manufacturers designing to a specification outlined by the American Petroleum Institute.American Petroleum Institute, Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 21, \\"Electronic Flow Measurement\\", 1993-1998 Flow metering accuracy is easily compromised if there are liquids in the gas stream. Therefore methods are implemented to remove liquids from the gas stream before measurement. However a newer V-Cone technology (the inverse of orifice plate technology) is being used to more accurately meter gas that contains some liquids.

It stars Courteney Cox as Sophie, a photographer whose life begins to unravel following a traumatic incident on November 7 that involved her boyfriend, played by James LeGros. The film co-stars Michael Ealy, Nora Dunn, Anne Archer, Nick Offerman, and Matthew Carey. The low-budget independent film was directed by Greg Harrison, written by Benjamin Brand and Harrison, and produced by Danielle Renfrew and Gary Winick. Sony Pictures Classics released it to theaters in the United States on July 22, 2005, and while its award-winning digital video photography was praised, many reviews criticised the film's story for being too ambiguous and derivative of other pictures. Critics have compared it to the work of film-makers such as David Lynch and M. Night Shyamalan.  Plot  On the evening of November 7, photographer Sophie Jacobs (Cox) and her attorney boyfriend Hugh (LeGros) go to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. As they travel home afterward, Sophie develops a craving for \\"something sweet\\" and stops their car at a convenience store. While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man (Carey) arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives. Sophie sinks into a deep depression, and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her psychiatrist, Dr. Fayn (Dunn), about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co- worker, Jesse (Ealy). After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs (Archer), who accidentally knocks a glass over. During a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7. Sophie contacts Officer Roberts (Offerman), the head of the investigation into the shootings at the convenience store, who is as puzzled as she is as to who is responsible for the photos. Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's credit card. The film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character \\"goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it.\\"Mills, Nancy. \\"Dramatic turn for Courteney\\" . New York Daily News. July 20, 2005. Retrieved September 19, 2005. According to Greg Harrison, the events in the film were Sophie's memories as she and Hugh lay dying on the floor of the convenience store: \\"Each movement of this memory was her process of coming to terms with the terrible trauma, which was that she was killed for absolutely no reason, and it was some random act of violence she couldn‚Äôt confront\\".

Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved June 27, 2006.  Development  The film's original script was written by Benjamin Brand, who had written and sold several unproduced screenplays to studios. Brand had served as an assistant to producer Danielle Renfrew on the film Groove (2000), which Greg Harrison had directed. Brand, Renfrew and Harrison were friends, and were living in their hometown of San Francisco developing separate projects at \\"mini-major\\" studios which, according to Renfrew, were \\"wallowing in development hell\\".Cooper, Caroline. \\"An Interview with Greg Harrison, Director of November\\". DC Film Society. Retrieved September 21, 2010. Brand then read a newspaper story about a shooting during the robbery of a store, in which the robber had hidden the body of the proprietor behind the counter and then taken the proprietor's place at the counter as customers came in. Inspired by the story and its setting, as well as experiences in his own life (he had once been a teacher of photography at the Academy of the Arts), Brand wrote a screenplay and presented it to Renfrew and Harrison. They were both impressed; Harrison said it was \\"fascinating ... kind of an abstract exercise in narrative, which I thought was exciting and bold\\".Murray, Rebecca. \\"Interview with Director Greg Harrison About His Indie Film, \\"November\\"\\" . About.com. Retrieved September 19, 2005. Brand and Harrison worked through several drafts of the script over the following six months. Harrison, who cited the \\"terrible, terrible\\" experience of coping with the death of a close friend as one of his personal inspirations for the film, focused their efforts on inserting a more profound element of emotion into the script; in his words they were \\"trying to express the subjective experience of trauma\\". Once they and Renfrew were satisfied with their work, the group began pitching the project to various production companies. Renfrew consciously chose to avoid taking the project to major Hollywood studios such as 20th Century Fox or Warner Bros.; instead, she opted for \\"smaller companies who were interested in doing something off of center\\". A breakthrough was achieved after a meeting with director Gary Winick, who had established a company in New York City called InDigEnt. The company specialised in backing low-budget films shot on digital video such as Personal Velocity (2002), Tadpole (2002) and Pieces of April (2003). Greg Harrison's debut film Groove had impressed executives at the company, and John Sloss of Cinetic Media said, \\"November is exactly the kind of sharp and invigorating material that has made InDigEnt what it is\\".Henderson, Chris. \\"Courteney Cox Arquette Goes Indie In \\"November\\"\\". IndieWIRE. March 17, 2003. Retrieved October 27, 2005. Before the development of the film, Harrison had cast actress Courteney Cox in a Garry Trudeau- scripted ensemble film being developed at Fox Searchlight. Cox was a comic actress widely known for her role on the television sitcom Friends and had participated in only a handful of more serious productions. While the Garry Trudeau project was intended as a comedy, Harrison said he felt Cox was \\"very capable of drama and was very willing and wanted to transcend her comedic persona\\" when they had first met. The project did not enter production, but when Harrison began casting for November, Cox became a prime candidate for the lead role. He offered her the part without an audition: \\"Courteney's biggest challenge is redefining herself ... I knew I could bring something out of her that people haven't seen before\\", he said. Cox, who said she is more similar to her character in November than her Friends character, Monica Geller, said, \\"I wanted to make November because it's fascinating, confusing, ambiguous, eerie and makes you think. There aren't that many movies where you leave the theater and want to talk about them\\". She added, \\"it was trying to take you through a woman's experience of tragedy and through all the stages. I loved that\\".Triplett, Brian. \\"Role Reversal Courteney Cox was eager to stretch dramatic muscles for indie November\\". Los Angeles Times. August 23, 2005. Retrieved August 28, 2010.  Production  Harrison, Brand and Renfrew intended the film to be set and shot in San Francisco, but problems arose with their proposal. Cox had a commitment to Friends, which was in production in Los Angeles, and the film's production costs did not allow the entire production team to relocate to northern California for the duration for the shoot. The film-makers were forced to shoot in Los Angeles, but Renfrew later expressed no regret in their decision: \\"We wanted the story to take place in an anonymous urban area. And I think we were successful in doing that\\". Production finally began on May 19, 2003, and took place on Cox's days off from her Friends shooting schedule. Renfrew's home in Los Angeles stood in for the apartment of Cox's character in the film. The budget did not allow the luxury of trailers, but with some persuading, neighbouring apartments were converted into staging areas. For her role Cox donned glasses with thick frames, and had her hair cut by seven inches and a grey streak dyed into it. Harrison said, \\"She's seen in the fashion world as glamorous, a pop icon from Friends, so how to dress her down, and also make her body feel different. I had her wear those clothes around the house to feel like a different person\\".\\"Interview with Greg Harrison\\". TheMovieChicks.com. June 6, 2005. Retrieved September 23, 2005. Smoke was pumped across the set to help create a blue color cast for scenes in the film's first act The film's cinematographer was Nancy Schreiber, who had never before shot a film on Mini- DV. Harrison intended the shifts between chapters of the film‚Äîand Sophie's emotions‚Äîto be signalled visually, and he instructed Schreiber to employ different colour casts accordingly. For the opening robbery scenes (which recur throughout the film), Schreiber purchased two Panasonic AG-DVX100 cameras with white balance and color temperature controls. She used them with lighting gels and sodium street lamps that surrounded the real-life convenience store where the crew was shooting to make the image appear green. A similar process was used in the second movement of the narrative, which was bathed in orange to represent Sophie's despair, while white expressed \\"acceptance\\" in the film's third and final act. To help achieve a blue colour cast for the first phase of the film (\\"denial\\"), Schreiber surrounded the shooting locations with machines that pumped smoke across the set. Cinematographer and Sundance Film Festival judge Frederick Elmes commented of Schreiber's work, \\"She lit it and used colors in a way that the camera responded. And I don't think that's the kind of thing you do by accident. That's completely designed\\".\\"Lens Crafter\\". Filmmaker Magazine. Spring 2004. Retrieved October 2, 2005. Harrison applauded the speed of Mini-DV for allowing such a short shoot: \\"We could shoot with multiple cameras at times, which helped us in our schedule\\". He also cited the advantages Mini-DV had in post-production, estimating that 75%‚Äì80% of the visual and sound design processing had been performed on desktop computers. November was shot in fifteen days on a budget of $150,000, and post-production costs were the same ‚Äì a typical production model for films produced by InDiGent. Of the tight schedule and production costs, Harrison said, \\"I don't recommend shooting a movie that way and I don't want to do it again to be honest. It's really, really taxing\\". Once shooting had wrapped, Harrison entered the editing room and constructed the film over the course of eighteen weeks, occasionally consulting colleagues such as Sarah Flack (editor of The Limey (1999) and Lost in Translation (2003)). Harrison, who had started out in the film industry as an editor, noted the strong involvement of key creative personnel throughout the pre-production, production and post-production stages, and called it \\"kind of a more holistic approach to post-production\\". He described the experience of editing the film alone (for the most part) as \\"brutal\\" and \\"exhausting\\", but he said he was satisfied with his work nonetheless. When asked about the film's seventy-three-minute running time, Renfrew said that Harrison \\"let the story and the film dictate the length as opposed to trying to force it to be any particular length\\".  Promotion  November was included in the Official Selection at the Sundance Film Festival, and received its first public screening there on January 18, 2004.

It is bisected by Woodward Avenue, four blocks north of Campus Martius Park, and is roughly bounded by Clifford, John R. and Adams Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The building at 25 West Elizabeth Street was added to the district in 2000, and additional structures located within the district, but built between 1932 and 1960, were approved for inclusion in 2012. History Augustus Woodward's plan for Detroit's baroque styled radial avenues and Grand Circus Park A part of Augustus Woodward's plan to rebuild the city after the fire of 1805, the city established the park in 1850. Woodward's original plan called for the park to be a full circle, but after construction began, property owners north of Adams Street were reluctant to sell due to rising land values. The Detroit Opera House overlooks the eastern edge of the park and the grounds include statuary and large fountains. Near this historic site, General George Armstrong Custer delivered a eulogy for thousands gathered to mourn the death of President Abraham Lincoln. Architect Henry Bacon designed the Russell Alger Memorial Fountain (1921) in Grand Circus Park. Bacon's other projects include the Lincoln Memorial (1915‚Äì1922) in Washington, D.C. The fountain contains a classic Roman figure symbolizing Michigan by American sculptor Daniel French who sculpted the figure of Lincoln for the Memorial. Grand Circus Park, circa 1910s In 1957, the City of Detroit constructed a parking garage under the two halves of the park. The eastern portion houses space for 250 cars and the western portion accommodates 540. The half-moon shaped park is divided down its center by Woodward Avenue, the city's main thoroughfare. The Alger Fountain anchors the eastern half and is capped on its north western edge with a statue of mayor William Cotter Maybury. Its western half is anchored by the Edison Fountain and capped on its north eastern edge with a statue of mayor Hazen Pingree. The Maybury and Pingree monuments have been relocated several times. The Pingree statue was erected in 1904 near Woodward and Park Avenues facing south, while his rival, Maybury, occupied a site in the eastern half of the park facing Pingree across Woodward Avenue. After the 1957 garage construction, Pingree was returned to his original site while Maybury was placed at the north boundary of the park with his back to his foe. In the 1990s, both statues moved once again to their current locations. Among the notable buildings encircling the park are the David Broderick Tower and David Whitney Building on the south, Kales Building, and Central United Methodist Church on the north, and Comerica Park and Detroit Opera House on the East. Development On November 12, 2007, Quicken Loans announced its development agreement with the city to move its headquarters to downtown Detroit, consolidating about 4,000 of its suburban employees in a move considered to be a high importance to city planners to reestablish the historic downtown. The construction sites reserved for development under the agreement include the location of the former Statler on Grand Circus Park and the former Hudson's location. (The western edge of the park was formerly home to the now demolished Statler and Tuller hotels). Grand Circus is serviced by a People Mover station. East necklace The Detroit Opera House is located at Broadway and Grand Circus. The east necklace of downtown links Grand Circus and the stadium area to Greektown along Broadway. The east necklace contains a sub-district sometimes called the Harmonie Park District, which has taken on the renowned legacy of Detroit's music from 1930s through the 1950s to the present. Near the Opera House, and emanating from Grand Circus along the east necklace are other venues including the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts and the Gem Theatre and Century Club. The historic Harmonie Club and Harmonie Centre are located along Broadway. The Harmonie Park area ends near Gratiot and Randolph. The Detroit Athletic Club stands in view of center field at Comerica Park. Part of the east necklace, the area contains architecturally notable buildings planned for renovation as high-rise residential condominiums such as the Gothic Revival Metropolitan Building at 33 John R Street. The Hilton Garden Inn is also in the Harmonie Park area. The east necklace area is serviced by the People Mover at the Cadillac and Broadway Stations.

It was released for the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and the BBC Micro in 1984. In this sequel to Jetpac, the second installment of the Jetman series, Jetman has to destroy alien bases whilst simultaneously defending himself, along with Earth, from a hostile alien race. Lunar Jetman was Ultimate Play the Game's first game to require 48K‚Äîall previous productions had run on unexpanded 16K models. The game was written by Chris Stamper with graphics designed by Tim Stamper. It was met with critical acclaim upon release for its addictive gameplay and range of colours. It is one of the few games to support the Currah Microspeech peripheral. The game was followed by a third episode, Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship, released for the NES in 1990. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay. Gameplay Jetman must collect bombs and destroy alien bases to advance to the next level Once again taking on the role of Jetman, players find themselves on the surface of a small purple moon. Similarly to its predecessor, the player can move around slowly on foot, or use a jetpack to leave the ground and navigate the moon faster. However, unlike Jetpac, Jetman's jetpack has limited fuel and must be topped up regularly. In addition to the jetpack, the player has a moon rover for ground travel, inside of which they are invulnerable to damage. However, the moon rover can only negotiate smooth terrain, and Jetman may need to use bridging kits obtained from the rover to fill in craters on the moon's surface. The moon rover doubles as a refuelling point for Jetman's jetpack. Aside from the rover and its bridging kits, Jetman has access to three other pieces of equipment, all of which can be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon. Gameplay itself requires Jetman to locate and destroy a series of alien bases on the surface of the moon. Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one. To accomplish this task, Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base‚Äîeither in his space suit or using the rover‚Äîand then fly over the base and drop the bomb. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before the base is destroyed, two missiles are launched from the base‚Äîone for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missile aimed at the rover, thus preventing a game over. Reception Similar to its predecessor, the game was critically acclaimed upon release. Crash praised the graphics and wide spectrum of colours, noting that whilst the presentation did not differ much from its predecessor, the graphics were \\"every bit as good\\" as superior arcade machines. Home Computing Weekly also praised the presentation, stating that the colour and animation were \\"superb\\", whilst expressing the gameplay as \\"disgustingly addictive\\". When Crash revisited the game in their \\"Crashback\\" section of a 1984 issue, the game was still praised, with one reviewer stating that he would not change any of the original scores. Brian Buckley of ZX Computing praised the game's advanced graphics and effects, stating that extraordinary attention had been paid to detail and that every usage of sound and colour was \\"excellent\\". Buckley also asserted that Lunar Jetman was \\"the best computer game of all time\\". The game replaced its predecessor at the top of the UK ZX Spectrum sales chart. The game was also voted number 31 in the Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time. Alt URL Home Computing Weekly placed Lunar Jetman third in their \\"Top 10 programs for the ZX Spectrum\\" in a later 1983 issue. Legacy Lunar Jetman was re-released in August 2015 as part of the Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles, Rare Replay. (Ultimate acquired the trading name Rare in 1988.)

Founded in 1855, it is a rare surviving example of a Victorian era scientific society, with a museum, research center, library, and educational facilities. Its buildings, developed between 1859 and 1901, present the collections of founder William Wagner in the style of the period, and have been designated a National Historic Landmark for their architecture and state of preservation. History The Wagner Free Institute was founded in 1855 by William Wagner, a merchant, philanthropist, and gentleman scientist of the time, who sought to offer free educational courses to all who would seek to learn about the natural world. Wagner began offering free lectures on science at his home, Elm Grove, a colonial farm estate on the outskirts of Philadelphia in 1847. To illustrate the lectures, he drew on a collection of specimens he had gathered since his boyhood. All of the classes were offered with an open admission policy that allowed women as well as men to attend. These lectures became so popular that by 1855 he moved them first to a public hall to accommodate the rapidly growing audience, and later to its permanent home designed by Philadelphia architect John McArthur, Jr., who would go on to design Philadelphia's City Hall. Wagner continued to lecture and to lead the unique institution until his death in 1885. The Board of Trustees then appointed Joseph Leidy, a biologist of international reputation, to head its scientific and educational programs. Leidy's appointment ushered in an active and productive era in which the Institute's mission and programs were greatly expanded. Leidy's most lasting and significant contribution to the Institute was his reorganization of the Institute's museum. He greatly enlarged Wagner's original collection by further field collection, purchases and other acquisitions. Leidy personally developed and supervised their reorganization into a systematic display in which specimens and cases were arranged according to Darwin's theory of evolution, so that visitors moved from simpler to more complex organisms and through geologic time as they walked through the exhibition hall. This new display opened in 1891 and little has been altered since Leidy's time, making the Institute an exceptional example of a Victorian era science museum. In 1892, the first branch of the Philadelphia Public Library, later becoming the Free Library of Philadelphia, opened at the Wagner Institute. The branch remained open until 1962. The Institute has continued to carry out Wagner's initial goals of offering free science courses, while also functioning as a library, lecture hall and museum. The museum maintains more than 100,000 specimens, including minerals and fossils collected by Wagner. Today, the Wagner Free Institute of Science is widely recognized as one of Philadelphia's historical treasures. While preserving its historic building and collections for future generations, the Institute also serves as a rich educational resource for programs on science, natural history, and the history of science from the 19th century to the present. The Wagner has received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities to preserve the building and its collection.

Additionally, a right of interstate travel is associated with the clause. Text Prior to ratification of Constitution The clause is similar to a provision in the Articles of Confederation: \\"The free inhabitants of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States.\\" James Madison discussed that provision of the Articles of Confederation in Federalist No. 42. Madison wrote, \\"Those who come under the denomination of free inhabitants of a State, although not citizens of such State, are entitled, in every other State, to all the privileges of free citizens of the latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own State.\\" Madison apparently did not believe that this clause in the Articles of Confederation dictated how a state must treat its own citizens. Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 80 that the corresponding Privileges and Immunities Clause in the proposed federal Constitution was \\"the basis of the union.\\" Between ratification and Civil War In the federal circuit court case of Corfield v. Coryell,Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823). Justice Bushrod Washington wrote in 1823 that the protections provided by the clause are confined to privileges and immunities which are, \\"in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments; and which have, at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several states which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign.\\" In his explanation of the scope of the rights protected by the clause, Justice Washington included the right to travel through and reside in states, the right to claim benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, the right of access to the courts, the right to purchase and hold property, and an exemption from higher taxes than state residents pay. The Corfield case involved the rights of an out-of-state citizen, rather than the rights of an in-state citizen, and Justice Washington's opinion did not suggest that this provision of the Constitution addresses how a legislature must treat its own citizens. On the contrary, Washington's handwritten notes indicate his belief that this provision of the Constitution did not address how a legislature must treat its own citizens.Magliocca, Gerard. ‚ÄúNot King Tut‚Äôs Tomb, But...‚Äù, Concurring Opinions (October 8, 2017), discussing Justice Bushrod Washington's notes on Corfield v. Coryell at the Chicago History Museum. Another pertinent federal circuit court case was decided by Justice Henry Baldwin, who succeeded Justice Washington. In the case of Magill v. Brown,Magill v. Brown, 16 Fed. Cas. 408 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1833) Justice Baldwin addressed the Privileges and Immunities Clause: \\"We must take it therefore as a grant by the people of the state in convention, to the citizens of all the other states of the Union, of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of this state.\\" These federal circuit court statements by Justices Washington and Baldwin were not inconsistent with each other. They both became the settled doctrine of the U.S. Supreme Court after the Civil War. In 1833, Justice Joseph Story also addressed the clause:Story, Joseph. Commentaries on the Constitution (1833), ¬ß 1800. > It is obvious, that, if the citizens of each state were to be deemed aliens > to each other, they could not take, or hold real estate, or other > privileges, except as other aliens. The intention of this clause was to > confer on them, if one may so say, a general citizenship; and to communicate > all the privileges and immunities, which the citizens of the same state > would be entitled to under the like circumstances. Thus, Story thought that the clause was meant \\"only to provide temporary visitors with equality in certain rights with the citizens of the states they were visiting.\\"Curtis, Michael Kent. No State Shall Abridge, page 67 (1986), via Google Books. The clause was also mentioned by the Supreme Court in the infamous Dred Scott v. Sandford decision in 1857. Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the majority, said that the clause gives state citizens, when in other states, the right to travel, the right to sojourn, the right to free speech, the right to assemble, and the right to keep and bear arms.\\"Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 at 417 (1857). In his dissent, Justice Curtis wrote that the clause does not confer any rights other than rights that a visited state chooses to guarantee to its own citizens.Dred Scott, 60 U.S. 393 at 584: \\"It rests with the States themselves so to frame their Constitutions and laws as not to attach a particular privilege or immunity to mere naked citizenship\\" (Curtis dissenting). After Civil War In 1866, during the congressional debates about the draft Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Senator Jacob Howard noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had never squarely addressed the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause: > It would be a curious question to solve what are the privileges and > immunities of citizens of each of the States in the several States....I am > not aware that the Supreme Court have ever undertaken to define either the > nature or extent of the privileges and immunities thus guarantied.Sen. Jacob > Howard (May 23, 1866), quoted in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified two years later, in 1868, and still the Supreme Court had not spoken. The following year, on November 1 of 1869, the Court finally addressed this issue. In the case of Paul v. Virginia, , the Court said the following: > It was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question to place the > citizens of each State upon the same footing with citizens of other States, > so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those States are > concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alienage in other > States; it inhibits discriminating legislation against them by other States; > it gives them the right of free ingress into other States, and egress from > them; it insures to them in other States the same freedom possessed by the > citizens of those States in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and in > the pursuit of happiness; and it secures to them in other States the equal > protection of their laws. The Court went on to explain that the laws of one state would not become effective in another: \\"It was not intended by the provision to give to the laws of one State any operation in other States. They can have no such operation, except by the permission, express or implied, of those States.\\" These sections of Paul v. Virginia are still good law, and were relied upon, for example, in Saenz v. Roe, . Other portions of Paul v. Virginia were reversed in U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n, . The Court has never deviated from the principle stated in Paul that the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the Constitution has no bearing on how a state treats its own citizens. In-state residents \\"have no claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\\" United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden, . The Privileges and Immunities Clause prevents discrimination against people from out of state, but only with regard to basic rights. The Court uses a two-part test to determine if the Privileges and Immunities Clause has been violated. First, it looks to see if a law discriminates against people from out of state regarding fundamental rights (e.g. protection by the government of the enjoyment of life, and liberty, the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety). These rights often focus on the economic right to pursue a livelihood. The second part of the test focuses on whether the state is justified in the discrimination. It examines if there is a substantial reason for the difference in treatment, and if the discriminatory law has a substantial relationship to that reason. For example, the Court has asked: \\"Does the distinction made by Montana between residents and nonresidents in establishing access to elk hunting threaten a basic right in a way that offends the Privileges and Immunities Clause?\\" See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana . The court held it did not, because hunting is a recreational sport, which is outside the fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. If the court had found that recreation and sports were fundamental rights, it would have still had to examine whether the state had a compelling interest (protecting elk herds from being over-hunted), and whether the law was designed to address that problem. The Court's decision in the Slaughterhouse Cases (1873) is consistent with the idea that the Privileges and Immunities Clause was intended only to guarantee that a citizen of one state could enjoy equality in another state with regard to fundamental rights. Referring to the words of Justice Washington in Corfield, the Slaughterhouse Court stated:Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1873). Via Cornell Law School. > [P]rivileges and immunities....are, in the language of Judge Washington, > those rights which are fundamental. Throughout his opinion, they are spoken > of as rights belonging to the individual as a citizen of a State....The > constitutional provision there alluded to did not create those rights....It > threw around them in that clause no security for the citizen of the State in > which they were claimed or exercised. Nor did it profess to control the > power of the State governments over the rights of its own citizens. Its sole > purpose was to declare to the several States, that whatever those rights, as > you grant or establish them to your own citizens, or as you limit or > qualify, or impose restrictions on their exercise, the same, neither more > nor less, shall be the measure of the rights of citizens of other States > within your jurisdiction. (emphasis added) The Supreme Court has never interpreted the Privileges and Immunities Clause as requiring any state to protect general rights of citizenship beyond those that the state already protects for its own citizens, though even a state's own citizens must be allowed to leave the state in order to enjoy privileges and immunities in any other state. Right to travel The Privileges and Immunities Clause says that a citizen of one state is entitled to the privileges in another state, from which a right to travel to that other state may be inferred.Bogen, David. \\"The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV\\", Case Western Reserve Law Review, Vol. 37, p. 794, 847 (1987). Under this clause such an internal passport which is in use in a small minority of countries, would be unconstitutional.Bogen, David. \\"The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV\\", Case Western Reserve Law Review, Vol. 37, p. 794, 847 (1987). Indeed, in the 1982 case of Zobel v Williams, a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that the Privileges and Immunities Clause plausibly includes a right of interstate travel.Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55 (1982). Justice William Brennan, speaking for Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Lewis Powell said: \\"Justice O'Connor plausibly argues that the right [to travel] predates the Constitution, and was carried forward in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV\\" (citation omitted). Id. at 66. In that case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained:Zobel at 79 (citations omitted). > Article IV's Privileges and Immunities Clause has enjoyed a long association > with the rights to travel and migrate interstate. The Clause derives from > Art. IV of the Articles of Confederation. The latter expressly recognized a > right of \\"free ingress and regress to and from any other State,\\" in addition > to guaranteeing \\"the free inhabitants of each of these states . . . [the] > privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States.\\" While the > Framers of our Constitution omitted the reference to \\"free ingress and > regress,\\" they retained the general guaranty of \\"privileges and immunities.\\" > Charles Pinckney, who drafted the current version of Art. IV, told the > Convention that this Article was \\"formed exactly upon the principles of the > 4th article of the present Confederation.\\" Commentators, therefore, have > assumed that the Framers omitted the express guaranty merely because it was > redundant, not because they wished to excise the right from the > Constitution. Early opinions by the Justices of this Court also traced a > right to travel or migrate interstate to Art. IV's Privileges and Immunities > Clause....Similarly, in Paul v. Virginia, the Court found that one of the > \\"undoubt[ed]\\" effects of the Clause was to give \\"the citizens of each State > . . . the right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.... Despite scholarly and judicial opinions acknowledging that the Privileges and Immunities Clause may include a right to travel, the issue is not without controversy.Natelson, Robert. \\"The Original Meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause\\", Georgia Law Review, Vol. 43 1117-1193, at 1183 (2009). During the coronavirus outbreak in the United States in April, 2020, Raleigh attorney S.C. Kitchen, working for Six Outer Banks property owners, filed a federal lawsuit against Dare County NC, claiming their constitutional rights have been violated by an emergency order preventing them from accessing their homes. The lawsuit contends that the prohibition on the entry of out-of-state property owners violates the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Privileges and Immunities Clause, asserting that citizens of each state are entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in every state. Miscellaneous Unlike the Dormant Commerce Clause, there is no market participant exception to the Privileges and Immunities Clause. That means that even when a state is acting as a producer or supplier for a marketable good or service, the Privileges and Immunities Clause may prevent it from discriminating against non- residents.United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Camden (1984). Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship by the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act in 1917; subsequently, the U.S. Congress passed a law (signed by President Truman in 1947)This federal law is currently codified in the U.S. Code as . which expressly extended this constitutional clause to the U.S. citizens in the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico: > The rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens of the United States > shall be respected in Puerto Rico to the same extent as though Puerto Rico > were a State of the Union and subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of > section 2 of article IV of the Constitution of the United States. In the 1970s the Supreme Court began to recognize the application to Puerto Rico of several Constitutional protections contained in the Bill of Rights. In its opinions, the Court, without elaborating, relied on the insular cases of Downes and Balzac as precedent for the application of these constitutional rights.See, e.g., Examining Board of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 600 (1976) (Equal Protection); Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 469 (1979) (Fourth Amendment); Posadas de Puerto Rico v.

A graduate of MIT, her best-known contribution to the history of cinema is the Pinscreen (√âcran d'√©pingles), a vertically-mounted grid of 240,000 sliding metal rods that are first manually pushed into position to create lit and shaded areas, then filmed frame by frame. While the hand- operated, mechanical Pinscreen superficially shares characteristics with early optical toys like the zoetrope, it is distinguished by being one of the first devices ever to produce animation by reconfiguring a set of individual picture elements, later called pixels. Its pin \\"resolution\\" is sufficient to create photorealistic images, a painstaking process analogous to modern pixel art. Parker shared directing credits for her films with her husband and collaborator, Russian animator Alexandre Alexeieff; however, the 1935 patent on the Pinscreen was made in her name alone.French Animation History - Richard Neupert - Google Books Alexeieff and Parker's Pinscreen films include Night on Bald Mountain (1933) and The Nose (1963), as well as the opening title sequence for Orson Welles' film The Trial (1962). , the last known original Pinscreen still being used in animation production is maintained at the National Film Board of Canada's main campus in Montreal.

Scott was the son of Sir Walter Scott, 4th of Buccleuch (himself grandson of Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch) and Margaret Douglas.

In November 1592 Buccleuch was allowed to return to Scotland from Flanders by the intercession of Anne of Denmark, at the request of the old Lady Ferniehirst.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 608, 610, 814. In 1594, Buccleuch was re-appointed Keeper of Liddesdale. In August 1594 he performed in tournament at the baptism of Prince Henry dressed as an Amazon.Michael Bath, Emblems in Scotland: Motifs and Meanings (Brill, Leiden, 2018), pp. 97-101. In January 1595 he influenced Anne of Denmark to interecede for the life of James Scott of Balwearie, an agent of the rebel Catholic earls.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 524. In April 1595 and in 1597 he raided Tynedale in England with a 100 or 1,000 men. They killed at least 30 residents, and burnt houses at Thorneburn, Donkleywood, Stokoe, Hordley Hill House and others including the home of a widow, Catherine Dodd of Bruntbank, and caused damage valued at ¬£191, and killed four members of the Charlton family at Bought Hill (now Charlton, Northumberland).Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 525-6. =Kinmont Willie= As Keeper of Liddesdale he rescued Kinmont Willie Armstrong from prison in Carlisle, an exploit famous in border lore. Armstrong, a well known border reiver, was captured by English soldiers led by Deputy Warden Salkeld on 17 March 1596, in violation of a truce day. He was taken to Carlisle and imprisoned in Carlisle Castle. Buccleuch, as Keeper of Liddesdale, petitioned the English Warden Sir Thomas Scrope for Armstrong‚Äôs release without success. Unable to release Armstrong by diplomatic means, on the night of 13 April 1596 Buccleuch led a party of about eighty men to Carlisle. Leaving the main body of his men a small distance outside the city to ambush any pursuers, Buccleuch took a small raiding party on to the castle where Armstrong was imprisoned. Finding their ladders too short to scale the walls, the raiding party breached a postern gate ‚Äî or more probably bribed a contact inside the castle to open it for them ‚Äî located Armstrong‚Äôs cell and freed him, returning him back across the Scottish border. No fatalities were occasioned on either side. The raid on Carlisle created a diplomatic incident between England and Scotland, and war between the two nations appeared imminent until Buccleuch surrendered himself to the English authorities. Tried and found guilty, Buccleuch was placed in the custody of the English Master of the Ordnance at Berwick, Sir William Selby, and was afterwards sent to London. When Buccleuch reached London, and, having been presented to the Queen, was asked by Elizabeth I of England how he dared to undertake an enterprise so desperate and presumptuous, Buccleuch is reported to have replied, \\"What is it that a man dare not do?\\" Unaccustomed though she must have been to such rejoinders from her own courtly nobles, Elizabeth not only did not resent the answer, but turning to a lord- in-waiting, said, \\"With ten thousand such men, our brother in Scotland might shake the firmest throne of Europe.\\" Buccleuch's kinsman, the author Sir Walter Scott, transcribed a well known ballad about the raid entitled Kinmont Willie in his collection Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, Vol. 1. =Lord Scott of Buccleuch= He was created a Lord of Parliament, as Lord Scott of Buccleuch, in 1606 (pursuant to a commission from King James dated 18 March 1606). From 1604 until the truce of 1609, Buccleuch led a company of Borderers in the service of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange during the Dutch Revolt. Buccleuch died on 15 December 1611, and was interred at St Mary's Kirk, Hawick.  Family  Scott married (contract dated 1 October 1586) Mary, daughter of Sir William Kerr of Cessford and Janet Douglas. They had four children: # Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch (d. 20 November 1633) # Margaret Scott (died 5 October 1651) married first James Ross, 6th Lord Ross; married secondly Alexander Montgomerie, 6th Earl of Eglinton # Elizabeth Scott, who married (contract dated 22 November 1616) John Cranstoun, later 2nd Lord Cranstoun # Jean Scott (died after 21 November 1613). Scott also had (apparently by Delia, daughter of Captain Thomas Butler in Holland) an illegitimate daughter, Jean, who married Robert Scott of Whitslaid. He had an illegitimate son, John (probably to be identified with John Scott, Provost of Crichton, who died in 1646).James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 233.

John Lowin (baptized 9 December 1576 ‚Äì buried - 24 August 1653) was an English actor. Early life Born in St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London, Lowin was the son of a tanner. Like Robert Armin, he was apprenticed to a goldsmith. While he is not recorded as a free citizen of this company, he did perform as a goldsmith, Leofstane, in a 1611 city pageant written by Anthony Munday. This pageant was commissioned by the Goldsmiths' Company in honor of the election of one of their company as mayor; in the document employing him, Lowin is described as a \\"brother\\" of the company, suggesting some form of ongoing relationship with that community. He lived in Southwark, where parish registers record two marriages involving a man of his name (in 1607 and 1620); the latter definitely involved the actor. Career Lowin was definitely associated with the theatrical world by 1602. His name frequently occurs in the account books of Philip Henslowe in 1602, when he was playing with Worcester's Men at Rose Theatre in Bankside; a note in Henslowe's book places him in a travelling company in the same year. By late 1603, he had joined the new King's Men, apparently as a hired man rather than a sharer, as his name is not mentioned in the original royal patent. He probably became a sharer in 1604, when the total number of sharers was likely increased to twelve. That he became important to the company fairly quickly is suggested by his appearance as himself (alongside Richard Burbage and Henry Condell) in the induction to John Marston's The Malcontent. He is mentioned in the surviving cast lists of the company's productions of Ben Jonson's Sejanus (1603), Volpone (1605), The Alchemist (1610), and Catiline (1611), John Fletcher's Bonduca and Valentinian (both ca. 1613), and John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (ca. 1614). Lowin's prowess as an actor is displayed by a remarkable fact about the plays in which he acted. In the hundreds of plays, and the thousands of roles in them, that date to the 1580‚Äì1610 era, there are only about twenty roles of 800 lines or longer. Only three plays have two roles of this scale: Shakespeare's Othello and Jonson's Volpone and The Alchemist. Burbage played the starring role in the King's Men's productions of these plays‚Äî;and Lowin apparently was the man who seconded him (just as Lowin is known to have played Bosola to Burbage's Ferdinand in The Duchess of Malfi). In all likelihood it was Lowin who played Iago to Burbage's Othello, Mosca to his Volpone, and Subtle to his Face.McMillin, pp. 61-3. Edward Alleyn's diary speaks of his dining with Lowin in 1620. When John Heminges died in 1630, Lowin purchased an eighth of the total shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres. Together with Cuthbert Burbage, Richard Robinson and Winifred (d.1642), his wife, William Heminges, and Joseph Taylor, Lowin filed a Bill of Complaint on 28 January 1632 in the Court of Requests against the owner of the Globe, Sir Matthew Brend, in order to obtain confirmation of an extension of the 31-year lease originally granted by Sir Matthew Brend's father, Nicholas Brend.. With the death of Heminges in 1630, the old guard left over from the Lord Chamberlain's Men had finally passed. From that year until the theaters closed in 1642, Lowin (together with Joseph Taylor) assumed the roles previously fulfilled by Heminges, serving as treasurers and as contacts with the court and with the Master of the Revels. In 1633, he was scolded by Sir Henry Herbert for staging Fletcher's The Woman's Prize without censorship. After the theaters closed in 1642, Lowin may have kept an inn (called the Three Pigeons) at Brentford, where he died in 1659, at the age of eighty-two. Lowin was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication in the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher First Folio; also, he signed the 1652 edition of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase with Joseph Taylor. In the 25 cast lists added to plays in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679, Lowin's name is mentioned in the lists for 21 dramas, more than any other single actor: * Bonduca * The Custom of the Country * The Double Marriage * The False One * The Humorous Lieutenant * The Island Princess * The Knight of Malta * The Laws of Candy * The Little French Lawyer * The Loyal Subject * The Lovers' Progress * The Mad Lover * The Maid in the Mill * The Pilgrim * The Prophetess * The Queen of Corinth * The Sea Voyage * The Spanish Curate * Valentinian * The Wild Goose Chase * Women Pleased Lowin, whose portrait in the Ashmolean Museum reveals as a large and imposing figure, is often associated with comic characters, especially those of a \\"stout blunt humor,\\" including Falstaff and Melantius in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy. On the authority of James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), he is also associated with Jonson's Epicure Mammon (The Alchemist), Morose (Epicoene), and the title role in Volpone. Again on Wright's report, Lowin is supposed to have originated the role of Bosola in The Duchess of Malfi, and he was probably also the original Flaminius in Philip Massinger's Believe as You List. Finally, in Roscius Anglicanus, John Downes reports that Lowin originated the title role in Shakespeare and Fletcher's Henry VIII. Legacy Lowin was the author of a single literary work (as far as is known), a brief pamphlet titled Conclusions upon Dances that was first printed in 1607. The text of the pamphlet cites positive and negative examples of dances mentioned in the Bible.Gurr, p. 28. Notes References * *Collier, J. P. Lives of the Original Actors in Shakespeare's Plays.

Background Spend A Buck was sired by Buckaroohttp://www.chef-de- race.com/dosage/chefs-de-race/buckaroo-pleasant_colony.htm out of the dam Belle de Jour. Through his son Einstein (BRZ), he is now the primary source for the Buckpasser sire line in the United States. Spend a Buck is inbred 5x5 to Prince Rose and is line bred 5x8x8x6 to Man o' War, while his sire Buckaroo is inbred 4x5 to Blue Larkspur and La Troienne. Racing career On May 4, 1985, Spend A Buck won the Kentucky Derby by 5-3/4 lengths over Stephan's Odyssey under jockey Angel Cordero Jr. His 2:00 1/5 time is the fourth fastest as of 2020. He paid $10.20, $5.40, and $3.40. It was his trainer Cam Gambolati's first attempt to win the Derby, a feat not matched again until 2003 when Barclay Tagg saddled Funny Cide for his win. Earlier in the season, Spend A Buck had won two races at the newly reopened Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey: the Cherry Hill Mile on April 6 and the Garden State Stakes on April 20. Before the season began, Garden State Park owner Robert Brennan had put up a $2-million bonus to the horse that won the two April preparatory races, the Kentucky Derby, and the May 27 Jersey Derby, Garden State's signature race. Spend A Buck's owner, Dennis Diaz, opted to skip the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes and thus trade Spend A Buck's chance to win the Triple Crown for a shot at the bonus. Cordero, Spend A Buck's regular jockey, was committed to another race that day, so Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. rode Spend A Buck at Garden State. Spend A Buck won the Jersey Derby by a neck over eventual Belmont winner Creme Fraiche, capturing a $2.6-million prize, the largest single purse in American racing history. That record stood for 19 years, until Smarty Jones won the 2004 Kentucky Derby and a bonus similar to Brennan's. Because Spend A Buck skipped the last two legs of the Triple Crown, the Triple Crown races put up a bonus of their own to encourage participation in the series. Honors and awards Spend A Buck was voted the 1985 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Colt. Several races are named for Spend A Buck, including the Spend A Buck Stakes at Monmouth Park and the Grade III Spend A Buck Handicap at Calder Race Course. Stud career Spend A Buck had a successful post-racing career standing stud,http://www.pedigreepost.com/archives/SpendaBuckJoseOliveira.html siring 27 stakes winners with earnings of over $16 million. He died on November 24, 2002, at Haras Bage do Sul in Brazil following an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin.

It became part of the 19th- century recovery and reinvention of druidic tradition. Born in Llanfaredd, Radnorshire, Davies attended Christ College, Brecon (alongside his friend, the historian Theophilus Jones). He was the curate of Olveston, Gloucestershire and in 1805 was made rector of Bishopston, Gower. Davies produced a number of collections of poetry and plays but it was his writings on myth and history which were most successful. Influential in their time and later, his historical works are wildly inaccurate and speculative by modern standards. He was not fluent in Welsh and used unreliable sources and guesswork in his attempt to make Celtic myth correspond with biblical history. But unlike his contemporary Iolo Morganwg, Davies was not guilty of deliberate forgery; indeed, he was one of the few at the time who were suspicious of some of Iolo's work, which led to a literary feud between them. However, like most of his contemporaries, Davies fell for a number of Iolo's frauds, which further undermines the reliability of his work.

He was a member of the Governor's Council, twice Mayor of Annapolis, and a chief justice in the colony's court. Two of his sons would in their turn become Mayors of Annapolis. Early life John was born in 1705 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. His father John Brice and mother Sarah Brice (n√©e Howard) were already prominent settlers. Marriage and family Brice married Sarah Frisby in 1730 and had a number of children, including: * John Brice III (1738‚Äì1820), lawyer and Mayor of Annapolis. * James Brice (1746‚Äì1801), Governor of Maryland. Both sons would go on to enjoy successful political careers. Political career Samuel Chase, signer of the Declaration of Independence and Brice's implacable opponent. John Jr. entered public service as the clerk of Anne Arundel County in 1738 and served in that post for many years. He enter politics as an alderman in Annapolis shortly after. He was appointed to the Maryland Court in 1751 and was named to the Governor's Council. He would serve in both offices until his death, and by the end of his term on the court he was the chief justice. He served twice as the Mayor of Annapolis (1755‚Äì1756 and 1762‚Äì1763). Coming of Revolution Brice held a number of Proprietary appointments and, politically, was a Loyalist. In 1766, Brice became embroiled in a war of words Samuel Chase, a vocal opponent of the Stamp Act and later a signer of the American Declaration of Independence. In an open letter dated July 18, 1766 (the year of Brice's death) Chase attacked Brice, Walter Dulany, George Steuart (1700‚Äì1784), and others for publishing an article in the Maryland Gazette Extraordinary of June 19, 1766, in which Chase had been accused of being: \\"a busy, reckless incendiary, a ringleader of mobs, a foul-mouthed and inflaming son of discord and faction, a common disturber of the public tranquility\\". In his response, Chase accused Brice and the others of \\"vanity...pride and arrogance\\", and of being brought to power by \\"proprietary influence, court favour, and the wealth and influence of the tools and favourites who infest this city.\\" In particular Chase accused Brice of \\"spleen and bitterness\\", and a \\"passion for wealth\\" which had led him into \\"formidable frowns and opposition\\" to Chase. Legacy Brice died in 1766 and hence did not live to see the end of British rule in Maryland. However, both of Brice's sons would follow him into politics. Both were elected to terms as Mayor of Annapolis, and in addition James Brice would become Governor of a free Maryland.

The plot revolves around the efforts of two police detectives in search of the murderer of an undercover police officer. As they investigate, they engage in unethical behavior and uncover dark secrets that will challenge their fragile relationship. Plot Undercover narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of Detroit. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer when he holds a child hostage, but a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, Tellis is tasked with investigating the murder of an undercover officer, Michael Calvess. Tellis reluctantly agrees to take the case on two conditions: that he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction, and that he is partnered with Detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis has read about in the Calvess case file. The police chief accepts Tellis' conditions, but warns him about Oak's instability. Oak believes the department wants the Calvess case buried. He recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a 10-year-old girl who was being sold into prostitution by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man; he sees parallels with the current case. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Calvess' family, turns up at the house and angrily confronts Tellis. The detectives visit the scene where a drug dealer has been shot dead in his bathtub, which Tellis surmises the death was accidental. Tellis notes that the shotgun at the scene is a SWAT weapon with the serial number filed off. The detectives next visit the home of a man involved in Tellis' shooting. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer's badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in self-defense. The case assailant is determined to be Calvess' killer and the case is closed. However, Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer is yet to be found, and continue to investigate independently. When the detectives visit an auto body shop, Oak attempts to force a confession out of a pair of suspects. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak's tactics. Oak finds police-issue guns in a car belonging to one of the suspects, including one that belonged to Calvess. He beats both men until Tellis tells him to get CSI tools from the car. When Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door and asks for the truth from the suspects. They explain that Calvess, who had fallen into drug addiction, blew Tellis' cover eighteen months before and caused the shooting. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly. Oak arrives, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them. Tellis confronts Oak and accuses him of murdering Calvess, which Oak denies. Tellis then raises the issue of Oaks' relationship with Calvess' wife Kathryn. Kathryn was the ten- year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had, and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest, and Oak beats him with the shotgun, and resumes brutalizing the dealers. He turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak, and, realizing he's dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died. Oak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the department. In despair, Calvess took his gun and shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family, so Calvess' wife could receive his pension. Oak's motive was to convict the dealers who he felt made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis' arms, leaving the confession on tape, and Tellis with only moments to decide what to do with it.

It shares a lobby with the cabaret style Century Theatre (built 1903). The theatre has stylings of Spanish Revival architecture. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History In 1902, the Twentieth Century Club, a group of cultural, socially prominent women, built a Mission-style building to house their club. The building, now the Century Theatre, is built of red brick trimmed with white sandstone. The first floor originally housed a dining room, while the second floor housed a 400-seat auditorium.History page from Gem Theatre In 1928, the member of the Century club contracted George D. Mason to design a theater addition to the Century Club building. The resulting Spanish Revival-style building was leased to the Little Theatre chain, which showed foreign films, and the building was known as the Little Theatre. In 1933, due to the Depression, the Twentieth Century Club disbanded. The Little Theatre, however, continued, suffering through several name changes, becoming The Rivoli in 1932, Drury Lane (and then the Europa in 1935, the Cinema in 1936, and the Vanguard Playhouse in 1960. The Vanguard offered live theater rather than movies. Finally, in 1967, the theatre was named the Gem. The building was used as an adult movie house until it closed in 1978. Soon afterward, developer Charles Forbes purchased the combined Gem/Century building, and began a complete restoration of the Gem Theatre in 1990. The refurbished Gem opened in 1991. Protected from demolition during urban renewal for Comerica Park, the newest home of the Detroit Tigers, the Gem Theatre and Century Theatre were moved five-blocks on wheels to its new location at 333 Madison Street on 16 October 1997.

It was flying on a Montreal‚ÄìToronto‚ÄìLos Angeles route. It crashed in Toronto Gore Township, now part of Brampton. All 100 passengers and 9 crew on board were killed, and at the time it was Canada's second deadliest aviation accident.  History  Captain Peter Cameron Hamilton and First Officer Donald Rowland had flown on various flights together before, and had an ongoing discussion on when to arm the ground spoilers. They agreed that they did not like arming the spoilers at the beginning of the final approach, as specified in the checklist, fearing it could lead to an inadvertent spoiler deployment. The captain preferred not arming them at all, but directly deploying them once on the ground, while the co-pilot preferred arming them during the landing flare. Neither procedure was approved, as the spoilers should have been armed in the pre-landing check. The flight engineer, Harry Gordon Hill, correctly called for the spoiler deployment as evidenced in the CVR transcript. When executed just above the runway, the landing flare procedure arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up), lift momentarily increases, reducing the descent rate, and the main wheels may then gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots normally retard the throttles to idle to reduce engine thrust. A squat switch within the main landing gear then signals the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down. The pilots made an agreement that, when the captain was piloting the aircraft, the first officer would deploy the spoilers on the ground as the captain preferred, and when the first officer was piloting the aircraft, the captain would arm them on the flare as the co- pilot preferred. Pieces of the wreckage In this particular instance, the captain was piloting the landing and said, \\"All right. Give them to me on the flare. I have given up.\\" This was not the pilots' usual routine. Sixty feet from the runway, the captain began to reduce power in preparation for the flare and said \\"Okay\\" to the first officer. The first officer immediately deployed the spoilers on the flare instead of just arming them. The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing, and the tail struck the ground. Realizing what he had done, the first officer began apologizing to the captain. Apparently unaware of the severity of the damage inflicted on the aircraft, the crew managed to lift off for a go-around, but the lost fourth engine had torn off a piece of the lower wing plating and the aircraft was now trailing fuel, which ignited. The first officer requested a second landing attempt on the same runway but was told it was closed (because of the debris the DC-8 had left earlier) and was directed to another runway. Two and a half minutes after the initial collision, the outboard section of the right wing above engine number four exploded, causing parts of the wing to break off. Six seconds after this explosion, another explosion occurred in the area of the number three engine, causing the pylon and engine to both break off and fall to the ground in flames. Six and a half seconds after the second explosion, a third explosion occurred, destroying most of the right wing, including the wing tip. The aircraft then went into a violent nose dive, striking the ground at a high velocity of about and killing all 100 passengers and the nine crew members on board. Wreckage, body parts, bits of clothing and personal effects were strewn for more than 90 metres (100 yards) beyond the impact spot. The plane dug a furrow eight or ten feet deep, less than from the home of the Burgsma family, in which 10 persons lived, with the crash explosion blowing in their windows. The crash occurred in a farm field located near what is now Castlemore Road and McVean Drive in Brampton, Ontario. Memorial and witness accounts at the time reported the crash was in Woodbridge. This was because in 1970, prior to urban sprawl and changes in municipal boundaries, the site was closer to Woodbridge than Brampton. This was the first Air Canada accident involving fatalities and the first hull loss of a DC-8-63 version of a DC-8. In November 1963, another DC-8 of Trans-Canada Air Lines (the precursor to Air Canada) Flight 831, also bound from Montreal to Toronto, crashed with a loss of 118 lives.  Investigation  A board of inquiry was established to investigate the crash. The board published its official report on January 29, 1971, in which the accident was attributed to pilot error. Eight recommendations were provided, including that the activating lever for the spoilers should be designed in such a way that it could not be activated while the DC-8 is in flight, that the manufacturer should reinforce the structural integrity of the DC-8's wings and fuel tank and that Air Canada training and operating manuals should clarify the operating procedures regarding spoiler arming and deployment.Canada Board of Inquiry into the Accident at Toronto International Airport, Malton, Ontario, to Air Canada DC8-CF-TIW aircraft on July 5, 1970, AMICUS No. 21795471 Monograph, Libraries and Archives Canada website.  Aftermath  Recovery and identification of bodies proceeded slowly after the crash because of the need to excavate the crash crater to a significant depth. More than 20 of the passengers were United States citizens, all of them listed as being from Southern California. On July 30, 1970, 52 victims, 49 of whom were identified, were buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, and in May 1971 an obelisk and stone monument were erected (Plot 24-1) at the site, with all 109 victims' names inscribed. In 1979, Air Canada added an additional memorial at the cemetery.Alexander, Julia. Brampton memorial garden dedicated to Air Canada victims, Toronto Sun, July 7, 2013. Retrieved from TorontoSun.com July 8, 2013. In June 2002, Castlemore resident Paul Cardin, who had been inspired by a November 2001 Toronto Sun article revisiting the Flight 621 crash scene, discovered aircraft wreckage and possible human bone shards at the site. The Peel Regional Police investigated the findings, and it was later determined that the bones were not of recent origin, and had indeed come from the crash. Continuing searches of the crash site by archaeologist Dana Poulton and Friends of Flight 621 (a Brampton-based advocacy group founded by Cardin) produced hundreds of additional human bone fragments.  Memorial garden dedication in 2013  Since the crash, the surrounding area of the crash site itself has experienced significant residential urbanization. In January 2007, the landowners, in conjunction with the property developers, filed an application to designate a section of the crash site as a cemetery and memorial garden. On July 7, 2013, the memorial was officially opened at the sitehttp://maps.google.ca/maps near Degrey Drive and Decorso Drive in present- day Brampton.Brampton Memorial Dedicated to Air Canada Crash Victims, The Canadian Press, July 7, 2013.

The regional capital Linz lies approximately to the north, nearest towns are Gmunden and Bad Ischl. The municipality also comprises the Katastralgemeinden of Langwies, Oberlangbath, Rindbach, Kohlstatt and Roith. History With the Traunviertel, Ebensee since 1180 belonged to the Duchy of Styria held by the House of Babenberg from 1192, until in 1254 King Ottokar II of Bohemia finally allocated it to his Austrian duchy. Ebensee itself was first mentioned in a 1447 deed. From 1596 on Emperor Rudolph II of Habsburg had a salt evaporation pond erected near the settlement, supplied with brine being delivered via a long pipeline from the salt mines around Hallstatt. Ebensee therefore was the primary production centre for salt in Austria. Historically, the site was chosen because of the rich forests, whose wood was used to boil the salt out of the brine. In 1883 the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay established soda works of the Solvay company at Ebensee. Although a former industrial center in the larger Salzkammergut region, it has recently fallen on bad fortunes with the closure of some of the larger factories. Nazi Concentration Camp In 1943, the SS established Ebensee concentration camp (codename \\"Zement\\") near the town, a planned emergency location for the Peenem√ºnde research centre after the RAF Operation Hydra attack. It was part of the Mauthausen network. Slave laborers were worked to death digging tunnels for armaments storage. The camp was liberated by American soldiers in May 1945. Due to the extremely high death rates, Ebensee is considered one of the most horrific Nazi concentration camps. Used as a Displaced Persons camp after the war, the area is today site of a memorial and a museum. Population Politics Seats in the municipal assembly (Gemeinderat) as of 2009 elections: * Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ): 18 * Austrian People's Party (√ñVP): 9 * Citizens' List for Ebensee (Independent): 8 * Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ): 2 Tourism Ebensee is surrounded by three picturesque lakes, the Traunsee, the Offensee and the Langbathsee. The Traunsee is large enough to be used for boating, while the other two lakes are smaller, surrounded by mountains, and used only for bathing; both are protected natural areas. On the shore of the Langbathsee is a 19th-century hunting lodge erected at the behest of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. View of the Traunsee Since 1927 an aerial tramway built by the Bleichert engineering company runs up to the summit of the Feuerkogel mountain. Other tourist attractions include the Gasselh√∂hle show cave and a small skiing area with about ten lifts. Parts of the 1968 Where Eagles Dare film were shot in the Ebensee area.

In 2006, he authored a resolution to replace the statue of Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian minister who worked to keep California in the Union during the American Civil War, with one of Ronald Reagan in Statuary Hall. One of his reasons was that he had never heard of King, and felt that someone more widely known should represent California. Hollingsworth also believed that the King statue would serve a better educational purpose being placed in the state capital. The bill passed the Senate and Assembly on August 31, 2006. Shortly after midnight on the morning of February 18, 2009, after several days of late-night, contentious debates over closing a $42 billion gap in the state budget, Senate Republicans met in caucus where they voted to replace State Senate Republican Leader Dave Cogdill with Hollingsworth as minority leader. Hollingsworth immediately repudiated a budget deal negotiated by Cogsdill because it included increases in the sales, income and gasoline taxes, saying \\"We should reopen negotiations and we should pass a no-tax budget.\\" The Cogdill-negotiated budget eventually passed regardless. In 2010, Hollingsworth retired from the Senate due to term limits.

Meeting behind the Iron Curtain, the group of scientists and thinkers from a variety of disciplines met in secret. Their goal was to explore whether it might be possible to use the chaos theory to identify a new general theory of evolution that might serve as a path to a better world. = Club of Budapest = In 1993, in response to his experience with the Club of Rome, he founded the Club of Budapest to, in his words, \\"centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course ‚Äî from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability\\". = Akashic field theory = L√°szl√≥'s 2004 book, Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything posits a field of information as the substance of the cosmos.

He posits that the \\"quantum vacuum\\" (see Vacuum state) is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the current universe, but all universes past and present (collectively, the \\"Metaverse\\"). L√°szl√≥ believes that such an informational field can explain why our universe appears to be fine-tuned so as to form galaxies and conscious lifeforms; and why evolution is an informed, not random, process.

Her legend recounts how she was arrested during persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire and refused to make pagan sacrifices even under torture. Saint Faith was tortured to death with a red- hot brazier. Her death is sometimes said to have occurred in the year 287 or 290, sometimes in the large-scale persecution under Diocletian beginning in 303. She is listed as Sainte Foy, \\"Virgin and Martyr\\", in the martyrologies. The center of her veneration was transferred to the Abbey of Sainte-Foy, Conques, where her relics arrived in the ninth century, stolen from Agen by a monk from the Abbey nearby at Conques. Legend A number of legends exist regarding Faith, and she was confused with the three legendary sisters known as Faith, Hope, and Charity. She is recorded in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum under October 6, but the date of her death is not given. A Passio, now lost, once existed, and appears in summarized form in the ninth- century martyrology of Florus of Lyon. Her legends portray her as a patron who could turn against those who only gave small donations to her church at Conques. It is believed that Saint Faith, a young girl from Agen, was martyred at the end of third or beginning of the fourth century, in which she was tortured over a brazier. The first extant reference to the martyrdom of Faith exists in the late sixth-century manuscript copy of the martyrology of Jerome, who died in 420, in which her feast day is listed as 6 October. Faith's martyrdom was later recounted in the Passio in the mid-ninth-century. Accounts Medieval depiction of Faith's martyrdom. Her popular hagiography, Liber miraculorum sancte Fidis, attributed to the churchman Bernard of Angers (composed between ca 1013 and after 1020), calls miracles associated with Faith joca‚ÄîLatin for \\"tricks\\" or \\"jokes\\", the kind that \\"the inhabitants of the place call Sainte Foy's jokes, which is the way peasants understand such things.\\" One such joke was the following story: a local castellan holds onto a ring that his dying wife had promised to the saint. The castellan, whose name is Austrin, uses the ring, however, to wed his second wife. Saint Faith causes the finger of the second wife to swell up in unbearable pain. Austrin and his new wife visit the saint's shrine, and on the third night, \\"when the sorrowful woman happened to blow her nose, the ring flew off without hurting her fingers, just as if it had been hurled from the strongest siege engine, and gave a sharp crack on the pavement at a great distance.\\" She was also known to restore the eyes and eyesight of those who lost them while being faithful to her, often retracting their eyesight when they became arrogant. The Can√ß√≥ de Santa Fe, celebrating Saint Faith in 593 octosyllabic lines, is the earliest known written work in the Catalan language, set down during the reign of Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, between 1054 and 1076 (often dated 1070). It was primarily based on a now lost Latin Passio sanctorum Fidis et Caprisii. Saint Faith's life and martyrdom has been recounted in several other verse narratives and martyrologies. A French verse narrative of Saint Faith, La Vie de Sainte Foy, was written by Simon of Walsingham, a monk at the Bury St Edmunds Abbey based on Latin sources. Veneration During the 12th century, Faith's cult (i.e., devotion and religious practices associated with her) was fused with that of Caprasius of Agen (Caprais) and Alberta of Agen, both associated with Agen Caprasius' cult in turn was also fused with that of Primus and Felician, who are called Caprasius' brothers. Simon of Walsingham's 12th-century verse narrative of Saint Faith's life, La Vie de Sainte Foy, Dacian, Caprais, and Primus and Felician figure heavily. One legend, retold in La Vie de Sainte Foy by Simon of Walsingham in the 12th century, states that during the persecutions of Christians by the prefect Dacian, Caprasius fled to Mont-Saint-Vincent, near Agen. He witnessed the execution of Faith from atop the hill. Caprasius was condemned to death, and was joined on his way to execution by Alberta, Faith's sister (also identified as Caprasius' mother), and two brothers, named Primus and Felician. All four were beheaded. Cult and reliquary Ninth-century reliquary of Saint Faith at Conques. Abbey of Sainte-Foy, Conques. In the fifth century, Dulcitius, bishop of Agen, ordered the construction of a basilica dedicated to her, later restored in the 8th century and enlarged in the 15th. It was demolished in 1892 due to an urban planning effort at Agen. The center of her cult was not the basilica but the abbatial church of Saint Foy at Conques. In the year 866, her remains had been transferred to Conques, which was along the pilgrimage route to Compostela. Her cult, centered at the Abbatiale Sainte-Foy de Conques, spread along the pilgrim routes on the Way of St. James‚Äîand beyond, for her cult became popular in England, Italy, and South America. In 1105, a priory dedicated to Saint Faith was erected in Horsham, a village in Norfolk, by Robert and Sybil Fitzwalter, in which murals of Saint Faith have survived, discovered in 1969 hidden behind a refectory wall. The gilded reliquary at Conques was described in Bernard of Angers's Book of Miracles of Sainte Foi, about 1010. Bernard of Anger's Book of Miracles of Sainte Foy provides an insightful testimony of his reaction towards Sainte Foy as a Medieval cleric and his ambivalent attitude towards reliquaries in general. His change in attitude came when he witnessed an \\"economically charged [miracle]\\" in which another cleric, Odalric, claimed he was beaten by Sainte Foy. Thus, Bernard of Angers believed that Sainte Foy punishes non-believers, and, despite previously attacking the statue, he justified his newfound devotion by stating by claiming that the idol was a \\"vehicle to the saint and not the saint herself.\\" Diebold, W. (2000). Word and Image: An Introduction to Early Medieval Art. Boulder: Westview Press.It has since been repeatedly adapted and enriched, into the nineteenth century. The head itself, made of a different gold from the body‚Äîwhich is fashioned of thin plates over a yew wood‚Äîhas been tentatively identified as an imperial portrait of the Later Roman Empire. Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has alternately theorized that the life-size golden face is a portrait or death mask of Charlemagne. Part of her relics were moved to the monastery of Sant Cugat in Catalonia in 1365. However, the reliquary can be seen in the Abbey at Conques, in France. Important churches were also dedicated to her at Conches-en-Ouche in Normandy and at S√©lestat, in Alsace (see St. Faith's Church, S√©lestat). In culture Several geographical locations have been named after Saint Faith in North America: In the United States, the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, as well as the Santa Fe Springs in Los Angeles, California, take their namesake from Saint Faith.

He continued to find success, hitting .278 with 14 home runs and 34 RBI‚Äôs in just 158 at-bats as a rookie with the major league Red Sox. During his eight-season major league career with Boston, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Texas, Horn hit .240, with a total of 62 home runs, including 23 home runs during the 1991 season as a member of the Baltimore Orioles. After leaving MLB, Horn played for the Taipei Gida in 1997 and 1998. He hit the first home run in the Taiwan Major League and held the record of being the highest paid player in the Taiwan professional baseball history (USD $216,000 for the 1997 season) until surpassed by Chin-Feng Chen in 2006.

New England Sports Network Horn worked for New England Sports Network, providing analysis on Red Sox post-game shows. Horn's catch-phrase was ka-pow, which he exclaims whenever a Sox player hit a home run. The Red Sox fans' message board website called Sons of Sam Horn, which has also been used by Red Sox players (e.g. Curt Schilling) and management (e.g. John Henry), is named after Horn. In July 2007, he declared his candidacy for President of Red Sox Nation.

Background On 5 August 1982, David Martin was caught while breaking into a private cinema in Portman Close, in London's West End; he was disguised as a security guard but he escaped by shooting his way out, severely wounding a police officer. A month later he was arrested at his last known home address in Crawford Place off Edgware Road, while disguised as a woman, but during a struggle drew two handguns before being shot in the neck by an armed police officer. On 24 December 1982 he escaped from a cell at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court, and went into hiding. The police were convinced that a Susan Stephens whom Martin had met before his arrest, and who had visited him in prison, was his girlfriend, so she was kept under surveillance. Police suspicions were reinforced when Martin telephoned Stephens several times, and they met to go to the cinema, and later for a meal, in the following weeks. The shooting On the evening of 14 January 1983, police officers in unmarked cars were following a hired Mini in which Stephens was sitting on the back seat, occasionally looking out of the rear window. The driver was Lester Purdey and the front-seat passenger was freelance film editor Stephen Waldorf, whom the police thought was Martin. When the Mini came to a stop because of rush hour traffic congestion in Pembroke Road, Earls Court, a detective was sent forward to confirm the identity of the front-seat passenger. The only one who knew Martin was Detective Constable Peter Finch, who had been one of the arresting officers when he was detained the previous September, so he approached the car along the pavement on foot with his revolver already drawn. Finch later said that at this point the driver glanced at him through the window, then said something to the passenger, who turned and reached toward the rear seat. Finch opened fire, shooting twice at the passenger-side rear wheel of the Mini, then four times at Waldorf himself. Detective Constable John Jardine then ran up to the back of the Mini, and fired five shots at Waldorf through the rear window. During the shooting, Purdey jumped out of the car to escape, and Waldorf attempted to follow him, even though he had already been hit several times, and ended up slumped across the driver's seat. Detective Constable John Jardine then fired twice at Waldorf through the open driver's door. Finch, meanwhile, had made his way round to the driver's side, where he leaned into the car, aimed his revolver between Waldorf's eyes and said, \\"OK, cocksucker,\\" before pulling the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Finding that he had already used all his ammunition, Finch then pistol whipped Waldorf until he lost consciousness. Hit five times and severely wounded in his head, abdomen, and liver, the handcuffed and unconscious Waldorf was then hauled by his arms onto the pavement. Stephens, screaming and protesting, was also dragged from the vehicle. Stephens was taken to hospital and treated for injury. Aftermath David Martin was rearrested shortly after the shooting. Sue Stephens had continued to be kept under police surveillance and attended a restaurant in Heath Street, Hampstead, north-West London, where she met up with Martin, who had dyed his distinctive blond hair dark. He was challenged by police and ran into Hampstead tube station, ran down the stairs of London's deepest tube station, south along the northbound track where eventually he was arrested at Belsize Park station without incident. He had a shotgun hidden inside his coat, and told the driver of a northbound Northern line train that he was a signal engineer. He was found guilty at Old Bailey of the attempted murder of PC Nicholas Carr and was sentenced to life in prison. He hanged himself in prison in 1984. Detectives Jardine and Finch stood trial for attempted murder and attempted wounding of Waldorf, but were acquitted of all charges in October 1983 after the judge, Mr Justice Croom-Johnson, directed the jury. Waldorf eventually made a full recovery and was paid ¬£150,000 compensation by the Metropolitan Police. Susan Stephens was also awarded ¬£10,000 for malicious wounding. Open Fire, a TV drama about David Martin and the shooting of Stephen Waldorf, was made by London Weekend Television and shown on the ITV network on 12 November 1994.

Coupled chromatography - MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural identity of the individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique can be used to analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied in a wide range of sectors including biotechnology, environment monitoring, food processing, and pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and cosmetic industries. In addition to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source. The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under high vacuum (around 10‚àí6 Torr / 10‚àí7 \\"Hg). Thus, it is not possible to directly pump the eluate from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system. Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric- pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.  History of LC-MS  The coupling of chromatography with MS is a well developed chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. Gas chromatography (GC)‚ÄìMS was originally introduced in 1952, when A. T. James and A. J. P. Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques. In GC, the analytes are eluted from the separation column as a gas and the connection with electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) ion sources in the MS system was a technically simpler challenge. Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s. The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was directly related to the development of proper interfaces. V. L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources. A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of GC-MS and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary was one of the main issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was time consuming and there was an inherent risk of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in LC-MS. = Moving-belt interface = The moving-belt interface (MBI) was developed in 1977. This interface consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied in the analysis of drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988. = Direct liquid introduction interface = The direct liquid introduction (DLI) interface was developed in 1980. This interface was thought as a solution to the evaporation of liquid inside the capillary inlet interface. In DLI, a nebulizer was used to disintegrate part of the effluent coming from the column. A small diaphragm was used to form a liquid jet composed of small droplets that were subsequently dried in a desolvation chamber. A microbore capillary column was used to transfer the nebulized liquid product to the MS ion source. The analytes were ionized using a solvent assisted chemical ionization source, where the LC solvents acted as reagent gases. To use this interface, it was necessary to split the flow coming out of the LC column because only a small portion of the effluent (10 to 50 Œºl/min out of 1 ml/min) could be analyzed on-line without breaking the MS vacuum. One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in horse urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B12. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms. = Thermospray interface = The thermospray (TSP) interface was developed in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces. The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion- molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving reversed phase liquid chromatography (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the analysis of drugs, metabolites, conjugates, nucleosides, peptides, natural products, and pesticides. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for LC-MS systems and was the most widely applied interface until the beginning of the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API). = FAB based interfaces = The frit FAB and continuous flow-FAB (CF- FAB) interfaces were developed in 1985 and 1986 respectively. Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a probe tip. From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform liquid film at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle liquid flow rates of only 1‚Äì15 Œºl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order to be used in FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of electrospray based interfaces in 1988. Liquid chromatography Diagram of an LC-MS system Liquid chromatography is a method of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two immiscible phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC can be divided into five categories, i.e., adsorption chromatography, partition chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a nonpolar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of irregularly or spherically shaped 5 Œºm diameter silica particles. In HPLC, typically 20 Œºl of the sample of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction. The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components of the sample will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns are 100‚Äì300 mm long with outer diameter of 6.4 mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0‚Äì4.6 mm. For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30‚Äì50 mm) with 3‚Äì5 Œºm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrow bore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/min (the conventional flow-rate). In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with smaller silica particles (~1.7 Œºm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi). Mass spectrometry 450x450px Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of charged particles (ions). Although there are many different kinds of mass spectrometers, all of them make use of electric or magnetic fields to manipulate the motion of ions produced from an analyte of interest and determine their m/z. The basic components of a mass spectrometer are the ion source, the mass analyzer, the detector, and the data and vacuum systems. The ion source is where the components of a sample introduced in a MS system are ionized by means of electron beams, photon beams (UV lights), laser beams or corona discharge. In the case of electrospray ionization, the ion source moves ions that exist in liquid solution into the gas phase. The ion source converts and fragments the neutral sample molecules into gas-phase ions that are sent to the mass analyzer. While the mass analyzer applies the electric and magnetic fields to sort the ions by their masses, the detector measures and amplifies the ion current to calculate the abundances of each mass-resolved ion. In order to generate a mass spectrum that a human eye can easily recognize, the data system records, processes, stores, and displays data in a computer. The mass spectrum can be used to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10‚àí2 to 1.33 * 10‚àí6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds like peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadrupole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadrupole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers. Interfaces The interface between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique carried out in a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate the transition from a high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer. = Electrospray ionization (ESI) = ESI interface for LC-MS systems was developed by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface can be used for the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized at the tip of the capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1‚Äì3 mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 Œºl/min range. = Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) = The development of the APCI interface for LC-MS started with Horning and collaborators in the early 1973. However, its commercial application was introduced at the beginning of the 1990s after Henion and collaborators improved the LC-APCI-MS interface in 1986. The APCI ion source/ interface can be used to analyze small, neutral, relatively non-polar, and thermally stable molecules (e.g., steroids, lipids, and fat soluble vitamins). These compounds are not well ionized using ESI. In addition, APCI can also handle mobile phase streams containing buffering agents. The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also nebulization at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high vacuum region, the ions are subject to mass analysis. This interface can be operated in positive and negative charge modes and singly-charged ions are mainly produced. APCI ion source can also handle flow rates between 500 and 2000 Œºl/min and it can be directly connected to conventional 4.6 mm ID columns. = Atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI) = The APPI interface for LC-MS was developed simultaneously by Bruins and Syage in 2000. APPI is another LC-MS ion source/ interface for the analysis of neutral compounds that cannot be ionized using ESI. This interface is similar to the APCI ion source, but instead of a corona discharge, the ionization occurs by using photons coming from a discharge lamp. In the direct-APPI mode, singly charged analyte molecular ions are formed by absorption of a photon and ejection of an electron. In the dopant- APPI mode, an easily ionizable compound (Dopant) is added to the mobile phase or the nebulizing gas to promote a reaction of charge-exchange between the dopant molecular ion and the analyte. The ionized sample is later transferred to the mass analyzer at high vacuum as it passes through small orifice skimmers. Applications The coupling of MS with LC systems is attractive because liquid chromatography can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition needs to be well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Further, LC-MS has applications in volatile explosive residue analysis. Nowadays, LC-MS has become one of the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC- MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for proteomics and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols. =Pharmacokinetics= LC-MS is widely used in the field of bioanalysis and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression in LC-MS, the LC separation can be quite quick. = Proteomics/metabolomics = LC-MS is used in proteomics as a method to detect and identify the components of a complex mixture. The bottom-up proteomics LC-MS approach generally involves protease digestion and denaturation using trypsin as a protease, urea to denature the tertiary structure, and iodoacetamide to modify the cysteine residues. After digestion, LC-MS is used for peptide mass fingerprinting, or LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) is used to derive the sequences of individual peptides. LC-MS/MS is most commonly used for proteomic analysis of complex samples where peptide masses may overlap even with a high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples of complex biological (e.g., human serum) may be analyzed in modern LC-MS/MS systems, which can identify over 1000 proteins. However, this high level of protein identification is possible only after separating the sample by means of SDS-PAGE gel or HPLC-SCX.. Recently, LC-MS/MS has been applied to search peptide biomarkers. An example is the recent discovery and validation of peptide biomarkers for four major bacterial respiratory tract pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis; Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). LC-MS has emerged as one of the most commonly used techniques in global metabolite profiling of biological tissue (e.g., blood plasma, serum, urine). LC-MS is also used for the analysis of natural products and the profiling of secondary metabolites in plants. In this regard, MS-based systems are useful to acquire more detailed information about the wide spectrum of compounds from a complex biological samples. LC-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is also used in plant metabolomics, but this technique can only detect and quantify the most abundant metabolites. LC-MS has been useful to advance the field of plant metabolomics, which aims to study the plant system at molecular level providing a non-biased characterization of the plant metabolome in response to its environment. The first application of LC-MS in plant metabolomics was the detection of a wide range of highly polar metabolites, oligosaccharides, amino acids, amino sugars, and sugar nucleotides from Cucurbita maxima phloem tissues. Another example of LC-MS in plant metabolomics is the efficient separation and identification of glucose, sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose from leaf extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana. =Drug development= LC-MS is frequently used in drug development because it allows quick molecular weight confirmation and structure identification. These features speed up the process of generating, testing, and validating a discovery starting from a vast array of products with potential application. LC-MS applications for drug development are highly automated methods used for peptide mapping, glycoprotein mapping, lipodomics, natural products dereplication, bioaffinity screening, in vivo drug screening, metabolic stability screening, metabolite identification, impurity identification, quantitative bioanalysis, and quality control.

The port and district are named after the green peafowl, which once lived in the region, but now only lives in the nearby Ujung Kulon National Park. The port is connected to Jakarta via the Jakarta-Merak Toll Road and is also connected to the Bakauheni port which is located at the south of the Trans-Sumatran Highway.  History  In 1883, the original settlement was completely destroyed by a series of tsunamis generated by the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait. The largest wave at Merak was estimated to be at least 41 m (135 ft) high. Approximately 2,700 people lost their lives, including virtually all of the town's inhabitants at that time.Simon Winchester, 2003, Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883, p.250  Features  A large thermal electric power plant is located close to Merak where coal barges handle large quantities of coal. A new LPG jetty handles liquid gases for distribution in Banten province, tankage has been built at Merak. The town of Cilegon is about 15‚Äì20 km from Merak port. There is heavy truck traffic on the road from Cilegon to Merak so the road is often in poor condition. In downtown Cilegon there is a hypermart mall and some shanty shops. Karaoke bars for sailors are not hard to find.  Port operations  The port is a key transport link between Java and Sumatra and is a major service provider for the heavy passenger and commercial ferry traffic from Merak to Bakauheni across the Sunda Strait on the southern tip of Sumatra. Ferry services are operated by PT Angkutan Sungai dan Penyeberangan (ASDP). Growth in demand for ferry services has been rapid in recent years. The facilities at the port are now very badly overstretched.'As Ramadan Nears, Merak Port Worries Grow', The Jakarta Globe, 20 June 2012. The ageing ferry fleet and poor supporting infrastructure are major restrictions on the port's efficiency. Long delays for passengers, buses and trucks waiting to board the ferries are common, especially at peak times of the year such as holiday periods when daily demand rises to over 2,000 cars and up to 500 buses per day.Oyos Saroso H.N., 'Ports paralysed as traffic at Bakauheni, Merak worsens', The Jakarta Post, 7 July 2012. 'Sumatra-Bound Trucks Stuck Again at Merak Port', The Jakarta Globe, 19 March 2011. It is not unusual for trucks to bank up for 10 kilometers or more from the port on the Jakarta-Merak Toll Road and be held up in queues for two or three days. It is partly because of problems of this kind that consideration is being given to the very ambitious Sunda Strait Bridge project. Merak port also provides services for Indonesia's largest concentration of petrochemical facilities located nearby along the Merak peninsula. More than 40 petrochemical plants operate near the seaport, an increase from two in 1990. In 2007 Shell Oil announced plans to expand its Merak port operations with the construction of a $US52 million oil storage tank.

The competitions were held from 10 to 14 August 1932. Due to the Great Depression, and the fact that the Games were held in Los Angeles (which was considerably difficult for the European nations to travel to), only 31 entries from 6 nations competed‚Äîwhich was to be the lowest participation of any Olympic Games. Disciplines =Jumping= The jumping competition had 11 riders from 4 nations. While individual medals were awarded, none of the teams managed to have three riders finish the course so team medals were not awarded. The 18-obstacle, 20-effort course was 1,060 meters in length, and included two fences at 1.60 meters, a very difficult wall, and a water that was 5 meters in width. 100,000 spectators were present at the show jumping competition. =Dressage= The dressage had 10 riders from 4 nations, and was held on the Riviera Country Club's polo field. 25,000 spectators watched the 16-minute tests, which now for the first time included piaffe and passage. A controversy arose after Swedish rider Bertil Sandstr√∂m was accused of clucking to his horse, which was not allowed under FEI rules. Sandstr√∂m claimed it was simply his new saddle squeaking. After being reviewed by the Appeals Committee consisting of FEI President Guy Henry, FEI Vice President Clarence von Rosen of Sweden, and FEI Secretary General Georges Hector of France, the decision was made to place Sandstr√∂m, who was in silver position, last individually but to allow his score to count for his team. This resulted in a French rider moving into individual silver position and an American moving into bronze. =Eventing= 14 riders competed with only 3 teams starting: the United States, The Netherlands, and Sweden. Sweden's Arne Francke was eliminated cross-country, so only team gold (United States) and silver (The Netherlands) were awarded. Pahud de Mortanges won his second consecutive individual gold medal, while individual silver went to Earl Foster Thomson on Jenny Camp who was to repeat that performance at the 1936 Olympic Games. The bronze winner in the eventing competition, Clarence von Rosen junior, also won bronze in the Jumping competition.

The Apollo Lunar Module, designed to land a crew of two humans and return them to orbit, made six successful landings and takeoffs from 1969 to 1972. The design requirements for these landers depend on factors imposed by the payload characteristics and purpose, flight rate, propulsive requirements, and configuration constraints.Lunar Lander Stage Requirements Based on the Civil Needs Data Base (PDF). John A. Mulqueen. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. 1993. Other important design factors include overall energy requirements, mission duration, the type of mission operations on the lunar surface, and life support system if crewed. The relatively high gravity and lack of lunar atmosphere negates the use of aerobraking, so a lander must use propulsion to decelerate and achieve a soft landing. Several studies indicate the potential for both scientific and technological benefits from sustained lunar surface exploration that would culminate in the utilization of lunar resources, or in the development of the necessary technology to land payloads on other planets in the Solar System.Lunar Lander Configurations Incorporating Accessibility, Mobility, and Centaur Cryogenic Propulsion Experience (PDF).

History The Luna program was a series of robotic impactors, flybys, orbiters, and landers flown by the Soviet Union between 1958 and 1976. Luna 9 was the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on the Moon on February 3, 1966, after 11 unsuccessful attempts. Three Lunas returned lunar soil samples to Earth from 1972 to 1976. Two Lunas soft-landed the Lunokhod robotic lunar rover in 1970 and 1973. Luna achieved a total of 7 successful soft landings, out of 27 attempts. The United States Surveyor Program first soft-landed Surveyor 1 on June 2, 1966, and successfully soft-landed four more, in a total of seven attempts through January 10, 1968. The Apollo Lunar Module was used for the 1969‚Äì1972 human spaceflight program of the United States. The LK Lander was designed for the human spaceflight program of the Soviet Union, but never used in space.

The Moon has relatively high gravity compared to that of asteroids or comets‚Äîand some other planetary satellites‚Äîand no significant atmosphere. Practically, this means that the only method of descent and landing that can provide sufficient thrust with current technology is based on chemical rockets. In addition, the Moon has a long solar day. Landers will be in direct sunlight for more than two weeks at a time, and then in complete darkness for another two weeks. This causes significant problems for thermal control. =Lack of atmosphere= space probes have landed on all three bodies other than Earth that have solid surfaces and atmospheres thick enough to make aerobraking possible: Mars, Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. These probes were able to leverage the atmospheres of the bodies on which they landed to slow their descent using parachutes, reducing the amount of fuel they were required to carry. This in turn allowed larger payloads to be landed on these bodies for a given amount of fuel. For example, the 900-kg Curiosity rover was landed on Mars by a craft having a mass (at the time of Mars atmospheric entry) of 2400 kg, of which only 390 kg was fuel. In comparison, the much lighter (292 kg) Surveyor 3 landed on the Moon in 1967 using nearly 700 kg of fuel. The lack of an atmosphere, however, removes the need for a Moon lander to have a heat shield and also allows aerodynamics to be disregarded when designing the craft. =High gravity= Although it has much less gravity than Earth, the Moon has sufficiently high gravity that descent must be slowed considerably. This is in contrast to an asteroid, in which \\"landing\\" is more often called \\"docking\\" and is a matter of rendezvous and matching velocity more than slowing a rapid descent. Since rocketry is used for descent and landing, the Moon's gravity necessitates the use of more fuel than is needed for asteroid landing. Indeed, one of the central design constraints for the Apollo program's Moon landing was mass (as more mass requires more fuel to land) required to land and take off from the Moon. =Thermal environment= The lunar thermal environment is influenced by the length of the lunar day. Temperatures can swing between 25K (during the lunar night) to 390K (during the lunar day). These extremes occur for fourteen Earth days each, so thermal control systems must be designed to handle long periods of extreme cold or heat. In contrast, most spacecraft instruments must be kept within a much stricter range of between 233K and 323K. This means that the lander must cool and heat its instruments. The length of the lunar night makes it difficult to use solar electric power to heat the instruments, and nuclear heaters are often used. Landing stages Achieving a soft-landing is the overarching goal of any lunar lander, and distinguishes landers from impactors, which were the first type of spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon. All lunar landers require rocket engines for descent. Orbital speed around the Moon can, depending on altitude, exceed 1500 m/s. Spacecraft on impact trajectories can have speeds well in excess of that. In the vacuum the only way to slow down from that speed is to use a rocket engine. The stages of landing can include: # Descent orbit insertion ‚Äì the spacecraft enters an orbit favorable for final descent. This stage was not present in the early landing efforts, which did not begin with lunar orbit. Such missions began on a lunar impact trajectory instead. # Descent and braking ‚Äì the spacecraft fires its engines until it is no longer in orbit. If the engines were to stop firing entirely at this stage the spacecraft would eventually impact the surface. During this stage, the spacecraft uses its rocket engine to reduce overall speed # Final approach ‚Äì The spacecraft is nearly at the landing site, and final adjustments for the exact location of touchdown can be made # Touchdown ‚Äì the spacecraft achieves soft landing on the Moon =Touchdown= Lunar landings typically end with the engine shutting down when the lander is several feet above the lunar surface. The idea is that engine exhaust and lunar regolith can cause problems if they were to be kicked back from the surface to the spacecraft, and thus the engines cut off just before touchdown. Engineers must ensure that the vehicle is protected enough to ensure that the fall without thrust does not cause damage. The first soft lunar landing, performed by the Soviet Luna 9 probe, was achieved by first slowing the spacecraft to a suitable speed and altitude, then ejecting a payload containing the scientific experiments. The payload was stopped on the lunar surface using airbags, which provided cushioning as it fell. Luna 13 used a similar method. Airbag methods are not typical. For example, NASA's Surveyor 1 probe, launched around the same time as Luna 9, did not use an airbag for final touchdown. Instead, after it arrested its velocity at an altitude of 3.4m it simply fell to the lunar surface. To accommodate the fall the spacecraft was equipped with crushable components that would soften the blow and keep the payload safe. More recently, the Chinese Chang'e 3 lander used a similar technique, falling 4m after its engine shut down. Perhaps the most famous lunar landers, those of the Apollo Program, were robust enough to handle the drop once their contact probes detected that landing was imminent. Apollo 11's lunar lander, for example, contacted the surface with its probe at 1.6m above the lunar surface, at which point the engine was shut down and the spacecraft fell the remaining distance.

It is a Muslim organization in Canada that stands for \\"separation of religion and state in all matters of public policy.\\" The group gained prominence by opposing the implementation of Shariah law in civil law in Ontario and supporting the country's same-sex marriage legislation. The group also promotes gender equality and was involved in organizing a Muslim prayer session in which the prayers were led by a woman, Raheel Raza. It has also been critical of Islamic fundamentalism and has urged the government to ban donations to Canadian religious institutions from abroad arguing that doing so will curb extremism. Split The Congress suffered a serious split in the summer of 2006 when several of its members and leaders left to form the Canadian Muslim Union. According to reports, the split occurred over questions of how the group engages with the broader Muslim community. The issue came to head over the MCC's position on the arrest of 17 Muslims in the 2006 Toronto terrorism case and objections by some MCC leaders to the MCC's participation in anti-war demonstrations during the 2006 Israel- Lebanon War where flags of Hezbollah and Hamas were raised along with posters of Iranian leader Ahmedinejad and Hezbollah leader Nasrallah. The entire executive and most of the board members eventually resigned. The CMU was formed the next day. CMU's philosophy of Liberal Islam is similar to the MCC's but with what they claim is their intention to work \\"within the Muslim community\\".Sonya Fatah, Moderate Muslim group splinters -Terror arrests and war in Lebanon prove divisive for MCC crippled by internal strife, Globe and Mail, August 25, 2006 CMU has been dormant since 2011. The slate of its officers is not available online. Despite this split, MCC continued its work of promoting secularism, and its members and directors continue to face opposition from those following political Islam. Some of its members have also received serious threats from unknown individuals. Tarek Fatah was its communications director and spokesperson until he resigned from the board in August 2006 and Farzana Hassan was the MCC's president from August 2006 until April 2010. Munir Pervaiz assumed the position of President in 2015. Farzana Hassan and others continued to be its director with Fatah recognized as the founder of the MCC enjoying the full support of its directors. Stances In 2006, the Muslim Canadian Congress supported the campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel. The Congress also compared Israeli policies to South African apartheid. In 2007, the MCC came out against a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint made by several youths associated with the Canadian Islamic Congress against Maclean's Magazine for publishing an allegedly Islamophobic column by Mark Steyn saying that \\"The reaction of the CIC has only given credence to his premise - that Muslims in the West cannot accept the values of individual freedom, a free press and the right to offend... How ironic and how unfortunate. For Steyn's thesis could as easily have been disproved by the traditional means of rational debate.\\"Jennifer Ditchburn, \\"Tory minister slams Islamic Congress complaint against journalist\\", Canadian Press, December 12, 2007 Earlier that year, the MCC came out against a proposal by John Tory and the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party to publicly fund faith-based schools accusing the Tories of \\"pandering to clerics\\".\\"MCC dismisses John Tory's new flip-flop: \\"Pandering to clerics will not work\\", Canada NewsWire, October 1, 2007 The MCC has also been outspoken on the issue of women wearing the Niqaab saying \\"It is not a requirement of Islam that Muslim women stay covered completely\\"\\"Elections chief firm on veil ruling\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, September 14, 2007 and that women should be assured that not wearing the hijab is not a sin.Tarek Fatah, \\"It's no sin to shun the hijab\\", Globe and Mail, December 17, 2007 In October 2009, the MCC called for a ban on burka and niqab (though not the hijab), saying that they have \\"no basis in Islam.\\" Spokesperson Farzana Hassan cited public safety issues, such as identity concealment, as well as gender equality, stating that wearing the burka and niqab is \\"a practice that marginalizes women.\\" In April 2008, the MCC criticized the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) for its stating a claim by the Canadian Islamic Congress that Maclean's magazine was publishing Islamophobic articles. The MCC stated that \\"the OHRC has become the virtual organ of Canada‚Äôs Islamist organizations and that it has taken sides in the bitter struggle within Canada‚Äôs Muslim community where sharia-supporting Islamists are pitted against liberal and secular Muslims\\" and that \\"the OHRC decision had the finger prints of its pro-Islamist commissioners who have close association with the Canadian Islamic Congress. It is not just the commissioners, but we have reason to believe that there are staff on the OHRC that support sharia law and endorse the CIC‚Äôs positions.\\" It has also joined International Coalition Against Blasphemy Laws. MCC officers profess serious reformation in Islam. MCC also supports Canada's secular democracy, and continues to be the major Muslim voice against political Islam in Canada.

In 1953, while occupying that position, he was elected, at the age of 42, WHO's second Director-General. As Director- General, Candau was influenced by his previous work in Brazil's malaria control program. He presented the case for global malaria eradication at the World Health Assembly meeting in Mexico City in May 1955. In 1958, 1963 and 1968, Dr Candau was re-elected for his successive terms in that office, which he held until 1973. In 1963 Candau received an honorary Sc.D. from Bates College.

The magazine was called \\"MacTech\\" for its first two issues, starting in 1984, after which its name was changed to MacTutor. At the time the magazine defined itself as \\"a technical publication devoted to advancing programming knowledge of the Macintosh for both hacker and professional alike\\". In the spring of 1989 a new and separate magazine called MacTech was launched by TechAlliance, a global Apple users group headquartered in Renton, WA that hosted the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA). The founding editor of MacTech was Andrew Himes, and Himes described the magazine as \\"The journal designed by people who program and develop for the Apple Macintosh. You hold in your hands what is designed to be a legendary publication for a legendary computer. In these wee, early hours of the computer revolution, just a scant half decade after the introduction of Apple's flagship computer, the world needs a magazine that focuses on the needs of the Mac developer community with the intensity, vision, and utility of no other existing publication. Nuts-and- bolts programming solutions and tutorials. In-depth looks at future technologies and present opportunities. An emphasis on both object-oriented and proceduarl languages, on database programming and spreadsheet macros, on HyperTalking and multimedia applications. Feature articles, tutorials, reviews, and commentary by some of the most important, creative, and eloquent programmers in the Macintosh universe. MacTech will be preeminently useful and intellectually provocative. An essential desktop reference for today's serious programmers, as well as a tool that will help pave your way to the future of programming.\\" In 1993, MacTutor Magazine purchased MacTech, and the name of the consolidated publication became MacTech. In 2010, MacTech launched its event series -- first with MacTech Conference, then MacTech Boot Camp and then MacTech InDepth. 2010 had a single event, 2011 had seven events, and 2012 has fifteen events. MacTech.com also provides a news aggregator service. The magazine is privately owned, held by Xplain Corporation. On June 5, 2008, MacTech announced it would act as caretaker to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums. At these forums, Stan's Lounge is crowded with MacMinute and MacCentral faithful in honor of Stan Flack's contributions to the Macintosh community. On November 6, 2009, MacTech announced that it was acquiring MacMod, a community site dedicated to modding Apple hardware and software.

The novel tells the story of the end of the universe and the saving of mankind from its destruction. Two parallel plots are followed throughout the novel: that of Lieserl, an AI exploring the interior of the sun, and that of the Great Northern, a generation ship on a five-million-year journey.  Plot summary  The AI Lieserl is abandoned for five million years, leaving her to observe the sun's interior. She discovers dark matter-based life, which she names \\"photino birds\\". These birds gradually drain the energy from the core of a star, ending fusion and causing premature aging into a stable red giant‚Äîthe birds' preferred habitat, as it has no risk of going supernova and destroying them. A generation ship is sent with one end of a wormhole to explore the future and investigate the whereabouts of Michael Poole. It will be a round- trip journey, returning to the solar system after five million years, though only a thousand years will elapse on board, due to relativistic time dilation effects. The crew is broken into three factions‚Äîthe primitives, the virtuals, and a survivalist faction, Superet. Among the factions, the primitives are a eugenics project for Garry Uvarov who hopes to lengthen the lives of humanity without the use of Anti-Senescence (anagathic or life-extension) technology. The Superet faction relies heavily on failing technology and maintains a totalitarian government which refuses to acknowledge the existence of other decks on the ship; the virtuals remain aloof. Upon their arrival, their end of the wormhole is destroyed leaving them trapped in the future. They observe that the entire universe is full of red stars, so the stars have aged far faster than expected. The Great Northern makes contact with Lieserl, who explains her observations of the photino birds. The birds do not just exist in our sun but every sun, helioforming them to an amenable habitat. The Xeelee, masters of baryonic matter, have known about the photino birds and have been striving to thwart them. The baryonic universe is doomed, but the Xeelee create a 'Ring', an escape hatch. A cosmic string is made into a loop and creates the phenomenon of the Great Attractor. The function of the Ring is to create a Kerr metric at its centre, which creates a portal to other universes. Whenever humans have met up with the Xeelee and pursued war, this was merely an annoyance since the Xeelee were thinking on a larger scale about more potent enemies. The crew of the Great Northern and Lieserl discover the folly of their species. A Xeelee nightfighter is discovered in Callisto, a reference to the later story \\"Reality Dust\\", and it is rigged to piggyback the Great Northern to the Great Attractor. Fifty days later, they discover that the Xeelees' project has been destroyed, but a recently awakened virtual of Michael Poole shows Spinner-of-Rope, a primitive, how to pilot around the fragmented cosmic strings and travel into the past, using a closed time-like path. These last humans return to the Ring, in an era in which it was not destroyed; the Xeelee allow them through, and they briefly attempt to pick universes and find sanctuary in another younger universe, after passing through the Ring, and get to work on starting a new world. Michael Poole remains in our universe and witnesses the deaths of the last stars, and the decay of the last protons‚Äîthe final victory of the dark matter lifeforms over the baryonic Xeelee and lesser races. Eventually, his consciousness disperses, and history ends.

He served three terms as director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) from 1973 to 1988, and is widely known for his effort to combat tuberculosis and his role in having shaped the landmark Alma Ata Declaration that defined the Health for All by the Year 2000 strategy.Forst√• hvordan befolkningen t√¶nker. Portr√¶t / interview: Halfdan Mahler Dagens Medicin, 26 October 2000, 1. sektion, Side 17  Biography  Mahler was born in Vivild, Denmark, in 1923, the last of seven children. Eschewing a career as a preacher, Mahler studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen (1948). Building on his postgraduate work in public health, his first international activities were in tuberculosis and community work in under-developed countries. He directed a Red Cross antituberculosis campaign in Ecuador between 1950 and 1951.Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1864-1874. In 1951, Mahler joined the World Health Organization (WHO) and spent almost ten years in India as Senior WHO Officer attached to the National Tuberculosis Programme. From 1962, he was Chief of the Tuberculosis Unit at the WHO Headquarters in Geneva until 1969, when he was appointed Director, Project Systems Analysis. From the late 1960s, under Mahler's lead, the WHO projects related to the development of \\"basic health services\\" were increased; these projects were the institutional predecessors of the primary health care programs that would later appear. In 1970, he was made Assistant Director-General of WHO while retaining the direction of Project Systems Analysis. Mahler was elected WHO's third Director-General in 1973. In the same year, the Executive Board of WHO issued the report \\"Organizational Study on Methods of Promoting the Development of Basic Health Services\\". Mahler established a close rapport with Henry Labouisse. The agreement produced in 1975 a joint WHO‚ÄìUNICEF report, Alternative Approaches to Meeting Basic Health Needs in Developing Countries, which examined successful primary health care in various countries. This report also criticized the idea of vertical approach methods of focusing on specific diseases as well as adding Western approaches to developing countries. The result of this report led WHO to re-construct their approaches to Primary Health Care, which led to a worldwide debate. Mahler delivered a speech at the 1976 World Health assembly describing weakening social structures and launching his Health for all by 2000 goal. He was re-elected for two successive five-year terms in 1978 and 1983. Under Mahler, in 1979, the Thirty-second World Health Assembly launched the Global Strategy for Health for All by the Year 2000. Mahler's \\"Health for All by the Year 2000\\" was criticized for being too broad and idealistic, and with the changing political climate of the 1980s health care began to move towards more selective and cost-efficient approaches. Mahler was left to champion a more holistic and inclusive approach to health care on his own and with his departure as the Director-General, the WHO lost its political profile. During the 1980s AIDS epidemic, he acknowledged that WHO were slow to respond to the spread of the disease. After leaving WHO, Mahler became director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. He left the role in 1995. Mahler died in Geneva on 14 December 2016 at the age of 93.

The film is a tribute to the life and music of jazz saxophonist Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker. It is constructed as a montage of scenes from Parker's life, from his childhood in Kansas City, through his early death at the age of 34. The film moves back and forth through Parker's history, blending moments to find some truth to his life. Much of the movie revolves around his only grounding relationships with wife Chan Parker, Bebop pioneer trumpet player and band leader Dizzy Gillespie, and his influence (both musically and into the world of heroin addiction) on trumpet player Red Rodney. Plot In 1939 Kansas City, Missouri, young alto saxophone player Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker (Forest Whitaker) performs at the Reno Club. However, his rapid and sporadic playing gets him jeered offstage. Moving to New York City, Charlie begins performing at different jazz venues on 52nd Street and meets trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie (Samuel E. Wright). While Charlie performs with Dizzy, their specific style of jazz develops a following and is known as \\"bebop.\\" One evening, Charlie meets Chan Parker (Diane Venora), a dancer and jazz lover. Attracted to Chan, Charlie continually asks her out, but she refuses his advances and moves to Chicago, Illinois. Later, Chan returns from Chicago and confesses she is pregnant with another man‚Äôs child. Upset, Charlie leaves for Los Angeles, California, to perform with Dizzy. One evening, Red Rodney (Michael Zelniker), a Jewish trumpet player, approaches Charlie and tells him he is a fan. Later, Charlie and Dizzy‚Äôs engagement is cancelled due to a lack of interest in bebop. Charlie stays in Los Angeles, but his addiction to drugs and alcohol worsen, and he is hospitalized for eight months. After Charlie gets clean and is released, Chan obtains a booking at a New York club for him. When he thanks Chan for her help, she introduces him to her daughter, Kim. Later, Charlie learns that his friend, Brewster, is opening a new club and naming it Birdland after Charlie. In need of work and money, Charlie travels to Paris, France, and finds an audience for jazz and bebop. However, he returns to New York and performs at Birdland. Charlie later meets with Red and, while waiting for Birdland to open, offers a job touring with him in the South. Although Red is hesitant about how an interracial band might be received, Charlie assures him no harm will come to them. Arriving at their first engagement, Red sees Charlie has advertised him as being a blues singer named \\"Albino Red.\\" During the tour, Charlie learns that Red is addicted to heroin and threatens him to stop using drugs. Returning to New York, Charlie and Red perform together for Birdland‚Äôs grand opening. Afterward, authorities pick up Red for drug possession. Charlie continues to perform at Birdland and other New York clubs. Chan and Kim move in with Charlie, and he and Chan have two children of their own: son Baird, and daughter Pree. Some time later, Charlie is arrested for drug possession and put on probation. He loses his cabaret card, leaving him unable to perform in New York, and moves to Los Angeles in order to find work. He reconnects with Dizzy, who sees that he is using drugs again. Charlie later learns that Pree has died from an illness and returns home for her funeral. Depressed by Pree‚Äôs death and his faltering career, Charlie tries to kill himself by drinking iodine, but survives. After Chan has him committed to a hospital psychiatric ward, she is advised to send Charlie to a state facility for shock treatments. She worries that such treatments might rob him of his creative abilities. After Charlie is released, Chan convinces him to move their family to upstate New York. Charlie later returns to the city for an audition set up by Brewster, but becomes distracted seeing all the former jazz clubs on 52nd Street have been turned into strip clubs. Missing the audition and embarrassed to tell Chan, Charlie goes to the apartment of Baroness Nica (Diane Salinger), a wealthy jazz music patron, and soon passes out. A doctor arrives and advises Charlie to go to the hospital, but he refuses. Later as he watches television with the Baroness, Charlie suffers a heart attack and dies at the age of 34.

There was a delay of a few years while the trade was completed, and by then Pryor had lost interest. The film was eventually shot in 52 days for $14.4 million, not counting Eastwood's fee, although in interviews Eastwood sometimes said the film only cost $9 million to make. Locations used for filming include the Sacramento Valley, Los Angeles, and Pasadena, California as well as New York City. Reception Clint Eastwood with actors Michael Zelniker and Forest Whitaker, and then-partner Sondra Locke, promoting the film at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. Bird received a positive reception from critics, scoring an 83% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 23 reviews. Whitaker's performance as Parker earned positive notices and honours including the Best Actor award at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe nomination. Eastwood was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Director. The film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association and the Academy Award for Best Sound (Les Fresholtz, Dick Alexander, Vern Poore, Willie Burton). The film opened in one theater in New York City and grossed $27,116 in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $2.2 million in the United States and Canada. \\"Clint Eastwood is a fabulous actor as well as a fabulous filmmaker,\\" observed Rolling Stones drummer and jazz aficionado Charlie Watts. \\"When he made 52nd Street move in Bird, it was one of the most exciting things I'd ever seen. He took the shot from a black-and-white still and then suddenly it all became colour and it moved! I'd have loved to have been there in the '40s.\\" Music Initially, when Columbia owned the project, the studio executives wanted to hire musicians to re-record all of Parker's music, largely because the original recordings were in mono, and were not of acceptable sound quality to accompany a feature film. Eastwood had some recordings of Parker made by Parker's wife, Chan, from which he had a sound engineer electronically isolate Parker's solos. Musicians, such as Ray Brown, Walter Davis, Jr., Ron Carter, Barry Harris, and Red Rodney, were then hired to record backing tracks on modern equipment. Dizzy Gillespie was on tour at the time of recording, so trumpet player Jon Faddis was hired to record his parts.

Career Salmon opened a veterinary practice in Newark, New Jersey in 1872, and subsequently moved to Asheville, North Carolina in 1875. In 1877, he gave a series of lectures at the University of Georgia on the topic of veterinary science. He worked for the State of New York, studying diseases in swine and for the United States Department of Agriculture studying animal diseases in the southern states. In 1883, he was asked to establish a veterinary division within the Department of Agriculture. This became the Bureau of Animal Industry, and he served as its chief from 1884 to December 1, 1905. Under his leadership, the Bureau eradicated contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in the United States, studied and controlled Texas fever (Babesia), put in place the federal meat inspection program, began inspecting exported livestock and the ships carrying them, began inspecting and quarantining imported livestock, and studied the effect of animal diseases on public health. In 1906 he established the veterinary department at the University of Montevideo, Uruguay and was its head for five years. He returned to the United States in 1911 and concentrated on veterinary work in the western region of the country. Salmonella a genus of microorganisms, was named after him in 1900 by Joseph Leon Ligni√®res, although the man who actually discovered and named the first strain, Salmonella choleraesuis, was Theobald Smith, Salmon's research assistant. Smith had isolated the bacterium in 1885. Since that time, more than 2,500 subtypes have been identified. Death Salmon died of pneumonia on August 30, 1914, in Butte, Montana at the age of 64.

Its population of 7,280 makes it the eighth largest town in Kildare and the 66th largest in Ireland. It is on the River Liffey. Clane gives its name to the associated townland, civil parish, electoral division and barony.Details of the Clane Townland, Civil Parish, Barony and Electoral Division History Clane is located on the crossroads of the R403 and R407 regional roads. The town most probably owes its origin to the foundation of Clane Friary in the sixth century, from about 520 A.D., when Ailbe of Emly, Bishop of Ferns, founded an Abbey in Clane and made St. Senchel the Elder its first Abbot. Saint Ultan Tua, who used to put a stone into his mouth to prevent him from speaking during Lent, and his brother Fotharnaise, are said to have been buried in Clane. They were brothers of Maighend, Abbot of Kilmainham, from whom the parish and church of Mainham, near Clane, were probably called. King Mesgegra's Mound claims links to the legendary first-century AD king Mesgegra of Leinster and was later used by Normans. The ruins of the Franciscan monastery founded at Clane by Sir Gerald FitzMaurice, 3rd Lord Ophaly, in 1272 still exist. In 1542, Henry VIII‚Äôs Commissioner granted the site and precincts of this House of Friars, manor or preaching-house of the preaching Friars of Clane to Robert Eustace, Roger Roche and Ed. Brown for ¬£177. Besides about of land in the neighbourhood - its possessions consisted of a church, cemetery, chapter-house, dormitory, store, kitchen, two chambers, stable and orchard. The dormitory and other buildings probably stood on the north side of the Abbey Church, and have long since completely disappeared. The parish of Clane has the distinction of being the place where the rebellion of 1798 broke out; a battle between the United Irishmen and the Yeomen forces led by Richard Griffith took place on Coiseanna Hill by the modern Woods Centre. The rebels were easily defeated, and the survivors fled to Timahoe with the rest of the North Kildare rebels. Features and amenities Clane has two Liffey tributaries, the Butter Stream at the south west, with a small park, and the Gollymochy River at the eastern side. Sections of The Pale remain as ditches and hedgerows in private fields to the north of Clane. Clane Friary and Abbey Cemetery lie to the south of the village. The Abbey, on Main Street, was formerly a church, then a ruin, and has since been restored into a community centre and garden of remembrance. The Wogan Mausoleum and churchyard lies at Mainham. The Liffeyside Nature Park is a small wilderness area leading to a paved path by the River Liffey. Clane General Hospital is a private hospital, founded in 1985, offering surgical and outpatient procedures, including a fertility clinic. Demographics Clane is something of a commuter town for Dublin, which lies to the east. As of the 2016 census, Clane had a population of 7,280 people, an increase from 6,702 in the 2011 census. According to the 2011 census, 2,565 people then spoke Irish in Clane (with 880 people speaking it daily). 984 people speak a language other than English or Irish, with Polish the most common foreign language (with 336 speakers).

He is author of the popular underground novel Unintended Consequences, and writes a regular column on the Internet. He was a Democratic candidate for US Congress in 1998 in Missouri's 2nd congressional district.Missouri Digital News. 1998 Election Results. Unintended Consequences Unintended Consequences is a controversial novel that mixes real events with fiction. These events portray a continuing oppression of the American gun culture that, the author believes, has occurred since the passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, which made it a federal offense to possess a machine gun, short- barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, or silencer without first paying a $200 fee to the United States Treasury. The cover of the book shows a woman dressed as Lady Justice being menaced by a heavily armed agent of the ATF; it contains several scenes of graphic sex and violence. The book has been repeatedly confiscated in Canada by customs officials. The publisher no longer ships copies of the book to Canada as a result. Its thesis, as discussed in the Author's Note - A Warning and Disclaimer, is that hostile bullying by a government will cause a revolt, and the revolt will be successful if the area involved is large enough, the area has a sufficiently distinct culture, and the rebels use low-tech leaderless resistance. Lacking any advertising or promotion in the mainstream book industry, the novel has remained a top seller on Amazon.com since it came out in 1996. Its sales largely have been either at gun shows or through online book retailers such as Amazon.com. It has sold briskly at gun shows but is generally not sold at traditional bookstores. (As of June 2009, the price for a new copy hovers around $120 and even used ones are priced at over $50 on auction sites because the publisher is almost sold out.) In 2000, Ross had his lawyer write a letter to the ATF claiming that their agents harassed him for writing his book, threatened vendors for selling his book and approached his \\"amicably separated\\" wife to elicit information against him.Jeffired, James III, . This letter is available at the Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership Web site. .500 S&W; Magnum Special Edition In 2007, Ross designed a version of the S&W; .500 Magnum revolver so as to make it more suitable to his needs and Smith & Wesson produced 500 of these John Ross Performance Center 5\\" handguns. It is a pound lighter than the standard version and produces even more power due to tighter barrel/cylinder tolerances.

In 2000, Ross appeared under his own name in the independent film Defiance, where he played the part of a gun dealer in a small western town in 1876. In October 2000, he had a stroke and was incapacitated for a few weeks. He has made a complete recovery and now lives in St. Louis, Missouri, where he writes, does investment consulting, schedules fee-based speaking engagements, and runs night classes for Concealed Weapons licensing.

Members of the species inhabit Africa with a range stretching along the equator from West Africa to Uganda. It subsists almost entirely on ants and termites. The species was first described by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1815. Description The giant pangolin is the largest of all pangolin species. While its average mass has not been measured, one specimen was found to weigh 33 kg (72.6 lb). Males are larger than females, with male body lengths about 140 cm (4.6 ft) and females about 125 cm (4.1 ft). Like all pangolins, the species is armored with large, brown to reddish-brown scales formed from keratin. Curiously, it also has eyelashes. The giant pangolin has a long snout, a long, thick tail, and large front claws. The animal has a strong sense of smell and large anal glands. Its secretions may be significant to animal communication. The species walks with most of its weight on its columnar rear legs, and curls its front paws, walking on the outside of the wrists rather than the palms to protect the claws. By using its tail for balance, it often walks upright as a biped. Distribution and habitat By Joseph Wolf The giant pangolin inhabits many countries, with the largest concentration in Uganda, Tanzania, and western Kenya. It is found mainly in the savanna, rainforest, and forest, inhabiting areas with large termite populations and available water. It does not inhabit high-altitude areas. Behavior and ecology Specimen The giant pangolin, like other pangolins, is nocturnal, which makes observation difficult. It is also usually solitary, although in one case an adult was seen in a burrow with a juvenile. The species is capable of climbing trees and other objects. =Diet= Like all pangolins, the giant pangolin is a specialized insectivore that lacks teeth and the ability to chew. Its diet mainly consists of ants and termites, which it finds by tearing open anthills and termite nests, both subterranean and mound-type. Because of its relatively large size, the giant pangolin is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds by leaning on the mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly leads to a partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. Only the adults are strong enough to do this; their young must follow behind their mothers until they grow large enough to do it for themselves. It eats the insects by picking them up with its sticky tongue, which is up to long. =Reproduction= Very little information about the reproduction of the giant pangolin is known. Two birth records exist, with one litter in September and another in October, with the young weighing around . As in all pangolins, infants have soft scales that eventually harden, and are born with open eyes. They cannot walk on their legs, but can move on their bellies. During age 6‚Äì8 weeks, the young often spew a yellow secretion from their anal glands(that is often said to smell of decay and cabbage) to keep predators and other animals from taking advantage of their mothers.  Threats  The giant pangolin is threatened by habitat destruction and deforestation, and hunting for the bushmeat trade. Between 2011 and 2015, nine shipments with pangolin body parts were seized in Asia that originated in Nigeria. They contained pangolin meat and close to pangolin scales that were destined to China and Laos. Conservation The giant pangolin has been listed on CITES Appendix I since January 2017.

Externally, the way was paved for Theban ascendancy by the collapse of Athenian power in the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC), through the weakening of the Spartans by their oliganthropia (demographic decline) and by the inconclusive Corinthian War (395‚Äì386 BC). Internally, the Thebans enjoyed two temporary military advantages: #The leaders of the Theban oligarchy at the time, Epaminondas and Pelopidas, were fully committed to an aggressive foreign policy and could be relied on to win any battle and #The same leaders had instituted tactical improvements in the Theban heavy infantry (e.g. longer spears, the use of a wedge-shaped formation of spearmen), which had yet to catch on among their rivals. Theban hegemony The Thebans had traditionally enjoyed the hegemony of the Boeotian League, the oligarchical federation of Aeolic-speaking Greeks to the immediate north-west of Athenian-dominated Attica. Their brief rise to power outside the Boeotian Plain began in 373 when the Boeotians defeated and destroyed the town of Plataea, strategically important as the only Athenian ally in Boeotia. This was taken as a direct challenge by the previous hegemonic power, the Spartans, who gambled on restoring their waning ascendancy by a decisive defeat of the Thebans. At Leuctra, in Boeotia, the Thebans comprehensively defeated an invading Spartan army. Out of 700 Spartan citizen-soldiers present, 400 died at Leuctra. After this, the Thebans systematically dominated Greece. In the south, they invaded the Peloponnese to liberate the Messenians and Arcadians from Spartan overlordship and set up a pro-Theban Arcadian League to oversee Peloponnesian affairs. In the north, they invaded Thessaly, to crush the growing local power of Pherae and took the future Philip II of Macedon hostage, bringing him to Thebes. Pelopidas, however was killed at Cynoscephalae, in battle against troops from Pherae (though the battle was actually won by the Thebans). The Thebans overstretched themselves strategically and, in their efforts to maintain control of the north, their power in the south disintegrated. The Spartan king, Agesilaus II, scraped together an army from various Peloponnesian towns dissatisfied with Theban rule and managed to kill but not defeat Epaminondas in the Battle of Mantinea, but not to re-establish any real Spartan ascendancy. This was if anything a Pyrrhic victory for both states. Sparta lacked the manpower and resources to make any real attempt at regaining her empire and Thebes had now lost both of the innovative leaders who had allowed her rise to dominance and was similarly reduced in resources to the point where that dominance could not be guaranteed. The Thebans sought to maintain their position through diplomacy and their influence at the Amphictyonic council in Delphi, but when this resulted in their former allies the Phocians seizing Delphi and beginning the Third Sacred War (c. 355), Thebes proved too exhausted to bring any conclusion to the conflict. The war was finally ended in 346 BC, by the forces not of Thebes, or any of the city-states, but of Philip of Macedon, to whom the city- states had grown desperate enough to turn. This signalled the rise of Macedon within Greece and finally brought to an end a Theban hegemony which had already been in decline.

Mankiewicz and starring Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda. It was the only western made by Mankiewicz. It was written by David Newman and Robert Benton, their first script after Bonnie and Clyde. Plot In 1883, Paris Pitman, Jr. has pulled off a $500,000 robbery and, having murdered his partners, is the only one who knows where the money is hidden. He is seen in a bordello and is captured, tried, convicted and sentenced to an Arizona penitentiary. A corrupt warden, LeGoff, is willing to cut the prisoner a deal. He will let Pitman break out of jail for an even split of the half-million dollars. Pitman agrees, but the plan goes awry when LeGoff is murdered during an inmate uprising. Former sheriff Woodward Lopeman becomes the new warden. Although they are enemies, he and Pitman work together to improve conditions at the prison. On a day the lieutenant governor visits, Pitman makes his move. He sparks a riot and manages to escape, but not before three inmates are killed, whereupon Pitman himself does away with two more partners. The money has been hidden in a nest of rattlesnakes. Pitman heads for it, with Lopeman in hot pursuit. The money is his again when Pitman is suddenly bitten by a rattlesnake. By the time Lopeman comes across him, Pitman is already dead. Lopeman collects the money, as well as Pitman's body, and rides back to the prison. However, upon his arrival, he abruptly decides to leave the body and gallop off, absconding to Mexico with the money. Cast *Kirk Douglas as Paris Pitman Jr. *Henry Fonda as Sheriff Woodward W.

Further shooting was done at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and at Warner Bros.-Seven Arts studio in Burbank, California. During production, Mankiewicz suffered a slipped disc in his spine in an accident at his home and had to direct from a motorized wheelchair for a time. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times was generally positive: \\"Although There Was A Crooked Man... is rather low-keyed and takes its own sweet time to reveal itself, it is a movie of the sort of taste, intelligence and somewhat bitter humor I associate with Mr. Mankiewicz who, in real life, is one of America's most sophisticated, least folksy raconteurs, especially of stories about the old Hollywood.\\"Canby, Vincent. \\"'There Was a Crooked Man ...' and a Myth: Mankiewicz Western Begins Local Run.\\" The New York Times, Dec. 26, 1970. Retrieved May 12, 2019. Variety wrote that the cast of stars, Newman and Benton script and director/producer Mankiewicz \\"are the formidable elements that don't jell in this picaresque tale set in a bleak western desert prison. It is the type of action drama in which neither the actors nor director appear to believe the script or characters, opt for the broadness euphemistically termed 'entertainment,' and which makes its best boxoffice in multiples exploiting the cast and elements.\\"\\"Film Reviews: There Was a Crooked Man\\".

Moore was posthumously promoted to the rank of Detective, 1st grade by New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton at his funeral. * Willie Bosket ‚Äì Adult repeat offender who, in 1978, received the maximum five-year sentence for multiple murder as a (fifteen-year-old) juvenile, causing New York to become the first state to change its laws so that juveniles as young as 13 could be tried as an adult for murder. * Lemuel Smith ‚Äì Serial killer and rapist. Convicted of killing six people between 1958 and 1981, including the first ever murder (1981) of an on-duty female corrections officer by an inmate at a prison. * David Sweat ‚Äì Transferred there after 2015 escape from Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York Educational program Five Points is most famous for its educational program that it made with its prisoners. Five Point correctional facility and Cornell paired together to be able to help the prisoners get education. This program was called the Cornell Prison Education Program or CPEP, in which Five points pairs with Cornell‚Äôs partner Cayuga Community College. On May 24, 2018 the first class was able to graduate in Romulus, New York (same place five points is located at). This class contained sixteen graduates overall, as they all received their Associate of Arts degrees surrounded by all of their families. According to Cornell.edu the graduating class included Jonathan Amidon, Donnell Baines, Jermaine Barrett, Jeffrey Berkley, Dedric Chislum, Chicko Dillard, Ansel Gouveia, Michael Hesse, Aaron Jarzynka, Jesse Johnston, Corey Kimmy, Jos√© M√©ndez, Richard Paul, Joseph Perez, Chester Wood and Christopher Wood. Nine Cornell Certificates in Liberal Arts also were awarded, to Berkley, Chislum, Dillard, Jarzynka, Johnston, M√©ndez and Paul, along with Jonathan M. Istvan and Adam Kitt. These students took multiple different types of classes such as liberal arts, social sciences and humanities. The people who taught these classes were teaching assistants and faculty from the colleges of Cornell, Cayuga CC, Hobart and William Smith, the University of Rochester and Keuka College. The liberal arts certificate, which was made up of 18 credits of work and was made especially for the Prisoner Education Program, to appeal the best to them. This program has been considered by many to be successful, as Senior Program Officer Eugene Tobin‚Äôs has an article on the Mellon Foundation talking about how successful the program was. According to the article in the 1970s that is when colleges started having programs with prisons through Pell grants, leading to them being able to educate these prisoners. This was until the mid 1990s when this decision was overturned as Congress decided to take away grants from them leading to these programs being stopped. This decision stayed this way until Barack Obama came into office, overturning the decision again and giving grants back to the program letting the prisoners able to get an education. Called the ‚ÄúSecond Chance Pell Pilot Program‚Äù which has a lot of optimism around it. There is no doubt that taking college courses reduces violence in prison, improves incarcerated students‚Äô ties with their families, lowers recidivism rates, and improves job prospects upon release. The popular belief is that this program does a lot of positive for these prisoners such as make them less violent, better off with their family and gives them a better chance to get a job in the future. It is also well known that it cost less to educate them, then to have them behind bars. This is especially concerning, because advocates of this program have pointed out that there are more African American males in prison then in college. These facts and many quotes such as from a young man in the program saying that spent his teen to his early twenties \\"on the outside\\" and that \\"Higher education has given me my humanity back.\\", show that there is a lot of hope for the program's future as long as they can keep the grants and funding coming.

In 1925, West Coast businessman J. R. Ridgway merged his investment firm with Investors Syndicate, and took over as president. In 1937, upon the death of then 50-year-old J. R. Ridgway from leukemia, 23-year-old J. R. Ridgway, Sr. was appointed president. In 1940, Investors Syndicate introduced one of the first mutual funds, the Investors Mutual Fund, giving clients new investing options and two advantages: diversification and professional management. By the 1960s, Investors Mutual Fund was the largest balanced mutual fund in the world. In 1949, Investors Syndicate changed its name to Investors Diversified Services, Inc. (IDS). In 1958, IDS founded the Investors Syndicate Life Insurance and Annuity Company (now known as RiverSource Life Insurance Company). In 1974, the IDS Centre (now IDS Center) is opened in downtown Minneapolis as the company's headquarters. In 1979, the Ridgway family sold the last of its ownership interest. IDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation pursuant to a merger. In 1984, American Express acquired IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation. In 1986, IDS acquired Wisconsin Employers Casualty Company of Green Bay, Wisconsin and renamed it IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company. In 1994, IDS reached $100 billion in assets.

Accordingly, for his services to Icelandic culture, Gordon was made a Knight of the Royal Icelandic Order of the Falcon in 1930.Douglas A. Anderson, ' \\"An Industrious Little Devil\\": E. V. Gordon as Friend and Collaborator with Tolkien', in Tolkien the Medievalist, ed. by Jane Chance, Routledge Studies in Medieval Religion and Culture, 3 (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 15‚Äì25 (at p. 18). . With Tolkien, Gordon also began the Viking Club. In this club they would read Old Icelandic sagas (and drink beer) with students and faculty, and invent original Anglo-Saxon songs. A collection of these was privately published as the book Songs for the Philologists. Most of the printed editions were destroyed in a fire and only 14 or so books are said to exist.TolkienBooks.net ‚Äì Songs for the Philologists Gordon was active in the Yorkshire Dialect Society. On Gordon's departure from Leeds, he was succeeded by Bruce Dickins. Among Gordon's best Leeds students were the scholars Albert Hugh Smith, J.A. Thompson, the translator of Halld√≥r Laxness's classic novel Independent People,Halld√≥r Laxness, Independent People, trans. by J.A. Thompson (London: Harvill Press, 1999), p. 1. and Ida Lilian Pickles,http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/20040/school_of_english/1253/history_of_the_school_of_english whom he married in 1930. Together they had four children (the eldest of whom, Bridget Mackenzie, went on to lecture in Old Norse at Glasgow University);Bridget Mackenzie, 'Corrienessan', Ambaile: Highland History & Culture: http://www.ambaile.org.uk/detail/en/1268/1/EN1268-corrienessan.htm. Tolkien composed them a long Old English praise-poem in the Old Norse drottkv√¶tt-metre, entitled Br√Ωdleop, as a wedding present.Leeds, Brotherton Library, Tolkien-Gordon Collection, MS 1952/2/16. University of Manchester, and death In 1931, Gordon was made Smith Professor of English Language and Germanic Philology at the University of Manchester where his research focused on Old and Middle English. Among his students was A. R. Taylor, who later succeeded Gordon at Leeds.C. E. F. [Christine Fell], 'Arnold Rodgers Taylor', Saga-Book, 23 (1990‚Äì93), 489‚Äì90. He died unexpectedly in 1938 of complications following an operation to remove gallstones. After his death, Gordon's widow Ida took on a number of his teaching duties at Manchester, finishing and posthumously publishing a number of his works, before retiring in 1968. Select bibliography and archives An extensive bibliography of Gordon's publications can be found in Tolkien the Medievalist, edited by Jane Chance (London: Routledge, 2003), pp. 273‚Äì74. In 2014, the estate of Gordon's eldest daughter Bridget sold a collection of letters to the Brotherton Library of the University of Leeds, written variously to E. V. Gordon and his wife Ida by J. R.

Guitarist/bassist and singer Mike Kinsella (formerly of Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc and currently of Owen), drummer and trumpet player Steve Lamos (formerly of The One Up Downstairs, one-time member of The Firebird Band and Edward Burch & the Staunch Characters, and currently of The Geese and DMS), and guitar player Steve Holmes (also of The Geese) formed the band. Despite the group's short initial lifespan, their self-titled debut album became one of the most acclaimed emo and math rock records of its era. American Football reunited in 2014 and have since released two more albums, American Football (2016) and American Football (2019). History Mike Kinsella and Steve Holmes knew one another at an early age, as both were students at Wheeling High School in Wheeling, IL, where Kinsella played drums for Cap'n Jazz; Holmes played guitar in a variety of bands. Kinsella and Lamos began playing together with David Johnson and Allen Johnson in 1997 under the name 'The One Up Downstairs', in which Kinsella was exclusively a vocalist. Three songs were recorded under this name, with the intention of releasing them as a 7\\" record on Polyvinyl Records. However, the band splintered before the record could be pressed and the songs were shelved. The three tracks recorded by The One Up Downstairs would finally be released in 2006 as a digital download EP, and in 2009, as a 7\\" record through Polyvinyl. David Johnson and Allen Johnson went on to form the band Very Secretary (and later Favorite Saints), while Kinsella and Lamos began working with Steve Holmes. American Football completed a total of two releases--a titular EP in 1998 and its debut album in 1999, both through Polyvinyl Records. Though the band did not record bass on the EP, Kinsella played bass guitar on some songs for the LP. Within a year of the release of its full-length, American Football became a studio project. Shortly thereafter, the band mutually decided to stop recording together. Still, American Football gained critical acclaim for that album, which merged the plain-spoken, confessional lyrics and the varying time signatures of math rock with a softer musical sensibility. These characteristics carried on in Mike Kinsella's solo project Owen, and Kinsella would later re-record \\"Never Meant\\" as Owen in 2004. On March 20, 2014, Polyvinyl Records announced a deluxe edition of the band's self-titled album, American Football, which includes the original nine tracks from its 1999 release, as well as 10 additional unheard demos and live recordings. The deluxe edition is available as a 180-Gram Red 2xLP, 2xCD, cassette tape, and an MP3 download. Another version ‚Äî limited to 2,000 copies of a 180-Gram Green/Yellow 2xLP ‚Äî was also announced. All versions were released May 20, 2014. On April 2, 2014, Polyvinyl teased fans with a website, americanfootballmusic.com, to fans on social media. The site had a countdown that expired on April 21, 2014, when two live dates in Champaign and New York were announced. The band added second and third shows in New York at Webster Hall which quickly sold out. For these dates, Mike's cousin Nate Kinsella joined the band on bass. Since the band's new-found success, American Football booked tour dates worldwide in the US, Canada, Spain, UK, Japan, and Australia. On August 23, 2016, the band announced their second album, also titled American Football. In the same announcement, \\"I've Been So Lost For So Long\\" was made available for streaming through SoundCloud. On October 21, 2016, the band released their second album for purchase worldwide through Polyvinyl Records. The album's cover featured the same house photographed on the band's first full-length. The \\"American Football House\\" became a landmark for emo music fans around the world, who often traveled to Urbana, Illinois to take photos outside of the home. On December 11, 2018, the band teased their third album on Instagram, with their third eponymous studio album available to pre-order on Apple Music and iTunes. The single \\"Silhouettes\\" was made available upon announcement. Their third album was released on March 22, 2019.

As a scholar, he specialized in comparative religion. Early life and education Raimon Panikkar was born to a Spanish Roman Catholic mother and a Hindu Indian father in Barcelona. His mother was well-educated and from the Catalan bourgeoisie. His father, Ramunni Panikkar, belonged to a Malabar Nair family from South India. Panikkar's father was a freedom fighter during British colonial rule in India, who later escaped from Britain and married into a Catalan family. Panikkar's father studied in England and was the representative of a German chemical company in Barcelona. Educated at a Jesuit school, Panikkar studied chemistry and philosophy at the universities of Barcelona, Bonn and Madrid, and Catholic theology in Madrid and Rome. He earned a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Madrid in 1946 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1958. He earned a third doctorate in theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome in 1961, in which compared St. Thomas Aquinas's Philosophy with the 8th-century Hindu philosopher ƒÄdi ≈öa≈Ñkara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras. Career In 1946 he was ordained a Catholic priest and became a professor of philosophy at the University of Madrid. He made his first trip to India in 1954 where he studied Indian philosophy and religion at the University of Mysore and Banaras Hindu University, where he met several Western monks seeking Eastern forms for the expression of their Christian beliefs. \\"I left Europe [for India] as a Christian, I discovered I was a Hindu and returned as a Buddhist without ever having ceased to be Christian\\", he later wrote. While in Jerusalem during 1962, he was summoned to Rome by the Opus Dei founder and director, Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, who expelled him after a brief trial where he was charged with disobedience to the organization. In 1966 he became a visiting professor at Harvard Divinity School and a professor of religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1972, and for many years he taught in the spring and spent the rest of the year doing research in India. Where the typical approach to cross-cultural religious studies, especially in a secular university, was to hold two or more traditions at arm's length and draw lines of comparison between them, Panikkar's approach was to view issues in the real world through the eyes of two or more traditions. In 1987 he moved to Tavertet in Catalonia, in the hills north of Barcelona, where he founded the Raimon Panikkar Vivarium Foundation, a center for intercultural studies. In 2005 he created Arbor, for the realization of his principle of interreligious collaboration for the relief of poverty in thousands of villages of India. Panikkar authored more than 40 books and 900 articles. His complete works are being published in Italian. His 1989 Gifford Lectures were published in English by Orbis in 2009 under the title The Rhythm of Being. In a statement from his residence in Tavertet dated January 26, 2010, he wrote: \\"Dear Friends ... I would like to communicate with you that I believe the moment has come (put off time and again), to withdraw from all public activity, both the direct and the intellectual participation, to which I have dedicated all my life as a way of sharing my reflections. I will continue to be close to you in a deeper way, through silence and prayer, and in the same way I would ask you to be close to me in this last period of my existence. You have often heard me say that a person is a knot in a network of relationships; in taking my leave from you I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having enriched me with the relationship I have had with each of you. I am also grateful to all of those who, either in person or through association, continue working to spread my message and the sharing of my ideals, even without me. Thankful for the gift of life which is only such if lived in communion with others: it is with this spirit that I have lived out my ministry.\\" Works =By Panikkar= * The Unknown Christ of Hinduism (1964) * The \\"crisis\\" of Madhyamika and Indian philosophy today.

A highly rated and influential program, it was commonplace that on a typical day in the 1970s, over two-thirds of all television sets in the Cleveland market were tuned to The Morning Exchange. In 1975, ABC (of which WEWS is an affiliate) recognized the show's success and used MX as a template for their (then new) national morning show ‚Äì creating Good Morning America.WEWS history ‚Äì Case Western Reserve University History The Morning Exchange incorporated many elements that would be used in morning television programs of the present day. It was the first morning show to use a \\"living room\\" set and establish the now familiar concept of news and weather segments at the top and bottom of the hour. The remainder of the program time was used to discuss general interest/entertainment topics. In a 2006 interview, Ken Lowe, the CEO of Scripps-Howard Broadcasting said, \\"The Morning Exchange was a huge risk that Don Perris took at the time. A lot of people thought that he was out of his mind when he suggested a morning show of that nature. Of course, we all know that [the show's format] went on to become [the standard for all of today's network morning shows.]\\" Fred Griffith, the program's longtime host, talked about the groundbreaking format in another 2006 interview saying, \\"We talked about death, sexuality, dealing with career choices, how to establish long lasting relationships, we talked about all those kinds of things that are just routine now, but [at the time] we were pioneers.\\" The show, originally called The Alan Douglas Morning Exchange and premiering on January 3, 1972, was created by Donald L. Perris and William F. Baker as an alternative to the solely news-based morning shows at the time.MX anniversary ‚Äì News Net 5.com Originally hosted by Alan Douglas, when the show debuted, a traditional news desk set was used. Don Webster served as the announcer and did some of the show's interviews and Joel Rose read the news.WEWS 60th anniversary ‚Äì News Net 5.com In March 1972, Don Webster briefly left WEWS and was replaced by Liz Richards, who became a co-host and the weather presenter. In July of that year, Douglas left the station and was replaced by Griffith, who had been a member of the station's news department since 1966. The choice of Griffith as a co-host of the show was only meant to be temporary, but Griffith remained a co-host throughout the remainder of the program's history.Liz Richards profile ‚Äì Cleveland Seniors.com In August 1972, the program's producers decided to replace the news desk set with a set that resembled a suburban living room; Griffith, Richards, and Rose would instead recline on couches. Producers felt that this would make viewers feel more relaxed and comfortable. This idea seemed to work, as the format became more relaxed as the hosts developed chemistry on screen. As a result, many viewers felt that the on-air set was an extension of their own living room and that the personalities were a part of their families. MX quickly became extremely popular, with an average of 67% of television viewers tuning in each day. The format was so successful that ABC used The Morning Exchange as the pilot for its national morning program Good Morning America, which replaced the struggling A.M. America in 1975. The format quickly caught on and soon GMA beat NBC's Today in the ratings. Soon thereafter, both NBC and CBS adopted the format for their morning shows. On March 16, 1979 in an emotional episode, a tearful Richards left the show in order to care for her children. This followed years of her personal life and her volatile marriage to Cleveland disc jockey Gary Dee spilling over into the headlines on other news outlets. She was replaced by Jan Jones. In 1983, Jones became a consultant for WEWS and left the show.Jan Jones profile = Cleveland Women.com Joel Rose left WEWS-TV in 1984, to devote himself full-time to his talk show on radio station WJW (850 AM, now WKNR), and Randi Hall became the new co-host of the show for a year-and-a-half. Rose would return to the show in 1986 and remain until 1990. The news segment updates were now delivered by either Jenny Crimm or Lou Maglio. Unlike Rose, however, Crimm and Maglio simply read the news and were not co-hosts. In 1987, Lee Jordan became the new co-host, filling the void left by Hall's earlier departure. From 1976 to 1982 and then again from 1988 until the show's end, Lynda Hirsch provided recaps and previews of soap operas. She developed such a reputation on the show that she was given her own nationally syndicated newspaper column. David Moss (now with WJW, channel 8) served as entertainment reporter from 1985 to 1993. In 1990, Jon Loufman (now with CBS affiliate WOIO, channel 19) joined the show and provided weather reports and a number of live shots. In 1993, both Maglio and Moss left the show for new positions at WJW-TV, while Loufman left for WKYC-TV (channel 3) (and later, WJW-TV). Loufman was replaced by Mark Johnson. Later in 1993, Lee Jordan moved from MX co-host to WEWS evening co-anchor (to replace the departing Wilma Smith) and was replaced by former WKYC anchor Connie Dieken. =The Weekend Exchange= From 1995 to 1997, the program expanded to include Saturday and Sunday editions entitled The Weekend Exchange. The show was hosted solo by Leon Bibb and was broadcast from a set different from the one used for the weekday edition. The Weekend Exchange consisted solely of interviews conducted by Bibb and did not include any news or weather updates. The format was later reworked into WEWS' weekend public affairs program Kaleidoscope, which is also hosted by Bibb. Decline WEWS originally chose not to air A.M. America and later Good Morning America, electing to run The Morning Exchange in the 7‚Äì9 a.m. timeslot. In 1978, WEWS began airing one hour of Good Morning America from 7 to 8 a.m. and then The Morning Exchange from 8 to 10 a.m. (the Cleveland market's secondary ABC affiliate at the time, Akron- based WAKR-TV, channel 23 ‚Äì later WAKC and currently Ion Television owned-and- operated station WVPX-TV ‚Äì carried Good Morning America in its entirety throughout the 1980s and early 1990s). On September 12, 1994, WJW-TV, as part of a group-wide deal involving the station's then-owner New World Communications, dropped its CBS affiliation and joined Fox. During the transition period, CBS attempted to negotiate a deal with WEWS owner Scripps- Howard to have WEWS and one-time ABC O&O; WXYZ-TV in Detroit, Michigan affiliate with the network (Detroit's then-CBS affiliate WJBK-TV was also involved in Fox's group deal with New World). Instead, the company informed ABC of CBS's intentions and convinced ABC to increase the affiliation fee it paid to WEWS, which resulted in a group-wide affiliation pact with the network that triggered, among other deals, Westinghouse's affiliation pact (and later, merger) with CBS. However, in addition to agreeing to stay with ABC, Scripps lost most of the remaining leverage for local schedule control it had for the network. For WEWS, this meant by network mandate, it would also have to agree to broadcast the full two hours of Good Morning America. By 1994, WEWS was the only ABC station remaining among the 25 largest television markets in the country that did not broadcast the full two hours of GMA. That move proved devastating to The Morning Exchange. Its timeslot was pushed back to 9‚Äì11 a.m., missing the commuter rush hour audience. Additionally, the show's original target audience, stay-at-home housewives and mothers, had nearly disappeared since the show's debut, as more women entered the workforce, and those that remained began to regard the show's format as antiquated. In addition, other stations also began increasing the amount of local programming it aired in the early morning hours. Most notably, WJW easily and successfully compensated for the loss of the perennially low-rated CBS This Morning as a result of the Fox switch by expanding its weekday morning newscast to 9 a.m., and later, beyond. The only remaining advantage for WEWS was that ABC's late morning programming at the time, including Home, Mike and Maty, and Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends, was wholly uncompetitive nationwide, had no ownership stake by ABC, and was easily pushed into the late night graveyard slot, as WEWS did with all three series in favor of MX. At the end of 1996, WAKR ended its ABC affiliation, leaving WEWS to be the area's only ABC affiliate, but also removing a buffer that allowed the station to direct viewers to pre- empted network programming, placing additional pressure on the station to air ABC programming in pattern. In 1997 as part of another Scripps/ABC deal, WEWS began airing Live with Regis and Kathie Lee during the 9 a.m. hour, bumping The Morning Exchange to the 10 a.m. to noon slot (the station had been airing Live from 11 a.m. to noon, two hours later than most stations that carry the program, ever since it debuted in national syndication in 1988). In an unusual move, WEWS slotted the syndicated (and at the time, half-hour) Martha Stewart Living program in the middle of the MX broadcast, making it appear as if it was an extended segment of the show. In 1998, major changes occurred to the program: it was retitled Today's Morning Exchange and was soon reduced to one hour, in an attempt to save the declining show. Viewers and ABC had also begun to clamor for The View, which premiered in 1997 to acclaim and success compared to ABC's past late morning programs (and was also under the network's full editorial control), to air in Cleveland at its prescribed time. WEWS had continued to delay The View to late night until January 18, 1999, when it began to air in its proper 11 a.m. time slot, leaving MX with little natural flow between Live! and The View. Fred Griffith was demoted to a field reporter with morning meteorologist Mark Johnson taking his place as co-host, along with former WJW-TV news anchor Robin Swoboda. The resulting show departed significantly from the program viewers were used to, and ratings declined even further. After only several months, WEWS announced that it would end The Morning Exchange after 27 years. The final week's editions saw Griffith return as host and featured \\"MX Moments\\" from throughout the show's run. The last broadcast, which aired on September 10, 1999, included live interviews with some of the hosts of morning shows that used the MX format, including Good Morning America.Fred Griffith profile ‚Äì Cleveland Seniors.com All of the other program's hosts praised MX for being the pioneer in establishing the format used by nearly all morning interview programs.

In February 2017, Walters voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session. FiveThirtyEight had found that Walters voted with President Trump 99% of the time, and was the eighth-most partisan Trump supporter in the House, when compared to her district's voting patterns.Tracking Congress in the Age of Trump, accessed September 25, 2018 = Federal taxation legislation of 2017 = In November 2017, Walters voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the house version of the Republican Party's tax reform bill. The House bill removed state and local tax breaks that many Californians used, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Walters said after the vote that she had received assurances from House Speaker Paul Ryan that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would restore the lost tax breaks that had been removed in the House version. According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill \\"contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with California's, but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level, instead of cutting it in half, as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare's individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees.\\" =Environment= In 2015, Walters sponsored and voted for H.R. 1732, a bill that opposed the Waters of the United States rule, which expands the federal government's jurisdiction to regulate waters and certain adjacent lands. Also in 2015, Walters voted to repeal the limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants set by the Clean Power Plan. \\"Forcing a shift away from traditional energy resources\\", she explained, \\"would ultimately stifle the economy for years to come and harm consumers' pocketbooks.\\" Walters also co-sponsored the Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017, which became law, and which declares that there is no legal requirement to regulate global warming.Mosko, Sarah; Mosko: Is Mimi Walters Changing Her Stance on Climate Change?; Voice of OC; March 27, 2018 Walters was originally a climate change denier, but she began to shift her views after meeting with the Orange County Central chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby in 2014. After they explained to her how the market-based approach of carbon fee and dividend could have a positive impact on the climate, without expanding government, Walters replied, \\"You guys are doing it the right way\\". In July 2017, Walters voted to veto the Perry Amendment, which would have de- funded Defense Department efforts to track climate change and its threats to military bases.Murphy, Breene; ‚ÄòKeep going‚Äô attitude brought Rep.

She also voted for H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which would have repealed Obamacare. Walters supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) with the American Health Care Act, the GOP's replacement plan for Obamacare, which did not come to a vote initially. She said that passing the American Health Care Act \\"is a critical step\\" towards the goal of rescuing \\"this failing health-care system\\". On May 4, 2017, Walters voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act. In early 2017, Walters tweeted that she was \\"committed to protecting patients w/ pre-existing conditions to ensure their access to quality, affordable health care\\".

It is worn over the rochet or cotta as part of choir dress by some of the clergy of the Catholic Church, among them the pope, cardinals, bishops, abbots, canons and religious superiors. There used to be a small hood on the back of the mozzetta of bishops and cardinals, but this was discontinued by Pope Paul VI. The hood, however, was retained in the mozzette of certain canons and abbots, and in that of the popes, often trimmed in satin, silk or ermine material. Color The color of the mozzetta, which is only worn over a cassock and sometimes other choral vestments, represents the hierarchical rank of the person wearing it. Cardinals wear a scarlet mozzetta, while bishops and those with equivalent jurisdiction (e.g., apostolic administrators, vicars apostolic, exarchs, prefects apostolic, territorial prelates, and territorial abbots, if not bishops) wear an amaranth mozzetta. Abbots, rectors of basilicas and some canons wear a black mozzetta with red piping and buttons. The black mozzetta may be worn by priests who are rectors of parishes. Some religious orders have a mozzetta as part of their religious habit: the Canons Regular of the Austrian Congregation wear a violet mozzetta; their confreres in the Congregation of St. Maurice wear a red mozzetta; the Congregation of Holy Cross, the Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception and the Lateran Canons wear a black mozzetta.

Papal mozzetta Pope Benedict XVI wearing red winter Papal mozzetta The pope wears five versions of the mozzetta: the summer mozzetta, which is of red satin; the winter mozzetta, which is of red velvet trimmed with white ermine fur; the red serge mozzetta, which is worn during Masses for the deceased; the red clothed mozzetta, which is worn during the Lenten and Advent season; and the Paschal mozzetta, which is of white damask silk trimmed with white fur. The Paschal mozzetta is worn only during Eastertide. The winter mozzetta and the Paschal mozzetta fell into disuse during the pontificate of John Paul II (1978‚Äì2005), but their use was briefly restored by Pope Benedict XVI (2005‚Äì2013) before being discontinued again by Pope Francis. Benedict wore the winter mozzetta during the papal station at the image of the Madonna near the Spanish Steps that traditionally marks the beginning of Rome's winter season, and he wore it on all the occasions in the winter season where this garment was appropriate. The white mozzetta was reintroduced during the Octave of Easter in 2008. This change between winter and summer garments was very practical, given the oppressive heat of the Roman summer. Symbolism The mozzetta is a sign of authority. Priests ranked as monsignors who are also pastors may wear black cassocks with matching pellegrinae, not mozzettas, both trimmed with violet buttons and piping only in their own parishes, as having attained \\"a touch of the purple\\" pertaining to the episcopal rank. Bishops wear their mozzettas of violet watered silk or a plainer fabric, with violet buttons and piping or, with less formality, black with violet buttons and piping, in their own dioceses. Cardinals may wear scarlet mozzettas of watered silk anywhere in their roles as Princes of the Church. The pope also wears his mozzetta anywhere in the world, usually with a heavily embroidered red stole over it, as a sign of his universal sovereignty. On the evening of his election in 2013, Pope Francis did not wear the mozzetta, appearing on the balcony of St Peter's in a white papal soutane, surmounted by the pellegrina. He donned the broad scarlet papal stole only when bestowing the blessing urbi et orbi. Pellegrina Not to be confused with the mozzetta, the pellegrina is a shoulder cape of elbow-length like the mozzetta but open in front, worn with the cassock, either fixed to it or detachable. It differs from the mozzetta also in not being associated with a cotta, surplice, or rochet.

Jean-Pierre Brisset (October 30 1837‚ÄìSeptember 2 1919) was a French outsider writer. Biography Born into a farming family of La Sauvag√®re, Brisset was an autodidact. Having left school at age twelve to help on the family farm, he apprenticed as a pastry chef in Paris three years later. In 1855, he enlisted in the army for seven years and fought in the Crimean War. In 1859, during the war in Italy against the Austrians. After he was wounded at the Battle of Magenta, he was taken prisoner. During the Franco-Prussian War, he was a second lieutenant in the 50e r√©giment d'infanterie de ligne. Taken prisoner again, he was sent to Magdeburg in Saxony where he learned German. In 1871, he published La natation ou l‚Äôart de nager appris seul en moins d‚Äôune heure (Learning the art of swimming alone in less than an hour), then resigned from the Army and moved to Marseilles. Here he filed a patent for the \\"airlift swimming trunks and belt with a double compensatory reservoir\\". This commercial endeavor was a complete failure. He returned to Magdeburg, where he earned his living as a language teacher, developing a method for learning French, which he self-published in 1874. Brisset became stationmaster at the railway station of Angers, and later of L'Aigle. After publishing another book on the French language, he undertook his major philosophical work, in which contended that humans were descended from frogs. Brisset supported his contention by comparing the French and frog languages (such as \\"logement\\" = dwelling, comes from \\"l'eau\\" = water). He was serious about his \\"morosophy\\", and authored a number of books and pamphlets put forth his indisputable substantiations, which he had printed and distributed at his own expense. In 1912, novelist Jules Romains, who had obtained copies of God's Mystery and The Human Origins, set up, with the help of fellow hoaxers, a rigged election for a \\"Prince of Thinkers\\". Unsurprisingly, Brisset got elected. The Election Committee then called Brisset to Paris in 1913, where he was received and acclaimed with great pomp. He partook in several ceremonies and a banquet and uttered emotional words of thanks for this unexpected late recognition of his work. Newspapers exposed the hoax the next day. In 1919, Brisset died, aged 81, at La Fert√©-Mac√©. Posthumous reputation The Complete Works of Brisset were reprinted by Marc D√©cimo, Dijon, Les Presses du r√©el, 2001. In an essay entitled, Jean-Pierre Brisset, Prince des Penseurs, inventeur, grammairien et proph√®te, Dijon, Les presses du r√©el, 2001, Marc D√©cimo has given a biography, explanations about Brisset's delirium about frogs as ancestors of humankind. Translations in several languages (European languages, Wolof, Armenian, Arabic, Houma, etc.) can be found in this book as well. It also includes the major texts written about Brisset by Jules Romains, Marcel Duchamp, Andr√© Breton, Raymond Queneau, Michel Foucault. In 2004 the Art of Swimming (as a frog) was published in paperback. Around 2001, Ernestine Chasseb≈ìuf wrote several letters to French politicians, universities, railway stations, library directors, psychiatric hospitals, to suggest they name a street, a university, etc. after Brisset. Their answers were published on a website dedicated to him,Website about Jean- Pierre Brisset at pagesperso-orange.fr but there is no \\"rue Jean-Pierre Brisset\\" yet. Thanks to a bequest to Jules Romain, an annual dinner in his memory was made possible until 1939. Brisset is listed as a saint on the 'Pataphysics calendar. His writings were in print as of 2004.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks. KTRV's offices are located on South Best Business Road in Kuna, and its transmitter is located at the Bogus Basin ski area summit in unincorporated Boise County. History Former DT2 \\"My Boise TV\\" logo, used from February 6, 2009 to January 22, 2012. The station signed on October 18, 1981, airing an analog signal on VHF channel 12. It was the first independent station in Idaho, and featured programming offerings consisting primarily of syndicated talk and children's shows in the day and movies in the evenings. It was originally owned by Peyton Broadcasting. Peyton sold the station to Block Communications in 1985. The station became a Fox affiliate when the network launched in 1986. It added the -TV suffix to its calls on July 10, 2006. On February 6, 2009, KTRV added MyNetworkTV and This TV to a new second and third digital subchannels. Until this point, there were no affiliates of either network in Boise. KTRV-DT2 was not added to Cable One systems until almost a year later on January 11, 2010. On September 1, 2011, KTRV's affiliation agreement with Fox expired after which the network moved to CW outlet KNIN-TV, channel 9 (then owned by the Journal Broadcast Group as part of a duopoly with ABC affiliate KIVI-TV, channel 6). On September 12 of the same year, The CW Plus (seen on KNIN-DT2 and Cable One systems) moved to low-powered Retro Television Network (RTV) affiliate KYUU-LP that can also seen on a second digital subchannel of CBS affiliate KBOI-TV, channel 2 (both are owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group in another duopoly). As a result of these changes, KTRV reverted to independent status. With the switch, Boise became one of the only few television markets in the United States with only four out of the six broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) having primary affiliations in a market containing five full-power commercial stations and the remaining two (The CW and the MyNetworkTV programming service) as digital multicast channels. Its weeknight prime time programming lineup as an independent began on September 19 with a double run of 30 Rock at 7 p.m. and Law & Order: Criminal Intent at 8 p.m. KTRV maintained a schedule similar to other stations not affiliated with a big three network or Fox. In an attempt to keep programming options fresh, KTRV planned to rotate its lineup every five or six months as do networks. In addition, KTRV became heavily involved in the airing of live local sports to cover the Treasure Valley's three minor league franchises. KTRV-DT2's MyNetworkTV affiliation initially remained on 12.2, which also added MeTV programming. By October 2011, This TV moved to a new third digital subchannel of KTRV and presumably a new channel location on Cable One systems.

On September 6, 2014, KTRV-TV discontinued the This TV affiliation on 12.3 and replaced it with Movies! becoming the first TV station in the area to broadcast that network. On September 1, 2016, KTRV joined Ion Television as an affiliate. The station had announced on August 31 that it would become an Ion affiliate by October 1; in the announcement, Block Communications chairman Allan Block said that \\"the timing was right to move to a more immersive network.\\" While MyNetworkTV programming initially continued to air in prime time as a secondary affiliation, it was removed in early 2017. On March 2, 2017, the MeTV affiliation moved to KNIN-TV digital subchannel 9.2, replacing Heroes & Icons (which resulted in a programming realignment that saw the H&I; affiliation move to KRID-LD 22.3) On June 20, 2017, Ion Media Networks announced that it would purchase KTRV-TV from Block Communications for an undisclosed amount (in a deal separate from another purchase announced on that date of fellow Ion Television affiliates WRBU in St. Louis and WZRB in Columbia, South Carolina from an Ion Media-backed trust overseen by former LIN Media CEO Gary Chapman).

The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 13. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 12. Newscasts In May 1999, the station established a news department and began airing a nightly newscast called Fox 12 News at 9. The success of that broadcast prompted KTRV to launch a weekday morning show under the name This Morning in April 2007. This was originally seen for two hours from 6 until 8 and simulcasted on KTRV-DT2. On January 11, 2010, the station added a weeknight newscast called News Edge at 10. The show competes with local news seen on Boise's big three affiliates and prior to September 5, 2011, was also simulcasted on KTRV-DT2. With the change back to independent status, KTRV added an hour to 12 News This Morning.

It conducts a wholesale distribution business for electrical, communications and data networking products, and is a provider of related supply-chain management and logistics services. It is included on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations. Founded in 1869 in Cleveland, Ohio, by Elisha Gray and Enos M. Barton, it was the origin of the Western Electric Company. On December 11, 1925, it was separately incorporated as Graybar Electric Company, Inc. History =Early history= During the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, an entrepreneur named Enos M. Barton (who had served as a telegrapher during the war) worked for Western Union in Rochester, New York. During this period, Barton met George Shawk, the foreman of the company's Cleveland, Ohio shop. When that shop was closed down, Shawk bought some of the equipment and went into business for himself, making various kinds of electrical and other apparatus, including inventor's models. While on a trip to Rochester, he and Barton, who was then 26, agreed to go into partnership. To raise the $400 her son needed for his share of the business venture, Barton's widowed mother mortgaged her home. The new firm, located at 93 St. Clair Street in Cleveland, grew. In May 1869, Elisha Gray, an Oberlin College professor and inventor of telegraphic equipment, bought out Shawk's interest. Up until then, Gray had been one of the firm's top customers. He had invented a needle annunciator for hotels and elevators, a telautograph (a machine for the electrical transmission of writing), and the telegraph answer- back call box. Gray and Barton joined forces with an investment of $2,500 each, with Gray as the senior partner. The success of the new company attracted the attention of General Anson Stager, general superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company. He offered to enter the business as an equal partner with Gray and Barton, providing the company's headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Chicago, Illinois. In December 1869, the company moved to 162 S. Water Street, Chicago. The great Great Chicago Fire in 1871 came within two blocks of its small plant. Chicago, Illinois building which housed the shops and offices of Gray & Barton in the early 1870s The destruction caused by the fire resulted in greater growth for Gray & Barton, as the company sold fire alarms and helped rebuild the Western Union infrastructure in the city. =Incorporation as Western Electric= Graybar Electric internal call system preserved at Edison and Ford Winter Estates After several relocations, all in Chicago, the business was incorporated as the Western Electric Manufacturing Company in 1872 to meet the capital requirements of the telegraph supply business. The new company so closely allied with the elder Western that three of its five directors were Western Union executives. Moreover, Stager was named president, although it was Barton as secretary/treasurer who actually handled day-to-day affairs. Although the young firm thrived in the telegraph industry, it was not until the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, and the incandescent lamp by Thomas Alva Edison in 1879, that Western Electric began to gain stature as a large company. Part-owner Gray held the title of company electrician and spent his days working on his inventions, becoming increasingly less involved in the operations of the shop, and eventually he sold his interest in Western Electric in 1875 and retired to pursue independent research and to teach at Oberlin College. In 1876, he filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office, announcing his intention to soon patent an invention that would transmit vocal sounds telegraphically. Gray dubbed his telephone \\"the harmonic telegraph\\". Only hours earlier, however, Alexander Graham Bell applied for a patent for the same idea, which became known as the telephone. As it turned out, what Bell actually patented would have never worked, while Gray's idea would have. Western Union acquired both Gray's and Edison's telephone patents to challenge the American Bell Telephony Company (renamed AT&T; in 1899), which led to a patent infringement suit and Bell ultimately being named the inventor of the telephone. Therefore it was Bell's patent and not Gray‚Äôs that launched the telecommunications industry. As applications of electricity broadened, Western Electric not only sold the electric bells and batteries, telegraph keys, fire alarm boxes and hotel annunciators it originally manufactured, but also many items it purchased from other manufacturers. Stager served as president of Western Electric until shortly before his death in 1885, and Barton then served as president from 1886 to 1908. Western Electric Company was the first company to join in a Japanese joint venture with foreign capital. It invested in Nippon Electric Company in 1899. Western Electric held 54% of NEC at the time. Their representative in Japan was Walter Tenney Carleton. By the turn of the century, Western Electric had become the main producer of telephone equipment in the United States. It also manufactured arc lamps, lighting equipment and power apparatus, ranging from small fans to huge motors and generators. Alongside manufacturing, the distribution business continued to grow, handling an extensive line of electrical supplies such as wire, conduit, wiring devices and pole line material. By the 1910s, the company became the world‚Äôs largest distributor and the United States‚Äô leading wholesaler of electrical supplies. These facts attracted investment by the American Bell Telephone Company, which also discovered that Gray and Barton could purchase supplies and sell them to the telephone companies more efficiently than the companies could acquire the supplies themselves. A chain of warehouses was established across the nation, and the growth of the distributing business continued to increase through World War I and into the post-war period. =Formation of Graybar= Graybar president Albert L. Salt (left) presents $3 million check to Western Electric president Edgar S. Bloom, as Graybar employees‚Äô down payment toward the purchase of their company in 1929. On December 31, 1920, the supply department of Western Electric was divided by forming operating divisions to handle general electrical supplies and telephone equipment, respectively. Scores of electrical supply manufacturers were using the company's distribution network, and business relationships were formed. Some of these relationships, such as with General Electric and the Square D Company, are more than a century old and still exist today. Having become one of the largest merchandizers of electrical supplies in the world, the division was incorporated as a separate identity on December 11, 1925 with the name Graybar Electric Company, in honor of Western's original founders, Elisha Gray and Enos Barton. On January 1, 1927, Western Electric's holdings in Graybar were transferred to Electric Research Holdings, a Western Electric company. Graybar was sold to the Graybar Management Corporation on December 31, 1928, a company held by the employees of Graybar, who purchased their shares for its capitalized value, which consisted of $3 million in cash and $6 million in cumulative preferred stock. The Graybar Electric Company was capitalized at $9 million and consisted of 59 distributing houses in cities across the United States. Graybar had become the largest merchandiser of electrical supplies in the world. Graybar's corporate headquarters were located at the Graybar Building in New York City from 1927 until 1982. During the 1930s, the company explored many different avenues of income, including a line of appliances and sewing machines under the Graybar brand. By 1941 the company's sales volume was more than $100 million, the number of distribution houses had jumped to 86, and there was a corresponding increase in personnel. Also that year, the remaining outstanding shares of stock were purchased from Western Electric with a $1 million check signed by Graybar President Frank A. Ketcham. When the country entered World War II, Graybar's ingenuity and knowledge of logistics proved to be of immeasurable value in providing war-needed goods. Graybar became a vital link between America's manufacturers and America's defense needs. Defense-related business continued in the postwar era, with Graybar again aiding the military during the subsequent Korean War and Vietnam War. Overall the company enjoyed strong growth in the years following World War II, its momentum not checked until the recession of the mid-1970s, which led to Graybar slashing its workforce by 20%. As a result, when economic conditions improved in the 1980s Graybar was unable to gear up quickly enough to meet the rising demand for electrical products. The corporate headquarters moved from the Graybar Building in New York City to Clayton, Missouri in 1982. =Recent years= The current Graybar corporate headquarters at the Graybar Building, Clayton, Missouri. Graybar modernized its infrastructure, implementing one of the first computer-to- computer ordering systems, but a weak real estate market and slowdown in construction began to take its toll on the bottom line. Revenues, which had approached $1.5 billion in 1980, improved to just $1.89 billion in 1990, then fell to $1.74 billion in 1991, prompting the closure of some regional offices and another reduction in the workforce. Aside from a weak economy, it was also becoming clear to management that Graybar suffered from internal problems; the company was losing market share on its traditional electrical business while unable to make desired progress on the newer communications/data products. Business improved as the economy recovered in the early 1990s. Despite sales growing to $2.3 billion in 1994, management decided to realign the business starting in January 1995, forming two business groups, one for electrical supplies and another devoted to the increasingly important comm/data business. That same year, Graybar formed the Solutions Providers Alliance, teaming up with wholesale distributors Kaman Industrial Technologies, WWR Scientific Products, and Vallen Corporation. To accommodate an aggressive new growth strategy, Graybar added 45 locations, 2,400 employees, and 350 salespeople from 1994 to 1999. It also improved its network of warehouses, spending $144 million to construct 16 major new facilities that dramatically cut down on delivery time. As a result of these investments, the company was well positioned to take advantage of a strong economy in the final years of the 1990s. In 1999 annual revenues topped $4.2 billion, while profits almost doubled during this period, improving from $36 million in 1995 to $64 million in 1999. The improvement in the comm/data sector was of particular importance. In 1991 it accounted for just 17 percent of Graybar sales, but by 1999 totaled 38 percent. Graybar engaged in some external growth, making several acquisitions in 1999 and 2000, the largest being Splane Electric Supply Co., a Detroit, Michigan, company with $30 million in annual sales, 70 employees, and six locations. In 2000 Graybar revenues improved to $5.2 billion, while net income topped $66.2 million. To support further expansion of its nationwide distribution centers, instrumental to the company's growth, Graybar placed a $100 million bond offering in the summer of 2001, the largest financing effort in its history. By this time nine of the 16 distribution centers started in 1997 were operational and the remaining seven were only months away from opening. Once the system was in place, Graybar was able to achieve its long- term aim of being able to ship to customers within 24 hours throughout the United States. A downturn in the economy, however, soon hurt business and forced management to fine-tune the company's strategy. In 2001 revenues fell to $4.8 billion and business continued to drop off in 2002 and 2003 to $3.99 billion and $3.78 billion, respectively. As it had done in the early 1990s, Graybar opted to invest in its infrastructure in order to be ready to take advantage of the economy when it ultimately rebounded. The company invested $90 million on new technology to provide customers with more detailed information on orders, deliveries, and payments. At the same time, it encouraged its 4,100 suppliers to implement a standardized bar code system to create an open, central database similar to that found in the retail industry. In this way, Graybar would distinguish itself from its rivals, graduating from the role of middleman to a supply chain expert capable of adding value to the process. Once the new system was functional, Graybar hoped to be able to sell detailed reports to both suppliers and customers in the then $73 billion electrical supply industry. Graybar's revenues had increased to $4.1 billion in 2004, $4.3 billion in 2005, and $5 billion in 2006. Today, Graybar operates a network of more than 260 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico as well as authorized agents around the world. Graybar Electric Company, Inc. is engaged in the distribution of electrical, communications and data networking products and the provision of related supply services primarily to electrical and comm/data contractors, industrial plants, federal, state and local governments, commercial users, telephone companies and power utilities in North America. All the products Graybar sells are purchased from others. The products distributed by the company consist primarily of wire and cable, lighting fixtures, power distribution equipment, comm/data products for wide and local area networks, conduit, boxes and fittings, wiring devices, motor controls, industrial automation, lamps, industrial enclosures, tools and test equipment, station apparatus, fuses and transformers. Sales for 2007 were more than $5.25 billion, positioning Graybar at #455 on the Fortune 500 listing and #55 for privately held companies. From January 1 to June 30, 2008, Graybar posted profit of $47.4 million on revenue of $2.7 billion for the six- month period, up from a profit of $39.7 million, on revenue of $2.6 billion for the same period in 2007.

Born 1591 Blois, France Died 28 February 1659 Paris, France Education studied in Leiden Occupation Theologian and biblical scholar Notable Work [https://www.amazon.com/Joannis-Congregationis-Oratorii-Presbyteri- Posthuma/dp/1289691282 Joannis Morini Congrefationis Oratorii Jesu Presbyteri Opera Posthuma] Jean Morin (Latin: Joannes Morinus) (1591 ‚Äì 28 February 1659) was a French theologian and biblical scholar. Life He was born in Blois, to Calvinist parents. He learned Latin and Greek at La Rochelle, and continued his studies in Leiden, subsequently moving to Paris. His conversion to the Catholic Church is ascribed to Cardinal du Perron. In 1618 he joined the congregation of the Oratory, and in due course took priest's orders. In 1625 he visited England in the train of Henrietta Maria; in 1640 he was at Rome, on the invitation of Pope Urban VIII,Edward Grey, The Travels of Pietro Della Valle in India (Hakluyt Society, 1892), p. xlii. who received him with special favor. He was, however, soon recalled to Paris by Richelieu, and the rest of his life was spent in incessant literary labor. Works Genesis 5:18-22 as published by Jean Morin in 1631 in the first publication of the Samaritan Pentateuch The Histoire de la d√©livrance de l'√âglise chr√©tienne par l'empereur Constantin, et de la grandeur et souverainet√© temporelle donn√©e a l'√âglise romaine par les rois de France (1630) gave great offence at Rome, and a Declaration (1654), directed against faults in the administration of the Oratory, was strictly suppressed. Morin is best known for his biblical and critical work. By his editing of the Samaritan Pentateuch and Targum, in the Paris Polyglott, he gave the first impulse in Europe to the study of this dialect, which he acquired without a teacher (framing a grammar for himself) by the study of manuscripts newly brought to Europe. Not unnaturally, he formed a very exaggerated view of the value of the Samaritan tradition of the text (Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum Pentateuchum, 1631). A similar tone of extreme depreciation of the Masoretic Hebrew text, colored by polemical bias against Protestantism, affects his major work, the posthumous Exercitationes biblicae de hebraeici graecique textus sinceritate (1660), in which, following in the footsteps of Cappellus, he brought arguments against the then current theory of the absolute integrity of the Hebrew text and the antiquity of the vowel points.

His coup started a series which culminated in the accession to power of the Labour Party just 3 years later. Biography Rawson was born in Santiago del Estero in 1884 to a San Juan family of American origin. Through his grandfather Juan de Dios Rawson, he was related to Guillermo Rawson. Rawson attended Argentina‚Äôs Military College, which he graduated from in 1905 and subsequently taught at for a time. Rawson rose through the ranks of the Argentine Army and was eventually promoted to general. By 1943, Rawson was the Commanding Officer of Cavalry at Campo de Mayo. On June 3, 1943, Rawson was contacted by members of the GOU (United Officers' Group), a group of military officers planning to overthrow Argentina‚Äôs civilian government. The GOU, lacking the sufficient number of troops needed to successfully implement a coup, knew Rawson could provide the soldiers they required. Rawson, who had been scheming to overthrow the government even before he was contacted by the GOU, agreed to their plan. On June 4, Rawson and 10,000 troops under his command entered Buenos Aires and overthrew the government of Ram√≥n Castillo. This ended the historical period known as the Infamous Decade and started the Revolution of '43. Rawson promptly declared himself president of Argentina the same day, beating Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez to do so.Mendelevich, p. 144 However, his choices for his cabinet alienated the GOU leadership, who forced him to resign on June 7. Rawson, as Castillo, supported the Allies of World War II, but the bulk of the military that organized the coup wanted Argentina to stay neutral in the conflict, considering that joining the war would prove destructive for the country. Colonel Elbio Anaya appeared at his office and told him that he was ruling because of a misunderstanding, as the president was Ram√≠rez. Rawson resigned, and rejected the military escort, leaving the Casa Rosada on a military jeep. His time as president was so brief that he never actually made the Oath of office. Even so, he did not take power as an interim president, but expecting to rule for a long time.Mendelevich, p. 145 Thus, Rawson had the second shortest mandate of any Argentine president, just three days (the first being Federico Pinedo with 12 hours). After resigning as president, Rawson was appointed Ambassador to Brazil, a post he would hold until 1944. He congratulated Ram√≠rez when he broke relations with Germany and Japan.Mendelevich, p. 146 In 1945, Rawson was arrested and brought before a military tribunal for opposing the government of President Edelmiro Farrell, but he was quickly released. In September 1951, Rawson supported General Jos√© Benjam√≠n Men√©ndez‚Äôs failed attempt to overthrow the government of Juan Per√≥n, for which Rawson was temporarily imprisoned. He wrote the book Argentina y Bolivia en la epopeya de la emancipaci√≥n (literally \\"Argentina and Bolivia in the Liberation epic\\"). Rawson died of a heart attack in Buenos Aires in 1952. He is buried at La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

In 1960 it moved to its current location, which had previously been a golf course. Programs offered =Electives= Prince of Wales offers a variety of electives that appeal to student interests, which range from applied skills such as home economics, technical education, and business education, to fine arts (graphic design, photography, art, choir, music). Many students pursue these electives for personal interest, or they choose these courses because they will be studying in this fields for their post-secondary programs. For example, many students take senior level accounting, marketing, and economics courses offered at PW and go on to study Commerce / Business in their post-secondary program. =Mini School Program= Prince of Wales Mini School seeks co-operative, creative, self-motivated and well-rounded students who have demonstrated above average academic achievement and involvement in school and community. The school aims to develop organizational skills, problem-solving techniques, and the ability to work cooperatively and independently in an academically challenging, enriched program requiring effort and self-discipline. An outdoor education component provides physical and emotional challenges, developing skills and contributing to the school community atmosphere. Students develop leadership skills through running school events and fund raising. =TREK Outdoor Education Program= The TREK program is offered for grade 10 students from schools throughout the Vancouver School District with an interest in outdoor activities and environmental education. The program admits 112 students each year, who are get to go on various outdoor trips throughout their school year. The program finishes most of the regular grade 10 academic curriculum while being able to participate in outdoor activities, including both overnight and day trips that teach basic outdoor skills, minimum impact camping, hiking and backpacking, ocean kayaking, canoeing, rock climbing, back-country (telemark) skiing, cross- country (Nordic) skiing, snow shelter building & winter camping, avalanche awareness, cycle touring, outdoor cooking, and map & compass navigation, and in-class focus on sustainability and the environment. =GOLD Program= The Gifted Over Learning Disabled (GOLD) Program is a district program designed for gifted students who have also been identified as having a learning disability. The acceptance rate is very low with an average of only about 8 students per year. Students in the program have at least one GOLD block as part of their regular timetable with GOLD English also being offered at the grade 8 level. The curriculum of the program includes communication skills, decision making, subject and personal support, self-awareness and self- advocacy.

Depicts Europa and Zeus, the latter in the guise of a white bull, trampling sea monsters and miscellaneous sea life. The White Bull (original title in French: Le Taureau Blanc) is a fable and a work of \\"contes philosophiques\\", a philosophical novel, written by the Age of Enlightenment-era philosopher Voltaire. The story is based on the Greek tale of Europa and the bull, where the white bull is in fact the Greek god Zeus. The date the story was written is unknown but it was published between the years 1773 and 1774. Voltaire's work seems to be prophetic in nature because the story was published only fifteen years before the French Revolution, when beheadings became common. Summary =Chapter 1= How the Princess Amasidia met a bull \\\\---- The story takes place in Ancient Egypt where Princess Amasidia, daughter to King Amasis, is walking along the Pelusium Way in the company of Old Mambres, who the king appointed to be in charge of her household. She is deeply saddened as her love has been missing for 7 years and the King has forbidden him. No one in the kingdom is to even speak his name. While walking along the Pelusium Way she encounters many majestic creatures one which is the most beautiful White Bull she has ever seen. As soon as the Bull sees the princess he tries to run towards her as a peculiar old lady tries to restrain the bull. As soon as the Bull reaches princess Amasidia, he throws himself to the ground weeping and kissing her feet. As soon as the princess sees this she offers to purchase the Bull and the bull seems to want to be with the princess, yet the bull cannot speak. Seeing that Amasidia wants the bull, Mambres goes to the old women to try to persuade her to sell the bull. =Chapter 2= How wise Mambres, former sorcerer to the Pharaohs, recognized an old woman, and how she recognized him \\\\---- As Mambres tries to persuade the old lady to sell the bull, she states that the bull is not hers to sell, like the rest of the animals they see there. Then they speak of how they met 700 years ago when Mambres was traveling from Syria to Egypt. The old lady was the noble Pythoness of Endor. The old woman states that even though they are old friends, she cannot satisfy their curiosity about the bull. Amasidia then goes to talk to the woman about buying the bull, yet the old lady still refuses. The lady says you are welcome to see the bull and feed him to your likings but he is never to leave the watch of the other animals and the old lady. They argue and Amasidia asks if he were to escape she would not be able to restrain him, but the old lady says that if he were to do that, the magical serpent might give the bull a venomous bite. As the day turns to night Amasidia knows that she has to return home and leave the bull. =Chapter 3= How the fair Amasidia held secret converse with a handsome serpent \\\\---- The next day Amasidia and Mambres are talking and decide the bull truly is a majestic creature and they start devising a plan to speak with the serpent. Mambres sets up a meeting between the princess and the serpent, and informs her that to get a secret from the serpent she must flatter him. They speak of his past presence as a god, and the serpent informs the princess that she has a certain power over him, the same power which he is to have over others. The serpent then agrees to tell Amasidia the tale of the white bull. The bull used to be a king who fell in love with his dreams as he slept. Wanting to remember them he hired Magi to retell him his dreams and interpret them for him. The Magi failed and the king had them hanged. Then about seven years ago a Jew interpreted his dream, and then suddenly the king turned into the ox he is now. Upon hearing that the ox is her lost love she faints, and Mambres rushes over, thinking she is dead. =Chapter 4= How they wanted to sacrifice the ox and exorcize the Princess \\\\---- The bull saw the princess's ladies rushing to her and did the same dragging the old lady. No one could wake the princess till the bull arrived. Then the princess abruptly awoke. She then showered the bull with kisses and all of the princess's ladies were bewildered. The ladies rushed back to their homes and told different stories to all who would hear. With all the talk of this gossip the king took wind of the story. Upon hearing the story he was filled with anger and sentenced his daughter to be locked in her chamber. Mambres knowing that the bull was the princess's love had to keep it a secret because that man was Nabuchad the one who had dethroned Amasis 7 years prior. The king had hired the Jew to perform the metamorphoses. Mambres then informs the princess that the only metamorphoses that can be changed back is one of an ox. =Chapter 5= How wise Mambres acted wisely \\\\---- Mambres then tries to trick the old lady into giving the ox to him so that he may hide him in one of his country's stables. Mambres then devised a plan to appoint the white bull as the new bull god Apis, and sent four magical animals, a raven, she-ass, dog, and dove to deliver a letter to the High Priest of Memphis, so that the priests could come and worship the new bull. He used tests to see of the animals were trustworthy, and all passed but the raven, who left displeased. Mambres then sent three servants to follow the animals. =Chapter 6= How Mambres met three prophets and gave them a good dinner \\\\---- Upon talking to his servants, they revealed themselves as the three prophets, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah. He then invited them along with the old lady and bull to a great dinner. The white bull was unable to take part in the feast as he was an animal and his identity was unknown to them. He sat angered as the prophet that had imprisoned him, Daniel, and the old lady got to enjoy a feast while he lay in the grass hungry. The dinner continued and the prophets, Mambres, and old lady feasted and drank wine, telling stories. Then the prophets and Mambres walked along the Nile talking into the night. The white bull seeing and opportunity to strike his enemies took it and as he was charging towards the prophets the master of things transformed them into magpies so they were not harmed. =Chapter 7= The King of Tanis arrives. His daughter and the bull are to be sacrificed. \\\\---- As the King arrived he yelled out saying that the bull needed to be tied up and thrown out to the Nile where the whale of Jonas was to eat him, for having placed a spell on his daughter. Mambres knowing that the raven had told the king everything, had the serpent go to Amasidia and reassure her that everything would be okay. Mambres then told the king that the bull needed to stay alive until another suitor had been found for the bull god Apis. The king agreed and gave Mambres one week to find a replacement. The old lady had departed spirits try and scare the king into not sacrificing the bull, but just like Nabuchad he did not remember in the morning. =Chapter 8= How the serpent told stories to the Princess, to comfort her \\\\---- The serpent told stories to Amasidia to calm her, telling her times when he cured serpent bites by just displaying himself on the end of a stick. He told her other inspirational stories and in order that her night might not be filled with grief. =Chapter 9= How the serpent brought her no comfort \\\\---- The princess remarked to the serpent stories by saying they did nothing but bore her. She needed stories that did not resemble dreams. He continued to tell her plausible stories, but she was not entertained. After one tale of love she could not refrain and yelled the name of her lover, Nebuchadnezzar!. Her ladies also yelled the name, and the raven went to inform the king, as it was still an offense to even utter his name. Amasis was enraged again and sent 12 of his evilest men to gather his daughter. =Chapter 10= How they wanted to cut off the Princess's head, and how they did not cut it off \\\\---- As they brought the Princess to Amasis, he re- informed her how by uttering his name you are condemned to death. She told her father to carry out the penalty, but to first allow her to bewail her virginity. He granted her wish and said tomorrow both you and the bull will be killed. Priests arriving due to the letter, and crowds joined from all reaches of the kingdom, all chanting \\"Our ox is dead and done, we'll find ourselves a better one.\\" =Chapter 11= How the princess married her ox \\\\---- The king was surprised by this spectacle, and did not carry out the killing of the bull. The priests had arrived just in time to worship Nebuchad as the new Apis. Mambres then told the king that he should be the first to untie the ox and worship him, and the king obliged. Then Amasis went to kill his daughter as if he didn't he would be sentenced to hell. While preparing for the killing, Amasidia shouted her love for Nebuchad. Upon becoming the new bull god Nebuchad gained the ability to speak and shouted back to Amasidia that he will love her till his death. After this the bull regained his human form in front of the large crowd. Then Nebuchad said, \\"I would rather be Amasidia's lover than a god. I am Nebuchadnezzar, King of Kings.\\" Nebuchad then married Amasidia on the spot and showed mercy to his new father-in-law and let him keep his kingdom of Tanis. He also bestowed foundations to the dove, she-ass, dog, whale, three magpies, and even the raven., showing the whole world that he could pardon as well as conquer. The old lady even received a fat pension. This created a custom that was passed on to all kings, that all can be pardoned after recognizing the error of their ways. Cultural background The story is based on the Greek mythological tale of Europa and the bull, where the white bull is the king of the Greek gods, Zeus, in disguise. Zeus, the sky and thunder god of the Olympic pantheon, often wore a disguise when romantically pursuing mortal women, so as to avoid the eye of his wife and sister, Hera. The stories of the Greek Olympic pantheon would have been well known by the educated people of Voltaire's time. In 1951 an illustrated version was published by the French erotic painter Paul-√âmile B√©cat.

The term is principally used to describe pidgins, creoles, and mixed languages. Relexification is not synonymous with lexical borrowing, by which a language merely supplements its basic vocabulary with loanwords from another language. Language creation and relexification hypothesis Relexification is a form of language interference in which a pidgin, a creole or a mixed language takes nearly all of its lexicon from a superstrate or a target language while its grammar comes from the substrate or source language or, according to universalist theories, arises from universal principles of simplification and grammaticalization. The language from which the lexicon is derived is called the \\"lexifier\\". Michif, Media Lengua, and Lanc-Patu√° creole are mixed languages that arose through relexification., , A hypothesis that all creole languages derive their grammar from the medieval Mediterranean Lingua Franca was widely held in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, but it fell out of favour. It was later argued, for example, because of underlying similarities between Haitian Creole and Fon language that the grammar of Haitian Creole is a substratum that was created when Fon-speaking African slaves relexified their language with French vocabulary. However, the role of relexification in creole genesis is disputed by adherents of generative grammar. , , , and , for example, have argued that the similarities in syntax reflect a hypothetical Universal Grammar, not the workings of relexification processes. Second language acquisition Spontaneous second language acquisition (and the genesis of pidgins) involves the gradual relexification of the native or source language with target-language vocabulary. After relexification is completed, native language structures alternate with structures acquired from the target language. Conlangs and jargon In the context of constructed languages, jargons, and argots, the term is applied to the process of creating a language by substituting new vocabulary into the grammar of an existing language, often one's native language.Wittmann (1989, 1994). While the practice is most often associated with novice constructed language designers, it may also be done as an initial stage towards creating a more sophisticated language. A language thus created is known as a relex. For instance, Lojban began as a relex of Loglan, but the languages' grammars have diverged since then.Section on the term \\"relex\\" in the Conlang Wikibook The same process is at work in the genesis of jargons and argots such as these: * Cal√≥ is a jargon used by Gitanos (Spanish Gypsies) that mixes a Spanish grammar with Romany vocabulary.

Factors such as host susceptibility, genetics and immune function, health care and co-infections as well as viral genetic variability may affect the rate of progression to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS. Rapid progressors A small percentage of HIV-infected individuals rapidly progress to AIDS if they fail to take the medication within four years after primary HIV-infection and are termed Rapid Progressors (RP). Indeed, some individuals have been known to progress to AIDS and death within a year after primo-infection. Rapid progression was originally thought to be continent specific, as some studies reported that disease progression is more rapid in Africa, but others have contested this view. Long term non-progressors Another subset of individuals who are persistently infected with HIV-1, but show no signs of disease progression for over 12 years and remain asymptomatic are classified as Long Term Non-Progressors (LTNP). In these individuals, it seems that HIV- infection has been halted with regard to disease progression over an extended period of time. However, the term LTNP is a misnomer as that progression towards AIDS can occur even after 15 years of stable infection. LTNP are not a homogeneous group regarding both viral load and specific immune responses against HIV-1. Some LTNPs are infected with HIV that inefficiently replicates whilst others are infected with HIV that is virally fit and replicates normally, but the infected individual has had a strong and broad set of HIV- specific humoral and cell-mediated responses that seems to delay the progression to AIDS. In some cohorts, individuals who experience signs of progression, but whose clinical and laboratory parameters remain stable over long periods of time, are classified as Long Term Survivors (LTS). Highly exposed persistently seronegative There is another, smaller percentage of individuals who have been recently identified. These are called Highly Exposed Persistently Seronegative (HEPS). This is a small group of individuals and has been observed only in a group of uninfected HIV-negative sex workers in Kenya and in The Gambia. When these individuals' PBMCs are stimulated with HIV-1 peptides, they have lymphoproliferative activity and have HIV-1 specific CD8+ CTL activity suggesting that transient infection may have occurred. This does not occur in unexposed individuals. What is interesting, is that the CTL epitope specificity differs between HEPS and HIV positive individuals, and in HEPS, the maintenance of responses appears to be dependent upon persistent exposure to HIV. Prediction of progression rates During the initial weeks after HIV infection, qualitative differences in the cell-mediated immune response are observed that correlate with different disease progression rates (i.e., rapid progression to WHO stage 4 and the rapid loss of CD4+ T cell levels versus normal to slow progression to WHO stage 4 and the maintenance of CD4+ T cell counts above 500/¬µl). The appearance of HIV-1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) early after primo-infection has been correlated with the control of HIV-1 viremia. The virus which escapes this CTL response have been found to have mutations in specific CTL epitopes. Individuals with a broad expansion of the V-beta chain of the T cell receptor of CD8+ T cells during primo-infection appear to have low levels of virus six to twelve months later, which is predictive of relatively slow disease progression. In contrast, individuals with an expansion of only a single subset of the V-beta chain of the CD8+ T cells are not able to control HIV levels over time, and thus have high viral loads six to twelve months later. LTNP‚Äôs have also been shown to have a vigorous proliferation of circulating activated HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell and CTL response against multiple epitopes with no detectable broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in the setting of an extremely low viral load. However, a few reports have correlated the presence of antibodies against Tat in LTNP status. HIV subtype variation and effect on progression rates The HIV-1 subtype that an individual becomes infected with can be a major factor in the rate of progression from sero-conversion to AIDS. Individuals infected with subtypes C, D and G are 8 times more likely to develop AIDS than individuals infected with subtype A. In Uganda, where subtypes A and D are most prevalent, subtype D is associated with faster disease progression compared with subtype A. Age has also been shown to be a major factor in determining survival and the rate of disease progression, with individuals over 40 years of age at sero-conversion being associated with rapid progression. Host genetic susceptibility The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released findings that genes influence susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS. HIV enters cells through an interaction with both CD4 and a chemokine receptor of the 7 transmembrane family. They first reviewed the role of genes in encoding chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR2) and chemokines (SDF-1). While CCR5 has multiple variants in its coding region, the deletion of a 32-bp segment results in a nonfunctional receptor, thus preventing HIV entry; two copies of this gene provide strong protection against HIV infection, although the protection is not absolute. This allele is found in around 10% of Europeans but is rare in Africans and Asians. Multiple studies of HIV-infected persons have shown that presence of one copy of this mutation, named CCR5-Œî32 (CCR5 delta 32) delays progression to the condition of AIDS by about 2 years. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has funded research studies to learn more about this genetic mutation. In such research, NIH has found that there exist genetic tests that can determine if a person has this mutation. Implications of a genetic test may in the future allow clinicians to change treatment for the HIV infection according to the genetic makeup of an individual, Currently there exist several at-home tests for the CCR5 mutation in individuals; however, they are not diagnostic tests. A relatively new class of drugs for HIV treatment relies on the genetic makeup of the individual. Entry inhibitors bind to the CCR5 protein to block HIV from binding to the CD4 cell. The effect of co-infections on progression rates Coinfections or immunizations may enhance viral replication by inducing a response and activation of the immune system. This activation facilitates the three key stages of the viral life cycle: entry to the cell; reverse transcription and proviral transcription. Chemokine receptors are vital for the entry of HIV into cells. The expression of these receptors is inducible by immune activation caused through infection or immunization, thus augmenting the number of cells that are able to be infected by HIV-1. Both reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome and the rate of transcription of proviral DNA rely upon the activation state of the cell and are less likely to be successful in quiescent cells. In activated cells there is an increase in the cytoplasmic concentrations of mediators required for reverse transcription of the HIV genome. Activated cells also release IFN-alpha which acts on an autocrine and paracrine loop that up-regulates the levels of physiologically active NF-kappa B which activates host cell genes as well as the HIV-1 LTR. The impact of co- infections by micro-organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be important in disease progression, particularly for those who have a high prevalence of chronic and recurrent acute infections and poor access to medical care. Often, survival depends upon the initial AIDS-defining illness. Co-infection with DNA viruses such as HTLV-1, herpes simplex virus-2, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus may enhance proviral DNA transcription and thus viral load as they may encode proteins that are able to trans-activate the expression of the HIV-1 pro-viral DNA. Frequent exposure to helminth infections, which are endemic in Africa, activates individual immune systems, thereby shifting the cytokine balance away from an initial Th1 cell response against viruses and bacteria which would occur in the uninfected person to a less protective T helper 0/2-type response. HIV-1 also promotes a Th1 to Th0 shift and replicates preferentially in Th2 and Th0 cells. This makes the host more susceptible to and less able to cope with infection with HIV-1, viruses and some types of bacteria. Ironically, exposure to dengue virus seems to slow HIV progression rates temporarily.

Whitney (1939 ‚Äì 8 January 2002) was an American behavioral geneticist and psychologist. He was professor at Florida State University. Beyond his work into the genetics of sensory system function in mice, in his later life he supported David Duke as well as research into race and intelligence and eugenics. Biography Whitney was born in Montana and grew up in Minnesota. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota, as well as his doctorate from there in 1966. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force and served until 1969. He subsequently worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics (University of Colorado at Boulder), under Gerald McClearn and John C. DeFries. In 1970, Whitney was hired by Florida State University to represent behavioral genetics in the psychobiology program, where he stayed until his death at the age of 62 on January 8, 2002, after contracting a severe cold that aggravated emphysema. He considered himself to be a \\"Hubert Humphrey liberal.\\"Whitney, Glayde. Foreword, in:  Academic work  Whitney was the author of over 60 papers on the genetics of taste sensitivity in inbred mice. Support for some of this work came from a Claude Pepper Award for Research Excellence from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and in 1994 he received the Manheimer Lectureship Award from the Monell Chemical Senses Center, which recognizes career achievements of individuals in the chemosensory sciences. He was the president of the Behavior Genetics Association from 1994 to 1995. By 1999, Whitney has shifted from studying mice to researching race and intelligence in humans. As part of this research, Whitney was supported by the Pioneer Fund, which has ties to scientific racism.  Political views  Whitney was a frequent contributor to magazines such as Mankind Quarterly, The g Factor Newsletter and The William McDougall Newsletter (named after eugenicist psychologist William McDougall). While outgoing president of the Behavior Genetics Association in 1995, some members of this group demanded his resignation after his presidential address suggested the need to investigate the possibility of genetic factors behind the high incidence of black crime in America.Secretary's Report on The 25th Annual Meeting of the Behavior Genetics Association, Richmond, Virginia Whitney wrote the foreword for My Awakening (1998), an autobiography by David Duke, a white nationalist politician and former National Director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. In the book, Duke uses scientific racism to push for the re-segregation of schools. Whitney did not specifically endorse Duke's re-segregation plan, but described Duke as \\"a Moses-like prophet\\". Whitney compared Duke to Socrates, Galileo, and Newton and said the NAACP and other \\"front organisations\\" had been created to further Jewish interests. Whitney said in a 1999 interview that the controversy distracted from what was meant to be a scientific discussion, saying \\"races are different for many genetic systems that influence everything from behavior and psychology to physiology, medicine and sports [...] Screaming nasty words does not change the reality.\\" Following the publication of the book, faculty and students of FSU condemned Whitney's comments, with some calling for his resignation. The school rejected Whitney's position, but defended his right to teach as a matter of academic freedom. Whitney's views regarding race and intelligence prompted the Florida Senate to pass Resolution 2742 in 1999, \\"condemning the racism and bigotry espoused by Florida State University Professor Glayde Whitney.\\" Whitney acknowledged the scientific achievements of Jews, but accused \\"organized Jewry\\" of playing a prominent role in suppressing race behavioral genetics in response to racism directed toward them, resulting in a \\"dishonest and hypocritical version of egalitarianism.\\" Whitney was a member of the Institute for Historical Review, an organization promoting Holocaust denial, making a case that Jews invented the Holocaust creating a \\"fake\\" for their own interests.

Early history The castle was founded around 1080 by Hartnidus of Ort, and improvements continued to be made into the thirteenth century - for example by Hartnidus V in 1244. In 1344 the brothers Friedrich and Reinprecht I of Wallsee purchased the castle, which became Friedrich‚Äôs sole possession on January 25, 1350. The castle remained in the possession of the Wallsee family until 1483, when Schloss Ort passed to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. 1484‚Äì1689 Schloss Ort as drawn in 1594 From 1484 to 1491, the castle was governed by Gotthard von Starhenberg, the Governor of Upper Austria. In 1492, Bernhard of Starhenberg and later his descendants ruled the castle until 1584. In 1588, the castle was purchased by Weikhard Freiherr of Pollheim, but he sold the castle on April 6, 1595 to the city of Gmunden. However, Gmunden sold the castle to Rudolf II that same year. The castle then passed to other owners before finally being acquired by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor.

The show was presented by British writer/comedian Danny Wallace and followed his quest to start his own country in his flat in Bow, London. The micronation he created was eventually named \\"Lovely\\". The series was released on DVD in the UK on 18 June 2007, having been postponed from October 2005. Episodes =\\"Birth of a Nation\\"= Danny investigates territory for his new country, starting by visiting Sealand. He also meets Erwin Strauss and the man who owns the Moon. He \\"invades\\" Eel Pie Island but leaves after the police are called. He makes friends with a General of the British Army. He eventually decides upon the area of his flat as the territory and makes a declaration of independence, which he gives to Tony Blair. =\\"Citizens Required\\"= With the help of an advertising agency, Wallace chooses a design for the flag of his country. He records a national anthem, which is played during his interview on Iain Lee's LBC show. =\\"For King and Country\\"= Danny Wallace meets the SAS (Second Amendment Sisters) and meets the King of Fusa. He also goes to the Principality of Seborga. =\\"State of a Nation\\"= Wallace visits two very different 'utopian' communities, the planned town of Celebration which maintains its pleasantness through strict rules and regulations, and the anarchic self-governing neighborhood of Christiania. He also speaks to a Catholic Cardinal about the role of religion in society and to Sheriff Joe Arpaio about law and order. A sombre visit to death row and an interview with the death row chief John George leads him to decide against the death penalty in his country. =\\"The Bank of Danny\\"= When he struggles to pay his electricity bill, Wallace begins to kick-start his country's economy. He investigates the National Debt, with advice from former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. He designs his own currency, the IOU (Interdependent Occupational Unit), which he shows to Andrew Bailey, the Chief Cashier at the Bank of England. He also discovers the Principality of New Utopia and interviews the UK Pro Consul, Tony Nicodemous. He applies for international aid, and fails, due to the wealth of his citizens. =\\"The United Nations\\"= Wallace attempts to enter the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens with a song called \\"Stop the Muggin', Start the Huggin'\\". In an attempt to officially become a country, he travels to New York to try to win the support of the United Nations. The lack of a territory lets him down. This final episode ends with a gathering of citizens in Leicester Square, where Wallace reveals that the country is to be called \\"Lovely.\\" Citizen TV A show called Citizen TV, also presented by Danny Wallace, was shown to digital viewers after each episode, giving news and discussions about the country. Kingdom of Lovely Wallace named his micronation the Kingdom of Lovely. Like several other micronations it is a partly Internet-based project that claims a small amount of territory. Wallace proclaimed himself King and, at its peak, 58,165 \\"citizens\\" were registered on the micronation's website citizensrequired.com. This site is no longer active. The sole official territory of Lovely was Wallace's flat in Bow, East London, but citizens of Lovely were invited to declare a room, or some other building or land belonging to them, to be an embassy for the country by taking a photograph displaying Lovely's flag there. The show depicted Wallace attempting to acquire various accoutrements of statehood for his fledgling nation. These included: * The country's name. Wallace solicited ideas online and put his two favourites \\"Home\\" and \\"Lovely\\" to a vote. * A national holiday: \\"Lovely Day\\" on 2 September, celebrating the nation's naming. * A flag featuring a blue stripe and a red stripe at erratic angles on a white background. * A pixellated coat of arms to reflect the internet-based nature of the micronation * A Latin motto: Die dulci freure (sic - the correct Latin is fruere), meaning \\"Have a nice day\\". * A national anthem performed by Banks & Wag. When the owners of a private island in Ireland rejected Lovely's currency (The \\"Interdependent Occupational Unit (IOU)\\") as a basis for sale, Wallace tried to start his nation by \\"invading\\" Eel Pie Island in London with the help of his friend Jon Bond, now Lovely's Minister of Defence. Bond was chosen for the role having once worked as a security guard at Tesco, making him the closest thing Wallace had to an army. However, the Metropolitan Police were contacted by local people, and Wallace was forced to call off the \\"invasion\\". After speaking to a number of people including the leaders of Sealand and Dennis Hope, who claims to own the moon, Wallace declared his flat to be a sovereign nation on 1 January 2005 and he set about populating the micronation and recording the television series. Other notable interviewees included democracy advocate Noam Chomsky, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, Giorgio Carbone, Prince of Seborga and Erwin Strauss, author of the guidebook How to Start Your Own Country. During the broadcasting run of How to Start Your Own Country, additional material was broadcast to digital TV viewers after each episode. This took the style of a national broadcast named Citizen TV. It was presented live by Danny Wallace and featured news, a special guest (usually a member of Wallace's government) and conversations with \\"citizens\\" who had called in. An early political change occurred when Wallace fired his first foreign minister live on air and appointed citizen Kieran Collins in his place. Wallace attempted to submit a song of his own composition, Stop The Mugging, Start The Hugging, as the Lovely entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The contest's scrutineer, Svante Stockselius, met with Wallace and was sympathetic to his cause but informed him that Lovely could not enter the Contest as it has no national television or radio station of its own and therefore could not join the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Wallace then submitted his song to the BBC (which is an EBU member which supports the UK entry to the contest), in an attempt to receive their backing -- their judges, however, were unimpressed. The series also showed Wallace's attempts to gain official recognition for Lovely at the United Nations, which was established to be the true mark of statehood. These efforts were unsuccessful, largely because of Lovely's lack of independent territory, Wallace's own flat being within the UK. Despite all this, Wallace appeared before his citizens in full regal attire in the final episode, declaring that their new country now had more citizens than seven internationally recognized countries, including Vatican City, Monaco and Liechtenstein. The archives of the Guardian Angel, Lovely's longest running newspaper, cover many events in the country's subsequent history between September 2005 and September 2007.

Early life Mastani was born to Maharaja Chhatrasal, a Rajput king, and his wife Ruhaani Bai Begum.Her father was the founder of the Panna State. She and her father were followers of the Pranami Sampradaya, a Hindu sect based on the Bhakti worship of Sri Krishna. Biography Peshwa Bajirao I = Marriage with Bajirao I = In 1728, Muhammad Khan Bangash invaded Chhatrasal's kingdom, defeated him and besieged his capital. Chhatrasal secretly wrote to Bajirao requesting his help. But being occupied in a military campaign in Malwa Bajirao did not respond until 1729 when he marched on towards Bundelkhand. Ultimately Bajirao defeated Bangash after reaching Jaitpur near Kulpahar in present Uttar Pradesh. In gratitude, Chattrasal gave Bajirao the hand of his daughter Mastani, dominion over Jhansi, Sagar and Kalpi - amounting to a third of his kingdom. After his marriage to Mastani, he also gifted Bajirao with 33 lakh gold coins and a gold mine. At the time, Bajirao was already married and monogamous by both nature and family tradition. He, however, accepted out of regard for Chattrasal. Back in Pune, the marriage was not generally accepted because Mastani's Muslim heritage. Mastani lived for some time with Bajirao at his palace of Shaniwar Wada in the city of Pune. The palace's north-east corner held Mastani Mahal and had its own external doorway called Mastani Darwaza. Because of his family's intolerance of Mastani, Bajirao later built a separate residence for Mastani at Kothrud in 1734,Rajakelkar Museum accessed 3 March 2008 some distance away from Shaniwar Wada. The site still exists at the Mrutyunjay temple on Karve road. The palace at Kothrud was dismantled and parts of this are displayed at a special section of Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum.Tribure India accessed 3 March 2008 = Shamsher Bahadur (Krishna Rao) = Mastani bore a son who was named Krishna Rao at birth, within a few months of Bajirao's first wife Kashibai delivering a son. But being born of a half-Muslim mother, the priests refused to conduct the Hindu upanayana ceremony for Krishna Rao. The boy was eventually named Shamsher Bahadur and brought up as a Muslim. After the closely following deaths of Bajirao and Mastani in 1740, Kashibai took the 6 year-old Shamsher Bahadur under her care and raised him as one of her own. Shamsher was bestowed upon a portion of his father‚Äôs dominion of Banda and Kalpi. In 1761, he and his army contingent fought alongside the Peshwa in the Third Battle of Panipat between the Marathas and Afghans. He was wounded in that battle and died a few days later at Deeg. Death Mastani died in 1740, shortly after Bajirao's death. Her cause of death is still unknown. Mastani was buried in the village of Pabal. Given her association with both Hinduism and Islam, her grave is called both Mastani's samadhi and Mastani's mazar. Descendants Shamsher Bahadur's son Nawab Ali Bahadur I was given the Rajputana provinces that came in Mastani's dowry - Jhansi, Sagar and Kalpi. In 1858, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 his son Nawab Ali Bahadur II responded to a rakhi from Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi and fought against the British.Shamsher's successor Ali Bahadur (Krishna Singh) established his authority over large parts of Bundelkhand and became the Nawab of Banda. The descendant of Shamsher Bahadur continued their allegiance to baihi bai fought the English in the Anglo-Maratha War of 1803. His descendant, Ali Bahadur fought alongside with Rani Lakshmibai in First War of Indian Independence of 1857. His descendants were known as Nawabs of Banda.

Early life and education Joseph was born in Beckley, West Virginia, in 1921, the son of Lebanese immigrants.Mercury Insurance website: \\"George Joseph: Portrait of the American Dream\\" retrieved August 11, 2013 His father worked as a coal miner and as a storekeeper. He served as a B-17 navigator in World War II, serving in some 50 missions. In 1949, he earned a degree in Physics and Mathematics from Harvard University in 3 years on the GI Bill. Career After he graduated, he took a job with the Occidental Life Insurance Company in Los Angeles as a systems analyst. In the evenings, he sold life insurance door-to-door. Noting that many of his customers would inquire about other lines of insurance (auto, property) in addition to life, Joseph proposed for Occidental to expand its offerings. After being rebuffed in 1954, he left Occidental and started his own insurance agency in California that bundled the life insurance policies he was already selling with property and casualty insurance and automobile insurance policies. At the time, the automobile insurance industry was not flexible, with all drivers paying the same rate, regardless of their driving record or experience. Noting that, Joseph founded Mercury Insurance in 1962. Mercury offered auto insurance policies with differing rates, based on a driver's record and experience, a first in the industry. Now in its fiftieth year, Mercury employs 4,000 agents and has $4 billion in assets. Joseph remains actively involved in the operations of Mercury Insurance as the Chairman of the Board, but the CEO of the company is now Gabe Tirador. Political activities Joseph was active in the opposition to California Proposition 103 which regulated providers of insurance to individuals in California.

This type is sometimes referred to as a thrust bridge. The bridge is retracted to the right Borden Avenue Bridge, Long Island City Retractable bridges date back to medieval times. Due to the large dedicated area required for this type of bridge, this design is not common. A retractable design may be considered when the maximum horizontal clearance is required (for example, over a canal). Two remaining examples exist in New York City: the Carroll Street Bridge (built 1889) in Brooklyn, and the Borden Avenue Bridge in Queens. A recent example can be found at Queen Alexandra Dock in Cardiff, Wales, where the bridge is jacked upwards before being rolled on wheels. Helix Bridge at Paddington Basin in London is a more unusual example of the type, consisting of a glass shell supported in a helical steel frame, which rotates as it retracts. The Summer Street Bridge over Fort Point Channel in Boston is a variant type called a retractile bridge. This bridge is oriented northwest‚Äìsoutheast, with the northwest-bound lanes of traffic retracting diagonally to the north, and the southeast-bound lanes retracting diagonally to the west. Some retractable bridges are also floating bridges, such as the Hood Canal Bridge. Two other floating bridges in Washington state used to have retractable spans but were replaced with new floating bridges without retractable spans: the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (replaced in 2016) and Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge (replaced after it accidentally sank in 1990). This design is popular in Guyana, which has the Demerara Harbour Bridge and the Berbice Bridge. Historical examples of designs for retractable bridges include those by Leonardo da Vinci and Agostino Ramelli. In the Netherlands, especially in the province of North Holland, a vlotbrug is a design of retractable bridge across a canal in which the roadway floats and can be retracted under fixed structures on the canal banks.

Born in the Netherlands, he moved to Italy and lived there before moving to the United States in 1939, where he worked as an art director for several advertising agencies, and then for Fortune magazine. He returned to Italy in 1962 and started writing and illustrating children's books. In 1962 his book Inch by Inch was awarded the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. Family Lionni was born in Amsterdam but spent two years in Philadelphia before moving to Italy during his teens. His father worked as an accountant and his mother was an opera singer. His father was assigned to an office in Italy part way through Leo's time in high school. He married Nora Maffi, the daughter of Fabrizio Maffi, a founder of the Italian Communist Party, and they had two sons, Louis and Paolo, grandchildren Pippo and Annie and Sylvan, and great-grandchildren Madeline, Luca, Sam, Nick, Alix, Henry and Theo. Leo Lionni died October 11, 1999, at his home in Tuscany, Italy, at the age of 89. Career From 1931 to 1939 he was a well-known and respected painter in Italy, where he worked in the Futurism and avant-garde styles. In 1935 he received a degree in economics from the University of Genoa. During the later part of this period, Lionni devoted himself more and more to advertising design. In 1939 he moved to Philadelphia and began full-time work in advertising, at which he was extremely successful, acquiring accounts from Ford Motors and Chrysler Plymouth, among others. He commissioned art from Saul Steinberg, the then neophyte Andy Warhol, Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, and Fernand L√©ger. He was a member of the Advertising Art Hall of Fame. In 1948 he accepted a position as art director for Fortune, which he held until 1960. He also maintained outside clients, designing The Family of Man catalogue design for the Museum of Modern Art, and was design director for Olivetti, for whom he produced ads, brochures and showroom design. In 1960 he moved back to Italy, and began his career as a children's book author and illustrator. Lionni produced more than 40 children's books. He received the 1984 American Institute of Graphic Arts (A.I.G.A.) Gold Medal and was a four- time Caldecott Honor Winner‚Äîfor Inch by Inch (1961), Swimmy (1964), Frederick (1968), and Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse (1970). He also won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1965. Over the course of his career, Lionni also held several teaching posts, beginning in 1946, when he taught advertising art at Black Mountain College. He also taught at Parsons School of Design in 1954; the Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India, in 1967; the University of Illinois in 1967; and Cooper Union from 1982 to 1985. Lionni always thought of himself as an artist. He worked in many disciplines including, especially, drawing, painting, sculpture and photography. He had one-man shows in the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. He continued to work as an artist until just before his death in 1999. Children's author and illustrator Lionni became the first children's author/illustrator to use collage as the main medium for his illustrations. Reviewers such as Booklist and School Library Journal have said that Lionni's illustrations are \\"bold, sumptuous collages\\" that include \\"playful patches of color\\" and that his \\"beautifully simple [and] boldly graphic art [is] perfect to share with very young children.\\" Book World said that \\"the translucent color of the pictures and the simplicity of the text make a perfect combination.\\" Many of Lionni's books deal with issues of community and creativity, and the existential condition, rendered as fables which appealed to children. He participated in workshops with children and even after his death school children continue to honor him by making their own versions of his books. Leo Lionni would usually draw pictures as he told stories to his grandchildren, but one time he found himself on a long train ride with no drawing materials. Instead, he tore out circles of yellow and blue from a magazine to help him tell the story he had in mind. This experience led him to create his first book for children, Little Blue and Little Yellow (1959). Lionni uses earth tones in his illustrations that are close to the actual colors of the objects found in nature. In his book Inch by Inch, for example, he uses realistic shades of brown and burnt orange in his collage of a robin, while the tree branches are shades of brown with dark green leaves. Mice are consistently found as characters in Lionni's books, such as the star character in Frederick and the title character in the Caldecott Honor Book Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse. Lionni's illustrations have been compared to those of Eric Carle as both often employ animals, birds, insects, and other creatures to tell a story about what it is to be human. Parallel Botany Among Lionni's books that were not intended for children, the best known is probably Parallel Botany (1978; first published in Italian as La botanica parallela, 1976). This detailed treatise on plants that lack materiality‚Äîin other words, imaginary plants‚Äîis richly illustrated with drawings of plants in charcoal or pencil and photographs of \\"parallel botanists\\". The text is a rich mix of plant descriptions, travel tales, \\"ancient\\" myths, and folk etymologies, leavened with historical facts and grounded in actual science. As an imaginary taxonomy, it is invoked by Italo Calvino as a precursor to the Codex Seraphinianus of Luigi Serafini.

He was born at the New Palace in Potsdam, Germany, in 1864 and known as \\"Sigi\\" to his family. His mother found him much more intelligent than his three elder siblings and believed he would have great potential when he grew up. However, he died from meningitis at the New Palace on 18 June 1866, aged twenty-one months. He was buried in the royal mausoleum of the Friedenskirche at Potsdam. His mother's grief and despair were intense as his father, leading the Prussian army into battle against Austria, had taken all available doctors thus making it impossible for her to alleviate the suffering of her child or prevent his death, the memory of which would haunt her for the rest of her life.

These have been translated as \\"Sort\\", \\"Set In order\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"Standardize\\" and \\"Sustain\\". The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision- making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work. In some quarters, 5S has become 6S, the sixth element being safety(Safe).Gapp, R., Fisher, R., Kobayashi, K. 2008. Implementing 5S within a Japanese Context: An Integrated Management System, Management Decision. 46(4): 565-579. Other than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as visual control,Ortiz, Chris A. and Park, Murry. 2010.

Under those (and similar) terminologies, Western companies were applying underlying concepts of 5S before publication, in English, of the formal 5S methodology. For example, a workplace-organization photo from Tennant Company (a Minneapolis-based manufacturer) quite similar to the one accompanying this article appeared in a manufacturing-management book in 1986.Schonberger, Richard J. 1986. World Class Manufacturing: The Lessons of Simplicity Applied. New York: Free Press, p. 27.  Origins  The scheme \\"Correct Arrangement of the Tool\\" from a USSR Central Institute of Labour instruction sheet, 1920-1924. 5S was developed in Japan and was identified as one of the techniques that enabled Just in Time manufacturing.Hirano, Hiroyuki. 1988. JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future. Two major frameworks for understanding and applying 5S to business environments have arisen, one proposed by Osada, the other by Hiroyuki Hirano. Hirano provided a structure to improve programs with a series of identifiable steps, each building on its predecessor. As noted by John Bicheno, Toyota's adoption of the Hirano approach was '4S', with Seiton and Seiso combined. Before this Japanese management framework, a similar \\"scientific management\\" was proposed by Alexey Gastev and the USSR Central Institute of Labour (CIT) in Moscow.Managing ¬´modernity¬ª: work, community, and authority in late- industrializing Japan and Russia, Rudra Sil, Publisher: Ann Arbor, Mich. : University of Michigan Press, 2002  Each S  There are five 5S phases. They can be translated to English as \\"sort\\", \\"set in order\\", \\"shine\\", \\"standardize\\", and \\"sustain\\". Other translations are possible. =Sort (seiri Êï¥ÁêÜ)= 1S ‚Äì a red tag area containing items waiting for removal. Seiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all unnecessary items from the location. Goals: * Reduce time loss looking for an item by reducing the number of unnecessary items. * Reduce the chance of distraction by unnecessary items. * Simplify inspection. * Increase the amount of available, useful space. * Increase safety by eliminating obstacles. Implementation: * Check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their presence at the location is useful or necessary. * Remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a 'red tag area' so that they are easy to remove later on. * Keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in use for production. =Set in order (seiton Êï¥È†ì)= 2S ‚Äì simple floor marking. (Sometimes shown as Straighten) Seiton is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for fulfilling their function in the workplace. Goal: * Make the workflow smooth and easy. Implementation: * Arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling / equipment is in close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted to the work performed. Place components according to their uses, with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace. * Arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items. * Assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is easy to spot missing items. =Shine (seiso Ê∏ÖÊéÉ)= 3S ‚Äì cleanliness point with cleaning tools and resources. Seiso is sweeping or cleaning and inspecting the workplace, tools and machinery on a regular basis. Goals: * Improves the production process efficiency and safety, reduces waste, prevents errors and defects. * Keep the workplace safe and easy to work in. * Keep the workplace clean and pleasing to work in. * When in place, anyone not familiar to the environment must be able to detect any problems within 50 feet in 5 sec. Implementation: * Clean the workplace and equipment on a daily basis, or at another appropriate (high frequency) cleaning interval. * Inspect the workplace and equipment while cleaning. =Standardize (seiketsu Ê∏ÖÊΩî)= Seiketsu is to standardize the processes used to sort, order and clean the workplace. Goal: * Establish procedures and schedules to ensure the repetition of the first three ‚ÄòS‚Äô practices. Implementation: * Develop a work structure that will support the new practices and make it part of the daily routine. * Ensure everyone knows their responsibilities of performing the sorting, organizing and cleaning. * Use photos and visual controls to help keep everything as it should be. * Review the status of 5S implementation regularly using audit checklists. =Sustain/self-discipline (shitsuke „Åó„Å§„Åë)= Shadow Board (with tools' outline) and worker's movement that is being used in Production floor Shitsuke or sustain is the developed processes by self- discipline of the workers. Also translates as \\"do without being told\\". Goal: * Ensure that the 5S approach is followed. Implementation: * Organize training sessions. * Perform regular audits to ensure that all defined standards are being implemented and followed. * Implement improvements whenever possible. Worker inputs can be very valuable for identifying improvements. * When issues arise, identify their cause and implement the changes necessary to avoid recurrence.  Variety of applications  5S methodology has expanded from manufacturing and is now being applied to a wide variety of industries including health care, education, and government. Visual management and 5S can be particularly beneficial in health care because a frantic search for supplies to treat an in-trouble patient (a chronic problem in health care) can have dire consequences.Graban, Mark. 2012. Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement. Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press. Although the origins of the 5S methodology are in manufacturing, it can also be applied to knowledge economy work, with information, software, or media in the place of physical product.  In lean product and process development  The output of engineering and design in a lean enterprise is information, the theory behind using 5S here is \\"Dirty, cluttered, or damaged surfaces attract the eye, which spends a fraction of a second trying to pull useful information from them every time we glance past. Old equipment hides the new equipment from the eye and forces people to ask which to use\\".

She is known for her single \\"What's in It for Me\\". The song was a 2005 hit in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. It was the most-played song in Poland that year; it remained in the top ten for four months. She has released six studio albums and performed on television as a singer, actress and hostess. To date, her biggest hits have been \\"What's in It For Me\\", \\"Welcome To The City\\", \\"Don't Cry Your Heart Out\\", \\"It Can Only Get Better\\", \\"Stay My Baby\\", \\"Is It Love\\", \\"Up\\" and \\"Thank You\\". She is also the youngest person in Sweden to have released a greatest hits album. Biography =Early life= Deasismont was born in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden as Amy Linn√©a Deasismont, the second child of an English father, Lee, and a Swedish mother, Chrisbeth. When she was ten months old, the family moved to England. The family moved back to Sweden when she was four-and-a-half years old, this time to J√∂nk√∂ping. She has an older sister, Danielle; three younger sisters Lisa, Holly, and Lily; and a younger brother, Charlie. Deasismont started figure skating at age six and won multiple gold medals. She practiced six times a week before embarking on her singing career.News report on Swedish TV4. 17 February 2005. She went to a dance and theater school called Blandgodis, and participated in theater and TV productions which gave her experience in public performing. She also appeared in a small television role on the show De drabbade. Deasismont has loved singing since she was one year old.Interview in Bettina S. talk show on 6 March 2006, Finnish FST. One of her first public performances was at the age seven on the talent show Sm√•stj√§rnorna. She dressed as Belinda Carlisle and lip synced to \\"Heaven is a Place on Earth\\", finishing third in the competition.Sm√•stj√§rnorna, Swedish TV4 (2000). In 2004, she participated in talent competitions such as Minimelodifestivalen in J√∂nk√∂ping and Swedish TV4's Super Troupers, winning most of them. On Mix Megapol Summer Idol she won the main prize: to record a song in a real studio. During recording, she was offered a commercial recording contract.Fan chat with Amy Diamond on 4 February 2007. Soon after, she recorded her debut single \\"What's in It for Me\\". Markus Sepehrmanesh, one of the songwriters for her albums, said in an interview that she sang perfectly. \\"What's in It for Me\\" was recorded in ninety minutes and the single was released the following February. =Success as a singer= \\"What's in It for Me\\" was a commercial success, although some Swedish TV stations refused to show the music video, arguing that Deasismont was too young (turned 13 soon after the release) for the song's theme about romantic relationships. Deasismont, though, didn't see the theme as a romantic relationship ‚Äì in her eyes it was relationships between friends. Nevertheless, the song received extensive radio airplay while she simultaneously went on tour with Elin Lanto. \\"What's in It for Me\\" reached number one on the Swedish singles chart in March and eventually went platinum. Before long, she appeared on Swedish TV4 and used her artist name for the first time. Although she sang to a pre-recorded backing track in the studio, on the program she sang her single and Alicia Keys' song \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" while accompanied by a live band. The band included a drummer, guitarist, bassist, background singer and a keyboard player, who also sang backgrounds.Television show Nyhetsmorgon, Swedish TV4, 16 February 2005. Amy Diamond giving autographs in Kalmar, Sweden in 2005 Due to the success of the single, a full album was commissioned, and This Is Me Now was released in May 2005. The album sold more than 150,000 copies, which was triple the requirement for gold record certification in Sweden at the time. The success led to television appearances, such as on the weekly chart show Trackslistan and on the children's competition show Vi i femman. By the end of 2005, she had appeared live on more than 20 television shows. A concert tour in Sweden was organized for her in the summer, and some of the shows were also televised. Although Deasismont's fans are typically school children, the album cannot be described as children's music.ARBETARBLADET ‚Äì P√• G√•ng/N√∂je The style of This Is Me Now is mainly happy pop music with synthesizer backgrounds, but it includes the theme song \\"Tomorrow\\" from the musical Annie and a live recording of the song \\"If I Ain't Got You\\". The songs in the album were made by the producer team Tysper (Tommy Tysper), Mack (Marcus Sepehrmanesh) and Grizzly (Gustav Jonsson), who are all from Stockholm. They form the core of the production company TEN Production and have produced successful pop tracks before working with Deasismont. Other Ten Production songs seeing popularity were performed by the A Teens and Helena Paparizou. Deasismont's albums were published through Bonnier Amigo Music Group. Amy Diamond in Rangsby (Finland) on 14 July 2007 Deasismont is a talented live singer and doesn't lip sync in her public performances. Her debut album included a live version of Alicia Keys' \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", which was described in a review as \\"sweet and impressive at the same time\\". She reached the finals in Super Troupers, where she reached the final by singing Shakira's \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\". She was 12 years old. A review in Svenska Dagbladet described her voice as fine and secure, and her record label advertised it as \\"shining and characteristic\\". =Outside Sweden= Deasismont signed a distribution deal with Warner in July in order to promote the album internationally. She never appeared with her band again, instead performing with a background track and dancers. The album became popular also in other Nordic countries and Poland during the following summer. \\"What's in It for Me\\" was heard frequently on the radio, becoming the 19th most played song of 2005 in Finland and 16th best songs of 2005 in Poland. More singles from the albums \\"Welcome to the City\\" and \\"Champion\\" were released in the summer. A special edition of the album was released for the Central European market. It contained two previously-unreleased songs which would later appear on Still Me Still Now. She was sent on a promotional tour throughout Central Europe in late 2005. Her record deal allowed the whole family to travel with her whenever the concerts were abroad. She performed on television in Germany, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania and the Netherlands. Deasismont was nominated for several awards in 2005. At 13, she was the youngest person in history to receive the Nordic Music Award for the best Nordic hit \\"What's in It for Me\\".Nordic Music Awards 2005 on Danish TV2. Further, she is the youngest artist to receive two simultaneous NRJ Radio Awards and the youngest to be nominated for the Swedish Grammy Awards.

He gained a wider reputation when he won a 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography,Michael Anderson, \\"R. W. B. Lewis, Biographer and Critic, Is Dead at 84\\", The New York Times, June 15, 2002. the first National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction, and a Bancroft Prize for his biography of Edith Wharton. The New York Times called the book \\"a beautifully wrought, rounded portrait of the whole woman, including the part of her that remained in shade during her life\\" and said that the \\"expansive, elegant biography ... can stand as literature, if nothing else.\\" He was the Neil Gray Professor of English and American Studies at Yale University, where he taught from 1959 until his retirement in 1988; from 1966 to 1972, he was master of Yale's Calhoun College. From 1954 to 1959 he taught at Rutgers‚ÄìNewark. In 1988 Lewis received a Litt.D. from Bates College. A member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, Lewis received its Gold Medal for Biography in 2000. Lewis is generally considered one of the founders of the academic field of American Studies. His interests ranged from criticism of American and European writers to biography and artistic criticism. Lewis' career as critic involved him in the lives of many influential American and European thinkers and writers. Lewis received his doctoral degree from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Norman Maclean, author of the novel A River Runs Through It and Other Stories. He and his wife and sometime co-author Nancy later became close friends with Southern writer Robert Penn Warren. Lewis' first major work The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century (1955) explored De Cr√®vecoeur's idea of the American as a \\"new man\\" - an innocent Adam in a bright new world dissociating himself from the historic past. Lewis portrayed this preoccupation as a pervasive, transforming ingredient of the American mind that shaped the consciousness of lesser thinkers as fully as it shaped the giants of the age. The book traces the Adamic theme in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Henry James and others, and in his epilogue Lewis exposes its continuing spirit in the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, J. D. Salinger, and Saul Bellow. Life and career Lewis was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Beatrix Elizabeth (Baldwin) and Leicester Crosby Lewis, an Episcopal minister.https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/lewis- richard-warrington-baldwin-1917 After preparing at Episcopal Academy and Phillips Exeter Academy, he earned his B.A. in 1939 at Harvard University and his M.A. in 1941 at the University of Chicago, where he also received a Ph.D. degree in 1954.www.yale.edu In the meantime he volunteered for war service in 1942, enlisting as a private in the U.S. Air Force and becoming a second lieutenant, serving in the Middle East, North Africa, and Italy, commanding a unit in Tuscany, Italy,serving in the British-U.S. intelligence service known as \\"M.I. X\\" and receiving the Legion of Merit Award in 1944 for service behind enemy lines, After the war, he continued as a commanding officer of the Northern Italy War Crimes Investigation Team and was discharged from service in 1946 with the rank of major. After returning from the war Lewis pursued his fascination with world literature, which was already awakened by his Harvard teachers. He also developed a lifelong fascination and love for Italy after visiting as a child, and serving there in the war. He and his wife Nancy visited there regularly for much of their lives, and Lewis later wrote a book on the city of Florence. Lewis taught at Bennington College 1948-1950, and was dean of studies at the Salzburg Seminar in Austria 1950-1951. He was a visiting lecturer at Smith College 1951-1952 and a resident fellow at Princeton University in 1952-1954, then joined the faculty at Rutgers University as a professor of English until his Yale University appointment in 1959. In 1977 he was appointed the Neil Gray, Jr. Professor of English and American Studies, reflecting his abiding interest in American literature and American cultural life. =Honors= Lewis received numerous honors for his research and contributions, including a grant for literary achievement from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, plus honorary degrees from several universities. He was invited to serve on both the National Book Award jury for fiction, on which he was charged with selecting the best novel of 1964, and on the 1977 jury for biography and autobiography. In 1988 he was one of 14 scholars chosen to advise the National Endowment for the Humanities on the state of American culture.www.yale.edu While teaching at Yale, Lewis lived in a house in Bethany, Connecticut. He worked in an octagonally-shaped writing studio situated in a ravine about 30 feet from his house. A railed walkway connected the house to the studio, which was built by Nancy Lewis' brother-in-law Isham McConnell, who studied under the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Lewis continued to write his books on a typewriter into his later years. Bookshelves lined the walls of Lewis' office, with each section containing works from Lewis' various areas of research: the James' family, Edith Wharton, Dante and Italy, American literature, etc. In 2006 the Yale College Writing Center was endowed with a directorship in Lewis' name.writing.yalecollege.yale.edu \\"This position in Dick Lewis‚Äô name will serve as a permanent tribute to a writer who made every subject he engaged in memorable and to a memorable teacher who made every student mindful of great writing,‚Äù said Yale President Richard C.

Some of the AFRCC's more notable missions include the search for John F. Kennedy Jr., the Payne Stewart mishap, the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Space Shuttle Columbia crash and, more recently, the search for world-record setting adventurer Steve Fossett. Location Located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, the AFRCC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The center directly ties into the Federal Aviation Administration's alerting system and the United States Mission Control Center. Mission In addition to the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking information, the AFRCC computer system contains resource files that list federal and state organizations, which can conduct or assist in SAR efforts throughout North America. When a distress call is received, the center investigates the request, coordinates with federal, state, and local officials, and determines the type and scope of response necessary. Once verified as an actual distress situation, the AFRCC requests support from the appropriate federal SAR force. This may include Civil Air Patrol, United States Coast Guard, or other Department of Defense assets, as needed. State agencies can be contacted for state, local, or civil SAR resource assistance within their jurisdiction. The AFRCC chooses the rescue force based on availability and capability of forces, geographic location, terrain, weather conditions, and urgency of the situation. During ongoing SAR missions, the center serves as the communications hub and provides coordination and assistance to on-scene commanders or mission coordinators in order to recover the mission's objective in the safest and most effective manner possible. AFRCC uses state-of-the-art technology including a network of satellites for monitoring emergency locator transmitter signals. Systems such as these help reduce the critical time required to locate and recover people in distress. The AFRCC also formulates and manages SAR plans, agreements and policies throughout the continental United States. Additionally, it presents a mobile Search Management Course to Civil Air Patrol wings throughout the United States, to produce qualified incident commanders thus improving national SAR capability. The AFRCC also assigns instructors to the National SAR School at the United States Coast Guard Training Center, Yorktown, Virginia The instructors teach the Inland Search and Rescue Class throughout the United States and at many worldwide military locations. This joint school is designed for civilian and military personnel from federal, state, local and volunteer organizations, all of who are responsible for SAR mission planning. Search and rescue missions include a variety of missions: searches for lost hunters, hikers, or Alzheimer's patients, sources of emergency locator transmitter signals, and missing aircraft. The center frequently dispatches rescue assets to provide aid and transportation to people needing medical attention in remote or isolated areas, for emergency organ or blood transportation, or for medical evacuations, when civilian resources are not available. The United States Coast Guard is responsible for Search and Rescue missions over water and operates similar Rescue Coordination Centers in each of its districts. History Prior to 1974, the Air Force divided the continental United States into three regions, each with a separate rescue center. In May of that year, the Air Force consolidated the three centers into one facility at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. This provided better coordination of activities, improved communications and economy of operations, and standardized procedures. The newly formed center permitted operations with fewer people, while creating a more experienced staff. In 1993, the AFRCC relocated to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, when Air Combat Command assumed responsibility for Air Force peacetime and combat SAR. In October 2003, the AFRCC was realigned under the Air Force Special Operations Command. Then in April 2006, the AFRCC was realigned back to Air Combat Command. On 1 March 2007 the AFRCC was moved from Langley to Tyndall Air Force Base under 1st Air Force (AFNORTH) commander. Since the center opened in May 1974, missions have resulted in more than 13,900 lives saved. Patch history AFRCC Emblem/Patch The emblem of the AFRCC was developed in late 1992 by its members at Scott AFB, Illinois shortly after word was received that Air Rescue Service (ARS) was to be stood down. The newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC) assumed responsibility for United States Air Force Rescue assets in 1993 as a result of a service-wide reorganization and the AFRCC moved to Langley AFB, Virginia. In 2003 under another Air Force wide reorganization the AFRCC was realigned under the Director of Operations, HQ Air Force Special Operations Command while its location remained at Langley AFB. In April 2006 the AFRCC was re- aligned under 1 AF and subsequently re-located to Tyndall AFB March 2007. The emblem depicts the broad mission of search and rescue in the United States. The green and blue represent the Inland Region, both land and air with the resources used the most often for search and rescue. Fixed and rotary wing aircraft and the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System are highlighted with red lightning bolts representing a rapid response. The yellow and black represent peacetime and combat SAR and the eagle is the AFRCC, continuously fostering a cooperative search and rescue network. Over the years, the emblem has become not only a symbol of the AFRCC, but of all those who support and participate in its national level mission. It embodies the cooperative unity that makes our search and rescue system work towards the common goal of saving lives.

Lazzaroni & C. Spa. Lazzaroni is a well-known Italian brand thanks to products such as Amaretti di Saronno. Lazzaroni was the first Italian company to produce biscuits industrially, and has been marketing Lazzaroni branded biscuits and pastries since 1888. History The manufacturing plant opened in 2004 The Lazzaroni family, led by Carlo Lazzaroni, moved from Valtellina to Saronno at the beginning of the 18th century, starting the artisanal production of Amaretti di Saronno. The business was continued by Carlo's sons Paolo and Davide. Paolo moved to Monza in the mid-19th century, starting the production of mostarda and liqueurs. Davide continued to produce amaretti, in Saronno in front of the cathedral, at that time served by horse transport. With the advent of the rail transport, Luigi Lazzaroni (son of Davide) joined the company and in 1888 the partners founded D. Lazzaroni & C., a new legal entity and a new manufacturing facility. In the following years, the company enjoyed great success, making 350 different types of biscuits and exporting its products world-wide; this was symbolized by the brand logo, which included steam boat. It was in this period that biscuits such as Oswego, Nutritivo, Croccale and Germovita made their debut. In 1984, the American multinational Campbell's acquired the firm in order to pursue an ambitious internationalization strategy. In 1991, the Italian firm Citterio, a producer of ham, salami and fresh pasta, acquired the company. In 2008, the company was acquired by the Ragosta Group with the goal of rejuvenating the Lazzaroni brand after a strong restructuring process. Products File:amarettidisaronno.pngAmaretti di Saronno File:frolle.pngFrollini File:latte litografiche.pngVintage tin boxes Lazzaroni's offers its traditional bakery products and the \\"original Amaretti di Saronno\\" (sold in the typical lithograph-decorated tin boxes), and many breakfast biscuits and cookies (\\"frollini\\"), pastries and pastry assortments.

The location was along the Western & Atlantic Railroad tracks near the present-day King Plow Arts Center development in the West Midtown area. It planned to show the progress made since the city's destruction during the Battle of Atlanta and new developments in cotton production. It demonstrated the rebirth of Atlanta and the South by announcing an end to the Reconstruction Era and the sectional hostilities that had plagued the nation for several decades. Placed a short train ride from downtown, it was designed so that the largest building could later be used as a cotton mill (see Exposition Cotton Mills). A quarter of a million people attended, generating between $220,000 and $250,000 in receipts, split evenly between sales and gate receipts.  Founding  The idea of holding such an exhibition in the South was first suggested by Edward Atkinson of New York, who in August 1880 wrote a letter to a New York journal discussing the great waste incident to the methods then in use in the gathering and handling of the cotton crop and suggested the exhibition, to bring all of those interested in the production of this great Southern staple for the purpose of improvement. The Atlanta Constitution republished the letter and urged the importance of some action in regard thereto. A few weeks after the publication of this letter it was announced that Atkinson was about to make a Southern trip for the purpose of putting the suggestion into form. H. I. Kimball, being impressed with the importance of the enterprise and personally acquainted with Atkinson, invited him to Atlanta to address the people on the subject. Atkinson accepted this invitation, and at the solicitation of many prominent citizens of Atlanta he delivered, on October 28, 1880, an address in the state Senate chamber, in which he advocated Atlanta as the proper place in which to hold a cotton exhibition, such as would result in devising improved methods in the cultivation of the cotton as well as to be a stimulus to the entire industrial development of this section. Early that November, James W. Nagle and J. W. Ryckman came to Atlanta to ascertain what action the citizens proposed to take in the matter. At their suggestion several preliminary meetings were held. A committee consisting of Governor A.H. Colquitt, Mayor W.L. Calhoun, ex-Governor R.B. Bullock, and J.W. Ryckman was appointed to prepare a plan for preliminary organization, which resulted in the formation of such an organization and the election of Senator Joseph E. Brown, president; Samuel M. Inman, treasurer; and Ryckman, secretary. Incorporation In February 1881, the chamber of commerce proposed and a corporation was organized under the general law, and a charter was obtained from the court. The Atlanta incorporators were those above plus R.F. Maddox, Benjamin E. Crane, Evan P. Howell, M.C. Kiser, Robert J. Lowry, Sidney Root, Campbell Wallace, J.F. Cummings, W.P. Inman, J.C. Peck, L.P. Grant, W.A. Moore, G.J. Foreacre, Richard Peters and E.P. Chamberlin. Associated with them were citizens of several other counties in Georgia and of the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Massachusetts, New York, Maine, Rhode Island and of London, England. Thus equipped the new enterprise commenced active operations. At first it was only contemplated that the exposition should be confined to cotton and all pertaining thereto, in its culture, transportation, manufacture, etc. The capital stock of the corporation was originally fixed at $100,000 in shares of $100. As the work advanced, however, and as the country became interested in the subject, it was decided to open its doors for the admission of all products from every section, and the capital stock was therefore to $200,000. H.I Kimball was elected chairman of the 25 member executive committee whose mission was to raise the money. It was believed if Atlanta subscribed one-third the amount required, other cities interested in the successes of the enterprise would contribute the balance. A canvass of the city was made, and in one day the amount proportioned to Atlanta was secured. Kimball was authorized to visit Northern cities and endeavor to interest them in the undertaking. He visited New York and secured subscriptions to two hundred and fifty-three shares of stock ($25,300); Boston took sixty shares; Baltimore, forty-eight; Norfolk, VA buying twenty-five; Philadelphia, forty- three; Cincinnati, seventy-nine. The gratifying result of Kimball's work in the North and the apparent interest manifested by the whole country caused the executive committee to take immediate steps to put the whole work of organizing and conducting the enterprise in hand. Kimball was named director- general and CEO. Construction begins Oglethorpe Park was selected as the site of the exposition. It belonged to the city and was located two and one half miles northwest from the railroad depot, and on the line of the Western & Atlantic Railroad. This park was originally laid out and improved under the direction of Kimball, in 1870 for the use of agricultural fairs, but the work of adapting the grounds and erecting the necessary buildings for the exposition was not an easy task. The work was begun under Kimball's direction and rapidly pushed to completion and made ready in ample time for the opening of the exposition. The main building was constructed after a general model of a cotton factory, as suggested by Atkinson, the form being a Greek cross, the transept nearly half the length, the agricultural and carriage annexes extending along the southern side, and the mineral and woods department forming an annex at the extreme western end of the building. Its extreme length was seven hundred and twenty feet, the length of the transport four hundred feet, and the width of the arms ninety-six feet. The dimensions of the remaining principal buildings were as follows: *Railroad building, 200x100 feet *Railroad annexes, 40x60 and 40x100 feet *Agricultural implement building 96x288 feet *Carriage annex, 96x212 feet *Art and industry building, 520x60 feet *Judge's hall, 90x120 feet *Horticultural hall, 40x80 feet *Restaurant, 100x200 feet There were several other buildings, as the Florida building, press pavilion, police headquarters, etc., and quite a number of individuals or collective exhibitors erected buildings for themselves. Opening The exposition was opened on October 5, 1881, and the occasion formed a memorable day in the history of Atlanta. The event was attended by many governors, senators, and congressmen; and addresses were made by Kimball, Governor Colquitt, North Carolina Senator Z.B. Vance, and Indiana Senator D.W. Voorhees. The exposition was a success in every way. The entire number of exhibits was 1,113, of which the Southern States contributed more than half; New England and Middle States, 341; Western States, 138; and foreign, 7. The gross receipts were $262,513, and the total disbursements $258,475. The average daily attendance was 3,816 for the seventy-six days it was open. The largest number of admissions on any one day occurred on December 7, Planters' Day, when there were 10,293. Governor's Day, October 27, 1881, was another important day to the exposition a few days after opening day. It was a celebratory day for the governor and a mural was unveiled to represent the new South. J.H Moser was the artist and named his mural \\"The New South Welcoming the Nations of the Earth.\\" The painting was highly admired by those who had the chance to see it. The mural was actually never found and no images of the painting were ever recovered but should be acknowledged, since the image summed up the message intended by the exposition. There were many written detailed descriptions of the mural by viewers and newspapers. The image was centered around an attractive brunette girl with the American flag wrapped around her. She is depicted with one hand pointing towards the exhibit, on her right, while having her other hand above a bale of cotton. Above her, Uncle Sam is shown also welcoming the visitors. Columbia is in the background displayed with a smile of approval and Clio is shown with a pen ready to keep record of this special event. The image also included African Americans in a cotton field picking the staples. The exposition also demonstrated the cotton gins in action and on Governor's day the machines were set up to make two suits. A machine would first pick the cotton straight from Oglethorpe's field in the morning and from there it was taken to a Cromptom loom. In the Cromptom loom it was woven into cloth and taken to the main building, the Wheeler and Wilson exhibit. At the end of the day two professional suits would be created and tailored for the governor to wear in the evening. The whole process was exhibited in the exposition and done in only one day. On Governor's Day the two governors of the North and South wore their freshly made suits to the ball clad. This was seen as a huge milestone for the union of the North and South. The Exposition Cotton Mills were opened on the site in 1882 and remained in operation until 1969.Cook, p.42 This article incorporates text from the public domain 1902 book, Atlanta And Its Builders by Thomas H.

The word is adopted from the Greek ()‚Äîfrom (), \\"three\\", and (), a sort of couch or rather chaise longue. Each couch was sized to accommodate a diner who reclined on their left side on cushions while some household slaves served multiple courses rushed out of the culina, or kitchen, and others entertained guests with music, song, or dance. The triclinium was characterized by three lecti triclinaris on three sides of a low square table, whose surfaces sloped away from the table at about 10 degrees. Diners would recline on these surfaces in a semi-recumbent position. The fourth side of the table was left free, presumably to allow service to the table. Usually the open side faced the entrance of the room. In Roman-era dwellings, particularly wealthy ones, triclinia were common and the hosts and guest would recline on pillows while feasting. The Museum of Archeology in Arezzo, Italy and the House of Cairo in Pompeii offer what are thought to be accurate reconstructions of triclinia. The custom of using klinai (\\"dining couches\\") while taking a meal rather than sitting became popular among the Greeks in the early seventh century BC. From here it spread to their colonies in southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and was eventually adopted by the Etruscans. In contrast to the Greek tradition of allowing only male guests into the formal dining room, called andr≈çn, while everyday meals were taken with the rest of the family in the oikos, the Etruscans seem to not have restricted the use of the klinƒì to the male gender. The Romans may have seen the first dining klinai as used by the Etruscans but may have refined the practice when they later came to closer contact with the Greek culture. A reproduction of a biclinium Dining was the defining ritual in Roman domestic life, lasting from late afternoon through late at night. Typically, nine to twenty guests were invited, arranged in a prescribed seating order to emphasize divisions in status and relative closeness to the dominus. As static, privileged space, dining rooms received extremely elaborate decoration, with complex perspective scenes and central paintings (or, here, mosaics). Dionysus, Venus, and still lifes of food were popular. Middle class and elite Roman houses usually had at least two triclinia; it is not unusual to find four or more. Here, the triclinium maius (\\"big dining room\\") would be used for larger dinner parties, which would typically include many clients of the owner. Smaller triclinia would be used for smaller dinner parties, with a more exclusive set of guests. Hence, their decoration was often at least as elaborate as that found in larger triclinia. As in the larger triclinia, wine, food, and love were always popular themes. However, because of their association with patronage and because dining entertainment often included recitation of highbrow literature like epics, dining rooms could also feature more \\"serious\\" themes. As in many houses in Pompeii, here the smaller dining room (triclinium minus) forms a suite with the adjoining cubiculum and bath.

He served as the head football coach at the University of Alabama from 1923 to 1930 and at Duke University from 1931 to 1941 and again from 1946 to 1950, compiling a career college football record of 171‚Äì49‚Äì10. His tenure at Duke was interrupted by military service during World War II. Wade's Alabama Crimson Tide football teams of 1925, 1926, and 1930 have been recognized as national champions, while his 1938 Duke team had an unscored upon regular season, giving up its only points in the final minute of the 1939 Rose Bowl. Wade won a total of ten Southern Conference football titles, four with Alabama and six with the Duke Blue Devils. He coached in five Rose Bowls including the 1942 game, which was relocated from Pasadena, California to Durham, North Carolina after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wade served as the head basketball and baseball coach at Vanderbilt University for two seasons (1921‚Äì1923), tallying a mark of 24‚Äì16, while he was an assistant football coach there. He was also the head baseball coach at Vanderbilt from 1922 to 1923 and at Alabama from 1924 to 1927, amassing a career college baseball record of 87‚Äì45‚Äì2. Wade played football at Brown University. After retiring from coaching, Wade served as the commissioner of the Southern Conference from 1951 to 1960. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1955. Duke's football stadium was renamed in his honor as Wallace Wade Stadium in 1967. Early life and playing career Wade was born in Trenton, Tennessee. He first played football under Tuck Faucett at Peabody High School in Trenton. Wade also attended Chicago's Morgan Park Academy. He went on in 1913 to play football at Brown University. Wade played guard on the Brown football team, which went to the 1916 Rose Bowl. One of his teammates at Brown was Fritz Pollard, who went on to become the first African American coach in the National Football League. Coaching career =Fitzgerald & Clarke= Fitzgerald and Clarke 1920 basketball team. Wade is in back. After spending time in the Army and rising to the rank of cavalry captain, W. S. Fitzgerald hired him as head coach at the Fitzgerald and Clarke Military School in Tullahoma, Tennessee. He went 15‚Äì2 in football, winning a state prep-school championship in 1920. Among his players were future consensus All-Americans Lynn Bomar and \\"Hek\\" Wakefield. He also posted successful basketball teams at Fitzgerald‚ÄìClarke. ' =Vanderbilt= In 1921 Wade was hired as an assistant and line coach at Vanderbilt University under Dan McGugin. He also coached basketball. Vanderbilt posted an undefeated 15‚Äì0‚Äì2 with Wade, and shared conference titles both years he was there. 1921 Wade at Vanderbilt, 1921 Defending Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champion Georgia was undefeated, having not allowed a score through its powerful line all year. Vanderbilt too was undefeated, and so the game was figured to decide the conference champion. It was described by The New York Times as an \\"important clash.\\" Sporting editor for the Birmingham News \\"Zipp\\" Newman had written weeks ago, \\"Stegeman has a powerful team and with all the regulars in the game, the team has a chance of going through the season undefeated unless it be Vanderbilt that stops her.\\" The Bulldogs were the favorite to win this meeting of the two schools, first since 1912, in part because the Bulldogs may have outplayed Harvard and defeated Auburn earlier in the season. Lynn Bomar starred at the linebacker position. \\"Georgia would have trampled Vanderbilt to atoms but for Lynn Bomar\\", observed Nashville Tennessean sportswriter Blinkey Horn. His play was again noted, \\"Lynn Bomar was the stellar performer of the game. In the first- half he made two-thirds of the tackles.\\" It is also said he stopped five Georgia touchdowns that day.Traughber, William L. Vanderbilt Football: Tales of Commodore Gridiron History. Charleston, South Carolina: History, 2011. The Commodores remained down 7-0 until late into the fourth quarter when Rupert Smith scored on an onside punt. He made the extra point as well and the game ended a tie. Both teams won the rest of their games as expected and remained co-champions. 1922 In 1922, Vanderbilt again went undefeated and its defense ranked top in the nation as measured by points against per game. Vanderbilt held Michigan to a scoreless tie in the inaugural game at the new Dudley Field, including a goal line stand. One account reads \\"Thousands of cheering Vanderbilt fans inspired the surge of center Alf Sharpe, guard Gus Morrow, tackle Tex Bradford, and end Lynn Bomar, who stopped Michigan cold in four attempts.\\" =Alabama= After working as an assistant for Vanderbilt, Wade was hired as the head coach at the University of Alabama in 1923. Over the next seven years, Wade's team won three national championships after appearing in the Rose Bowl in 1925, 1926, and 1930. On the hiring, the Athletic Council stated: > Mr. Wade's experience as a football coach has been brilliant and successful. > He comes to us with the highest recommendation not only from Vanderbilt and > Brown authorities, but also from many of the leading football experts of the > South and indeed the entire country. If we rely on expert testimony, the > University is fortunate securing a man of Mr. Wade's character, experience, > and achievements.\\" 1923-1926 In 1923, Alabama was undefeated in Southern Conference play until upset by the Florida Gators 16-6 in the rain on Thanksgiving Day. Edgar C. Jones scored all of Florida's points. The loss would give Wade's former school Vanderbilt the conference. The 1924 team won the school's first Southern Conference title, suffering its only loss to Centre. The 1925 team went undefeated and was the first Southern team to win a Rose Bowl. The 1926 Rose Bowl, which Alabama won over Washington 20 to 19, is thus commonly referred to as \\"the game that changed the south.\\" The 1926 team also went undefeated, tying with Pop Warner's Stanford team in the 1927 Rose Bowl. 1927-1930 Alabama's 13‚Äì0 loss to Georgia Tech snapped a 24-game unbeaten streak. Alabama outgained Tech 188‚Äì144 in the game, but Tech scored a touchdown in the second quarter and scored another after recovering a fumble at the Alabama 1 with two minutes to go. It was the first time Georgia Tech had scored points on Alabama since 1922. Alabama came from behind in the fourth to beat Mississippi State 13‚Äì7 but limped home with three straight losses to end the year at 5‚Äì4‚Äì1. Wade was under fire after lackluster seasons in 1928 and 1929, which included narrow losses to Robert Neyland's Tennessee Volunteers. Wade submitted his resignation on April 30, with the caveat that he coach next season. John Suther described the feeling before the Tennessee game that year, which Alabama won 18‚Äì6. \\"Coach Wade was boiling mad. He was like a blood-thirsty drill sergeant anyway, and those critics made him more fiery ... He challenged us to help him shut up the loudmouths that were making his life miserable.\\" Wade's last Alabama squad outscored their opponents 271-13 over the course of the season and completed a perfect (10-0) campaign with a 24-0 victory over Washington State in the Rose Bowl. The team was voted #1 by several organizations during the pre-AP poll era, and the University of Alabama officially claims the 1930 national championship. =Duke= Wade at Duke Following his third national championship, Wade shocked the college football world by moving to Duke University, which had less of a football tradition than Alabama. Though Wade refused to answer questions regarding his decision to leave Alabama for Duke until late in his life, he eventually told a sports historian he believed his philosophy regarding sports and athletics fit perfectly with the philosophy of the Duke administration and that he felt being at a private institution would allow him greater freedom. He brought assistants Ellis Hagler and Herschel Caldwell with him to Duke. In 16 seasons, Wade's Duke teams compiled a record of 110 wins; 36 losses; and 7 ties. 1931-1937 The 1932 team upset Tennessee and featured North Carolina's first All-American in Fred Crawford. The 1933 team won the school's first Southern Conference title, and upset Neyland's Volunteers 10-2\\\\. It caused Neyland to say of Crawford: \\"He gave the finest exhibition of tackle play I have ever seen.\\" Both Clyde Berryman and James Howell named Duke as a retroactive national champion for 1936. 1938-1941 Wade's most notable season at Duke was in 1938, when his \\"Iron Dukes\\" went unscored upon until reaching the 1939 Rose Bowl. In that game, Duke's first Rose Bowl appearance, the \\"Iron Dukes\\" lost 7‚Äì3 to the USC Trojans. The 1939 team added Dutch Stanley to the coaching staff, replacing Carl Voyles as end coach, and won another SoCon championship. Wade's Blue Devils lost the 1942 Rose Bowl to Oregon State. The game was held at Duke Stadium, the Blue Devils' home stadium in Durham, North Carolina, because the recent attack on Pearl Harbor made the event's organizers skittish of hosting the game in California. World War II Wade entered military service after the 1942 Rose Bowl loss and the legendary Eddie Cameron filled in for him as head football coach from 1942 to 1945. While in the United States Army, Wade was hired to coach a Western All- Army football team that played against National Football League teams before the 1942 NFL season to raise money for the Army Emergency Relief fund. Playing in five games, Wade's team defeated the Chicago Cardinals and Detroit Lions, but lost to the Washington Redskins, Green Bay Packers, and New York Giants. Along with Neyland's Eastern All-Army team, the games raised $241,392.29 for the fund. 1946-1950 Wade returned to coach the Blue Devils in 1946 and continued until his retirement in 1950. Later life and honors From 1951 to 1960 Wade was the commissioner of the Southern Conference. He was inducted College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. In 1967, Duke's football stadium was renamed Wallace Wade Stadium in his honor. Wade died in 1986 in Durham at the age of 94 and was buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Durham.Wallace Wade at Find A Grave In 2006, a bronze statue of Wade was erected outside of the University of Alabama's Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium alongside the statues of Frank Thomas, Bear Bryant, Gene Stallings, and now Nick Saban, the other head coaches who led Alabama to national championships. =Coaching tree= Wade's coaching tree includes: #Paul Burnum #Johnny Cain: played for Alabama (1930-1931), head coach for Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette.

Biography Born near Bardstown in Nelson County, Kentucky. His father was William Johnson, who was state senator and a Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky. His mother, Nancy, was a member of the committee that selected the design of the Confederate flag; they chose a design submitted by Nicola Marschall.

The quality start was developed by sportswriter John Lowe in 1985 while writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer. ESPN.com terms a loss suffered by a pitcher in a quality start as a tough loss and a win earned by a pitcher in a non-quality start a cheap win. Nolan Ryan has used the term \\"High Quality Start\\" for games where the pitcher goes seven innings or more and allows three earned runs or fewer. All-Time As of the end of the 2014 Major League Baseball (MLB) season, the highest \\"quality start\\" percentage for a given season in the live-ball era (post-1920) was recorded by Greg Maddux, who had 24 of them in 25 games in 1994. Dwight Gooden was 33-for-35 in 1985. Since 1921, and through the 2014 MLB season, the overall leaders by percentage (min. 100 starts): #Jacob deGrom (102 of 136, 75.0%) #Clayton Kershaw (148 of 209, 70.8%) #Tom Seaver (454 of 647, 70.2%) #Adam Wainwright (152 of 217, 70%) #Mel Stottlemyre (247 of 356, 69.4%) #F√©lix Hern√°ndez (207 of 303, 68.3%) #Bob Gibson (328 of 482, 68%) #David Price (123 of 181, 68%) #Jered Weaver (179 of 265, 67.5%) #Spud Chandler (123 of 184, 66.8%) #Randy Johnson (403 of 603, 66.8%)  Criticisms  = High ERA = An early criticism of the statistic, made by Moss Klein, writing in The Sporting News, is that a pitcher could conceivably meet the minimum requirements for a quality start and record a 4.50 ERA, which is generally seen as undesirable.https://wgntv.com/2013/05/19/stats-sunday-quality- starts/https://books.google.com/books?id=gcwv4OxWTgIC&pg;=PA139&lpg;=PA139&dq;=tim+mccarver+%22quality+start%22&source;=bl&ots;=3qOEM1YIhp&sig;=cHkXIUwut7a5euVWYMHMvCZMQXA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=S9-ZUYfaPKjYywGfn4DwCQ#v=onepage&q;=tim%20mccarver%20%22quality%20start%22&f;=false Bill James addressed this in his 1987 Baseball Abstract, saying the hypothetical example (a pitcher going exactly 6 innings and allowing exactly 3 runs) was extremely rare among starts recorded as quality starts, and that he doubted any pitchers had an ERA over 3.20 in their quality starts. This was later confirmed through computer analysis of all quality starts recorded from 1984 to 1991, which found that the average ERA in quality starts during that time period was 1.91. = Complete games = Another criticism against the statistic is that it is not beneficial for pitchers who pitch many innings per start. If a pitcher allows three earned runs in six innings, he gets a quality start with an ERA of 4.50 for that game. But if a pitcher pitches for nine innings and allows four earned runs, he would have a 4.00 ERA, but would not get a quality start. Former pitcher Carl Erskine said \\"in my day, a quality start was a complete game ... you gave everybody a day's rest.\\" That the category is more reliable in the aggregate can be seen with countervailing individual examples, such as the ones listed by Sports Illustrated writer Joe Posnanski in a 2011 piece on the subject: :\\"In July 2000, Mark Mulder went 6 2/3 innings, gave up 15 hits and nine runs ‚Äî but only two were earned, so that was classified as a quality start. :In June 1997, Randy Johnson struck out 19 in a complete game but allowed four runs. That was not a quality start. :In July 1982, Mike Scott allowed seven hits and walked five in six innings, did not strike out anybody, gave up seven runs, but only three of those were earned. Quality start. :In April 1974, Gaylord Perry went 15 innings and allowed four runs. Not a quality start.\\"Joe Blogs: All You Never Wanted To Know: Quality Starts Possible new criteria Due to the reasons listed above, some have proposed a possible change in the criteria for a quality start. One of the proposals includes that for every two innings pitched, the starter is allowed to give up one earned run, and as long as he pitches five innings, a quality start would be recorded. This criterion would give Randy Johnson and Gaylord Perry listed in the above examples quality starts. This criteria would still allow a pitcher to have a 4.50 ERA and earn a quality start, but would better represent a quality start. Dayn Perry of CBS Sports has introduced what he calls the \\"Dominant Start\\".http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24659516/from-quality- start-to-dominant-start This stat would award a pitcher with a Dominant Start if he goes at least eight innings, and give up no more than one run, earned or unearned. This stat means that if a pitcher pitches a complete game and gives up two unearned runs, he would not get a Dominant Start. Perry argues that this stat would better show which pitchers are truly the best in all of baseball.

All three disciplines, except for the Nations Cup, were held at the equestrian stadium in Bromont, which had a capacity of 15,000 spectators, and the cross-country and steeplechase were also nearby. Building this stadium provided some headache for the Organizing Committee after the original estimate of 1 million Canadian dollars increased to CAD 4,425. Poland and Chile were not allowed to ship horses into the host country due to the concern of piroplasmosis, and France and Italy also had to keep some horses home due to veterinary regulations. Overall 23 nations competed: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Guatemala, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Puerto Rico, the Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, and the US, with the Montreal Games being the first for Guatemala and Puerto Rico in equestrian events. The 1976 Olympics was also the first Games with a disqualification due to a positive equine drug test, after San Carlos, ridden by Ronald McMahon of Ireland, received treatment following an injury during transport. Although the treatment was needed, the rules did not allow for him to compete. Disciplines =Show jumping= Tom Gayford, assisted by Robert Jolicoeur, built the massive courses ridden by 61 riders from 20 countries. All courses were to be ridden at 400 m/min, and had 15 obstacles with 18 jumping efforts, including a 5m water. Round A, 950 meters in length, had verticals up to 1.60 meters and a 2.20 meter wide oxer with a 1.55 meter front rail and a back rail at 1.60 meters. Round B (660 meters) had a narrow 1.70 meter vertical, and the oxers were also raised in height. The final jump off was 470 meters long. Only 39-year-old Alwin Schockem√∂hle was able to pull off two clear rounds to win gold. The next three highest placed riders had 12 penalties apiece, and they had to jump off for silver and bronze. The Nations Cup was held in the Olympic Stadium in front of 55,000 spectators, despite a great debate to move it to Bromont after intense rain. However, course dimensions were reduced. Alwin Schockem√∂hle managed to complete the 2 Nations Cup courses with 4 and 8 penalties respectively, helping Germany finish with team silver. To watch the show jumping, see . =Dressage= The 10-minute Grand Prix dressage test was ridden by 27 riders from 11 nations. The Grand Prix awarded up to 500 points per judge‚Äî2500 points total‚Äîwith Christine St√ºckelberger winning the test on Granat with 1869 points (74.7%). The top 12 riders from the Grand Prix competed in a second test, the Grand Prix Special. The Special, with an 8-minute 45 second time allowed, was also won by Granat with 1486 out of 1950 possible points (76.2%), earning St√ºckelberger the individual gold medal. They finished 51 points ahead of silver medal winner Harry Boldt and Woycek, who was 40 points ahead of the bronze medal winners, Reiner Klimke riding Mehmed. To see St√ºckelberger's Grand Prix Special ride: The favorites for the team competition were Germany, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union to medal, but the US managed to clinch the bronze ahead of the USSR for their first dressage medal since the 1948 Games. =Eventing= 49 riders from 13 countries competed, including Princess Anne from Great Britain, becoming the first member of the British Royal Family to have participated in the Olympic games. There were also several sets of family members: Guatemala had a mother and daughter pair competing on their team (Rita and Silvia de Luna), while Australia had a father and son (Bill and Wayne Roycroft). The cross-country course designer, Barbara Kemp, was the first woman to design an Olympic equestrian course. It wouldn't be until 1996 when show jumping would have its first woman course designer with Linda Allen. The endurance day track was 27,465 meters in length, of which 7,695 meters was a 36-obstacle cross-country course. The track was very varied, traveling over meadows (2300 meters), gravel roads (1300 meters), through the woods (900 meters) as well as a manicured golf course (3200 meters).

A former standout at linebacker for Georgia Tech, he was the defensive coordinator at the Georgia Institute of Technology for two stints, one in 1999-2001 under George O'Leary, and secondly, 2013-2017 under Paul Johnson. Roof served as the head coach at Duke University from 2003 to 2007, compiling a 6‚Äì45 record. Noted for his highly aggressive defenses, Roof has also been the defensive coordinator at the University of Minnesota and at Auburn University, winning the 2011 BCS National Championship Game with the latter. Early life and family Roof attended Central Gwinnett High School and earned his bachelor's degree in management from Georgia Tech in 1987. Roof is married to Pam Ash-Roof of Fayetteville, Georgia, and the couple have twin boys, Terrence Davis and Michael Edwin. Terrence is a linebacker at Georgia Tech and Michael is a quarterback at Charlotte. Playing career After graduating from Central Gwinnett High School, Roof went on to play football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in 1982. He started his final three seasons and served as team captain while leading the Ramblin' Wreck's famed \\"Black Watch\\" defense as a senior. Their success fueled Georgia Tech's run to 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 in 1985, including a win over Michigan State in the All-American Bowl. Roof was honored as member of the All-America team, was selected to the All- ACC first team, and was named the Defensive Back of the Year by the Atlanta Touchdown Club. He remains among the most prolific tacklers in program history, ranking second for most tackles in a game with 25 against Tennessee in 1985 and seventh on the all-time tackling list with 417. Roof was enshrined into Georgia Tech's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998. Coaching career Ted Roof on the sidelines, 2013 Roof began his coaching career as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Alabama in 1987, where he helped on defense before taking his first full-time position as the linebackers coach at the University of West Georgia for the 1989 season. After Steve Spurrier left Duke University in 1990, his successor, Barry Wilson, lured Roof to fill the position coaching outside linebackers on his staff. When Wilson and his staff were fired after the 1993 season, Roof left to serve as an assistant coach for the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Roof took his first job as defensive coordinator in 1997 at Western Carolina University, where he stayed one season before being lured away to join George O'Leary's staff at his alma mater. After spending the first season coaching the Yellow Jackets linebackers, Roof was promoted to defensive coordinator. He was nominated for the 2000 Broyles Award, an annual honor given to the nation's top assistant coach, when his defense finished the season ranked 12th in the nation in rushing defense and 20th in scoring defense. The following season, the Yellow Jackets were again one of the top defenses in the nation, ranking 23rd nationally in total defense and 32nd against the run. When O'Leary left for the University of Notre Dame, Roof left Georgia Tech to become the defensive coordinator at Duke for the 2002 season. Roof's instruction brought marked improvement to the Duke Blue Devils defense, which led the ACC in rushing defense after finishing ninth in the league the previous year. From 2001 to 2002, the Blue Devils moved from ninth to fifth in the ACC and from 113th to 58th nationally in total defense. They progressed in passing defense in the 2003 season, jumping to third-place in the ACC from ninth the previous year. When head coach Carl Franks was released midway through the 2003 season, Roof was promoted to interim head coach. The team finished the season by winning two of the last three games and Roof was subsequently hired as the 20th head coach at Duke on December 6, 2003. However, after winning only four games over the next four seasons, he was fired on November 26, 2007, having compiled a 6‚Äì45 record. Despite the dismal record of Duke teams under Roof, his aggressive defenses consistently ranked in the top-30 nationally in tackles behind the line of scrimmage. > Coach Roof's enthusiasm makes him successful. He has a passion for football. > He lives, eats and sleeps football, and that rubs off on everyone around him > (but no current playing field).

He really brought us together as a team. > \\\\--Kenneth Stanford, 2004 Duke co-captain The 2008 pre-season saw Roof in strong demand. While he had initially been hired on January 6, 2008 by the University of Louisville to work alongside Ron English and Ken Delgado on the defense, it was reported on February 21, 2008 that Roof would succeed Everett Withers as the defensive coordinator at the University of Minnesota. Under just one season of Roof's tutelage, the Gophers made tremendous improvements to give up 160 fewer passing yards per game and over 135 fewer total yards when compared to the previous year's 119th ranked defense. Besides the nation's worst total defense, Roof also inherited a squad which had ranked 115th in pass defense, 114th in rushing defense and 109th in scoring defense in 2007. Roof's defense made strides throughout the season and finished ranked in the top-25 in both sacks and tackles for loss after being ranked 103rd and 116th the previous season. Roof's defense created 31 turnovers, second most in the Big Ten and 11th nationally. They were seventh in the nation causing fumbles (16), fueling the team's 16th ranking in turnover margin. Overall, the scoring defense improved to 61st, rushing defense to 69th, total defense to 79th and pass defense to 93rd. This quick turn-around on defense contributed to the Golden Gophers improving their record from 1‚Äì11 to 7‚Äì6 and garnering an appearance in the 2008 Insight Bowl. On January 6, 2009, Roof was hired as the defensive coordinator at Auburn University by first-year head coach Gene Chizik. Roof had just finished one season in a three-year contract at Minnesota reportedly worth $350,000 a year. His salary at Auburn was $370,000. While at Auburn, Roof coached in two bowl games, with wins in both the 2010 Outback Bowl and the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. On December 8, 2011, Roof accepted the defensive coordinator position at the University of Central Florida. The move came after Roof led Auburn's defense to one of the worst statistical seasons in the program's history. Auburn's defense finished the 2011 regular season 78th in the nation, allowing 405.8 yards per game. The previous yards-per-game high for an Auburn defense was 389.1 in 1979. > Ted has played an important role in the success of our football program, > helping Auburn win 29 games in three years, including a national > championship last season. I'm very appreciative of the passion, energy and > work ethic Ted brought to the program every day. I know that this will be a > great opportunity for Ted to be reunited with his mentor in George O'Leary > and we wish him and his family nothing but the best at UCF.\\\\--Gene Chizik, > Auburn head coach, 2009-2012 On January 10, 2012, Roof was hired by new head coach Bill O'Brien as defensive coordinator at Penn State. Due to the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, on July 24, 2012 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sanctioned Penn State with a four-year postseason ban, loss of 40 scholarships over a four-year period and allowed players to transfer without having to sit out a year. Despite the difficult conditions of the program, Roof led the defense to rank second in the Big Ten Conference in scoring defense, led the league in sacks, ranked first in red-zone defense and third in turnover margin. Nationally, Penn State ranked tied for first in red-zone defense, 15th in sacks, 16th in scoring defense, 23rd in rushing defense, 28th in pass efficiency defense and 29th in total defense. On January 9, 2013, Georgia Tech announced Roof was returning to his alma mater as defensive coordinator for the Yellow Jackets. On December 22, 2017, North Carolina State announced that Ted Roof was joining the Wolfpack staff as the 10th assistant coach allowed by a change in NCAA rules.

Vernon's family was directly descended from one of Rhode Island's first pioneers, Anne Hutchinson.Rhodeisland- philatelic.comRootsweb.com William Vernon was a member of Newport's Second Congregational Church, which was pastored by Ezra Stiles.http://www.redwoodlibrary.org/notables/vernon.htm William and his older brother Samuel (September 6, 1711 - 1792) entered into business together, eventually establishing themselves as prominent merchants in Newport. Another brother, Thomas, did not enter into trade with his other siblings. William Vernon was one of the charter members of the Artillery Company of Newport.  Newport Triangle Trade  The Vernon brothers, William and Samuel, made a name for themselves in Newport by successfully utilizing the \\"triangle trade.\\" Their first ship, commanded by Captain John Godfrey, was ironically named the Olive Branch. The brothers also owned the Hare, a ship whose participation in the American slave trade is well documented. Incredible profits were made by purchasing slaves in Africa with rum from the colonies, selling those slaves in the West Indies, using those profits to purchase molasses from those ports before buying more rum in the colonies, continuing the triangular cycle of trade. The Vernons are known as the first Newport merchants to sell African slaves directly to the southern colonies, instead of exclusively in the West Indies. Their ships returning from the West Indies offloaded slaves in South Carolina in exchange for barrels of rice destined for markets in New England.Yale.edu Their first sale to the southern colonies was made in Charleston in 1755.Rhodeisland-philatelic.com These brothers serve as a perfect example of the pivotal role many northern colonies played in the American slave trade.  Contributions to the American Revolution  William‚Äôs success in Newport meant he was well known to the British. Samuel and William were both early supporters of the revolution; Samuel was even one of the ringleaders responsible for the Stamp Act Riots of 1765. Their other sibling, Thomas was a Loyalist or Tory sent into a brief exile in Glocester, Rhode Island, but Thomas remained friendly with the brothers throughout the war.Google Books Search As a result of his well-known political beliefs, William was forced to flee Newport prior to the British occupation of Newport. Vernon fled to Rehoboth, Massachusetts, hoping to protect his family. His nephew remained at the Vernon House to protect it during this time. The Vernon House, located on Clarke Street in Newport, was the headquarters of the Comte de Rochambeau during the revolution, General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette both were guests at the Vernon House. The elegant formal style of life introduced by the French during the Revolutionary War was quickly taken up by the populace, chief among them William Vernon Jr. (1759-1833), the son of William Vernon. A francophile, Vernon frequented the court of Louis XVI in Paris (where he was an aide to Benjamin Franklin) and on the death of his father spent his entire eighty-thousand-dollar inheritance on a collection of fifty-two Old Master paintings, thereby forming one of the first important collections of such works in this country. They hung for many years at Vernon House (which still stands on the corner of Clarke and Mary Streets) and undoubtedly enticed other Newport residents to collect within the same parameters. After moving closer to the heart of revolutionary activity, Vernon was appointed by the Continental Congress as the president of the Eastern Naval Board on May 6, 1777. This position was effectively the precursor to the Department of the Navy (effectively making Vernon the first Secretary of the Navy, before the position was officially established in the 1790s). In this position, Vernon was responsible for building and outfitting the ships of the colonial Navy for the duration of the American Revolution. Vernon was extremely dedicated to his duties; on several occasions, he actually contributed some of his own personal wealth to the cause with little chance of collecting interest or even repayment. After the Revolution, Vernon became involved in the Board of the Admiralty before returning to Newport.Redwoodlibrary.org  Post-Revolution  Following the Revolution, William Vernon continued to expand his activities and influence within the Newport community. He was a president of the Redwood Library, founding member of the Newport Artillery Company in 1741 and a key figure in establishing the Newport Bank in 1803. William Vernon was an early benefactor of the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University). William Vernon continued his triangle trade merchant activities throughout the revolution and following his brother Samuel‚Äôs death in 1792 until at least 1799. William Vernon is buried in the Vernon Cemetery on Warner Street in Newport, Rhode Island. His house, Vernon House, is a National Historic Landmark.

He has been known to perform much better against India national cricket team than any other international team.  Domestic career  Powell was 19 when he made his first-class debut in the 1996‚Äì96 season and followed it up with a List A debut in the following year in 1998‚Äì99 season.

He made 2,000 ODI runs at a strike rate of 96.66, which is the highest strike rate of a West Indian player with more than 1000 ODI runs and he also emulated Gordon Greenidge by hitting 8 sixes in an ODI innings against India cricket team in 1999 at Singapore which was a West Indian ODI record. He also hit seven sixes in another ODI against India cricket team at Toronto that same year. In total, he hit 75 sixes in 100 ODI innings, a ratio equal to that of Viv Richards.

It contains 887 square kilometers including the Rift Valley lakes of Abijatta and Shalla. The two lakes are separated by three kilometers of hilly land. The altitude of the park ranges from 1540 to 2075 meters, the highest peak being Mount Fike, which is situated between the two lakes. Besides the two lakes, the primary attraction of this national park are a number of hot springs on the northeast corner of Lake Abijatta, and large numbers of flamingoes on the lake.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide, 5th edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2009), pp. 457ff Care must be exercised in driving vehicles out to the edge of this lake, as the thin crust of dried mud on the surface can give way without warning.  History  Although its intent was to protect wildlife, few wild animals currently can be viewed there. During the tumultuous period of the last days of the Derg regime, and for some time afterwards, large numbers of nomads took advantage of weakened central authority to move into the Park and set up residence with their livestock. Much of the Acacia woodland surrounding Lake Abijatta has been cut down for charcoal. Currently, not only do small groups continue to fell Acacia trees, but they go as far as to remove the salty soil from the lake shoreline and sell it.\\"Important Bird Areas factsheet: Abijatta - Shalla Lakes National Park\\", BirdLife International website (accessed 16 November 2010) A recent visitor noted that while viable breeding populations of greater kudu, Giant Striped Gnu, Grant's gazelle, black-backed jackal and spotted hyena may exist, he saw no evidence of their presence. Although baboons are still quite common, they were outnumbered by the livestock introduced by cattle herders. A few Grant's gazelle and several ostriches were kept in a fenced enclosure near the gate house. Nevertheless, more than 300 bird species have been recorded in Abijatta-Shalla or the remnants of the adjacent park-like woodland.

It has around 470 pupils and is open to boys between the ages of 7 and 18 as either boarders or day pupils; it was modelled after English public schools. It is divided into Merchiston Juniors (ages 7‚Äì13), Middle Years (ages 13‚Äì16) and a Sixth Form.  History  In May 1833, Charles Chalmers took a lease of Merchiston Castle (the former home of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms) ‚Äî which at that time stood in rural surroundings ‚Äî and opened his academy, starting with thirty boys. Over time, the number of pupils grew and the Merchiston Castle became too small to accommodate the school. The governors decided to purchase 90 acres of ground at the Colinton House estate, four miles south-west of Edinburgh. Building began in 1928 including the Chalmers and Rogerson boarding houses, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer In 1930 the school moved to Colinton. Three years later, in 1933, Merchiston celebrated its centenary, attended by the Duke and Duchess of York. Fifty years on, in 1983, at a time of further expansion and with 350 boys on the roll, their daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II, visited the school for its 150th anniversary.

Sports and games  A range of sports and activities is available at the school; particularly in rugby union, which over 60 Merchistonians have played at international level. The Merchistonian Football Club for former pupils of the School was a founder member of the Scottish Rugby Union and was involved in the very first rugby international, supplying three players.

History Zanes was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1961, and spent his childhood in Texas and then in Fredericton, New Brunswick. His father was a teacher, as well as a poet and writer. He started playing guitar when he was eight and began taking Lead Belly records out of the public library as soon as he was old enough to get a library card; according to his mother, \\"He was always very musical.\\" Zanes attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts for two years. Zanes ended up living on the outskirts of Concord, New Hampshire. In 1981, Zanes went to Oberlin College in Ohio, where he was determined to start a really cool band. In the breakfast line on the very first day at Oberlin, he met up with former high school classmate Tom Lloyd. Zanes and Lloyd took their breakfast back to the dorm and immediately started a band and soon left school and headed to Boston (\\"It was between Boston and Austin,\\" according to Zanes), where they became known as The Del Fuegos. The Del Fuegos The Del Fuegos played in lofts, bars, warehouses, small art galleries, clubs, barns, college dining halls, fraternity houses, gymnasiums, auditoriums, and, finally, big theaters. Rolling Stone named the Del Fuegos \\"Best New Band\\" in 1984. Once, Bruce Springsteen jumped on stage to play \\"Hang On Sloopy\\" with them. With the Del Fuegos, Zanes made several records ‚Äì The Longest Day (1984), Boston, Mass (1985), Stand Up (1987), Smoking in the Fields (1989) ‚Äì and had a hit single, Don't Run Wild. In 1987, Zanes married Paula Greif, the director of the video for the Del Fuegos song, I Still Want You. Children's music After Dan Zanes and his wife at the time, Paula Greif, had a baby, Anna Zanes, they moved to New York City. Zanes subsequently began playing music with a group of other fathers that he had met in West Village playgrounds who were also there with their kids. These fathers playing music together eventually became The Wonderland String Band, which played at parks and parties and on a tape of songs that Zanes recorded at his home. Dan Zanes The tape was a hit locallyi.e. on the playgrounds where he and his daughter playedand Zanes realized that he liked making music that families could enjoy together, as opposed to music that is just for children or just for adults. So, he added a small number of women to his band, renamed it the Rocket Ship Revue, and began making a full-length homemade album, enlisting the help of some people he had met when he was a Del FuegoSheryl Crow, Suzanne Vega, and Simon Kirke, the drummer for Bad Company. The album, Rocket Ship Beach (2000), was also a hit. The New York Times Magazine called it \\"cool\\", and added, \\"Mostly, though, Zanes' kids music works because it is not kids music; it's just musicmusic that's unsanitized, unpasteurized, that's organic even.\\" Sheryl Crow and Suzanne Vega made guest appearances on the album. The second album, Family Dance (2001) is composed of dance songs from a wide variety of musical traditions and features Loudon Wainwright III and Rosanne Cash. The third recording, the more mellow Night Time! (2002), features collaborations with Aimee Mann, Lou Reed, John Doe, Dar Williams, and other established musicians. In 2003, he played himself on Dragon Tales Let's Start a Band on TV film. The fourth album in the family series is House Party (2003), a rambunctious 20-song collection with a diverse instrumentation that, in addition to the usual guitars, banjos, upright bass and drums, includes such instruments as tuba, accordion, pump organ, djembe and saw. House Party was nominated for a Grammy in the Musical Album for Children category. Music video selections from the House Party album played during the Disney Channel's morning program suite known as Playhouse Disney from 2005‚Äì2007. New music video selections occasionally play on Nickelodeon's Noggin. In 2007, Zanes received the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children for Catch That Train! (2006) and produced a children's reggae CD with Father Goose called \\"Its a Bam Bam Diddly\\", which also features songs performed by Sister Carol and Sheryl Crow. In early 2009, Zanes' ¬°Nueva York! (2008) won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Children's Music Album.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì 8th Annual Winners His seventh album 76 Trombones (2009) was a Broadway/Showtune themed album, featuring guest vocalists Matthew Broderick, Carol Channing, and Brian Stokes Mitchell.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996. Creekmur played professional football in the National Football League (NFL), principally as an offensive tackle and offensive guard, for the Detroit Lions for ten years from 1950 to 1959. He appeared in every pre-season, regular season, and post-season game played by the Lions from 1950 to 1958‚Äîa streak of 165 consecutive games. He played in eight consecutive Pro Bowl games from 1950 to 1957 and was selected by the Associated Press as a first-team All-Pro player seven consecutive years from 1951 to 1957. During Creekmur's tenure with the team, the Lions advanced to the NFL championship game four times and won the championship in 1952, 1953, and 1957. Creekmur also played college football for the College of William & Mary from 1948 to 1950. Early years Creekmur was born in 1927 in Hopelawn, New Jersey. He attended Woodbridge High School in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. Creekmur attended the College of William & Mary, though his college education was interrupted by military service in 1945 and 1946. He played for the William & Mary Indians football team in 1944 and from 1947 to 1949. He played for the #14-ranked 1947 William & Mary team that lost to Arkansas in the 1948 Dixie Bowl, and in the 1949 Delta Bowl, he returned an interception 70 yards to help the #17-ranked 1948 William & Mary team defeat Missouri Valley Conference champion Oklahoma A&M; by a 20‚Äì0 score. Professional football Creekmur was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 26th round, 243rd overall pick, of the 1948 NFL Draft, but continued playing college football in 1948 and 1949. He was acquired by the Detroit Lions prior to the 1950 NFL season and spent his entire NFL career with the Lions. Beginning with the 1950 season, Creekmur appeared in every pre-season, regular season, and post-season game played by the Lions from 1950 to 1958‚Äîa streak of 165 games. He played through multiple injuries, including dislocated shoulders, knee injuries, and one whole season with a crushed sternum. Creekmur began his career with the Lions as an offensive guard for two years and then moved to the offensive tackle position, though he also played some on defense as well. He was considered an \\"outstanding blocker\\" for Detroit teams that featured backfield stars Bobby Layne and Doak Walker. He played in eight consecutive Pro Bowl games from 1950 to 1957 and was selected by the Associated Press as a first-team All-Pro player six times in seven years from 1951 to 1954 and 1956-1957. With Creekmur in the line, the Lions advanced to the NFL championship game four times and won the championship in 1952, 1953, and 1957. During his rookie season, Creekmur was the victim of a highly publicized extortion attempt in which a \\"notorious hoodlum\\" schemed with others to falsely accuse him of sexual assault on a night club dancer. Two individuals were later convicted after a trial in the matter. Near the end of the 1958 season, Creekmur, at age 31, announced that he would retire at the end of the season, ending his 168-game playing streak. The Lions held a \\"Lou Creekmur Day\\" for their December 14, 1958, game against the New York Giants. In October 1959, after the Lions lost their first four games, the Lions persuaded Creekmur to return to the club. Creekmur appeared in the final eight games of the 1959 season. During his playing career, Creekmur worked a second job as the terminal manager for the Saginaw Transfer Company and made more money as terminal manager than he did as an All-Pro football player. Later years and honors After retiring from football, Creekmur worked for a time in the 1960s and 1970s for Ryder Trucks as a director of labor relations and later as vice president of labor relations in Florida. Creek received numerous honors, including the following: * In 1975, sports writer Joe Falls named him one of his 11 greatest Lions. * In 1976, sports writer George Puscas jokingly dubbed Creekmur as \\"perhaps the finest holder of all time\\". Puscas recalled that Creekmur would cup his hands in front of his chest to \\"grab a handful of jersey, or the edge of a shoulder pad\\" and noted: \\"I remember telling Creekmur in his late years that I would spend the entire game just watching him, to make note and study of his craftmanship and perhaps compose an essay on it.\\" * In 1983, Puscas included Creekmur on his all-time Lions team. * In 1989, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1996, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his 32nd year of eligibility‚Äîat that time, a record wait for an inductee. Creekmur said at the time, \\"I kept falling through the cracks.\\" Creekmur died in 2009 at University Hospital in Tamarac, Florida. He was diagnosed post-mortem as having developed Chronic traumatic encephalopathy following a 30-year decline of cognition.

He was an early editor of Creem magazine, has written for various publications such as Newsday, The Village Voice, and Rolling Stone, and has published numerous books about music and musicians, mostly focused on rock music. He is also a committee member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Early life Marsh was born in Pontiac, Michigan. Moving to Waterford, Michigan in 1964. He graduated from Waterford Kettering High School in Waterford, Michigan in 1968. He then briefly attended Wayne State University in Detroit. Career He began his career as a rock critic and editor at Creem magazine, which he helped start. At Creem, he was mentored by close friend and colleague Lester Bangs. Marsh is credited with coining the term punk rock in a 1971 article he wrote about Question Mark & the Mysterians. While supportive of punk music in general, he said in a 2001 interview that \\"I don't know that it was any more important than disco,\\" and believes rap is more significant than punk in the history of rock music. He has written extensively about his favorite artists, including Marvin Gaye, whose song \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" he chose as the number one single of all-time in his book The Heart of Rock and Soul: the 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made, and Sly Stone, whom he called \\"one of the greatest musical adventurers rock has ever known.\\" Along with Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner, Marsh has been involved in organizing and maintaining the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Marsh has at times courted controversy with his style of maintaining selections. Marsh has published four books about Bruce Springsteen. Some of these became bestsellers, including Born to Run and Glory Days. Marsh has edited and contributed to Rock and Roll Confidential, a newsletter about rock music and social issues. The newsletter has since been renamed Rock and Rap Confidential. Marsh contributed to the 1994 book Mid-Life Confidential, a book about and by the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band composed of American authors. He has also worked for Newsday and The Real Paper. Marsh's most recent book, 360 Sound: The Columbia Records Story ‚Äî Legends and Legacy, was released in October 2012. In the same format as Heart of Rock and Soul, this book covers the 264 greatest songs from Columbia Records beginning with the 1890 performance of John Philip Sousa's \\"Washington Post March\\" and working its way chronologically up to Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" (2011). To promote the music of Columbia Records, Legends and Legacy is available as a free eBook on iTunes.\\" =Derision of musicians= Marsh has been characterised as a \\"grumpy rock and roll journalist\\" due to his acerbic comments on popular musicians whom he dislikes.

In 1976, he wrote that Led Zeppelin had an \\"insurmountable flaw\\" in drummer John Bonham (who has topped multiple all-time greatest drummers lists), whom he saw as \\"something like clinically incompetent\\" and responsible for marring every Zeppelin album to date. Marsh wrote in 1978: \\"Queen isn't here just to entertain. This group has come to make it clear exactly who is superior and who is inferior. Its anthem, 'We Will Rock You', is a marching order: you will not rock us, we will rock you. Indeed, Queen may be the first truly fascist rock band...[I] wonder why anyone would indulge these creeps and their polluting ideas.\\" Marsh had previously described Queen frontman Freddie Mercury ‚Äì who is regarded as one of the best rock singers of all time ‚Äì as possessing a \\"passable pop voice\\". Marsh described Bob Seger's 1980 album Against the Wind as \\"absolutely cowardly\\". He was much more supportive of Seger's earlier work. In the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, Marsh called Journey \\"a dead end for San Francisco area rock\\", and their music \\"calculated\\". He awarded every single Journey album released up to that point ‚Äì seven studio albums, a compilation album and a live album ‚Äì the minimum possible score of 1/5 stars. When asked about Marsh's unrelenting derision of Journey on a 1986 television program during which other critics had defended the band, lead singer, Steve Perry, called Marsh \\"an unusual little man who all too often thinks that his subjective opinions translate to inarguable fact\\".Steve Perry interview. 96.5 KOIT. June 2, 1986. Also in the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, Marsh described Air Supply as \\"The most calculated and soulless pseudo-group of its kind, which is saying something\\". In 1989, Marsh referred to the Grateful Dead as the \\"worst band in creation\\". Regarding a possible Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction for Kiss, Marsh said: \\"Kiss is not a great band. Kiss was never a great band. Kiss never will be a great band, and I have done my share to keep them off the ballot.\\" Kiss were ultimately inducted in 2014; in the lead-up, Marsh said: \\"I was done with them before I ever turned the first album over to the second side... all that mediocrity was harmless enough until the boastful bassist decided to turn it into a propaganda machine for the only two things he's ever loved: Gene Simmons and money.\\" Lead singer Paul Stanley described Marsh as \\"pompous\\", and pointed to his derision of Led Zeppelin and Queen as evidence that he had \\"no clue\\" about music. =Talk shows= Dave Marsh hosts three Sirius XM Radio shows, one called Live from E Street Nation, airing on E Street Radio and the second Kick Out the Jams, airing Sundays on eclectic-rock channel The Spectrum. The title references the MC5 album Kick Out the Jams.

It was founded and owned by Howard Thompson, who designed the company's first game, Stellar Conquest. The company also invented Microgames and published Steve Jackson's first designs, including Ogre, G.E.V. and The Fantasy Trip. History The company's first product, released in 1974, was Stellar Conquest, which had been rejected by Avalon Hill in 1973.Thompson, Howard (June 1978). Preface to the rule book in the third printing of Stellar Conquest. Many of Metagaming's notable titles were also science fiction wargames, including Ogre, G.E.V., and WarpWar. In 1975, Metagaming started The Space Gamer as a quarterly house magazine. By its 17th issue, TSG was a full size bimonthly magazine, printed on slick paper and covering games from other publishers, including fantasy games. Thompson and Metagaming pioneered the idea of publishing small, low-cost games in what came to be known as the MicroGame format. For a while, Metagaming dominated this niche wargaming market. Notable MicroGames from Metagaming include WarpWar (designed by Thompson himself), Ogre, G.E.V., Melee, Wizard (all designed by Steve Jackson), and Hitler's War. Following the success of Dungeons & Dragons, Thompson had Steve Jackson design Melee (1977) and Wizard (1978) as the combat and magic systems for a fantasy role-playing game named The Fantasy Trip. TFT was released in 1980 as three books: In the Labyrinth: Game Masters' Campaign and Adventure Guide, Advanced Melee, and Advanced Wizard. Thompson was unhappy with Jackson's work on TFT, which presumably contributed to Jackson's departure from Metagaming later in 1980. Jackson bought The Space Gamer when he left; after a legal dispute, Metagaming conceded that they had also sold Ogre, G.E.V. and an unreleased MicroGame called One-Page Bulge to Jackson. In the early 1980s, Metagaming published a series of modules for TFT in MicroGame format, as well as other MicroGames, some with historical themes, including Hitler's War. The company launched another magazine, Interplay, which was a house organ intended to be published six times a year. It ran for eight issues before the company disbanded. The first issue of Interplay was dated May/June 1981, and the eighth was dated September/October 1982. On 1 January 1982, Thompson created Games Research Group, Inc., a spin-off from Metagaming. The Games Research Group, Inc. copyright appears on several Metagaming-released products, such as the counters of the MicroGame Dragons of the Underearth. Thompson closed down Metagaming in April 1983 and disappeared from the gaming hobby, leaving most of Metagaming's intellectual property in limbo. On December 26, 2017, Steve Jackson announced that he had re-acquired the rights for the remaining products he authored for Metagaming, specifically Melee, Wizard, Death Test, Death Test 2, Advanced Melee, Advanced Wizard, In the Labyrinth, and Tollenkar's Lair. This was accomplished through the provisions of 17 U.S. Code ¬ß 203, which allows authors to reclaim works after 35 years. Personnel Notable game designers who worked for Metagaming include Jackson, Lynn Willis and Keith Gross. Ben Ostrander, who was later the publisher of Mojo Press, served as the art director for most of the company's titles.

Location and communications Dyrham is at lat. 51¬∞ 29' north, long. 2¬∞ 22' west (). It lies at an altitude of 100 metres above sea level. It is near the A46 trunk road, about north of Bath and a little south of the M4 motorway. The Cotswold Way long-distance footpath runs through the village. Administration Dyrham is administered by the civil parish of Dyrham & Hinton and by the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire. The population of this parish was 296 at the 2011 census. History St Peter's Church, parish church of Dyrham. Next to it has stood for many centuries the manor house of Dyrham, the present incarnation of which, Dyrham Park (pictured), dates from the reign of William & Mary, and is thought to incorporate some of the structure of the ancient home of the Russells. In this church can be seen the funerary brass of Sir Maurice Russell(d.1416) Dyrham is thought to have been the site of the important Battle of Deorham fought in AD 577 between the West Saxons under Ceawlin and Cuthwine, and the Britons of the West Country. The outcome of the battle was a decisive win for the West Saxons, allowing them to colonise three important cities, Glevum (Gloucester), Corinium (Cirencester) and Aquae Sulis (Bath). The Domesday Book of 1086 records the tenant-in-chief of Dyrham as William FitzWido who held seven hides in Dyrham, formerly the land of Aluric. The manor passed to the Norman magnate Wynebald de Ballon, and then via the Newmarch family to the Russell family, notably being held by John Russell (died c.1224) and William Russell (1257‚Äì1311). By the 15th century the manor had passed into the Denys family, the most notable holder being William Denys (1470‚Äì1533). After the family accumulated debts in the 16th century, the manor was sold to the Wynter family and then the Blathwayte family, who built the present mansion known as Dyrham Park, which is said to incorporate some of the structure of the earlier manor house.

The aim of Capitalism is to become the most profitable business in the world while competing in several different markets against a number of different corporations. The player must run a business as the chief executive officer while preventing the business from going bankrupt or being bought out by a competitor. A more advanced version was developed and released as Capitalism Plus on January 1, 1996, featuring world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities which was published by Broderbund. A sequel was released entitled Capitalism II in 2001. An expanded version of Capitalism II, called Capitalism Lab, was released December 14, 2012.http://www.capitalismlab.com/  Gameplay  Capitalism is a simulation game which can be played in two different ways. The player may start their own business or play a scenario with a pre-made business with a set goal. In a new game, the player begins with a maximum of $200,000,000 initial capital. Each store can be stocked with up to four different items. As a real world model it is necessary to take into account land cost, overhead, demand for the products, and competition. The player can build several types of firms including department stores, factories, research and development centers, farms, mines, oil wells, and logging camps. The most common business model to pursue in Capitalism is retail by running a chain of department stores. However, the player can venture into any market segment they want including manufacturing, which includes another set of considerations such as suppliers and raw material shortages. Manufacturing begins with building a factory and planning the internal operation layout of the structure. Purchasing, manufacturing, sales and advertising can all be used in factories. The player can also choose to run research and development (R&D;) operations as either their sole business or alongside running other operations such as department stores and factories. R&D; ultimately improves the player's product quality by increasing technology gain. R&D; for any product can last from 6 months to 10 years in the game, with the technology gain being higher when the R&D; duration is increased. New products can also be produced using R&D.;  Scenarios  The scenario screen enables players to choose a scenario to play. Capitalism includes seventeen scenarios with pre-made situations and businesses and a certain goal. The scenarios are generally more difficult to succeed in that competitors often have the starting advantage. Each scenario has a different goal and different environment and competitor situation. For example, the Alternative Challenge scenario restricts the market to two cities while in \\"D\\" for Diversification the player must manage a profitable broad- based corporation and manage a large number of firms at the same time. Some of the scenarios require the player to dominate a particular market in terms of market share. For example, Food Dominance sets a goal of dominating the food industry within 50 years while earning an annual operating profit of no less than $20 million. In Fortress of the Beverage King, the player must dethrone the Beverage King 'James Zandman' as the dominator of the beverage industry within 50 years. Most scenario games disable the stock market option in an attempt to make the player focus on completing the scenario goals. The initial capital given in each scenario depends on the difficulty of the goals set. Each time a player successfully completes a scenario within the time limit set and with all goals reached, they will receive a bonus score and be added to the 'Hall of Fame' list.  Other features  Capitalism includes many different features designed to reduce effort and save time in basic gameplay. From the main menu, players can use 'Quick Start' to choose from eight instructional games to learn about retailing, market analysis, farming, manufacturing, branding and advertising, research and development, raw material production and the stock market. These lessons are included in the game to introduce a new player to the concepts and basic gameplay.Capitalism Plus Manual, page 20. Chapter 2 Another feature of Capitalism is the layout plan library, which can store layout plans for all types of buildings available in the game. It enables the player to save previously used layout plans into a library as a record and then apply them to buildings to save time rather than creating new layout plans. Layout plans can be replaced, added, deleted or sorted.Capitalism Plus Manual, page 65. Chapter 6  Capitalism Plus  Capitalism Plus retail box cover. A more advanced version of the original Capitalism was developed and released as Capitalism Plus on Jan 1, 1996 and published by Broderbund for Windows 95 only. It added world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities to the game in addition to improved SVGA graphics, more markets to dominate and random events including riots, disease and technology breakthroughs. With Capitalism Plus, a map and scenario editor program was also added enabling players to configure products, industries, goals and other items.Yahoo! Games - Capitalism Plus Review Capitalism Plus is compatible with Windows XP and Windows Vista.GOG Reception Capitalism and its Capitalism Plus SKU together sold 150,000 copies by 2000. Shortly after the release of Capitalism in 1995, a review in Next Generation commented, \\"The game is complex, but don't let the novel-sized manual fool you. It may be daunting at first, but this is one of those sims that you'll play for hours without even noticing.\\" The reviewer scored it four out of five stars. Capitalism also made appearances on The Discovery Channel, and CNBC-TV Cable. In 1996, Harvard University and Stanford University began using Capitalism for educational purposes. Professor Tom Kosnik said, \\"Capitalism is a world-class, hands-on learning experience I've used at Stanford School of Engineering and Harvard Business School. Gamers not only learn the subtleties of growing an entrepreneurial business but also learn about leadership and team building necessary in any business situation.\\" On October 21, 1996, BusinessWeek reviewed Capitalism, saying:Amazon.com, Capitalism Plus Reviews - BusinessWeek, October 21, 1996 (original source: BusinessWeek, abstracted from capalive.com) In 2000, Computer Gaming World named Capitalism among the fifteen most difficult games ever, saying: \\"[Capitalism is] so complicated it should come with a free MBA in every box.\\" The magazine has also praised the game as highly enjoyable and addictive. PC Gamer nominated Capitalism as the best simulation of 1995, although it lost to Apache.

It features a new lineup, reformed by bandleader Tom Warrior with newly joined musicians Oliver Amberg, Curt Victor Bryant and Stephen Priestly. Despite it being marketed to exploit the mass appeal of glam metal, the album has more of a traditional heavy metal sound. The album was not popular with the group or its fans and is no longer available to buy, making the LP much sought after by collectors. Background After a disheartening end to their \\"One in Their Pride\\" tour in Dallas, Texas, Tom Warrior decided to end the band. However, in mid-1988, at the request of Oliver Amberg and with the support of producer Tony Platt, the band was resurrected, although with an entirely new line-up (Oliver Amberg ‚Äì guitars, Curt Victor Bryant ‚Äì bass, Stephen Priestley ‚Äì drums and additional vocals). Even though the project had the cooperation of Warrior, he held little interest in it and so allowed Amberg to do most of the musical composition. Reception Upon its release, the album was universally slammed by music critics and the band was labeled a sell-out by its core fanbase. The appearance of the band was remade with teased hairstyle to look like popular glam metal acts such as M√∂tley Cr√ºe. The earlier works by the band had been underground thrash/death/black metal. Modern reviews are more positive. AllMusic reviewer Bradley Torreano wrote that Cold Lake is \\"still the worst Celtic Frost album\\", but that it \\"really isn't that bad\\" and the \\"vibrant heavy metal here... is longing to be rediscovered by fans.\\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered Cold Lake a \\"good record\\", filled with riffs \\"awesome and sinister\\" and lyrics about street-level sin \\"almost scarier\\" than the abandoned black metal ones. Legacy Amberg was quickly fired after the release of the album. When the band re-issued its back catalogue in 1999, they purposely omitted Cold Lake. Some of the tracks appear on the compilation album Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying but in a different, heavier mix that Tom Warrior supervised. Tom Warrior had this to say about Cold Lake: Tom has also said it was the \\"absolute worst I could do in my lifetime.\\" He has also called it \\"an utter piece of shit\\" and \\"possibly the worst album ever created in heavy music.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Celtic Frost *Tom Gabriel Warrior ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, effects *Oliver Amberg ‚Äì lead and rhythm guitars, effects, backing vocals *Curt Victor Bryant ‚Äì bass, effects, backing vocals, lead guitar on track 11 *Stephen Priestly ‚Äì drums, backing vocals ;Additional musicians *Michelle Villanueva ‚Äì backing vocals, additional lead vocals on track 5 *Brian Hewett ‚Äì rap on track 1, backing vocals on track 2 *Xavier Russell ‚Äì backing vocals on tracks 1 and 11 ;Production *Celtic Frost, Tony Platt ‚Äì producers, arrangements, mixing at Conny Plank Studio *Thomas Steeler, Dexter ‚Äì assistant engineers *Karl-Ulrich Walterbach ‚Äì executive producer References Category:Celtic Frost albums Category:1988 albums Category:Albums produced by Tony Platt Category:Noise Records albums Category:Glam metal albums ","title":"Cold Lake (album)"},{"id":"2379439","text":"East African oryx in the national park Awash National Park is a national park in Ethiopia. Spanning across the southern tip of the Afar Region and the northeastern corner of the Misraq Shewa Zone of Oromia, this park is 225 kilometers east of Addis Ababa (and a few kilometers west of Awash), with its southern boundary along the Awash River, and covers 756 square kilometers of acacia woodland and grassland. The Addis Ababa - Dire Dawa highway passes through this park, separating the Illala Saha Plains to the south from the Kudu Valley to the north. In the south of the park the Awash River gorge has amazing waterfalls. In the upper Kudu Valley at Filwoha are hot springs amid groves of palm trees. The Awash National Park was established in 1966, although the act authorizing its existence was not completely passed for another three years. In establishing this park, as well as the Metehara Sugar Plantation to the south, the livelihoods of the Karayyu Oromo people indigenous to that area have been endangered‚Äîan effect that is contrary to the Ethiopian government's original intention of these establishments serving to benefit the local population.

Service history The ship was ordered in 1918 as SS War Harbour and completed at Bethlehem Steel Company's (Union Iron Works into 1917), Alameda, California yard as hull #162A for the British Shipping Controller, London, requisitioned during construction and completed by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as Independence and assigned official number 217172. She was acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 16 November 1918 with Lt. O. P. Rankin in command and made one Atlantic crossing from New York to England with foodstuffs in 1919. After World War I service, she decommissioned on 20 March 1919 and was returned to the USSB for US Merchant Marine service. Rebuilt and renamed City of Norfolk in 1930, she was run by the Baltimore Mail Steamship Company until reacquired by the Navy on 14 December 1940. Converted by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, Portland, Oregon, she recommissioned as Neville (AP-16), on 14 May 1941, Captain C. A. Bailey in command. =1941-1942= On 18 June 1941, Neville reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet and for the remaining days of quasi-peace in 1941 transported military and naval personnel to various points along the East Coast and in the Caribbean. On 7 December 1941 she was at San Juan, en route from Trinidad to New York. Within the month, however, she was conducting landing exercises with Army units along the Virginia coast. Detached from that duty in mid-February, she embarked Army and Navy personnel and equipment and departed the East Coast, on 19 February 1942, on the first trans-oceanic run of her second world war. She completed the round-trip voyage to Belfast, including a stop at Glasgow, on 25 March, at New York, disembarked RAF, RCAF, and British Merchant Navy personnel, and then continued on to Norfolk for voyage repairs. At the same time, she received 20 mm guns and more modern landing craft for use in her new operational territory, the Pacific. Neville departed Hampton Roads, on 10 April, and steaming south with TF 38, transited the Panama Canal, on the 18th, becoming a unit of TransDiv 8, ServRon 4, Pacific Fleet. Anchoring in Fanui Bay, Bora Bora, on 4 May, she discharged her Army and Seabee passengers and proceeded on to Wellington, New Zealand, where she remained until 22 July. Then, with units of the 1st Marine Division embarked, she headed toward the Fiji Islands to rendezvous with other Allied vessels assigned to \\"Operation Watchtower\\", the assaults on Tulagi and Guadalcanal. At 0630, on 7 August, Neville arrived in her assigned transport area off beach \\"Blue\\" on Tulagi. Seven minutes later she lowered her boats and Raider groups were dispatched. At 0730 Marine Combat Team 2 was debarked into landing boats which put them ashore soon after \\"H-hour\\", 0800. Despite increasingly stiff opposition, all assigned waves had been landed by 1012. By 1320, aerial resistance, in the form of bombers and fighters, had been added to the well developed Japanese defenses in the Tulagi-Gavutu-Tanambogo area. The long battle for the Solomons had begun. Neville remained in the area through the 9th, witnessing, from a distance, the devastation wrought off Savo Island on that date. On the 13th, she arrived at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, whence she continued on to Wellington to take on reinforcements. Returning to the combat area on 26 October, she participated in the landings at Aola Bay on 4 November, and then departed to take up transport duties in the New Caledonia- New Hebrides area. At the end of the month, she again returned to Guadalcanal, discharged supplies and reinforcements, took on personnel to be evacuated, and headed south east. After stopping at Espiritu Santo to disembark her evacuees, she proceeded to San Diego, arriving on 4 January 1943 for availability. =1943= On 14 February, Neville, now redesignated APA-9 (effective 1 February), stood out from San Diego en route back to the Atlantic. She arrived at Norfolk on 10 March, and after amphibious training in the Chesapeake Bay area, sailed on 8 June for North Africa to prepare for the Sicilian invasion. By 10 July she was off Scoglitti with \\"Cent\\" Force as it landed Army units on either side of that fishing town. Assigned to the Northern Group, Nevilles boats delivered units of the 45th \\"Thunderbird\\" Division to \\"Red\\" beach, near the mouth of the Acate River, at 0434. Despite being the last group to get away from their transport, heavy surf, and indefinite landmarks, they were the first to touch down on the beach. With the last wave in by 0640, the task of discharging cargo was begun. On the afternoon of the 12th, the APA departed the assault area and returned to Oran, whence she sailed, on the 22nd, for the United States. Neville arrived at Newport News, Virginia, 3 August, only to depart again on the 23rd, once more assigned to the Pacific. By the end of September she was engaged in intensive landing exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. On 10 November she stood out of Honolulu and sailed for the Gilberts with troops of the 27th Division and a platoon of Marine Raiders, 5th Amphibious Corps, embarked. On the morning of 20 November, Marine and Army units were landed on Tarawa and Makin. At 0642 Neville dispatched her Marines to secure Katubam but kept her Army units on board for later landings on the lagoon side of Butaritari. By 1015 the first of eight waves had been dispatched, landing on beach \\"Yellow\\" at 1040 under an opposing storm of small arms fire. Cargo discharge operations, begun later in the day, continued through the 22nd. On the 23rd, Neville departed the transport area only to return the next day to take on survivors from before returning to Pearl Harbor. From Pearl Harbor, the transport steamed to Bremerton, Washington, underwent repairs, and then headed south to San Diego, arriving on 31 December. =1944= With the new year, 1944, Neville received new landing craft, fresh boat crews, and orders to join Trans Div 30 at Pearl Harbor. She arrived in Hawaii on 9 January, again took on units of the 27th Division, and on the 23rd got underway, with TG 51.1, the Kwajalein Attack Force Reserve Group. Neville sighted Kwajalein on the 31st, but maneuvered east of the Atoll until entering the lagoon on 2 February. There she engaged in debarkation drills in preparation for the assault on Eniwetok. On 11 February, the uncommitted Kwajalein Reserve Group was dissolved and reformed as the Eniwetok Expeditionary Group. Four days later the group, TG 51.11, sortied from Kwajalein. On the 17th, Neville entered Eniwetok lagoon and prepared to land her troops on the main objective, Engebi, the following morning. The first waves hit the beaches at 0844. Neville's boats, used on the 17th and on the morning of the 18th, were not called on to transport her own passengers to the beaches until after the vessel had shifted to Transport Area 3. Then, at 1609, troops were debarked for landings on Eniwetok Island. For the next three days, she remained off Eniwetok, sending supplies to the beaches and taking on casualties. On the 23rd, she shifted to the Parry Island transport area, where she remained for four days. APA‚Äì9 then got underway for Kwajalein, Pearl Harbor, and, ultimately, San Francisco. On 8 April, she returned to Hawaii to conduct amphibious training exercises with Marine personnel in preparation for \\"Operation Forager\\", the push into the Marianas. Assigned in May to TransDiv 10, Neville departed Honolulu on 30 May, and steamed west with TF 52\\\\. Soon after 0630 on 15 June, she was in her assigned transport area, off Saipan. By 0700 her boats had departed for a demonstration feint off Mutcho Point, Garapan. Her boats reloaded in mid-morning, she shifted to the Charan Kanoa transport area. At 1103 she received orders to send her troops in to beach \\"Green Two\\". The first boats shoved off for the departure line at 1135 and by 1340 the job was completed. From the 15th until the 18th, the transport retired each night to positions just off the islands of Saipan and Tinian. From the 19th to the 21st, as the Battle of the Philippine Sea raged, she cruised 75‚Äì100 miles east-northeast of Saipan, then returned to complete off- loading cargo at Saipan. On the 23rd, she turned her bow toward Eniwetok, where Japanese POWs were taken on board. Next sailing to Kwajalein, she embarked ambulatory casualties, and on 5 July joined a convoy headed for Pearl Harbor. There, on 13 July, she delivered her prisoners, and the next day continued her voyage, arriving at San Diego on the 21st. =1945= On her arrival at San Diego, Neville was assigned to TU 13.1.1, TransDiv 1, then conducting amphibious training exercises for assault troops. From 3 January 1945 until 15 August, she operated as a training ship for APA crews, and then, after the cessation of hostilities, resumed duties as a transport to ferry fresh troops to former Japanese islands in the South Pacific and bring home veterans. =Post-war= On 15 January 1946, the World War I transport departed California for the last time. Steaming to the East Coast, she arrived at Boston on 5 February to begin inactivation, decommissioning on 30 April. Transferred to War Shipping Administration on 16 July, she was struck from the Navy List on 15 August 1946, and scrapped in 1957. Awards Neville received 5 battle stars for her World War II service.

It is the nation's largest national park. Gambella is located several hundred kilometers from Addis Ababa, Gambella was established in 1974, but is not fully protected and has not been effectively managed for much of its history.\\"... Gambella National Park has virtually ceased to exist as a conservation area...\\":  Fauna and flora Gambella National Park has one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in Ethiopia. 69 mammal species occur in the protected area including African elephant, African buffalo, White-eared kob bushpig, common warthog, giraffe, hippopotamus, k√©wel, Nile lechwe, sable, tiang, topi, and waterbuck, cheetah, leopard, lion, mantled guereza, olive baboon, patas monkey, and spotted hyena. The park also hosts herds of Bohor reedbuck, bushbuck, Lelwel hartebeest, oribi, reedbuck, roan antelope, and white-eared kob. The white- eared kob migration is Africa's second largest mammal migration. In 2015, African Parks and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority surveyed the park's giraffe population for the first time, and estimated there were between 100 and 120 giraffes. Gambella's giraffes were once thought to belong to the Nubian subspecies. 327 bird species, including seasonal migrants, have been recorded, including the African skimmer, black-faced firefinch, Carmine bee- eater, cisticolas, crowned cranes, Egyptian plover, exclamatory paradise whydah, green bee-eater, pelicans, approximately 40 species of raptors, red- necked buzzard, red-throated bee-eater, storks, warblers, and vultures. Plant species along the Akobo and Baro rivers include: Acacia victoriae, Arundo donax, shenkorageda (Saccharum officinalis), and temba (Pennisetum petiolare). The invasive Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) has also been reported. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit. Efforts to reduce poaching doubled the number of wild animals in the park between 2008 and 2012. History Gambella was established during 1974‚Äì1975 to protect habitat and wildlife, especially the Nile lechwe and white-eared kob, two endangered antelope species. Animal populations in the park have declined because of agriculture, cotton farming, hunting, poaching, and the creation of refugee camps, especially following the 1983‚Äì1985 famine in Ethiopia and by displaced Sudanese. Illegal deforestation by local communities has also led to conflict. In 2012, Bantayehu Wasyihun, head of the park's office, said infrastructure development was underway to make Gambella more accommodating to tourists. The conservation organization African Parks and Addis Ababa University's Horn of Africa Research Centre worked with park officials to draft plans to improve Gambella's security and structure.

While the Prussian and Russian armies of the same period included dragoon regiments among their respective Imperial Guards, different titles were applied to these units. Origins The British Army first used the designation in 1746, when the King's Own Regiment of Horse, the Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Horse (prior to 1727 the Princess of Wales's Own) and the 4th Horse were redesignated as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Dragoon Guards respectively. In 1788 the four remaining regiments of Horse were converted into the 4th to 7th Dragoon Guards. At the beginning of the French Revolutionary War the British Army maintained seven regiments of Dragoon Guards, plus six of Dragoons and fourteen of Light Dragoons. During the 19th and esrly 20th centuries the seven regiments of Dragoon Guards were classed as medium cavalry while the three remaining Dragoon regiments were heavy cavalry.Encyclopaedia Britannica, article title \\"Dragoon\\", page 471 volume 8, eleventh edition. Title The exercise of converting from \\"Horse\\" (heavy cavalry) to \\"Dragoon\\" (formerly mounted infantry) was intended to save money‚ÄîDragoons were paid less than Horse and rode an inferior breed of horses.Encyclopaedia Britannica, article title \\"Dragoon\\", page 471 volume 8, eleventh edition. The change was accordingly very unpopular among the regiments affected. To compensate for the fall in salary and status, the impressive sounding title of \\"Dragoon Guards\\" was adopted. The Dragoon Guards remained as cavalry of the line and did not become Household troops in any sense. Seniority The Regiments of Horse that were converted to Dragoon Guards took precedence over all other cavalry regiments of the Line, which were at the time exclusively dragoons. As the senior regiments, they could not take numbers sequential with those of the existing dragoon regiments, so they needed a new title and numbering system. Hence they were termed Dragoon Guards, the guards appellation giving them higher prestige, and allowing them to be numbered in their own sequence.

The initial fort, also called Fort Wise, operated from 1860 to 1867. After a flood in 1866, a new fort was built near Las Animas, Colorado, which operated as a military post until 1897. It has been used as a United States Army fort, a sanatorium, a neuropsychiatry facility, and a minimum security prison. The state closed the prison in 2011, and in early 2013 proposed to use the site as a rehabilitation center for homeless people. Then in late 2013 it became a rehabilitative transitional housing facility for homeless people with some form of substance abuse problem. This is run by the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and has been a developing program to the present day. The fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Part of the site, the Fort Lyon National Cemetery, which began burials in 1907, remains open. History =Fort Lyon (1860‚Äì1867)= Bent's New Fort was rented to the U.S. government and used as a military post from 1860 to 1867 In July 1860, the Army rented Bent's New Fort and used it for storage of annuity goods for the Cheyenne and Arapaho. Annuity goods were provided by treaties in exchange for reduced access to ancestral land, such as hunting grounds. Barracks were built around the fort and additional defensive features were added, like diamond-shaped gun emplacements on newly-erected earthenworks that surrounded the fort. It was first named Fort Flaunteroy. Shortly after, it was named Fort Wise for Henry A. Wise, the governor of Virginia. After the start of the American Civil War and Virginia's succession from the Union, it was finally named Fort Lyon in 1862 for Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, who had died in battle. In 1861, the Treaty of Fort Wise was signed at the fort. The goal, which was short-lived, was to ensure peace between settlers and the Cheyenne and Arapaho people. Old Fort Lyon was the staging post used by Colonel John Chivington in 1864 as he led an attack on friendly Cheyenne and Arapaho camps that became known as the Sand Creek massacre. To prevent word spreading of the impending attack, Chivington had guards posted at the fort to prevent people and mail from reaching Sand Creek. In 1866 after flooding on the Arkansas River, the U.S. Army established a new fort near Las Animas. The facility was completed in 1867. The site was abandoned after the Army relocated. =Fort Lyon (1867‚Äì1897)= In 1867, a new fort called Fort Lyon was built near the present-day town of Las Animas, Colorado. The U.S. Army used Fort Lyon until 1897, when they abandoned it after the end of the Indian Wars. =Medical, prison, and psychiatric facilities= In 1906, the U.S. Navy opened a sanatorium there to treat sailors and marines with tuberculosis. The dry climate and rest by isolation at the fort were thought to be beneficial by contemporary treatment methods. On 22 June 1922, the Veteran's Bureau assumed operations. In 1930, administration of the hospital was transferred to the newly created Veterans Administration. Within three years, the VA designated Fort Lyon a neuropsychiatry facility. In 2001 the hospital was closed and the facility was turned over to the state of Colorado for conversion to a minimum security prison. The prison was closed in 2011. In September 2013, Governor John Hickenlooper announced that Fort Lyon had reopened as an isolated transitional housing facility for homeless people with substance abuse issuesGov.

Gwent Police currently employs 1,204 officers, 649 civilian staff and 217 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs). The force was formed in 1967 by the amalgamation of Monmouthshire Constabulary and Newport Borough Police. In 1974 its area was realigned to cover the new administrative county of Gwent, and in 1996, it was expanded again to cover the former Rhymney Valley district area that had become part of the Caerphilly county borough.  Organisation  = Governance = Like most police forces in England and Wales, Gwent Police is overseen by an elected Police and Crime Commissioner, which replaced the former police authority of councillors, magistrates and lay members in 2012. The PCC is currently Jeff Cuthbert. = Structure = Gwent Police has two local policing areas: * East ‚Äì Newport and Monmouthshire * West ‚Äì Caerphilly , Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen These divisions are run practically independently, controlled by a Chief Superintendent. Both contain three departments, each under a Chief Inspector; CID, Neighbourhood Operations (providing community officers and local response) and Neighbourhood Support (including traffic and public order teams, among other things). However, there are still some departments that cover the whole force, including the dog section, rural crime team, and training functions. The force has its headquarters at Croesyceiliog in Cwmbran. = Collaborations = Gwent Police has participated in collaborations with other agencies to improve service and reduce costs at a time of government cuts. Examples of collaborations include: * Joint Response Unit (with Welsh Ambulance Service) ‚Äì where a special constable works alongside a paramedic or technician. Funded by the Welsh Ambulance Service and staffed by Gwent Police Special Constabulary. * Joint Firearms Unit (with Dyfed‚ÄìPowys Police and South Wales Police) * Tarian (with Dyfed-Powys Police and South Wales Police) ‚Äì regional organised crime unit. * Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit (with Dyfed-Powys Police, South Wales Police and North Wales Police) *South Wales Joint Scientific Investigation Unit (with South Wales Police) ‚Äì processes all forensic submissions * Air Support is provided by the National Police Air Service ‚Äì mainly using NPAS47, a Eurocopter EC-135 Police Helicopter based at MOD St Athan, supported by NPAS43 at Bristol Filton Airport. * Missing Children's Unit (with several local councils) * Youth Offending Service (with several local councils, healthcare bodies, CAHMS, and Probation Service). * Joint Legal Services (with South Wales Police) * Joint Printing Unit (with South Wales Police) * Record Management (with South Wales Police) =Police stations and offices= Gwent Police operate both fully- fledged police stations, and several offices and shops that serve as points of contact with the public. For example, the police station at Abertillery closed due to budget cuts, but the police still maintain a presence at the local fire station. In Abergavenny, neighbourhood officers are available at a \\"one stop shop\\" shared with Monmouthshire County Council. On the other hand, several buildings are owned for operational or administrative purposes that are not open to the public, including the force headquarters in Cwmbran. Newport Central police station is the only front desk service that is available 24 hours a day, a custody suite is based at the station. Several front offices and stations have been partially or fully closed following a review of the function and role of front desks in police stations.

Rabbinic career Returning to Lithuania to complete his studies, Unterman was ordained as a rabbi by Rabbi Refael Shapiro, and by Rabbi Simcha Zelig Reguer, the Dayan of Brisk. He founded his own yeshiva in the town of Vishnyeva around 1910. Unterman served a variety of roles in the Lithuanian Jewish community until 1924, when he was selected to become the head rabbi of Liverpool. Unterman served in Liverpool for 22 years, becoming an important figure in the English Zionist movement and working to relieve the suffering of refugees in England during the Second World War. Rabbi Unterman (left) with Rabbi Shlomo Goren (right) In 1946, Unterman became the Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, a position he held for twenty years before being appointed Chief Rabbi of Israel. As Chief Rabbi, Unterman worked to reform the rabbinic court system and reach out to secular Israelis. He also wrote opinions on a variety of religious issues relevant to the young Jewish state, such as religious conversion and marriage law. He founded two advanced Talmudical academies (kollels), one in Tel Aviv and one in Jerusalem, designed to prepare select students for the rabbinate and educational positions, with an emphasis on systematic study of Talmud and practical halakhah.

But in 1972, he wrote that the rabbinic establishment needed to be more lenient with the anticipated Russian Aliyah, given the circumstances of their lives in the Soviet Union. While a convert's sincere intention to accept mitzvot is a necessary condition for conversion, the rabbi advocated a lenient approach when dealing with the conversion of non-Jewish spouses.

Their traditional homeland is in southern Afghanistan (Loy Kandahar region), straddling into Toba Achakzai in Balochistan, Pakistan, but they are also settled in other parts of Afghanistan and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Ahmad Shah Durrani, who is considered the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan, belonged to the Abdali tribe. In 1747, after establishing the Afghan Empire based in Kandahar, he adopted the epithet ShƒÅh Durr-i-DurrƒÅn, \\"King, Pearl of Pearls,\\" and changed the name of the tribe to \\"Durrani\\" after himself.The Hephthalites: Archaeological and Historical Analysis, Aydogdu Kurbanov, Berlin, 2010, page 242. Most Durranis speak southern Pashto, which is considered a prestigious variety of Pashto.  Descent and origin  Graveyard of 19th-century Durrani princes and princesses in Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan In the early modern period, the Abdali tribe of Pashtuns was first explicitly mentioned in Mughal and Safavid sources. For example, in the 1595 Mughal account Ain-i-Akbari, the Abdali were mentioned as one of the \\"Afghan ul≈´s\\" (Pashtun tribal confederacies) settled in Kandahar area, along with Tarƒ´n, Pa·πáƒ´, and KƒÅka·πõ. Some scholars have postulated that the Abdali descended from Hephthalite tribes, who settled in present-day Afghanistan in ancient times and were known as Œ∑Œ≤ŒøŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒø (Ebodalo) in Bactrian language. According to linguist Georg Morgenstierne, the tribal name AbdƒÅlƒ´ may have \\"something to do with\\" the Hephthalite.Morgenstierne, Georg. \\"The Linguistic Stratification of Afghanistan.\\" Afghan Studies 2 (1979): 23‚Äì33. This hypothesis was endorsed by historian Aydogdy Kurbanov, who indicated that after the collapse of the Hephthalite confederacy, they likely assimilated into different local populations and that the Abdali may be one of the tribes of Hephthalite origin.Kurbanov, Aydogdy. \\"The Hephthalites: Archaeological and Historical Analysis.\\" PhD dissertation, Free University of Berlin, 2010. 19th-century British Indian explorers, Charles Masson and Henry W.

Yu. V. Gankovsky, a Soviet historian on Afghanistan, also asserted that the Hephthalite contributed to the ethnogenesis of Durrani Pashtuns: =Mythical genealogy= According to a popular mythical genealogy, recorded by 17th- century Mughal courtier Nimat Allah al-Harawi in his book TƒÅrƒ´kh-i KhƒÅn JahƒÅnƒ´ wa Makhzan-i AfghƒÅnƒ´, the Abdali tribe descended from their eponymous ancestor AbdƒÅl (or AwdƒÅl), who was son of Tarƒ´n, who was son of Sharkhb≈´n, who was son of Sa·πõban (progenitor of the Sarbani tribal confederacy), who was son of Qais Abdur Rashid (progenitor of all Pashtuns). Qais Abdur Rashid was a descendant of Afghana, who was described as a grandson of the Israelite king Saul and commander-in-chief of the army of prophet Solomon. Qais was claimed to be a contemporary of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a kinsman of Arab commander Khalid ibn al-Walid. When Khalid ibn al-Walid summoned Qais from Ghor to Medina, Qais accepted Islam and the prophet renamed him Abdur Rashƒ´d (meaning \\"Servant of the Guide to the Right Path\\" or \\"Servant of God\\" in Arabic). Abdur Rashid returned to Ghor and introduced Islam there. The book stated that Abdur Rashid's great-grandson, Tarƒ´n, had three sons: \\"One was black in complexion, and he was named T≈çr (meaning \\"black\\" in Pashto); the other was white in complexion, and he was named Spƒ´n (meaning \\"white\\" in Pashto); his third son was named AbdƒÅl (or AwdƒÅl).\\" The first two sons were the progenitors of modern Tareens, who are closely related to Durranis and are divided into two clans (Tor Tareen and Spin Tareen), while the third son was the progenitor of modern Durranis.Tareen or Tarin. 10 April 2015. Khyber.ORG. The 1595 Mughal account Ain-i-Akbari also mentioned the tradition of Israelite descent among Pashtuns, which shows that the tradition was already popular among 16th-century Pashtuns. History During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Abdali were primarily pastoralists, not known for agricultural activities, but some of them were engaged in overland trade. Abdali and Tarin (a Pashtun tribe related to Abdalis) chieftains were patronized by both Safavid and Mughal appointed governors, and asked to patrol travel routes to ensure the safety of merchant caravans passing through Kandahar, which was a province located on a strategic trade corridor linking Hindustan, Iran, and Turkestan. =Hotak dynasty= King Mahmud Hotak (1717-1725), whose mother Khanzada Sadozai was a Durrani The first Ghilji Emir of the Hotak dynasty, Mirwais Hotak (1709‚Äì1715), was married to Khanzada Sadozai, daughter of Abdali chief Jafar Khan Sadozai. This cemented a Ghilji-Abdali alliance that played an integral role in Mirwais' rise to political authority in Kandahar and in the successful revolt against the Safavids.The Pearl of Pearls: The AbdƒÅlƒ´-DurrƒÅnƒ´ Confederacy and Its Transformation under A·∏•mad ShƒÅh, Durr-i DurrƒÅn by Sajjad Nejatie. https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/80750. A product of the marriage, Mahmud Hotak, conquered Iran in 1722, and the Iranian city of Isfahan remained the dynasty's capital for six years. During the Hotak rule, an Abdali contingent went to Herat to assume control of the province, replacing the former Safavid appointed governors. Zaman Khan Abdali, father of Ahmad Shah Durrani, was one of the Abdali governors of Herat. =Durrani Empire= Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747‚Äì1772), founder of the Afghan Empire In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani established the Durrani Empire with its capital at Kandahar. He adopted the title ShƒÅh Durr-i-DurrƒÅn, \\"King, Pearl of Pearls,\\" and changed the name of his tribe \\"Abdali\\" to \\"Durrani\\" after himself. Ahmad Shah is now regarded as the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan. Within a few years, he extended his control from Khorasan in the west to Kashmir and North India in the east, and from the Amu Darya in the north to the Arabian Sea in the south. =Barakzai dynasty= King Amanullah Khan (1919‚Äì1929), under whom Afghanistan gained independence over its foreign policy from the British Raj Queen Soraya Tarzi, wife of King Amanullah Khan In 1823, Emir Dost Mohammad Khan, who belonged to the Barakzai tribe of Durranis, founded the Barakzai dynasty centered at Kabul. Thereafter, his descendants ruled in direct succession until 1929 when King Amanullah Khan, under whom Afghanistan gained independence over its foreign policy from the British Raj, was forced to abdicate and his cousin Mohammed Nadir Shah was later elected king. The Barakzai dynasty ruled present-day Afghanistan until 1973 when Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last Barakzai king, was overthrown in a bloodless coup by his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan. The coup ended the Barakzai kingdom and established the Republic of Afghanistan (1973‚Äì1978). =Contemporary period= Hamid Karzai, former Afghan president (2001‚Äì2014) and leader of the Popalzai clan of Durranis Contemporarily, the former Afghan president Hamid Karzai (2001‚Äì2014) is the leader of the Popalzai clan of Durranis.Taliban run-in highlights dangers for Afghan opposition leader . 6 November 2001. Pashto dialect Although many are bilingual in Dari Persian, the Durrani of southern Afghanistan speak Southern Pashto, also known as \\"Kandahari Pashto\\", the \\"soft\\" dialect of Pashto. It is considered one of the most prestigious varieties of Pashto. This dialect retains archaic retroflex sibilants and , which have merged into other phonemes in other dialects. Southern Pashto also preserves the affricates and , which have merged into and in some dialects. The Tareen (Tarin) tribe is historically closely related to Durranis. Although most Tareens speak Southern Pashto, a small section of the Spin clan of Tareens living east of Quetta speaks the unique Wanetsi (Tareeno) dialect of Pashto, which is considered by some linguists to be distinctive enough to be classified as its own language.

He was also a recurring guest on many shows that include The 700 Club, Sid Roth's It's Supernatural, Benny Hinn's This Is Your Day program, and Joni Lamb's Table Talk among others. At one time he was a member of the controversial Kansas City Prophets, whose practice and doctrine came under fire in the 1980s and '90s.Bill Jackson The Quest for the Radical Middle (Cape Town: Vineyard, 1999) chapter 13 He was the founder of Streams Ministries International, a Christian group that deals especially with the practice known as prophecy.

The Coming Perfect Storm In what Jackson referred to as a revelation from the Lord, he released a statement in 2008 called The Coming Perfect Storm. In this statement, he spoke of a time coming to America and the world in which economic, military, religious, political, and geophysical issues and events would occur in a relatively small period of time to make up a perfect storm of calamity. In the summer of 2009, Jackson was a guest on Sid Roth's It's Supernatural! radio and television program which aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network, The Inspiration Network, GOD TV, Daystar and other regional television stations. In the interview, Jackson describes in detail the events that were revealed to him. \\"I saw the year 2010 was going to be very difficult, especially as you get further into 2010.

The angel did not tell me about those woes. But there was more emphasis on those woes than almost anything else that I was given.\\" In a 2011 web video series called \\"The Perfect Storm Revisited\\", Jackson elaborated more on his original message. In this video, he clarified his earlier statements regarding the year 2012. While stating he still did not know the details of what these \\"woes\\" were, he affirmed that he did not believe it would be anything on an apocalyptic or global destructive scale (making a reference to the film 2012).The Perfect Storm Revisited: Part 2 The subject of The Perfect Storm has been discussed on multiple mainstream television programs, including Joni Table Talk, and Sid Roth's, It's Supernatural!

A Democrat, he represents the 34th district, which encompasses parts of northern Orange County and a small portion of Long Beach. Previously, he served in the California State Assembly, representing the 69th District. He is a partner at Umberg Zipser LLP in Orange County. Military service and family Born in Cincinnati, Ohio of German ancestry, Umberg graduated with honors from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1977. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army, then promoted to Captain. Umberg served with the 2nd Infantry Division in South Korea and with NATO forces in Italy during his time in the army. Umberg also served as a paratrooper with the US Army Special Operations Command, US Army Special Warfare Center and the XVIIIth Airborne Corp. Umberg completed the Harvard University, Kennedy School of Public Policy, Program for Senior Executives in National Security. He was also awarded a master's degree in Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College. Umberg remained in the U.S. Army Reserve, rising to the rank of Colonel. He was reactivated as a prosecutor of terrorist suspects, and he received a Joint Services Commendation Medal for his contribution in Guantanamo. Umberg was also recalled to active duty in 2009 to serve as Chief, Anti-Corruption in Afghanistan. Umberg's military decorations include: the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal (2d award), the US Coast Guard Distinguished Public Service Award, the Army Commendation Medal (2d award), the Army Achievement Medal. Umberg is married to Brigadier General (USA) Robin Umberg, and has three children, Brett, Tommy, and Erin Umberg. Tommy and Erin Umberg are both attending law school at UC Berkeley. Early career After receiving his Juris Doctor degree from UC Hastings College of the Law in 1980, he was appointed an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Orange County. He had a 100% conviction rate prosecuting drug dealers, gang members, white collar criminals, and civil rights cases. He also served as a military prosecutor between 1980 and 1985. Elected office =First stint in Assembly= Umberg was first elected to the California State Assembly in 1990, defeating incumbent Republican Curt Pringle. Umberg was re-elected in 1992. While in the Assembly he served as Chairman of the Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee. Instead of seeking a third term in 1994, Umberg ran for Attorney General of California but lost to Republican Dan Lungren. =Clinton Administration= Umberg then joined the law firm of Morrison & Foerster LLP in 1995 as a partner. He was the Managing Partner of Morrison & Foerster's Orange County Office from 2003 until 2005. During the 1996 presidential election, he served as the chairman of the Clinton re-election campaign in California. Clinton appointed Umberg as the Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in 1997. =Second stint in Assembly= In 2000, Umberg left the Clinton administration and returned to California. In 2002, he lost the Democratic Party nomination for State Insurance Commissioner to John Garamendi. In 2004, Umberg won election to the Assembly to represent the 69th District. During his third term, Umberg chaired the Elections and Redistriciting Committee. While in the legislature, Umberg authored over 60 measures which became law. These laws include measures dealing with hate crimes, white collar crime, campaign finance reform, high-speed rail transport and school meal programs. =2006 Senate campaign= Umberg sought the seat of retiring State Senator Joe Dunn (D) in the 2006 elections. Orange County Supervisor and former Assemblyman Lou Correa jumped in the race in January 2006 despite pressure from the local Democratic party for him to stay out (although with pressure from the state Democratic party for him to jump in), stating that he was running in part because of the allegations about Umberg's residency. Aside from other negative articles, Umberg also received criticism that he voted to legalize gay marriage.Quach, Hahn Kim \\"34th Senate race likely to get heated, expensive.\\" The Orange County Register. January 26, 2006. Local 1. Umberg attempted to get Correa off the ballot because Correa submitted more than the number of signatures required to qualify for the ballot, but ultimately failed.Joseph, Brian. \\"Judge upholds Correa's right to remain in Senate primary.\\" The Orange County Register. March 29, 2006. Local 6.

May 9, 2006. Page B4. Umberg was defeated by Correa by a 60% to 40% margin, and Correa went on to narrowly win the general election. =Orange County Supervisorial campaign= After Correa won the general election for the state Senate by a 1% margin, Umberg entered the race to replace Correa on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, representing the 1st Supervisorial District. 52% of 1st Supervisorial District voters are also voters in the 69th Assembly District, formerly represented by Umberg. 73% of 1st Supervisorial District voters are also 34th Senate District voters, so Umberg was believed to be the favorite.

Laughing gull showing the wing shape emulated in gull wing aircraft. The gull wing is an aircraft wing configuration, known also as Pulaski wings, with a prominent bend in the wing inner section towards the wing root. Its name is derived from the seabirds which it resembles. It has been incorporated in aircraft for many reasons.  Sailplanes  The gull wing was first seen on a glider when the Weltensegler flew in 1921. Its wings were externally braced and featured swept-back wingtips. After the aircraft broke up, killing its pilot, the design feature stayed out of popular use. The gull wing made a resurgence in 1930 with Alexander Lippisch's record-breaking Fafnir. Lippisch used the configuration for its increased wingtip clearance and the ill-founded belief it improved stability in turns. However, studies have shown that normal gull wing configurations have significantly less severe and more easily recoverable stalls. Inverted gull wings show the opposite stall behaviour, but both normal and inverted gull wings impede lift-to-drag ratio and climb performance. The true success of the Fafnir's gull wing lay primarily in its aesthetic value; the gull wing would be a staple of the high-performance sailplanes of the time, until the 1950s. ;Notable gull wing sailplanes: * Bowlus Senior Albatross * DFS Habicht * DFS Kranich * DFS Reiher * G√∂ppingen G√∂ 3 Minimoa * Lawrence Tech IV \\"Yankee Doodle\\" * Lippisch Fafnir * Ross RS-1 Zanonia * Schweyer Rh√∂nsperber * Slingsby Kite * Weltensegler Seaplanes Beriev Be-12 seaplane with gull wing profile The gull wing design found its way into seaplanes by the early 1930s. As engine power increased, so did the need for large propellers that could effectively convert power to thrust. The gull wing allowed designers to ensure adequate propeller tip clearance over the water by placing the engines on the highest point of the wing. The alternative was placing the engine on a pylon. Possibly the first flying boat to utilize the gull wing configuration was the Short Knuckleduster, which flew in 1933. The Dornier Do 26, a high-speed airliner and transport platform, of which 6 aircraft were built, flew in 1938. The configuration was also used on the US Navy's PBM Mariner and P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft. The emergence of long range, land-based jets in the 1950s and the subsequent demise of the seaplane prevented widespread use of the gull wing, although it was still used in some post-war designs, like Beriev Be-12 Chaika (the name means 'the gull' in Russian). Examples: * Beriev Be-6 * Dornier Do 26 * Martin P5M Marlin * Piaggio P.136 * Short Knuckleduster Landplanes PZL P.11c, showing an idea of original Pulawski's gull wing The gull wing design found its way into landplanes in the late 1920s, with Polish inventor Zygmunt Pulawski designing the PZL P.1 in 1928 and applying for a patent in 1929. The arrangement he devised is occasionally known as the \\"Pulawski Wing\\" or the \\"Polish wing\\". The gull wing was used to improve visibility in a high wing arrangement, because such wing could be thinnest by the fuselage, and in theory should limit pilot's view no more than A-pillars of a windscreen in a car body. It was used in fighter aircraft like PZL P.11 and Polikarpov I-15. Examples: * PZL P.1 * PZL P.7 * PZL P.11 * PZL P.24 * Polikarpov I-153 * Loire 46 Inverted gull wing Junkers Ju 87 Stuka German ground-attack aircraft of WWII F4U Corsair landing on USS Bunker Hill Aichi B7A carrying torpedo. The inverted gull wing was also developed in the 1930s and was chiefly used on single engine military aircraft with increasingly powerful engines. Before contra-rotating propellers came into use, such powers required larger diameter propellers but clearance between the propeller tip and ground had to be maintained. Long landing gear legs are heavy, bulky, and weaker than their shorter counterparts. The Vought F4U Corsair, designed from the onset as a carrier-based fighter, not only had the largest propeller of any U.S. fighter, but was also expected to face rough landings aboard a pitching carrier deck. The inverted gull wing allowed the landing gear to be short and strong, and to retract straight back (while twisting through 90¬∫ to place the mainwheels atop the lower gear strut ends), improving internal wing space. An additional aerodynamic advantage was that the wing/fuselage connection is perpendicular and has inherently lower drag than any other connection. Another reason for having an inverted gull wing is to permit clearance for a large external bomb load, as on the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka.

Beginning in April 1993, the Secret City Saga books consisted of three four- issue miniseries (Jack Kirby's Secret City Saga, Satan's Six, TeenAgents) and three one-shot specials (Captain Glory, Nightglider, and Bombast), which were all preceded by the one-shot promotional giveaway, Jack Kirby's Secret City Saga #0. The concept itself saw Topps lease Kirby's name alongside the characters, and saw the line referred to as \\"The Kirbyverse\\". All the characters resided in the same shared universe, and the deal also presented the final time that Kirby had complete creative control over any of the many properties that he had created in his career. It was initially seen as a creative and financial failure. The line consisted of leftover concepts Kirby had developed years prior, and generated low sales and minimal reader interest, finding a niche only with hard-core Kirby fans.Evanier, Mark. Kirby: King of Comics (2008), Abrams, p.207. The Secret City The Secret City Saga chronicled the adventures of three heroes, Captain Glory, Nightglider and Bombast. As revealed in Jack Kirby's Secret City Saga #0 (April 1993), at some point in pre-recorded history \\"fifteen millennia before our own\\", there existed a race of beings known as \\"the Ninth Men\\". \\"Ninth Men\\" is part of Kirby's fictional concept that civilized human society tends to repeat itself in cycles, starting off in a primitive state and later evolving and advancing in intelligence and technology until factors such as greed and arrogance then lead to said society's collapse and destruction...only to be replaced later by another race of humanoids, who tend to repeat the mistakes (unknowingly) of the prior society. This is also a theme that Kirby touched upon briefly in his more popular Fourth World books published by DC Comics in the early 1970s. The Ninth Men populated Gazra, a society which advanced to the point in which it was harvesting the full potential of an integrated community, with its technological advancements having been made with an organic theme, instead of machine-based. Yet their environment itself seemed to turn against them in the form of huge, nearly planet-wide storms destroying all in their path. As a contingency, the scientific and military leaders of Gazra placed three of their citizens into hibernation, with hopes that these three would survive \\"the Great Catastrophe\\" (a term used for these planet-wide storms) to spread the ideals of the society of the Ninth Men onto the next age of Man....which is revealed to be us, present-day humankind. The three citizens were: Keltan, a captain in Gazra's Science Team security forces, who upon awakening would assume the name Captain Glory. Glida, who upon release from hibernation would assume the name Nightglider. As indicated in Secret City Saga #0, this may have been an \\"official\\" term for her and/or her kin during her days in Gazra, for she possesses bodily modification that would foster the abilities of flight, such as a hollow bone structure. Bombast, who seems to have been a member of Gazra's military, possibly of some sort of demolitions or heavy ordnance team, whose official term seems to have been \\"hurlers\\". Skilled at ballistics and explosives. The Kirbyverse The four-issue Secret City Saga miniseries told the story of the three Ninth Men's first adventure in the present day. After release from hibernation, they discover and attempt to foil a plot whose origin lay in the last days of Gazra, involving an evil duplicate of then-President Bill Clinton. Other residents of the Kirbyverse Satan's Six were a team of agents of the Kirbyverse's interpretation of Satan himself, created for the sole purpose of causing chaos in the mortal plane. But the continued incompetence of the members always seemed to be their downfall (and humanity's benefit). Members included: Brian Bluedragon, a doltish knight of Arthur's court, Hard Luck Harrigan, a petty gambler and bookie who worked in the 1930s criminal underworld, Dr. Mordius, a Henry Jekyll wannabe, Kuga the Lion-Killer, a warrior of African origin, Dezira, of ancient Babylon, and Frightful, a demon in Satan's employ whose job it was to keep the members in line....a \\"drill instructor from Hell\\", so to speak.... The TeenAgents were a group of four teenaged denizens of the Inner City populated by descendants of humans who fled the surface world from persecution as witches and warlocks and discovered and salvaged remnants of the Ninth Men's world that somehow survived \\"the Great Catastrophe\\". Their job was to intervene should any of the wild (and most times, monstrous) creatures that populate the bowels of the Earth try to attack the surface world (or as they referred to it, \\"Upworld\\"). After speculation, it might be safe to say that these subterraean creatures might possibly have been some of the \\"ordinary\\" wildlife that populated the Ninth Men's prehistoric times. Members of the TeenAgents included: Aurik, who possessed the power to control his own mass and density, Dijit, who possessed gloves that each individual finger was endowed with the ability to project a different form of force bolt (fire, electricity, etc., etc.,), Seera, a female who could transform herself into a vaporous state, allowing her the abilities of flight (and seemed to have slight empathic abilities), and the Kreech, a young female shapeshifter. Silver Star, a previous Kirby creation, was a government agent appointed the task of fighting superhuman enemies. A genetic mutant, classified as Homo geneticus, Morgan Miller was the result of genetic experimentation of his father, Dr. Bradford Miller. Possessing of incredible superhuman strength, Miller's abilities are also a curse, for each time he uses his powers it physically drains his life force. Miller is quoted to have said, \\"What's up with this super secret shanigans?\\" Captain Victory, another of Kirby's previous independent comic book endeavours. Victory is the leader of an extraterrestrial intergalactic police force, which visits then-present day (1982) Earth. With the publication of Victory #1, though, it seems that Victory's Pacific Comics' exploits are, continuity-wise, difficult to reconcile with the Kirbyverse's \\"present\\" (supposedly circa early 1990s). Loose ends What would have become the final two installments of the Secret City Saga, a new Silver Star miniseries, and a new Capt. Victory book, Victory, which were both billed as four-issue miniseries, only saw the publication of the first issues before the plug was pulled on the books. The final three issues of each have yet to be published. Both Silver Star, the Secret City heroes and Captain Victory resurfaced in 2011 in Kirby: Genesis, written by Kurt Busiek, who was also the author of the never-published Silver Star issues.

It is set in the Star Trek universe but, as part of the \\"Shatnerverse,\\" does not follow the timeline established by other Star Trek novels. The book's sequel is Avenger. Plot summary The novel begins on the planet Veridian III and takes place shortly after the events seen in the motion picture Star Trek Generations. The body of James T. Kirk is stolen by the Romulans after his burial by fellow Starfleet captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Borg have formed an alliance with the Romulan Star Empire in order to destroy the Federation. Using alien technology, the Borg bring Kirk back to life and his katra is restored, but false memories are implanted to turn him against the Federation. The goal of this secret alliance is to destroy Picard and therefore Starfleet's only defense against the Borg but, despite his conditioning, Kirk is able to resist commands to kill Worf, Data, and Geordi La Forge, all of whom are attacked by him during his search for Picard. Simultaneously, Picard and Dr. Beverly Crusher are participating in a strike team in a Federation expedition to an assimilated colony, where they are forced to sneak on board the fleeing Borg vessel. While on board, they are able to move freely around the vessel and they learn of the Borg/Romulan Alliance. Spock also learns of this alliance when he is captured dealing with Romulans, but the Borg do not assimilate him as, for some reason, they believe Spock is already Borg. Kirk is eventually captured on Deep Space Nine attempting to kill Commander William Riker, and the implant that was responsible for his false memories is removed by the joint efforts of Dr. Julian Bashir and Admiral Leonard McCoy; McCoy acts as an advisor during the surgery while Bashir's younger, fitter hands perform the operation. Although Kirk retains the drives implanted in him by the device, leading him to a confrontation with Picard in a holodeck re-creation of the original USS Enterprise, Spock is able to remove the commands thanks to a mind meld. In the process, they learn that V'ger, the former Voyager 6, was actually upgraded by a division of the Borg Collective, which explains why the Borg did not assimilate Spock; they assumed the trace of V'ger in his mind from their meld (in Star Trek: The Motion Picture) was an actual link to the Collective. This also gives Starfleet another advantage; thanks to the meld, Spock knows the location of the Borg homeworld. Taking a Defiant-class starship (renamed Enterprise for the mission), the Enterprise-D senior staff, accompanied by Kirk, Spock and McCoy, travel directly to the Borg homeworld thanks to a stolen transwarp drive. Once there, the Enterprise neutralizes the Borg/Romulan fleet around the planet with a wave, dampening the Borg's communication and making them unable to maintain their link to the Collective, effectively neutralizing them. Taking this as a distraction, Kirk and Picard beam down to the planet in search of the Borg central node. Using Picard's memories as Locutus, they track down the Borg central node which, when deactivated, will sever the Borg Collective; every Borg ship will be separate from every other ship, and what can defeat one will always work a second time. However, the result will cause a cataclysmic explosion that will kill whoever operates the node. Picard and Kirk debate on who will go, each attempting to be the hero and sacrifice themselves. Kirk appears to give in and let Picard pull the lever, but he takes the sudden calm to knock Picard out and beam his unconscious body back up to the Enterprise. Kirk then pulls the lever and triggers the explosion. However, even as the crew watches, Spock, who has always been able to sense Kirk ever since they first mind-melded, still does not believe that his friend is dead. Background Shortly after the release of Star Trek Generations, William Shatner pitched the story of Kirk being brought back to life by the Borg for the next Star Trek film. While Paramount was interested in using the Borg for the next movie, they also felt the torch had been passed and the next movie should feature just the Next Generation cast. The working title for the book was The Fires of Olympus. Reception Gideon Kibblewhite reviewed The Return for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Kibblewhite comments that \\"There is enough pace and action, enough in-jokes, enough of wide-eyed Kirk whispering 'Spock!' fiercely (yes, all the old favourites are wheeled on literally, in one case), and quite enough of Kirk rolling around as if he was 30, but not one new idea, character or race is introduced.\\" See also * List of Star Trek novels References External links Category:Novels based on Star Trek: The Original Series Category:Novels based on Star Trek: The Next Generation Category:Novels by William Shatner Category:1996 American novels Category:Novels by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens Category:Pocket Books books Category:Resurrection in fiction ","title":"The Return (Shatner novel)"},{"id":"2379550","text":"Nungambakkam is a locality in downtown Chennai, India.

The first system was initially observed near the Windward Islands on September 6\\\\. The last system to dissipate, the fourth storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 11, while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Between October 5 and October 10, the fourth and fifth system existed simultaneously. Of the season's five tropical cyclones, only one reached hurricane status, the fewest since 1890. Furthermore, that storm strengthened into major hurricane, which is Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. This storm, which was the fourth and strongest hurricane of the season, peaked at Category 3 strength with 120 mph (195 km/h) winds. It was also attributed to at least six fatalities after sending a rogue wave across the steerage of the steamer Campania. The first storm also resulted in two deaths after a schooner wrecked in Barbados. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 28, the lowest value since 1864. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1905 till:01/12/1905 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1905 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:06/09/1905 till:08/09/1905 color:TS text:\\"One\\" (TS) from:11/09/1905 till:16/09/1905 color:TS text:\\"Two\\" (TS) from:24/09/1905 till:30/09/1905 color:TS text:\\"Three\\" (TS) from:01/10/1905 till:11/10/1905 color:C3 text:\\"Four\\" (C3) from:04/10/1905 till:10/10/1905 color:TS text:\\"Five\\" (TS) bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1905 till:01/09/1905 text:August from:01/09/1905 till:01/10/1905 text:September from:01/10/1905 till:01/11/1905 text:October from:01/11/1905 till:01/12/1905 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Tropical Storm One= The first storm of the season, already at tropical storm intensity, was identified on September 6 to the east of Grenada. A small storm, it quickly passed through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September 7. The next day, the storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating as a shallow but large system. A schooner sailing from Bridgetown to Suriname encountered heavy seas just a day out of port and turned back. It was thrown onto the pierhead and wrecked. The captain and a crewman were swept overboard and drowned. =Tropical Storm Two= HURDAT indicates that a tropical storm originated to the northeast of the Windward Islands on September 11\\\\. Steadily tracking towards the west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified, reaching its peak intensity with winds estimated at 60 mph (95 km/h) on September 13\\\\. After turning northwestward, the system slowed and began to weaken. By September 16, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated shortly thereafter. =Tropical Storm Three= Based on weather reports from the Weather Bureau Office in New Orleans, Louisiana, a tropical storm was first observed about 20 miles (30 km) north-northwest of Swan Island on September 24\\\\. The storm strengthened slightly before making landfall near Punta Allen, Quintana Roo around 1200 UTC on September 25\\\\. Early on the following day, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and headed north- northwestward. At midday on September 26, it peaked with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm re-curved north-northeastward late on September 28, while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 1000 UTC the next day, this system made landfall in extreme southwest Vermilion Parish, Louisiana at the same intensity. The storm slowly weakened inland and dissipated over Arkansas on September 30\\\\. Strong winds and rough seas were reported along the central Gulf Coast of the United States, forcing ships to remain in port. =Hurricane Four= On October 1, a tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Moving slowly north- northeastward, it reached tropical storm status early on October 3\\\\. The following day, the storm curved northeastward. Kingston, Jamaica recorded rainfall as the system bypassed the island. Late on October 5 and early on October 6, the storm passed through the Windward Passage. Eastern Cuba was affected \\"with some force\\", but damage was not significant. Entering the Atlantic Ocean, the system passed through the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands without causing damage. While centered about halfway between Bermuda and Turks and Caicos Islands, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Later on October 8, it deepened to a Category 2 hurricane, while passing south of Bermuda. The island experienced gale-force winds with gusts reaching hurricane force, but damage was apparently minimal. Early on October 9, the storm intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and peaked with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). On October 10, it weakened to a Category 2 and then became extratropical early the next day. The steamer Campania encountered the remnants of the storm and was reported to have been struck by a large rogue wave, which was described as \\"disastrous.\\" The ship roll and water moved across the steerage, sweeping five passengers into the ocean, they presumably drowned. At least 30 other people were injured, one of them fatally. The extratropical remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea on October 13\\\\. =Tropical Storm Five= A tropical storm was first observed in the Gulf of Mexico on October 5, while located about 105 miles (170 km) north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The storm strengthened slowly while crossing the Gulf of Mexico and peaked with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) early on October 8\\\\. At 1700 UTC on the following day, it made landfall near Morgan City, Louisiana at the same intensity. The system quickly weakened inland and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi on October 10\\\\. The extratropical remnants dissipated over Virginia on October 11\\\\. The remnants of this storm brought heavy rains to the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada.

An Amiga version was released in 1990. The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft. Following the success of Red Baron, version 1.5 was released in 1991 which included Gulf War missions and improved graphics and sounds. Several mission packs were sold separately. A sequel published by Sierra, Silent Thunder: A-10 Tank Killer II, was released in 1996. Gameplay The gameplay consists of the player piloting an A-10 Thunderbolt II \\"tank killer\\" through various combat missions set in the Gulf War air campaign as well as a fictional European scenario. The player receives a mission briefing, has the opportunity to customize a weapon load- out before starting the mission, and is debriefed after the mission. Reception According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of A-10 Tank Killer and its sequel surpassed 250,000 units by the end of March 1996. Computer Gaming World stated that \\"A-10 has much going for it\\" and gave it four stars out of five. The magazine recommended the game for those looking for quick fun, not \\"flight grognards\\" seeking realism. In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title three-plus stars out of five, liking the graphics but noting the \\"very sensitive\\" joystick control. The DOS version of the game received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Because of the violence level of A-10 Tank Killer, it has been placed on the \\"Index\\" in Germany and is not generally available to the public. See also *Red Baron (1990) *A-10 Attack!

This differs from a lift bridge or table bridge, which operate by raising the roadway. Two submersible bridges exist across the Corinth Canal in Greece, one at each end, in Isthmia and Corinth. They lower the centre span to 8 metres below water level when they give way to ships crossing the channel. The submersible bridge's primary advantage over the similar lift bridge is that there is no structure above the shipping channel and thus no height limitation on ship traffic. This is particularly important for sailing vessels. Additionally, the lack of an above-deck structure is considered aesthetically pleasing, a similarity shared with the Chicago-style bascule bridge and the table bridge. However, the presence of the submerged bridge structure limits the draft of vessels in the waterway. The term submersible bridge is also sometimes applied to a non-movable bridge that is designed to withstand submersion and high currents when the water level rises. Such a bridge is more properly called a low water bridge.

This special Bangla service of All India Radio was launched in the wake of the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and played a key role during the war, broadcasting Indian news bulletins in Bangladesh. It continued till April 2010 but was discontinued thereafter due to decommissioning of the Super Power Transmitter at Chinsurah. The headquarters of the Hooghly District Sports Association (HDSA) and the famous district Sadar hospital Imambara Sadar Hospital is situated here. Chinsurah is also the home of the oldest Armenian church in India and old Hindu Temples. Etymology Lu√≠s de Ata√≠de, 1st Marquis of Santar√©m, Viceroy of Portuguese India. Hooghly-Chuchura was a municipality formed by the merging of two towns, Hugli and Chinsura, in 1865. The names are spelled in other ways including Hooghly, Hugli, Hughli, Ugulim (in Portuguese), Chinsura, Chunchura, Chuchro and Chinsurah. State Highway 6/ Grand Trunk Road (G.T. Road) passes through the town. Chuchura and Hooghly are historic stations on the Howrah- Bardhaman main line of the Eastern Railway. Ferry services across the Hooghly River serves as a link with the district of North 24 Parganas. History A View of Chinsura the Dutch settlement in Bengal The Portuguese founded the town of Hooghly-Chuchura in 1579, but the district has thousands of years of heritage in the form of the great kingdom of Bhurshut. The city flourished as a trading port and some religious structures were built. One such structure is a Christian church dedicated to a statue of Mary, brought by the Portuguese. In the 17th century, political disorder struck the city and the Mughal governor of Bengal expelled the Portuguese. The fleeing Portuguese lost the statue in the river, but local people later found it on the river bank. The arrested Portuguese were taken to Delhi, where a death sentence of trampling by elephants was decreed. When the emperor Shah Jahan heard this he ordered the priests released and granted a piece of land on the bank of the river Hooghly, where the statue of Mary was reestablished. There the Portuguese constructed a church to house the statue, which still receives pilgrims today. The church was renovated in the 1980s and has been declared as a basilica by the authority of Rome. In 1656 the Dutch erected a factory on the site of the town. At that time Calcutta was the principal settlement in Dutch Bengal, who used it as a base for Dutch intra-Asian trade in opium, saltpetre, spices, cotton and indigo. In 1759 the garrison of Chinsura, on its march to Chandernagore, attacked a British force under Colonel Forde. The Battle of Chinsurah lasted less than half an hour and ended with the rout of the Dutch attackers. In 1795, during the Napoleonic wars, a British garrison occupied the settlement. The peace of 1814 restored Hughli to the Dutch. However, in 1825, the Dutch ceded many of their possession in India to the British, in exchange for the British possessions in Sumatra. Both Chinsurah and Hooghly played a role in the Bengal renaissance and the Indian independence movement. \\"Vande Mataram\\", India's national song, was composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay at Joraghat in Chinsurah, who had been an alumnus of the Hooghly Collegiate School. Nazrul Islam's revolutionary songs were penned while he was imprisoned by the British in Hooghly Jail. Geography Map of hooghly chinsurah municipality =Location= Hugli-Chuchura is located at .

The Transcript is also the oldest media outlet of the Denver metropolitan area. It is published by Mile High Newspapers in Golden, Colorado. Newspaper history This newspaper was established as the Colorado Transcript in Golden on December 19, 1866. It was begun by George West, one of the founding fathers of Golden, who came west as leader of the Boston Company during the Colorado Gold Rush in 1859. West began his journalistic career as an apprentice of the newspaper of Claremont, New Hampshire, continuing as a journalist at the Boston Transcript. After coming west, he fortuitously helped William N. Byers publish the first extra edition of the Rocky Mountain News on June 11, 1859, and then with his partners in the Boston Company established Colorado's fourth newspaper, the Western Mountaineer, in Golden on December 4, 1859. After that newspaper ceased operating in 1860, West fought with the Union Army in the American Civil War, and resumed his journalistic career as Local Editor of the News in 1865. With money West saved he established Colorado's eighth newspaper, and Golden's third newspaper, in 1866. He named it the Transcript after his old newspaper, the Boston Transcript, which published from 1830‚Äì1941 on Milk Street across from the Old South Meeting House in Boston. The namesake has now outlived the 110-year career of the original. Originally a weekly, the Transcript would continue publishing along this line for a century. Its founder remained at the helm for 40 years, a remarkable accomplishment in Colorado journalism, until his death in 1906. An ardent Democrat, West used his paper often to promote Democratic candidates and causes. He also was a tireless promoter of Golden and constantly reported on and encouraged its growth and progress. Upon his death the newspaper passed to his son, Harley Dean West, a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and it remained in the West family for some years. During the 1960s the newspaper became a twice-weekly, three days a week, and finally a daily newspaper, publishing on weekdays throughout the 1970s. It resumed being twice weekly in the 1980s, and resumed being a weekly in the 2000s. Through the years the Transcript outlasted skilled and serious competition, including the Golden Globe (1872‚Äì1919); Jefferson County Republican (1919‚Äì46); and Golden Outlook (1940s‚Äì90s). The Golden Transcript carries the remarkable distinction of having never missed an edition throughout its publishing history. This has been accomplished despite such events as a major paper shortage that caused it to print on single sheets of wrapping paper in 1869 and a fire that struck it as a daily in 1978. As of December 24, 2009, the Transcript has published 10,832 total issues. Homes of the Transcript The Golden Transcript has been headquartered at five locations: * Boston Building ‚Äì 1005 Washington Avenue, Golden (1866‚Äì67, now destroyed) * Loveland Block ‚Äì 1225 Washington Avenue, Golden (1867‚Äì70, second building of that name, now destroyed) * Transcript Building ‚Äì 1115 Washington Avenue, Golden (1870‚Äì1967) * Transcript Building ‚Äì 1000 10th Street, Golden (1967‚Äì2007) * ClickData Building ‚Äì 110 North Rubey Drive, Golden (2007‚Äì2014) * Washington Station ‚Äì 722 Washington Ave, Golden (2014‚Äìpresent) In 1978 the Hesteds Building (1225 Washington Avenue, now destroyed) became the emergency quarters from which the Transcript was published after its headquarters was damaged by fire on November 4, 1978. Ironically, the paper was printed on exactly the same site as its second home. Other Transcript newspapers Through time companion editions of the Transcript have been published by its creators. These include Golden's original daily edition, reporting on the Colorado Territorial Legislature, published from 1866‚Äì67; the Denver edition, published in 1875; and the Wheat Ridge edition (originally Jefferson County edition), published from 1982 to the present. These are considered distinct publications apart from the original Transcript.

He is the former City Attorney of Los Angeles (2001-09). Career *Teacher/Coach, Los Angeles Unified School District, Franklin *Attorney, O‚ÄôMelveny & Myers *Director of Business Development, Rebuild LA *Deputy Mayor of Economic Development, Office of Mayor Richard Riordan *Elected City Attorney of Los Angeles 2001 *Re-elected City Attorney of Los Angeles 2005 *CEO of Los Angeles County Medical Association 2011 *Partner, Liner LLP 2011 Biography Delgadillo is a native of Highland Park, Los Angeles. He attended Harvard College, where he won the Robert F. Kennedy Award given each year to a member of the varsity football team. He went on to Columbia Law School, graduating in 1986. He passed the California State Bar in 1986. After a short period in private practice at the prestigious Los Angeles law firm O'Melveny & Meyers, he joined Rebuild LA, a non-profit formed in the wake of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. He later joined the administration of Mayor Richard Riordan, eventually becoming deputy mayor for economic development. He ran against former Governor and Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown in the 2006 race for the Democratic nomination for state Attorney General of California. City Attorney As City Attorney, he has subscribed to the \\"broken windows\\" theory of law enforcement. Among the programs Delgadillo has implemented is a neighborhood prosecutor program that put city attorneys in each of the city's police divisions. He has also sped up the implementation of civil gang injunctions, which largely limit association by gang members in certain defined areas. Civil rights groups have challenged the injunctions, but the state's courts have upheld them. They have come under renewed attention recently, particularly in South Los Angeles, where some community members have complained that it is difficult for gang members to escape a sometimes intrusive law enforcement structure. One of the most well-publicized prosecutions by Delgadillo's office was that of entertainer Paul Reubens, more commonly known as Pee Wee Herman, for possession of child pornography. Delgadillo's office arranged a plea bargain requiring Reubens to pay a $100 fine and serve three years of probation. Delgadillo was criticized, for recommending to the Los Angeles City Council that the City pay $2.7 million to black firefighter Tennie Pierce, who alleged he was fed dog food as a firehouse prank and later retaliated against by his fellow firefighters when he complained to superiors. Delgadillo argued that the City would likely have been forced to pay even more money to Pierce had the case gone to trial, in addition to legal costs, considering jury verdicts in past cases of a similar nature. According to the Los Angeles Times, in September 2007 the City of Los Angeles agreed to pay Pierce $1.49 million to avoid going to trial, with the support of then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who had vetoed the earlier $2.7 million settlement offer proposed by Delgadillo, and the City Council. With legal costs to the City reaching an estimated $1.35 million, the taxpayers ended up having to pay out $2.84 million in the Pierce matter. An agreement facilitating digital billboards in Los Angeles while he was seeking campaign funds from the industry created controversy as to possible bias in agreeing to the advertising expansion.

In Canadian service she served the Highway 6 route between Tobermory and South Baymouth, Manitoulin Island from 1989 to 1992 alongside the MS Chi-Cheemaun. Service history One of three sister ships, she was launched on 19 August 1974 as the Monte Cruceta at the \\"S. A. Juliana Gijonesa\\" shipyard in Gij√≥n, Spain, for the Spanish shipping line Naviera Aznar. The vessels were built as long-distance multi-purpose roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries, handling both cargo and passengers, with fully refrigerated vehicle decks. Outfitting delays postponed her maiden voyage until 1976, by which time she had been renamed as Monte Castillo. The ships ran a summer service in the Mediterranean, and in the winter carried fruit and vegetables across the Bay of Biscay to Liverpool and Newhaven from Spain and the Balearic Islands By 1977, the service across the Bay of Biscay for which they were built had ceased, the ships were sold: Monte Castillo was sold to Manx Line (later Sealink-Manx Line) and renamed Manx Viking for service between Heysham, England and Douglas, Isle of Man. Following a controversial reverse takeover in 1986 by the Isle of Man Steam Packet company, she worked a season painted in Steam Packet livery, initially alongside the Mona's Isle (ex-Free Enterprise III) followed by Antrim Princess (subsequently renamed Tynwald) before Manx Vikings lease was terminated and she was returned to her owners (the parent Sealink company, by now part of Sea Containers, who had actually funded the takeover). In 1987, she was briefly renamed Manx for the delivery voyage to new Norwegian owners Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap, for whom she sailed in service under the name Skudenes. The ship was sold again in 1989, into service with the Government of Ontario. She was renamed Ontario No.1 for the Atlantic crossing before her final renaming as MS Nindawayma. Her sisters were sold to Trasmediterranea for Mediterranean service. =Manx service= During her days as the Manx Viking, she served on the Heysham-Douglas service of Sealink-Manx Line. Her maximum speed was , with a draught of , and a metacentric height of around , giving excellent stability and seakeeping qualities. She was licensed for 777 passengers and at this stage of her life was quoted as . During Canadian service this figure was stated as , while a 1984 Sealink press release quotes \\" a weight of 3,589.43 tonnes\\". The ship was the first RORO ferry on Manx routes, and the first there to carry both freight and passenger traffic being suitable for cars, commercial trucks and trailers. She was fitted with numerous motorcycle stands to allow for Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix traffic. As built, the ship had cranes for self-loading of containers onto the afterdeck; these were unused by Manx Line. Manx Line added a bow door and visor, along with extra lifeboats; becoming the only passenger ship in Manx waters with lifeboat accommodation for all aboard. She was also the first ferry in Manx waters to have inside accommodation for all passengers. At the time her 450 tonne fuel capacity gave her the longest range of any ferry in British waters: she was theoretically capable of travelling from Heysham to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands without refuelling. She was considered for Falklands duty, but not used. During Manx service she enjoyed an unrivalled reputation for reliability with passengers and was able to put to sea in weather conditions which forced her competitors to remain in port. Her arrival created a marked change in Manx traffic flows eventually resulting in the financial collapse of the rival Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, and the Steam Packet's subsequent amalgamation with Sealink-Manx Line. She initially carried the white and blue livery of Manx Line, but after this company ran into financial difficulties and was taken over by British Rail-Sealink, she received the BR corporate monastral blue hull, white upperworks and red funnel. She differed from other Sealink ships in carrying a gold-coloured sculpted \\"three legs of man\\" on her funnels rather than the standard BR double chevron. Later, publicity images were released of her painted in the Sea Containers era Sealink livery of white hull with blue trim, but these were mockups and the colours never applied. Due to problems with ship availability she was recalled hurriedly from dry dock before the paint job was completed, with just the new blue boot-topping applied. After the Steam Packet takeover her unwashed blue hull was given a rough overpaint of black, retaining the BR red funnels (rather than the differently-hued Steam Packet red). Following the takeover, the crew persisted in flying the Manx Line house pennant, rather than the management-mandated Steam Packet one. Later as a continued sign of protest against the takeover the crew changed this to half of a Manx Line pennant. It was initially intended that she would be retired from Manx service following the amalgamation of Sealink-Manx Line and The Steam Packet. Services would be concentrated on the Heysham-Douglas route with a strengthened two-ship service using the larger Mona's Isle (VI) and Antrim Princess. After over 150 years of uninterrupted service, the Steam Packet's year-round Liverpool-Douglas services were to be abandoned. In the event, trade union problems delayed the transfer of Antrim Princess from Stranraer, while Mona's Isle proved unserviceable. Instead Mona's Isle was withdrawn after six months and Manx Viking remained for another season. Manx Viking was eventually replaced by the cargo-only roll-on/roll-off vessel leaving - the by now renamed - Tynwald (VI) as the only passenger vessel on the route. In so doing the combined company avoided an expensive charter as the otherwise surplus Peveril was owned by the Steam Packet, not leased and had just been released from charter on the Heysham-Belfast route. The changes in manning brought about by the Manx Viking withdrawal, and Peverils route transfer were some of the centres of dispute of the 1980s British national seamen's strikes. If Manx Viking had been withdrawn as originally intended, she would have been transferred to Weymouth, Dorset and renamed Earl Henry for service on the route to Cherbourg. This never took place due to the delayed availability of the Antrim Princess. =Norwegian service= Following Manx Viking‚Äôs sale to Det Stavangerske Dampskibsselskap, she was reported to have developed severe engine problems, in so doing creating financial difficulties for her owners. She was sold on after only one year. This may have been a recurrence of the crankshaft problems she has been reported to have suffered while in Sealink-Manx Line service. =Canadian service= MS Nindawayma‚Äôs decommissioning from Canadian service after four years of use is said to have been due to \\"unsatisfactory performance\\". There was a distinct smell of diesel fuel at deck level, possibly due to her low-set twin funnels. (Photos of her in Canadian service show that the funnel-top smoke deflectors had been removed.) Her French Pielstick diesel engines were apparently troublesome, and sailings were canceled due to mechanical problems. Her bow and stern doors were claimed to not be high enough to accommodate semi-trailer trucks despite this not being a problem in Manx or Spanish service. These factors caused significant numbers of ferry passengers to avoid the MS Nindawayma in favour of the MS Chi-Cheemaun, even if waiting involved very long delays at the ferry terminals in Tobermory and South Baymouth. =Final use= The MS Nindawayma was used as two movie sets; featured in 2003 as the Belles' loft on water in the film Saved by the Belles, and in 2006 as the killer's lair in the film Bon Cop, Bad Cop. As of April 2007, Nindawayma was docked in a port in Montreal, rusting and being used for parts. Fate As of 17 August 2007, the ship was owned by Purvis Marine, a marine salvage company, and docked at a government wharf in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. The ship was broken up for scrap at Sault Ste Marie by Purvis Marine between 2007 and 2012, with the scrap metal being sold to the local Essar Steel Algoma steelworks. http://www.saultstar.com/2013/02/20/singers-ferry-ended-days-in- saulthttp://www.mic.co.im/news-detail.php?Fate-of-the-Manx-Viking-357 Photo gallery Image:Nidawa.jpgThe vessel as the MS Nindawayma.

The facility is located off U.S. 65 just north of Ozark, Missouri and south of Missouri's third largest city, Springfield (pop. 151,500). Price Cutter Park (cap. 4000), was built in four months in early 1999 and was named after a local supermarket company. It was home to the Springfield/Ozark Mountain Ducks minor league baseball team of the Texas/Louisiana League, Central Baseball League and, in their final year, the Frontier League (all independent leagues) as the Springfield/Ozark Ducks as well as the Southwest Missouri State Bears. The Ducks discontinued playing in 2004 after the city of Springfield landed the Springfield Cardinals (formerly El Paso Diablos) minor league team of the Double-A Texas League. One year earlier, the Missouri State University Bears (formerly Southwest Missouri State) baseball team also moved from Price Cutter Park to the new Hammons Field (cap. 8,000) in downtown Springfield. In June 2006, organized ball returned briefly to the stadium with the Ozark Generals of the collegiate wood bat M.I.N.K. League. In 2009 the Springfield Metro Baseball league moved into the stadium and began play. The open registration league operated in the park with 19 & under, 15 & under, and 12 & under divisions through 2014. Players registered starting each January and new teams are drafted each year in April. The Summer season ran from mid-May through the end of July. There was also a fall league which operated on weekends in September and October. The league's annual ceremonies in May had been host to a number of former MLB stars including Jack Clark, Willie Wilson, and others. Every third year (2011,2014) the league ran a unique \\"retro\\" season with all the teams outfitted as MLB teams of the past including teams like the St. Louis Browns, Kansas City Athletics, and Washington Senators. The 2014 season was the first where the league operated entirely with wood bats only. Just prior to the beginning of the 2015 season, the league was informed that the ballpark ownership and the city of Ozark were negotiating with fledgling semi-pro baseball leagues and Springfield Metro moved out of the stadium and Ozark to ballparks on the near west side of Springfield (Barnhouse & Optimist Fields). No baseball ended up taking place at Price Cutter Park in 2015. The playing surface was rededicated as \\"John Pittman Field\\" in 2009 for a primary designer of the ballpark. In 2016 US Baseball was resurrected and purchased by the Williams Grocer Corporation. US Baseball web site. Retrieved September 30, 2019.

By December 2005, Sky+ 80 GB boxes manufactured by Pace, Amstrad and Thomson were being installed. Many people have reported various problems with the different boxes. A persistent complaint is that early Amstrad 80 GB models are noisy in operation. Amstrad was bought out by Sky in 2007, and decided to bring in its satellite receiver development and manufacturing in-house.End of an era as Sky buys Amstrad Retrieved 8 January 2012 =Sky+ remote= Sky+ remote control A typical Sky+ remote control is similar to a typical Sky remote, but provides controls for the extra features, e.g. rewinding the programme, record, play or pause, fast forward and stopping playback of the programme. The Sky+ remote is silver coloured or beige for the early remotes issues with 40GB Boxes (like the set top box) rather than the dark blue of the normal and original Sky remote. The sky + remote will work a Sky HD Box automatically but does require additional tuning to work with a standard sky box which can be found below. =Remote recording= In July 2006, Sky added remote recording functionality to Sky+ in the UK and Ireland. This enables customers to schedule recordings when they are away from home via a mobile telephone. Programmes can be added to the planner either by downloading an application to the mobile phone, called 'Sky Go', or by sending as SMS with details of the programme name, time, date and channel. In February 2007, Sky added remote recording via the sky.com website, so customers can program their STB from any web browser using an EPG similar to that found on the Sky+ system. =Sky Anytime TV service= On 2 January 2007, Sky announced plans to release a service, named Sky Anytime to Sky+ subscribers. The service is a Push-Video on Demand (push-VoD) system similar to Top Up TV Anytime, where the Sky+ PVR automatically records programmes transmitted over-night. The service, will be available to over 2 million Sky+ subscribers, using reserved space on the PVR's hard drive. The service works as a catch-up service for the best programmes of the week. The service launched some time in March 2007, and is available to owners of Sky HD and newer Sky+ boxes. Critical reception Following a six-month trial of the service, Guy Dixon wrote in PC Advisor magazine that he found Sky+ very easy to use and particularly praised the Series Link feature, describing it as a \\"killer app\\". He also described the ability to pause and rewind live TV as a \\"novelty...that wore off after a couple of days\\" and criticised the inability to customise the EPG's standard channel list. He also questioned whether both the high cost of the hardware and extra subscription fee would harm its success and suggested Sky should waive the hardware and installation fees. Sky would later offer reduced cost hardware, and began to waive the extra subscription fee to its premium channel subscribers, and subsequently all subscribers. BSkyB spent upward of ¬£20 million advertising the new service. In 2004, Sky began to waive the service fee to customers who were subscribers of their premium sport and/or movie channels, and from 2007, the charge was dropped for all subscribers. Sky+ is also built into Sky+ HD digiboxes. A number of hackers have attempted to upgrade the Sky+ receiver, primarily through the installation of larger hard drives to increase recording capacity; instruction manuals and tool kits to do this are widely available. Installing a larger hard drive in the unit is no harder than in a normal PC, but the Sky+ receiver is sensitive to the type of disk installed. Disks with low power requirements and fast spin up times are most likely to be compatible. Hard drives (consumer electronics drives) designed specifically by manufacturers for use with PVRs provide a considerably lower noise level and produce significantly less heat, reducing the need for internal fans to operate as frequently and again cutting down on noise generation. Software is also freely available which facilitates the migration of recorded material from the hard drive to a replacement. However, as of December 2010, this software is incapable of migrating recorded material from a standard definition Sky+ Box to a Sky+ HD box. It is thought that this is due to the planner databases used for Sky+ and Sky+ HD being incompatible.

The name cinquedea means \\"five fingers\\", and it describes the width of the blade next to the guard. The blade was heavy, about 45 cm (18 in) in length, and tapered to a somewhat rounded point. The grip was simple with a small pommel, and the guard was curved with the concave side toward the point. There were typically several fullers along the wider sides of the blade to lighten the weapon. The wide blade was useful for decorative etching. The wide blade was also used for attacking rather than the point of the blade. This weapon was varied in size, being anywhere from 10\\" to 28\\" in length. It was often carried in place of a knife or larger sword. It is depicted in period art as sometimes being carried horizontally next to the buttocks so that it could be drawn laterally from the back.

Buldir Island (also sometimes written Buldyr; ; ) is a small island in the western Aleutian Islands of the U.S. state of Alaska. Its is long and wide with an area of . Buldir is farther from the nearest land than any other Aleutian Island. Its nearest neighbors are Kiska in the Rat Island group, 68 miles to the east, and Shemya in the Near Island group, 64 miles to the west. Buldir Island is uninhabited. It is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. It has been designated a Research Natural Area.  Geology  Buldir is the most westerly of the Aleutian Islands which formed as a result of volcanic activity in the late Quaternary or Recent times. The rocks from which the island formed are of two different ages with a considerable time gap. The rocks of the older dome are mainly olivine basalts and the younger dome consists of hornblende basalts and basaltic andesites. That this island is younger than some of the neighboring islands is also suggested by the fact that there are fewer species of flowering plant on this island. The two major volcanoes on the island are the Buldir Volcano, which forms most of the island, and the East Cape Volcano, which forms the island's northeast section. Buldir Volcano is the taller, reaching in height, the highest point on the island. The is no harbor of any sort on Buldir Island. The coast is mostly steep cliffs or boulder beaches backed by cliffs. There is only one small flat area abutting a relatively gentle beach, North Bight Beach, suitable for landing small boats in good weather. It is on the northwest shore of the island. This area is the site of both prehistoric and modern habitation on the island.  Human History  North Bight Beach, Buldir Island Archeological evidence of human occupation on Shemya and Kiska, on either side of Buldir, dates back to at least 2000 B.C.E. Given the long distance between the Rat Islands and the Near Islands, it is likely that prehistoric peoples stopped at Buldir in transit between the two larger groups, but they left no evidence that has yet been found. Archeologists visited Buldir in 1991, 1993, 1997, and 2001. Their research shows that prehistoric peoples lived on Buldir periodically beginning over a thousand years ago. The water soaked clay on the island has preserved wooden and other organic artifacts unusually well, allowing scientists to carbon date the periods of occupation. The midden on North Bight Beach was investigated, revealing much about the native diet. Bird, mammal, and fish bones were identified, ranked in order of frequency of appearance. Almost no invertebrates were found in the midden. Twenty-three species of birds were identified from their bones, twenty-one of which were sea birds. Mammal bones were almost exclusively those of Steller sea lion. Among the bones found was a rib of a Steller's sea cow, a relative of modern- day manatees, which became extinct in 1768 due to over-hunting by Russian fur traders. This was among the first evidence of Steller's sea cow ever found beyond the Commander Islands of Russia. The rib was carbon dated to approximately 400 C.E. Dating evidence suggests that human occupation of Buldir Island was not continuous. Further, it appears that occupation was sometimes by people coming from the Near Islands, sometimes by people coming from the Rat Islands, and during some periods, by both peoples. It is not clear why early people would have risked the dangerous voyage across the open sea to reach Buldir. Archeologists speculate that resource scarcity or other turmoil in the larger island groups may have forced people to Buldir as a matter of survival. Another theory is that it was a neutral ground between the two larger island groups that allowed the two peoples to mingle. A large house framed with whalebone was found by archeologists, dating from the mid- seventeenth century. Some of the whales were large, suggesting they had been harvested locally by people living on Buldir. Both the size of this construction and others, and the many artifacts recovered from archeological excavations suggest that occupation of Buldir, while sporadic over the centuries, was by people who were living there rather than passing through on their way from one island group to the next. The recorded history of Buldir Island begins with Vitus Bering's Second Kamchatka Expedition. Bering's ship, St. Peter, left Petropavlosk, Kamchatka in June 1741 and reached what is now known as Kayak Island near the mouth of Prince William Sound on July 20. Crewmen went ashore to replenish the ship's fresh water supply. The next day Bering began the return voyage. His hope was to arrive in Kamchatka before scurvy and winter storms proved fatal. Contrary winds and currents made for slow going along the Aleutian chain. By October 28, 1741 scurvy stalked the ship. The log for that day reports that \\"By the will of God Stephen Buldirev, naval cooper, died of scurvy\\". Later that day \\"high land\\" was sighted in the rainy weather. Scholars believe that this was Buldir Island. The log recounts that Bering named it \\"St. Stephen Island\\", but at least as early as 1787 it appeared on Russian maps as Buldir (–ë—É–ª–¥—ã—Ä—å). It may be that the cooper is commemorated in the island's name. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has maintained seasonal biological monitoring teams on Buldir since 1988. Their primary focus is on nesting seabirds. The data they produce is an input to assessments of the regional ecosystem, which are used in fishery management.  Bird Life  Buldir's remoteness and the extreme difficulty of landing a boat safely on the island gave it a unique ecological history. Neither Russian nor American fur traders thought it was worth the effort to stock Buldir with Arctic or red foxes, as was done on 190 other Aleutian islands. Since the fur traders did not land, the island also escaped introduced rats. In consequence, the ground-nesting birds of Buldir continued their lives undisturbed by mammalian predators, while on other Aleutian Islands entire species were extirpated. Freedom from introduced predators allowed Buldir to become one of the largest and most diverse seabird breeding colonies in the Northern Hemisphere. The island is home to 4 million seabirds of 21 species during breeding season. The island's colonies include crested auklets and least auklets, as well as puffins, storm petrels and other species. It is one of only four known locations where red-legged kittiwakes breed. A comprehensive survey in 1975 revealed a total of 77 species on the island. As of 2019 at least 116 bird species have been reported. Due to its proximity to Asia, over three-dozen species of birds have been recorded on Buldir Island which are rare in North America. Buldir played an important part in the recovery of the Aleutian subspecies of Cackling Goose, Branta hutchinsii leucopareia. This subspecies was thought to be extinct by the early part of the twentieth century. The last confirmed sighting was in 1938. The birds had suffered complete breeding failure due to predation by introduced rats and foxes which ate both eggs and goslings. In 1962, a remnant population of perhaps 300 birds was discovered on Buldir Island. These geese survived because of the lack of mammalian predators. In 1967 the bird was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 and subsequently, in 1973, under the Endangered Species Act. The recovery program for the subspecies involved capturing goslings on Buldir Island for a captive breeding program. The birds produced by this program were reintroduced to Aleutian Islands which had been cleared of foxes by teams of trappers and hunters working for the National Wildlife Refuge. The recovery plan worked and the Aleutian cackling goose was removed from the list of endangered species in 2001. By 2017 there were perhaps as many as 150,000 Aleutian cackling geese, most or perhaps all of them descended from the original Buldir Island population.

Pirro is the host of Fox News Channel's Justice with Judge Jeanine. She was a frequent contributor to NBC News, including regular appearances on The Today Show. A Republican, she was the first female judge elected in Westchester County, New York. Pirro was elected the first female District Attorney of Westchester County. As district attorney, Pirro gained visibility in cases of domestic abuse and crimes against the elderly. Pirro briefly sought the Republican nomination for United States Senate to run against Hillary Clinton in 2006, but dropped out to accept the nomination for New York Attorney General, which she did not win. In 2018, she authored the book Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy. Early life Jeanine Ferris was born on June 2, 1951 in Elmira, New York, to Lebanese- American parents Nasser \\"Leo\\" and Esther Ferris (n√©e Awad). Her father was a mobile-home salesman, and her mother was a department-store model that spent much of her childhood in Beirut. Pirro knew she wanted to be an attorney from the age of six. She graduated from Notre Dame High School in Elmira in three years, interning in the Chemung County District Attorney's office during her time in high school. Pirro then graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University at Buffalo. She received her J.D. degree at Albany Law School of Union University in 1975, where she was an editor of the law review. Westchester County law career =Assistant District Attorney= In 1975, Carl Vergari appointed Pirro to the position of Assistant District Attorney of Westchester County in New York State, where she began her career by writing appeals and handling minor cases. In 1977, Pirro approached Vergari and requested that he apply for a federal grant for local district attorney's offices to establish bureaus that specialized in domestic violence. She hoped that Vergari would take advantage of potential funding, as well as a 1977 change in New York law that moved many domestic violence cases from family court to criminal court. Vergari agreed to apply for the grant, and his office became one of four in the nation to win the grant. In 1978, he appointed Pirro to be the first chief of the new Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Bureau. Pirro was known to be an aggressive bureau chief. Due to possible coercion, she had a strict policy against dropping cases at a victim's request. Many people praised Pirro for her passion as Domestic Violence Bureau Chief, but she attracted increasing criticism from some colleagues for what they considered her \\"attention-grabbing\\" behavior and violations of tradition. On multiple occasions, Chief District Attorney Vergari spoke to Pirro concerning her violation of office policy. She had issued press releases with her own name‚Äîand not Vergari's‚Äîon top. The relationship between Pirro and Vergari disintegrated in the late 1980s, after Pirro claimed sole responsibility for the establishment of the Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Bureau. On June 1, 1990, just five months prior to Pirro's first appearance on the ballot for County Court Judge, she attracted widespread attention for rushing to conduct a bedside investigation of Maria Amaya at the Intensive Care Unit of United Hospital in Port Chester. Amaya had been charged with four counts of second- degree murder for the deaths of her four children. She was a 36-year-old immigrant from El Salvador who had a history of being hospitalized for mental issues. Amaya had killed the four children and attempted suicide, believing that they were being corrupted by drugs and sex. Vergari had served as district attorney for Pirro's entire tenure as an assistant district attorney and her time on the bench. In 1999, he critiqued Pirro as \\"bright and capable\\" and someone who \\"plays hardball seeking publicity,\\" but who was also \\"very self-centered in everything she does.\\" While recognized for her prosecution of domestic violence, she was criticized for her relative prosecutorial absence in bringing charges involving major public corruption or organized crime. These criticisms intensified when Pirro's husband was later convicted of several felonies tied to organized crime, including tax evasion and conspiracy.Spirro Sentenced New York Times August 14, 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2019. \\"One would have to believe that there's no organized crime in Westchester County, not a single corrupt official, and every union in this county is as clean as the driven snow,\\" according to William I. Aronwald, who headed the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force during the 1970s and who was targeted for assassination by Colombo crime family head Carmine Persico.Mob Figure Admits Roles In Murders, Including Judge's New York Times August 14, 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2019. During a 1986 abortive campaign for Lieutenant Governor of New York, Pirro boasted to have never lost a case in \\"about 50 trials.\\" This number was disputed when presented in 2005 to colleagues, who said that the real number of trials personally handled by Pirro \\"wasn't more than 10.\\" Pirro's then-spokesman, Anne Marie Corbalis, contended only that Pirro had a \\"100% felony conviction rate\\" as an Assistant District Attorney. =Court Judge= Pirro left the District Attorney's office after her November 1990 election as a judge of the Westchester County Court. She had successfully run on the Republican and Conservative party lines against Democratic nominee and New Castle Town Justice Lawrence D. Lenihan and Right to Life Party nominee August C. Nimphius, Jr. When she was sworn in on January 1, 1991, Pirro became Westchester County's first female judge.. She was a judge for two years. =District Attorney= In November 1993, Pirro was elected Westchester County District Attorney; she was the first woman to hold that position. She was re-elected in 1997 and 2001. On May 23, 2005, Pirro announced that she would not seek re-election to a fourth term as Westchester County District Attorney. On December 31, 1993‚Äîwithin hours of Pirro's midnight inauguration as District Attorney‚ÄîScripps newspaper heiress Anne Scripps Douglas was savagely bludgeoned in the head with a hammer by her estranged husband, Scott Douglas, as she slept in their Bronxville, New York, home. By the time police arrived, Scott Douglas had fled the scene. Anne Scripps Douglas died in the hospital on January 6. Scott Douglas subsequently committed suicide by jumping off the Tappan Zee Bridge. Pirro, already known as a passionate prosecutor of domestic violence cases, was a frequent presence in the media during the period between the murder and when Scott Douglas's body washed ashore in Riverdale in early March 1994. This increase in Pirro's national profile led to her surfacing as a frequent guest on network and cable television news in June 1994, when O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his ex-wife, appearing frequently as a talking head for Nightline, Larry King Live, and Geraldo. Within months of taking office, Pirro undertook a costly renovation to the district attorney's facilities and expanded to an additional floor of the county courthouse. The largest expenses were a new kitchenette and a media room, costing $20,000, to assist Pirro's growing profile; additional expenditures were made to remodel her personal office with mahogany. Pirro was the first female president of the New York State District Attorneys Association. Also while district attorney, she was appointed by then-Governor George Pataki to chair the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board. Its report and recommendations resulted in legislation passing that enhanced protections of, and safeguards for, the victims of domestic abuse. During her tenure as district attorney, she repeatedly refused to reopen the murder case of Jeffrey Deskovic. In 1990, Deskovic was falsely convicted of killing a 15-year-old girl, and spent 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by DNA evidence, and the real killer confessed to the crime. He later won a $41.6 million lawsuit against Daniel Stephens and Westchester County for his wrongful conviction. Statewide political career = 1986 Lieutenant Gubernatorial candidacy = On May 26, 1986, Pirro, then an assistant district attorney, was announced as the running mate of Westchester County Executive and presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee Andrew O'Rourke. Pirro was selected by O'Rourke and New York State Republican Committee Chairman Anthony J. Colavita after nearly a dozen individuals declined the position, including Erie County Executive Ed Rutkowski, Hempstead Presiding Supervisor Thomas Gulotta, and the Executives of Broome and Oneida Counties. Colavita, who said at the press conference that he \\"had so many say 'no' to me (during the lieutenant governor search), it doesn't hurt anymore,\\" pointed to Pirro's prosecutorial experience, ability to effectively use crime as an issue, Italian married name, youth, and status as a woman when asked about her strengths as a candidate. Pirro's selection frustrated many New York Republicans, with Assembly Minority Leader Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr. traveling on May 27 from Albany to the first night of the State Republican Committee's Nominating Convention in Syracuse, to tell O'Rourke and Colavita that his conference was concerned by Pirro's lack of political experience or statewide stature. Many Republicans also worried that if Pirro were nominated, their ticket would be too geographically dominated by downstate and the suburbs, with O'Rourke, like Pirro, being from Westchester, and the presumptive nominees for attorney general, Peter King and United States Senate, Alfonse D'Amato both hailing from Nassau County. On May 28, just one day prior to the scheduled vote for the lieutenant gubernatorial nomination at the state party convention in Syracuse, Pirro announced her withdrawal from the race, saying that her husband could not disclose his legal clients or the couple's business interests (later revealed to have been her husband's partial ownership of a Connecticut garbage hauling company with alleged mafia connections),She's a Politician. He Avoided Attention. Not Anymore, New York Times, Joseph Berger, April 17, 1997. Retrieved December 18, 2019. and that many of his clients did business with the state, which would make it \\"virtually impossible\\" for her to serve as Lieutenant Governor. Pirro had privately informed O'Rourke and Colavita of her decision during the evening of May 27, and the two were generally supportive, telling the press that her departure had nothing to do with Rappleyea's intervention. Pirro was replaced just six hours after her announcement by Michael Kavanagh, the District Attorney of Ulster County. =2006 U.S. Senate campaign= On August 10, 2005, Pirro announced that she would seek the Republican nomination to challenge first-term incumbent senator Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2006 election for U.S. Senator from New York. Other Republicans who announced campaigns for the nomination were John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, William Brenner, an attorney in Sullivan County, and attorney Edward Cox, the son-in-law of former president Richard Nixon. In a widely publicized moment when she was declaring her candidacy, Pirro misplaced page 10 of her speech and went silent for 32 seconds, something that was widely considered to have damaged her campaign before it even started. During an appearance at the Crime Victims Resource Center, Pirro described herself this way: \\"I am red on fiscal policy. I am conservative and I support the Bush tax cut... I have broad blue stripes when it comes to social issues... I am a woman who is a moderate in New York.\\" Republican governor George Pataki's endorsement of Pirro caused Cox to withdraw from the race, leaving Pirro as the likely nominee. Donors to Pirro's political campaign included designer Tommy Hilfiger (also a native of Elmira) and Donald Trump, as well as contractors and real estate executives who had done business with her husband. Trump spoke highly of her husband at the time, saying: \\"Al has a good sense of the law and what's practical and a lot of common sense.\\" On December 21, 2005, Pirro dropped out of the Senate race after continuing pressure from party chiefs. This decision was reached after a lagging fundraising effort, and polls that showed she would be easily defeated by Clinton (a Quinnipiac University poll forecast Pirro would lose to Clinton 62 percent to 30 percent). In a statement, she said \\"I have decided that my law enforcement background better qualifies me for a race for New York State attorney general than a race for the United States Senate.\\" Spencer was eventually chosen as the Republican Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate. During her four-month campaign, the Pirro campaign racked up $600,000 in debt to campaign vendors. By 2019, debts to vendors remained unpaid. =2006 State Attorney General campaign= On May 31, 2006, Pirro was unopposed for the nomination and became the Republican Party's official candidate for Attorney General of New York by acclamation at the state GOP convention. She also received the nominations of the New York Conservative and Independence Parties. Pirro lost the general election to the Democratic nominee, former Clinton Housing and Urban Development Secretary and future Governor Andrew Cuomo 58%‚Äì39%. Books Pirro is the author of six books, two of which are crime novels. Her first book was 2003's To Punish and Protect: A DA's Fight Against a System That Coddles Criminals. It was followed in 2004 by To Punish and Protect: Against a System That Coddles Criminals. In 2012, Pirro's first fiction book, Sly Fox: A Dani Fox Novel, was released as a crime and legal thriller, followed in 2014 by the second novel in the series, Clever Fox: A Dani Fox Novel. Her book Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy (2018) is a look inside the Presidency of Donald Trump, as well as the politics surrounding the anti-Trump movement. Radicals, Resistance, and Revenge: The Left's Plot to Remake America (2019) is described as \\"the latest chapter in the unfolding liberal attack on our most basic values.\\" In 2020, her book \\"Don't Lie to Me: and Stop Trying to Steal Our Freedom\\" was published right before the presidential election. Media career Pirro has been a regular contributor to the syndicated morning talk show The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet. She has been a guest analyst on Today, Fox NY Good Day New York. She is a Fox News legal analyst appearing on various shows, and has guest-hosted shows such as Larry King Live, The Joy Behar Show, and Geraldo at Large. She was a frequent guest on Fox's late-night satire show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2003, Pirro released the nonfiction book To Punish and Protect, describing life inside the criminal justice system. In 2012, with the assistance of author Pete Earley, Pirro wrote the novel Sly Fox based on her own experiences as a 25-year-old assistant district attorney in Westchester. Pirro appears in the HBO six-part serial The Jinx, recounting her perspective on the 1983 disappearance of Kathie Durst, a high- profile case for which she was the investigating attorney. Pirro was the host of the American reality prime time court show You the Jury, canceled after two episodes. =Judge Jeanine Pirro on The CW= On May 5, 2008, The CW Television Network announced that Pirro would host a weekday television show to be named Judge Jeanine Pirro, part of the network's CW Daytime lineup, with two episodes airing daily. The show was distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television, and was carried by default on all CW affiliate stations. Judge Jeanine Pirro was cleared for a second season beginning in fall 2009. Unlike its first season, the second season, which began in the fall of 2009, was not exclusive to CW affiliates. In May 2010, the show received its first Emmy nomination, and in 2011, received the daytime Emmy Award. In September 2011 the show was canceled due to low ratings. =Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News= Vice President Mike Pence in December 2019 Pirro is the host of Fox News' Justice with Judge Jeanine, which premiered in January 2011. The program airs on weekends and focuses on the big legal stories of the week. In 2014, Pirro claimed ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was \\"released by Obama in 2009\\". However, Baghdadi was held in custody until 2004, when he was released under the Bush administration. In March 2019, on her show ‚ÄúJustice with Judge Jeanine‚Äù Pirro criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar for questioning the loyalty of American Jews to the US, by rhetorically asking if Omar's Muslim faith meant she was more loyal to Sharia law than the US constitution. She said: \\"Omar wears a hijab which according to the Quran 33:59 tells women to cover so they won't get molested. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States constitution?\\" Fox News strongly condemned Pirro's statement. Pirro, an Arab-American, later clarified her remarks, stating that she did not mean to insist that Representative Omar was anti-American because of her faith, saying that she intended to start a discussion. On March 16, Fox News decided not to air her show replacing it with a rebroadcast of a Scandalous episode in its time slot. CNN reported on March 17 that Pirro had been suspended by Fox News, and President Trump wrote on Twitter: \\"Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country.\\" Justice with Judge Jeanine resumed airing on March 30, 2019. In March 2020, she hosted the show from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She did not appear on air for the first 15 minutes citing \\"technical difficulties\\", with Jackie Iba√±ez covering for her, and when Pirro finally appeared, she was in a disheveled state, slurring her speech, causing widespread speculation that she was inebriated. After one commercial break, she was even seen putting aside a drink with a straw. Political positions =Trump administration= Pirro supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, while also noting that she was \\"infuriated\\" by some of his behaviors. After the release of the Access Hollywood tape, Pirro defended Trump, stating \\"I have been involved in a million situations with him and his children. He has always been a gentleman.\\" After Trump's election, Pirro was known for delivering fiery defenses of the president. The Washington Post described her show as \\"almost universally positive about Trump,\\" and Politico described her coverage of Trump as \\"gushing.\\" According to Politico, \\"From the outset of the administration, she has used her TV platform to hammer the president's critics and to ding his allies, including Sessions, as insufficiently loyal.\\" Pirro has called for arresting individuals who cooperated with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III's, investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election of President Trump. Pirro called for \\"cleansing\\" those government agencies of people critical of the president. These sorts of attacks on the FBI and Justice Department have been criticized as dangerous, \\"despicable\\", and strictly out of place with US traditions of constitutional democracy. In February 2018, after two senior Trump administration officials resigned due to domestic abuse allegations, Pirro suggested that Barack Obama's policies were to blame for the two domestic abuse scandals. In May 2018, Pirro said that Trump had \\"fulfilled\\" a \\"biblical prophecy\\" by moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. In June 2018, Pirro said Trump's pardon of conservative activist Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of 'illegal campaign contributions' to a college friend, to whom he received support, was \\"fantastic news\\", as she believes D'Souza was singled out for prosecution for his politics by the FBI for having produced two political documentary movies: 'Hillary's America' and 'Obama's America'. Later that month, Politico reported that Pirro had, since late 2016, repeatedly told the Trump administration about her interest in becoming the Attorney General. On her show, Pirro had referred to Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, as \\"the most dangerous man in America.\\" In July 2018, after Trump was widely criticized, including by numerous prominent conservatives, for refusing to condemn Russian interference in the 2016 election, because it would have gained little leeway, while standing on stage with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Pirro defended Trump. Pirro said, \\"What was he supposed to do, take a gun out and shoot Putin?\\" That same month, Trump posed with Pirro and her new book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, in the Oval Office. That Trump would promote the book of a pro-Trump advocate raised questions about potential ethics violations. Washington Post book critic Carlos Lozada described the book as a \\"sycophantic\\" and \\"gushing\\" pro-Trump book. PolitiFact found that Pirro's assertion in the book that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had announced in February 2018 that \\"the Russia collusion investigation is over\\" was false; Rosenstein never said it and the progression of the Russia probe since February 2018 demonstrated otherwise. In September 2018, while Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh faced scrutiny over sexual assault allegations, when he was a teenager, Pirro referred to the Democratic Party as \\"demon-rats\\". On January 12, 2019, while on Fox, Pirro took a call on-air from Trump in which he spoke for 20 minutes, claiming his former attorney Michael Cohen fabricated stories to reduce the length of his expected sentence. Trump conjectured Cohen said, \\"I have an idea, I'll give you some information on the president,\\" and he continued, \\"Well, there is no information.\\" \\"He should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at.\\" Pirro asked the name of Cohen's father-in-law, but Trump replied, though regarding the affairs of a private citizen, \\"I don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there.\\" The father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, owned condos both at Trump Tower and another in a Trump development near Miami. According to federal investigators, Shusterman actually introduced Trump to Cohen. In November 2019, she described Trump as \\"almost superhuman\\". In December 2019, she suggested that Trump had made it possible for people to say \\"Merry Christmas\\" again. In 2020, she disagreed that then-candidate Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists in his campaign announcement counter to the verbatim truth. =Health care= Describing her own political positions in 2005, Pirro said, \\"I'm Republican red on fiscal policy with conservative beliefs on making tax cuts permanent, but I've got broad blue stripes on the social issues,\\" during her campaign for the US Senate in New York. Her positions were described as politically moderate during her Senate run. Pirro supported a woman's right to an abortion, including U.S. taxpayer funding of abortion through Medicaid, in 2005, though she has been opposed to late-term abortions. =LGBT rights= On the topic of LGBT rights, Pirro actively supported the passing of a New York hate crimes law which covered sexual orientation as a protected class in 2000. She was outspoken in her support for anti- discrimination protections for gays and lesbians during her 2006 campaign for State Attorney General. Pirro supported civil unions for same-sex couples. She also received an endorsement from the Log Cabin Republicans. She did not support marriage equality, however; Pirro opposed attempts to amend the Constitution in order to ban same-sex marriage, claiming: \\"Make no mistake, if it does become the law of this state, I will fight to defend it\\". In spite of this, eight years later, she had Wiliam Owens, a representative of the National Organization for Marriage and opponent of same-sex marriage, as a guest on her program. =Benghazi= In 2014, Pirro called for Obama's impeachment over the 2012 Benghazi attack, wherein militants attacked a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Of gun ownership, Pirro commented in December 2015: Personal life In 1975, she married Albert Pirro of Mount Vernon, Westchester County, New York. The couple met while in law school. Together, they have two children, a son and a daughter. Following their marriage, they moved to Harrison, New York, where Pirro began working as assistant district attorney and her husband began work as a lobbyist. Later in their marriage, but before their children were born, Albert was accused of fathering a daughter by a Florida woman he termed as extortionate and mentally unstable. After his denials and extensive court proceedings, DNA testing confirmed him as the father and he was ordered to begin child support payments in 1998.Now \\"grand\\" paternity woe for Pirro, New York Post, Joe Mcgurk, September 18, 2002. Retrieved December 18, 2019. Following her tenure as D.A. and judge, Pirro returned to the private sector and began a new career as a TV personality and commentator. In 1997, People magazine named her one of its \\"50 Most Beautiful People\\". On February 23, 1999, Pirro's husband was indicted by the office of United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on one count of conspiracy, four counts of tax evasion, and 28 counts of filing a false tax return for hiding over $1 million in personal income as business expenses between 1988 and 1997. That day, Pirro appeared with her husband at a press conference in response to the charges, criticizing the investigation as \\"invasive and hostile.\\" New York Governor George Pataki released a statement saying that the Pirros had been personal friends for \\"a long time,\\" and that he and his wife \\"wished them well.\\" With the trial beginning on May 15, 2000, and closing arguments given on June 19, 2000, the jury found Pirro's husband guilty on June 23, 2000, on 23 of the charges brought against him and not guilty of 10. In November 2000, he was sentenced to 29 months in federal prison, but received some leniency in exchange for waiving his right to appeal. He served 17 months in prison, being released early for good behavior and participating in an alcoholism treatment program. In the midst of the trial, Pirro had attacked the prosecution for bringing up matters which involved her, calling it a \\"desperate attempt by them to bring me into this wherever they can.\\" As a result of their \\"tumultuous\\" relationship, Pirro and her husband separated in 2007, with their divorce being finalized in 2013. In 2019 Police charged her with driving 119 miles per hour in upstate New York. In July 2019, Pirro was named to the board of directors of the cannabis company HeavenlyRx, which manufactures CBD products. Said Pirro: \\"My interest in CBD stems from a curiosity after hearing people say how much they benefited from CBD.... Initially a skeptic, I now understand there are tremendous benefits outside the assembly line of traditional medical and pharmaceutical dictates\\". Pirro revealed in her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, that she was diagnosed with cancer in 2012. She is a practicing Catholic.

Refugees International. In 2005, the management responsibility for Nechisar National Park was handed over to APN. In consultation with the Ethiopian government and the SNNPR government they began attempting to address the problems with illegal operations in the park including the illegal cutting down of trees for firewood for Arba Minch, illegal fishing, illegal human settlement and cattle grazing inside the park. APN assigned a group of scouts to improve the protection of the area. One of the major environmental concerns facing the park is illegal fishing operations on Lake Abaya and Chamo. According to Abera Adnew, deputy manager of Arba Minch Fishermen Cooperatives, \\"There are over 3000 illegal fishermen working on Lake Abaya,\\". The Arba Minch Fishermen Cooperative has attempted to address the problem but has faced much hostility from the illegal fisherman who depend on the fish stocks for their livelihoods. The problem is enhanced by water recession from the shore during the dry seasons and the volume has been diminishing in the last few years as tributary rivers were diverted for irrigation. A tributary, the Kulfo River, which once had an abundant fish population has dried out considerably during dry season. Some farmers in the park have taken advantage of the dry land on the shores and have begun banana cultivation in recent years referred to the locals as \\"soke\\". The fishermens' association is licensed to work on Lake Chamo as well, but aside from conflicts with the fishermen, they have also faced hostility from Guji pastoralists. APN attempted to directly negotiate with the Guji communities in the park and according to the manager of APN, \\"We managed to have an agreement with the Guji people by the end of September 2004,\\" John Mark said. The federal government requested a formal letter from the SNNPR government approving the negotiation between the Guji communities and African Parks. But the regional government would not approve the negotiation. That is the main reason why they are pulling out\\" While tourism in Ethiopia has increased in the park in recent years, doubling each year from 5300 tourists in 2005 to 20,500 in 2007, in October 2008 APN announced that they were ending management of Nechisar National Park. In a magazine article reprinted on their website, APN claims that sustainable management of the Ethiopian parks is incompatible with \\"the irresponsible way of living of some of the ethnic groups\\". African Parks added that the emphasis for resettling inhabitants out of the park, rather than educating them to work with them, came from the Ethiopian government. APN was told that the Guji were an Oromo people, and \\"they belong in the adjoining Oromiya province, not among the Gamo and Gofa peoples of the Southern District, where the park is\\".\\"Why African Parks Network is pulling out of Ethiopia\\" Geography and landscape The important regional centre to the park is Arba Minch in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Approximately 15% of the park consists of lakes including Lake Abaya in the north and Lake Chamo in the south. Part of the habitat consists of the groundwater forest and shoreline of the lakes, but there are dry grassy plains, and most of the park is covered in thick bushland and the wooded valleys and foothills of the Amaro Mountains. The altitude ranges from 1,108 meters above sea level at the shore of Lake Chamo to 1,650 meters on Mount Tabala in the north-east, renowned for its hot springs.Nechisar National Park , Realethiopia.com, January 4, 2006, Retrieved on June 22, 2008 The forest between the two lakes and by the Kulfo river is dominated by Ficus sycamorus, which can grow up to 30 m tall. Extensive areas to the west of Lake Abaya were cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to establish large-scale mechanized farms for cotton and other crops. Dichrostachys cinerea The freshwater swamps at the mouth of the Kulfo River and in Lake Chamo are dominated by Typha angustifolia, tall waterside grasses and the small leguminous trees, such as Aeschynomene elaphroxylon and Sesbania sesban. Taller trees found in the park include Dichrostachys cinerea, Acacia tortilis, Balanites aegyptiaca and less common Acacia nilotica. The southern part of the park is domainated by edaphic grassland and a calcareous black clay soil underneath with Dobera glabra, Acacia tortilis and the grass Chrysopogon aucheri forming much of the landscape. Both Lake Abaya and Chamo have substantial fish populations, notably Nile perch, which forms the basis of the local fishing industry. Crocodiles inhabit both lakes and there is a crocodile farm near Lake Abaya. At Chamo crocodiles are exploited for their skins.  Wildlife  The park has a notable population of Grant's gazelle Wildlife in the park include plains zebra, Grant's gazelle, dik-dik, and the greater kudu as well as one of the last three populations of the endangered Swayne's hartebeest, endemic to Ethiopia. A stretch of the northwest shore of Lake Chamo is known as Crocodile Market, where hundreds of crocodiles gather to bask. The park also has populations of bushbuck, bushpig, Anubis baboon, vervet monkeys, and black-backed jackal. The endangered painted hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, once existed in the park (with last sightings at Fincha), but may now be extirpated due to human population pressures in this region.C. Michael Hogan (31 January 2009). Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus , GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg In 2009, a small group of less than 23 lions were estimated in and around the protected area. Nechisar National Park is considered an important habitat for bird populations particularly those migrating. It has a noted population of kingfishers, storks, pelicans, flamingos and African fish eagles.WordTravels Ethiopia Travel Guide , Retrieved on June 22, 2008 Other birds include Falco naumanni and Circus macrourus, which are fairly common on passage, while small numbers of Phoenicopterus minor have been reported on Lakes Chamo and Abaya. Species typical of bushland habitats include Phoeniculus somaliensis, Lanius dorsalis and Cisticola bodessa and the open plains support three species that are very unknown elsewhere in Ethiopia: an isolated population of Mirafra albicauda, the endemic Caprimulgus solala and the rare C. stellatus. The south-western corner of Lake Abaya supports one of only two Ethiopian populations of Myrmecocichla albifrons. Other species of note include Accipiter ovampensis, Aviceda cuculoides, Gypaetus barbatus, Macheiramphus alcinus, Chelictinia riocourii, Francolinus levaillantii, Podica senegalensis, Crithagra reichardi, Schoutedenapus myoptilus, and Coracina caesia.

It is immediately north of Center City. Though the full extent of the region is somewhat vague, \\"North Philadelphia\\" is regarded as everything north of either Vine Street or Spring Garden Street, between Northwest Philadelphia and Northeast Philadelphia. It is bordered to the north by Cheltenham Township along Cheltenham Avenue, Spring Garden Street to the south, 35th Street to the west and Adams Avenue to the east. The Philadelphia Police Department patrols five districts located within North Philadelphia: the 22nd, 25th, 26th, 35th and 39th districts.PPD Online Patrol Districts, Philadelphia Police Department. There are fifteen ZIP codes for North Philadelphia: 19120, 19121, 19122, 19123, 19125, 19126, 19130, 19132, 19133, 19134, 19137, 19138, 19140, 19141, and 19150. The city government views this sprawling chunk of Philadelphia more precisely as three smaller districts, drawn up by the Redevelopment Authority in 1964. These regions are (from north to south) Olney-Oak Lane, Upper North Philadelphia and Lower North Philadelphia. Other sections of North Philadelphia include Brewerytown, Fairhill, Fairmount, Fishtown, Francisville, Franklinville, Glenwood, Hartranft, Koreatown, Northern Liberties, Poplar (roughly bound by Girard Avenue, Broad Street, Spring Garden Street and 5th Street), Sharswood, Strawberry Mansion and Yorktown. History =Early history= Prior to its incorporation into the city proper, North Philadelphia was little more than a collection of primarily agricultural townships above the original City of Philadelphia. In the 18th century, as Philadelphia grew in importance and, consequently, population, then pastoral North Philadelphia became an attractive alternative to the burgeoning city. The mansions of wealthy Philadelphians began to dot the landscape, and by the late 18th and early 19th century, several small town centers had developed to anchor the growing population. However, this suburban landscape was to be interrupted around the middle of the 19th century, as rapid urban expansion led to The Consolidation Act of 1854. This state law annexed all of the townships within Philadelphia County to the City of Philadelphia. With new territory now under the aegis of Philadelphia's city planners, a rising influx of European immigrants led to the end of North as a suburb of Philadelphia. North Philadelphia's decentralized towns were gradually meshed into a sprawling network of the ubiquitous Philadelphia rowhomes. Many of the newly created neighborhoods retained the name of their ancestral towns and townships, for example, Northern Liberties was formerly Northern Liberties Township. =Industrial era= Victorian and Gothic stylizations of the German architects that designed buildings in North Philadelphia. Turrets like the one pictured still dot North Broad Street. Philadelphia was one of the more important centers of manufacturing in the world between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries,, pp. 3‚Äì16Workshop of the World and North Philadelphia is one of the sections of the city whose landscape was most deeply shaped by the industrial era. Its landscape still strongly reflects this heritage. As the industrial age peaked in America, North Philadelphia became a working man's town. Upper North Philadelphia, Olney, Brewerytown, became major hubs of production. Large factories and industrial complexes were erected, covering vast swaths of city land. Thousands of row homes were constructed to house the burgeoning worker population. This expansion was also the impetus for breaking ground on the Broad Street Line subway, designed specifically to carry a passenger from the northern hub of Olney to Philadelphia City Hall in under 20 minutes. Major freight and passenger rail lines were built to intersect at the newly constructed North Broad Street Station and transmit cargo from the bustling factories. The completion of the BSL these major railways made the region a thriving hub of transportation. For a time, North Philadelphia station became the second most heavily trafficked rail station in the city, and the Olney Ave station the most used subway stop. Along with many of Philadelphia's major manufacturing concerns came the nearby estates of the wealthy industrialists who had founded them. Lower North Philadelphia in particular housed a number of the nouveau riche: ambitious first or second generation immigrants or those that had made their fortunes starting manufacturing firms. Many were German Jews who had settled in the area, later founding companies and building synagogues. For a time, an age of opulence and grand architecture returned to North Philadelphia, centered on what is now zoned as the Historic North Broad Street Mansion and Speculative Housing Districts. Gentlemen's clubs, upscale restaurants and shopping districts grew in this southern tier for a brief moment in history, peaking in the late 1920s. Upper-class foremen and executives lived farther north along Broad Street, in what is now the West Diamond Street Townhouse Historic District. Thriving commercial districts sprung up along the great northern avenues: Columbia (renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue), Susquehanna, Dauphin, Erie, Lehigh and Olney, to name a few. However, just as this wealth was so suddenly gained, it would just as suddenly be lost. The new money culture proved to be an unstable foundation for a lasting community, and like so many constructs of the Gilded Age, this core of wealth was doomed to rot. =Post-industrial economic decline= Over the next few decades The Great Depression, outsourcing and white flight took their toll on North Philadelphia in a fashion similar to other major US cities of the mid to late 20th century, if not in a more pronounced fashion. While residential corridors like Hope Street and Delhi Street had long housed primarily African- American residents, white residents moved out of the city as waves of poor blacks moved in. During the 40s and 50s, much of the area was racially integrated, although smaller streets were usually completely black or white. Whites began to move out slowly at first in the late 1940s as these residents became more affluent and Northeast Philadelphia began to develop new housing with lawns and conveniences such as modern plumbing. In most cases African Americans moved into the vacant houses and as this began to increase, true white flight began. Increasingly, people moved out of North Philadelphia not solely to move into newer homes, but to avoid facing decreasing property values and increased criminality. For a time, Lower North Philadelphia became a great center of black culture and music, most notably jazz. Many commercial corridors were maintained for decades, and a great many musicians came to North Philadelphia, like John Coltrane and Stan Getz. By 1964, North Philadelphia was the city's center of African American culture, home to 400,000 of the city's 600,000 black residents.Doing No Good Time Magazine As the century marched past middle age, many other problems symptomatic of all US cities of the time came about. Many of the neighborhoods in North Philadelphia sprung up around one monolithic factory, which was the center of the community's income. Each factory that closed down devastated its host neighborhood. In this way, the wave of national industrial collapse caused the rapid break up of numerous \\"factory neighborhoods\\" in the predominantly working class North Philadelphia. 1964 Columbia Avenue Riot On the evening of August 28, 1964 a black woman named Odessa Bradford got into an argument with two police officers, one black, Robert Wells, and the other white, John Hoff, after her car stalled at 23rd Street and Columbia Avenue. After Bradford refused to comply with the two officers' orders to move the car, because the car had stalled, and she was unable to drive it, an argument ensued. The officers then tried to physically remove Bradford from the car. She resisted and a large crowd assembled in the area. A man tried to come to Bradford's aid by attacking the police officers at the scene, but he and Bradford were arrested. Rumors then spread throughout North Philadelphia that a pregnant black woman had been beaten to death by white police officers. Later that evening, and throughout the next two days, angry mobs looted and burned mostly white-owned businesses in North Philadelphia, mainly along Columbia Avenue. Outnumbered, the police response was to withdraw from the area rather than aggressively confront the rioters. The race riots of 1964 became iconic for the rising ethnic tensions in the region, and the continued withdrawal of white residents. The riot, which virtually destroyed the central shopping district of North Philadelphia, signaled the beginning of the end for the North's commercial sector. The withering of the American manufacturing sector led to the closing of many of the factories that many northern neighborhoods were centered on and depended on. Increased urban blight and the general decline of Philadelphia in the late 20th century even saw the decline of many of the strong black communities in North Philadelphia. The legendary Connie Mack Stadium was closed in favor of the new Pattison Sports Complex. North Philadelphia Station lost Amtrak Service, and the BSL subway line garnered a reputation for violent crime and rape. The great art deco office buildings and government institutions were mostly abandoned, as were the mansions of the many ruined industrialists. As in many poorer African American city ghettos, drug addiction became a major blight in North Philadelphia, further destabilizing families and social networks. Locale North Philadelphia today Commercial District of Germantown and Lehigh Avenue, in the Hartranft neighborhood of North Philadelphia = Neighborhoods = Ogden Street in North Philadelphia on a snowy night. North Philadelphia, like many other sections of Philadelphia, is highly racially and socially segregated block by block. A noticeable pattern in the area is that, in the southern part of North Philadelphia (south of about Erie Avenue), Germantown Avenue (which later becomes North 6th Street) is the dividing point between the areas that are predominantly Black (to the west), and the areas that are predominantly Hispanic (to the east). However, this is slowly changing, with a small yet growing population of Hispanics living west of Germantown Avenue, and already significant population of Blacks living east of that street. The area between Broad Street and 5th Street is increasingly becoming a \\"transition zone\\" between the larger predominately black area west of Broad, and the smaller predominately Hispanic area east of 5th. This section of Philadelphia has nearly equal populations of Hispanics and Blacks. Though, Germantown Avenue is still seen as a divider street, with areas between Germantown Avenue and Broad Street \\"more black\\" and areas between Germantown Avenue and 5th street \\"more Hispanic\\". East of Front street, blocks start to get more diverse, with significant populations of Hispanics, blacks and whites. Also, as the Hispanic community continues to grow eastward, the ethnic white enclaves of eastern North Philadelphia continue to shrink. See https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- srv/special/nation/census/2010/ North Philadelphia is usually described as an area north of Center City, between Front Street and Fairmount Park. Sub- sections include: *Lower North Philadelphia - Spring Garden Street to the south and Dauphin Street to the north *Upper North Philadelphia - Dauphin Street to the south and Wyoming Avenue to the north *Olney-Oak Lane, Philadelphia often nicknamed Uptown - Wyoming Avenue to the south and the Philadelphia city limits to the north = Blight and Brownfields = Today, many remnants of these more prosperous eras remain. However, many historic buildings have collapsed, either from neglect or demolition, and thousands more still lie abandoned. A handful have become protected historic properties, and 67 properties and districts were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Several blocks, with numerous old mansions, have been re- zoned as the aforementioned historic districts. A great many extravagant churches were built over the years, as well. Some still stand, but all too often money is scarce to preserve their deteriorating architecture. The trolley lines that once criss-crossed the northern streets and linked the region with the rest of Philadelphia were shut down by SEPTA in 1992. Immense, abandoned factories sit idle; warehouses lie empty; and disused heavy rail lines scar the landscape. The names of the old industrialists, such as Gratz, Poth, Uber, Bouvier and Schmidt, still adorn many buildings and street signs in the area but are otherwise foreign to many modern-day residents. The Neighborhood Transformation Initiative or NTI, was a City program launched by Mayor John F. Street. The program called for the demolition of thousands of condemned buildings and the construction of large-scale, medium-density public housing, with restoration efforts to be employed on salvageable houses. Many blocks of old rowhouses have been bulldozed and replaced with suburban-style tract houses. This program has radically changed some sections of North Philadelphia. Some charge that little effort was made to save a number of historic buildings, others that NTI was needed to change blighted neighborhoods. The lasting effects of the program remain to be seen. =Notable people= *Tierra Whack *Cecil B.

Allegheny West has advanced, mostly from the support of some of the last industries in North Philadelphia, such as Pep Boys, which is headquartered in the neighborhood. Several parts of North Philadelphia, especially those that border the Center City district, have recently been experiencing varying levels of gentrification. Once economically divested neighborhoods like Brewerytown, Francisville, Northern Liberties, Poplar and West Kensington have seen large scale development break ground. Other regions have seen virtually no change, save the rising housing values that have accompanied increased attention in urban markets. Many residents of communities in North Philadelphia have voiced resistance towards these gentrifying forces, viewing the sudden investment as an invasion that threatens the traditional character of the neighborhoods. Some poor and elderly residents have been pushed out of increasingly valued neighborhoods adjacent to the dynamic Center City housing market, as speculative buyers push outward from the city core. Many fear this process will be repeated in North Philadelphia. Many buildings are abandoned. Demographics According to the 2010 census, 340,350 people live among the ZIP codes of 19132, 19133, 19121, 19122, 19130 and 19123.

The concept relates to the idea that evolution has a purpose (teleology) and is progressive (orthogenesis), for example that feet might be better than hooves or lungs than gills. However, evolutionary biology makes no such assumptions, and natural selection shapes adaptations with no foreknowledge of any kind. It is possible for small changes (such as in the frequency of a single gene) to be reversed by chance or selection, but this is no different from the normal course of evolution. In the 19th century, when belief in orthogenesis was widespread, zoologists (such as Ray Lankester and Anton Dohrn) and the palaeontologists Alpheus Hyatt and Carl H. Eigenmann advocated the idea of devolution. The concept appears in Kurt Vonnegut's 1985 novel Gal√°pagos, which portrays a society that has evolved backwards to have small brains. Dollo's law of irreversibility, first stated in 1893 by the palaeontologist Louis Dollo, denies the possibility of devolution. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explains Dollo's law as being simply a statement about the improbability of evolution's following precisely the same path twice. Context progressively drives animal body plans towards higher levels, creating a ladder of phyla, as well as an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances. The idea of progress in such theories permits the opposite idea of decay, seen in devolution. The idea of devolution is based on the presumption of orthogenesis, the view that evolution has a purposeful direction towards increasing complexity. Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption. and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in vestigiality or in loss of genes.Dougherty, Michael J. Is the human race evolving or devolving? Scientific American July 20, 1998. Earlier views that species are subject to \\"cultural decay\\", \\"drives to perfection\\", or \\"devolution\\" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory. Early scientific theories of transmutation of species such as Lamarckism perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that adaptation through natural selection comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less \\"successful\\"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of genetics and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by Gregor Mendel. Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the modern evolutionary synthesis or the neo-Darwinism of the 20th century. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular alleles. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new mutations. Selection also might arise from more complex epigenetic or other chromosomal changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be heritable. The concept of devolution on the other hand, requires that there be a preferred hierarchy of structure and function, and that evolution must mean \\"progress\\" to \\"more advanced\\" organisms. For example, it could be said that \\"feet are better than hooves\\" or \\"lungs are better than gills\\", so their development is \\"evolutionary\\" whereas change to an inferior or \\"less advanced\\" structure would be called \\"devolution\\". In reality an evolutionary biologist defines all heritable changes to relative frequencies of the genes or indeed to epigenetic states in the gene pool as evolution. All gene pool changes that lead to increased fitness in terms of appropriate aspects of reproduction are seen as (neo-)Darwinian adaptation because, for the organisms possessing the changed structures, each is a useful adaptation to their circumstances. For example, hooves have advantages for running quickly on plains, which benefits horses, and feet offer advantages in climbing trees, which some ancestors of humans did. The concept of devolution as regress from progress relates to the ancient ideas that either life came into being through special creation or that humans are the ultimate product or goal of evolution. The latter belief is related to anthropocentrism, the idea that human existence is the point of all universal existence. Such thinking can lead on to the idea that species evolve because they \\"need to\\" in order to adapt to environmental changes. Biologists refer to this misconception as teleology, the idea of intrinsic finality that things are \\"supposed\\" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way to pursue their own good. From a biological viewpoint, in contrast, if species evolve it is not a reaction to necessity, but rather that the population contains variations with traits that favour their natural selection. This view is supported by the fossil record which demonstrates that roughly ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct. People thinking in terms of devolution commonly assume that progress is shown by increasing complexity, but biologists studying the evolution of complexity find evidence of many examples of decreasing complexity in the record of evolution. The lower jaw in fish, reptiles and mammals has seen a decrease in complexity, if measured by the number of bones. Ancestors of modern horses had several toes on each foot; modern horses have a single hooved toe. Modern humans may be evolving towards never having wisdom teeth, and already have lost most of the tail found in many other mammals - not to mention other vestigial structures, such as the vermiform appendix or the nictitating membrane. In some cases, the level of organization of living creatures can also ‚Äúshift‚Äù downwards (e.g., the loss of multicellularity in some groups of protists and fungi).Seravin L. N. (2001) The principle of counter-directional morphological evolution and its significance for constructing the megasystem of protists and other eukaryotes. Protistology 2: 6-14, . A more rational version of the concept of devolution, a version that does not involve concepts of \\"primitive\\" or \\"advanced\\" organisms, is based on the observation that if certain genetic changes in a particular combination (sometimes in a particular sequence as well) are precisely reversed, one should get precise reversal of the evolutionary process, yielding an atavism or \\"throwback\\", whether more or less complex than the ancestors where the process began.Medawar, P. B., Medawar, J. S.; Aristotle to Zoos: A Philosophical Dictionary of Biology; Harvard University Press 1985, At a trivial level, where just one or a few mutations are involved, selection pressure in one direction can have one effect, which can be reversed by new patterns of selection when conditions change. That could be seen as reversed evolution, though the concept is not of much interest because it does not differ in any functional or effective way from any other adaptation to selection pressures.Majerus, Michael E. N. (ed:Fellowes, M, et al.); The Peppered Moth: Decline of a Darwinian Disciple; Insect Evolutionary Ecology (Royal Entomological Society) CABI 2005 As the number of genetic changes rises however, one combinatorial effect is that it becomes vanishingly unlikely that the full course of adaptation can be reversed precisely. Also, if one of the original adaptations involved complete loss of a gene, one can neglect any probability of reversal. Accordingly, one might well expect reversal of peppered moth colour changes, but not reversal of the loss of limbs in snakes. History B√©n√©dict Morel (1809‚Äì1873) suggested a link between the environment and social degeneration. The concept of degenerative evolution was used by scientists in the 19th century, at this time it was believed by most biologists that evolution had some kind of direction. In 1857 the physician B√©n√©dict Morel influenced by Lamarckism claimed that environmental factors such as taking drugs or alcohol would produce social degeneration in the offspring of those individuals, and would revert those offspring to a primitive state.Moore, James Richard. History, Humanity and Evolution: Essays for John C. Greene, p. 331 Morel, a devout Catholic, had believed that mankind had started in perfection, contrasting modern humanity to the past, Morel claimed there had been \\"Morbid deviation from an original type\\".Beer, Daniel. Renovating Russia: the human sciences and the fate of liberal modernity, 1880-1930, 2008, p. 36 His theory of devolution was later advocated by some biologists. According to Roger Luckhurst: > Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards > human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident > or consoling. Using Darwin's theory, and many rival biological accounts of > development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as > possible to devolve, to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior > states of development.Luckhurst, Roger. Late Victorian Gothic tales, 2005, > p. 20 Link One of the first biologists to suggest devolution was Ray Lankester, he explored the possibility that evolution by natural selection may in some cases lead to devolution, an example he studied was the regressions in the life cycle of sea squirts. Lankester discussed the idea of devolution in his book Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism (1880). He was a critic of progressive evolution, pointing out that higher forms existed in the past which have since degenerated into simpler forms. Lankester argued that \\"if it was possible to evolve, it was also possible to devolve, and that complex organisms could devolve into simpler forms or animals\\".Moore, Gregory; Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. Darwin's Screens: Evolutionary Aesthetics, Time and Sexual Display in the Cinema By Barbara Creed, 2009, p. 8Nietzsche, biology, and metaphor, 2002, p. 117 Anton Dohrn also developed a theory of degenerative evolution based on his studies of vertebrates. According to Dohrn many chordates are degenerated because of their environmental conditions. Dohrn claimed cyclostomes such as lampreys are degenerate fish as there is no evidence their jawless state is an ancestral feature but is the product of environmental adaptation due to parasitism. According to Dohrn if cyclostomes would devolve further then they would resemble something like an Amphioxus.Bowler, Peter J. Life's splendid drama: evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life's ancestry 1860-1940, 1996, p. 164 The historian of biology Peter J. Bowler has written that devolution was taken seriously by proponents of orthogenesis and others in the late 19th century who at this period of time firmly believed that there was a direction in evolution. Orthogenesis was the belief that evolution travels in internally directed trends and levels. The paleontologist Alpheus Hyatt discussed devolution in his work, using the concept of racial senility as the mechanism of devolution. Bowler defines racial senility as \\"an evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began.\\"Bowler, Peter J. The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolution theories in the decades around 1900, 1992, p. 161 Hyatt who studied the fossils of invertebrates believed that up to a point ammonoids developed by regular stages up until a specific level but would later due to unfavourable conditions descend back to a previous level, this according to Hyatt was a form of lamarckism as the degeneration was a direct response to external factors. To Hyatt after the level of degeneration the species would then become extinct, according to Hyatt there was a \\"phase of youth, a phase of maturity, a phase of senility or degeneration foreshadowing the extinction of a type\\".Bowler, Peter J. Evolution: the history of an idea, 1989, p. 263The Encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 20, Hugh Chisholm, The Encyclop√¶dia britannica company, 1911, p. 590 To Hyatt the devolution was predetermined by internal factors which organisms can neither control or reverse. This idea of all evolutionary branches eventually running out of energy and degenerating into extinction was a pessimistic view of evolution and was unpopular amongst many scientists of the time.Bowler, Peter J. Evolution: the history of an idea, 1989, p. 249 Carl H. Eigenmann an ichthyologist wrote Cave vertebrates of America: a study in degenerative evolution (1909) in which he concluded that cave evolution was essentially degenerative.Romero Diaz, Aldemaro. The biology of hypogean fishes, 2001, p. 57 The entomologist William Morton WheelerLustig, Abigail; Richards, Robert John; Ruse, Michael. Darwinian heresies, 2004, p.11 and the Lamarckian Ernest MacBride (1866‚Äì1940) also advocated degenerative evolution. According to Macbride invertebrates were actually degenerate vertebrates, his argument was based on the idea that \\"crawling on the seabed was inherently less stimulating than swimming in open waters.\\"Bowler, Peter J. Life's splendid drama: evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life's ancestry 1860-1940, 1996, p. 432 Dollo's law It has been observed that complex body parts evolve in a lineage over many generations; once lost, they are unlikely to re-evolve. This observation is sometimes generalized to a hypothesis known as Dollo's law, which states that evolution is not reversible. This does not imply that similar engineering solutions cannot be found by natural selection: the tails of the cetacea‚Äîwhales, dolphins and porpoises, which are evolved from formerly land-dwelling mammals‚Äîrepresent an adaptation of the spinal column for propulsion in water. Unlike the tails of the mammal's marine ancestor, the Sarcopterygii, and of the teleosts, which move from side to side, the cetacean's tail moves up and down as it flexes its mammalian spine: the function of the tail in providing propulsion is remarkably similar. In literature Kurt Vonnegut's 1985 novel Gal√°pagos is set a million years in the future, where humans have \\"devolved\\" to have much smaller brains.Moore, Lorrie. \\"How Humans Got Flippers and Beaks\\", New York Times October 6, 1985, section 7, page 7.

Originally named \\"Depot Field\\", it was renamed in honor of Lieutenant General Millard F. Harmon, who disappeared on 26 February 1945 on a flight from Kwajalein to Hawaii. Despite the most intensive search by Army and Navy planes and surface vessels, no trace of the plane was ever found. On February 25, 1946, he was declared officially dead. History Harmon Field was the headquarters for the XXI Bomber Command and later Twentieth Air Force which directed the B-29 Superfortress strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese Home Islands. It was also the major B-29 aircraft depot and maintenance facility in the Western Pacific during the war, and that mission continued for Far East Air Forces until its closure. Harmon was used operationally by the USAF 11th Bombardment Group as an operational B-29 Base. After the war the 9th Bombardment Group used the base for strategic reconnaissance missions and the 374th Troop Carrier Group of the Technical Service Command used the base for transport of supplies and equipment from its depot facilities. Harmon AFB was closed in 1949 due to budget constraints and was merged with the neighboring Naval Air Station Agana. Today, the technical facilities are an industrial area to the northeast of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, which served as the main airfield for both Harmon AFB and NAS Agana.

Spalding-Peterborough route change The route of the A16 changed following the completion of the new Spalding- Peterborough link road. The section between Spalding to the south of Crowland only, opened in August 2010; the remainder was completed in October 2011. The new route has taken the number A16, effectively linking the route with Peterborough, with the current road from Spalding to Stamford becoming the A1175.Chance to see route of ¬£69.8 million road from Spalding to Eye , Lincs. Free Press, 25 September 2008 This new section replaced the A1073 road, a road that ran between the former A16 at south of Spalding in Lincolnshire and the A47 between Eye and Eye Green at near Peterborough. The A1073 route had become increasingly dangerous over the years because traffic usage had increased. It was narrow with many blind corners and slopes, and much of it was on an embankment with deep ditches either side and no run-off areas. There were dangerous junctions, particularly with the B1443 between Peakirk and Thorney, which formed a staggered crossroads. The road was a principal route servicing the food-processing industry in Spalding, bringing in supplies and moving products to the supermarket distribution system to the south. An upgrade to the route had been under discussion for many years. The main hold-up was arguments over funding between the administrative counties of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and the Department for Transport, exacerbated by the actions of a former Leader of Lincolnshire County Council who went to jail for seeking to influence the route to his own financial advantage. Eventually a route was agreed, avoiding Cowbit and Crowland and joining the A47 west of Eye, and in 2008 construction work began, originally due to be completed by Autumn 2010. The Northern of the new route opened between Spalding and the roundabout south of Crowland in Autumn 2010, with the opening of the Southern delayed due to structural problems at the embankment at Car Dyke Bridge. On completion of remedial repairs and the opening of the Southern portion on 16 October 2011, the new road was renumbered to form part of the A16; the original A1073 alignment between Spalding and Eye Green became an unclassified local road.Chance to see route of ¬£89 million road from Spalding to Eye , Lincs.

Calcification is the accumulation of calcium salts in a body tissue. It normally occurs in the formation of bone, but calcium can be deposited abnormally in soft tissue,Miller, J. D.

Calcifications may be classified on whether there is mineral balance or not, and the location of the calcification.Calcification The American Heritage Science Dictionary. Retrieved 2013-03-23. Calcification may also refer to the processes of normal mineral deposition in biological systems, such as the formation of stromatolites or mollusc shells (see Mineralization (biology) or Biomineralization). Signs and symptoms Calcification can manifest itself in many ways in the body depending on the location. Causes of soft tissue calcification Calcification of soft tissue (arteries, cartilage, heart valves, etc.) can be caused by vitamin K2 deficiency or by poor calcium absorption due to a high calcium/vitamin D ratio. This can occur with or without a mineral imbalance. Intake of excessive vitamin D can cause vitamin D poisoning and excessive intake of calcium from the intestine, when accompanied by a deficiency of vitamin K (perhaps induced by an anticoagulant) can result in calcification of arteries and other soft tissue.Paul Price, et al., \\"Warfarin-Induced Artery Calcification Is Accelerated by Growth and Vitamin D\\", Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, 2000, Vol. 20, pp. 317-327. Such metastatic soft tissue calcification is mainly in tissues containing \\"calcium catchers\\" such as elastic fibres or sour mucopolysaccharides. These tissues especially include the lungs (pumice lung) and the aorta.McGavin, Zachary.

Laminated appearance suggests granulomatous disease while popcorn calcification indicates hamartoma. Malignant lesions may have stippled or eccentric calcification. =Breast disease= In a number of breast pathologies, calcium is often deposited at sites of cell death or in association secretions or hyalinized stroma, resulting in pathologic calcification. For example, small, irregular, linear calcifications may be seen, via mammography, in a ductal carcinoma-in-situ to produce visible radio- opacities. Robbins and Cotran (2009), Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Elsevier. Diagnosis In terms of diagnosis, in this case vascular calcification, an ultrasound and radiography of said area is sufficient. Treatment Treatment of high calcium/vitamin D ratio may most easily be accomplished by intake of more vitamin D if vitamin K is normal. Intake of too much vitamin D would be evident by anorexia, loss of appetite, or soft tissue calcification.

In 2011 a larger group of refugees moved from another apartment complex into one in the Richardson ISD district and the Wallace Elementary attendance boundary. The students spoke Chin, Karen, and Karenni. In the fall of 2011 there were 96 Burmese students at Wallace Elementary, making up around 16% of the student population.

January 1990. Retrieved on May 24, 2016. By 1990 the addition of children living in apartments to the school caused the demographics to become more heavily minority and poor. In 1989 the school had 500 students. That year the number of ethnic minority students rose from 25 to 130. Due to the Fair Housing Act of 1988 apartments could no longer deny families with children as tenants. However its student body was still more affluent than those of surrounding schools. **The construction of Lake Highlands Town Center on the site of demolished apartments meant that the number of low income and minority students declined and the test scores improved: in the 2005-2006 school year, there were 270 low income students, making up 44% of the student body, and there were 205 black students, and 110 Hispanic students; 87% of the students passed Texas standardized tests, and 24% were ranked as \\"commended\\" on these tests. There were 620 total students in 2006. The student body immediately declined after the demolition of the apartments. In 2009-2010 the school had 96 low income students, making up 17% of the student body, and there were 68 Hispanic students and 68 black students; 97% of students passed state tests, the highest percentage of any RISD school, and 57% reached commended. The number of high income white students increased significantly after the apartments were demolished. **By the late aughts the popularity of the school caused it to be overcrowded with students, starting a political issue on whether to build a new school. There were 630 students by 2012, and then around 2014 there were 800 students. RISD had added classrooms that year, giving the school a capacity of 912, but the district projected that in 2017 the school would need to have portable classrooms as there still would be too many students. Eric Nicholson of D Magazine wrote \\"Whether White Rock Elementary actually got better at educating students is a trickier question\\" since on one hand having too high poverty levels in any school can damage student performance, but also that the \\"strongest single predictor of student achievement\\" is socioeconomic status; however he added that the area real estate market perceived White Rock as having improved, and therefore house values rose. *White Rock Trail Elementary School (Dallas) ** Planning to open in August 2018Fancher, Julie. \\"Richardson ISD to decide whether new school will shake up elementary boundaries.\\" The Dallas Morning News.

Playing career Naehring graduated from La Salle High School, and attended Miami University. In 1987, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Red Sox in the 8th round of the 1988 amateur draft. He made his major league debut on July 15, 1990 against the Kansas City Royals. In his years as a starter, Naehring was a fine-fielding third baseman and solid all-around offensive player. He hit .307 with 10 HR and 57 RBI for the AL East Champion Red Sox in 1995. The following season, he hit .288 and set career highs with 17 HR and 65 RBI. In his final campaign in 1997, Naehring was on his way to having his finest season, as he batted .286 with 9 HR and 40 RBI through just 70 games, but a shoulder injury forced him to miss more than half the games that year. He played his final game on June 23, 1997 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Naehring homered in his second to last at bat.

The band gap varies from approximately 1.4 to 2.2 eV, depending on composition. Radiation detectors using CZT can operate in direct-conversion (or photoconductive) mode at room temperature, unlike some other materials (particularly germanium) which require liquid nitrogen cooling. Their relative advantages include high sensitivity for x-rays and gamma-rays, due to the high atomic numbers of Cd and Te, and better energy resolution than scintillator detectors. CZT can be formed into different shapes for different radiation- detecting applications, and a variety of electrode geometries, such as coplanar grids and small pixel detectors, have been developed to provide unipolar (electron-only) operation, thereby improving energy resolution.

Although originally developed for military purposes, it is also widely used in commercial customer service organisations.US Defense Acquisition University on Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Elements ILS defined In general, ILS plans and directs the identification and development of logistics support and system requirements for military systems, with the goal of creating systems that last longer and require less support, thereby reducing costs and increasing return on investments. ILS therefore addresses these aspects of supportability not only during acquisition, but also throughout the operational life cycle of the system. The impact of ILS is often measured in terms of metrics such as reliability, availability, maintainability and testability (RAMT), and sometimes System Safety (RAMS). ILS is the integrated planning and action of a number of disciplines in concert with one another to assure system availability. The planning of each element of ILS is ideally developed in coordination with the system engineering effort and with each other. Tradeoffs may be required between elements in order to acquire a system that is: affordable (lowest life cycle cost), operable, supportable, sustainable, transportable, and environmentally sound. In some cases, a deliberate process of Logistics Support Analysis will be used to identify tasks within each logistics support element. The most widely accepted list of ILS activities include: *Reliability engineering, maintainability engineering and maintenance (preventive, predictive and corrective) planning *Supply (spare part) support acquire resources *Support and test equipment/equipment support *Manpower and personnel *Training and training support *Technical data/publications *Computer resources support *Facilities *Packaging, handling, storage and transportation *Design interface Decisions are documented in a life cycle sustainment plan (LCSP), a Supportability Strategy, or (most commonly) an Integrated Logistics Support Plan (ILSP). ILS planning activities coincide with development of the system acquisition strategy, and the program will be tailored accordingly. A properly executed ILS strategy will ensure that the requirements for each of the elements of ILS are properly planned, resourced, and implemented. These actions will enable the system to achieve the operational readiness levels required by the warfighter at the time of fielding and throughout the life cycle.United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (UK MoD) Through Life Support (TLS) Directorate into the following elements and promulgated in UK Defence Standard (DEFSTAN) 00-600Defense Acquisition University ILS can be also used for civilian projects, as highlighted by the ASD/AIA ILS Guide.SX000i - International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications It is considered common practice within some industries - primarily Defence - for ILS practitioners to take a leave of absence to undertake an ILS Sabbatical; furthering their knowledge of the logistics engineering disciplines. ILS Sabbaticals are normally taken in developing nations - allowing the practitioner an insight into sustainment practices in an environment of limited materiel resources. Adoption ILS is a technique introduced by the US Army to ensure that the supportability of an equipment item is considered during its design and development. The technique was adopted by the UK MoD in 1993 and made compulsory for the procurement of the majority of MOD equipment. *Influence on Design. Integrated Logistic Support will provide important means to identify (as early as possible) reliability issues / problems and can initiate system or part design improvements based on reliability, maintainability, testability or system availability analysis *Design of the Support Solution for minimum cost. Ensuring that the Support Solution considers and integrates the elements considered by ILS. This is discussed fully below. *Initial Support Package. These tasks include calculation of requirements for spare parts, special tools, and documentation. Quantities required for a specified initial period are calculated, procured, and delivered to support delivery, installation in some of the cases, and operation of the equipment. The ILS management process facilitates specification, design, development, acquisition, test, fielding, and support of systems. Maintenance planning Maintenance planning begins early in the acquisition process with development of the maintenance concept. It is conducted to evolve and establish requirements and tasks to be accomplished for achieving, restoring, and maintaining the operational capability for the life of the system. Maintenance planning also involves Level Of Repair Analysis (LORA) as a function of the system acquisition process. Maintenance planning will: *Define the actions and support necessary to ensure that the system attains the specified system readiness objectives with minimum Life Cycle Cost (LCC). *Set up specific criteria for repair, including Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) requirements, testability, reliability, and maintainability; support equipment requirements; automatic test equipment; and manpower skills and facility requirements. *State specific maintenance tasks, to be performed on the system. *Define actions and support required for fielding and marketing the system. *Address warranty considerations. *The maintenance concept must ensure prudent use of manpower and resources. When formulating the maintenance concept, analysis of the proposed work environment on the health and safety of maintenance personnel must be considered. *Conduct a LORA repair analysis to optimize the support system, in terms of LCC, readiness objectives, design for discard, maintenance task distribution, support equipment and ATE, and manpower and personnel requirements. *Minimize the use of hazardous materials and the generation of waste. Supply support Supply support encompasses all management actions, procedures, and techniques used to determine requirements to: *Acquire support items and spare parts. *Catalog the items. *Receive the items. *Store and warehouse the items. *Transfer the items to where they are needed. *Issue the items. *Dispose of secondary items. *Provide for initial support of the system. *Acquire, distribute, and replenish inventory Support and test equipment Support and test equipment includes all equipment, mobile and fixed, that is required to perform the support functions, except that equipment which is an integral part of the system. Support equipment categories include: *Handling and Maintenance Equipment. *Tools (hand tools as well as power tools). *Metrology and measurement devices. *Calibration equipment. *Test equipment. *Automatic test equipment. *Support equipment for on- and off-equipment maintenance. *Special inspection equipment and depot maintenance plant equipment, which includes all equipment and tools required to assemble, disassemble, test, maintain, and support the production and/or depot repair of end items or components. This also encompasses planning and acquisition of logistic support for this equipment. Manpower and personnel Manpower and personnel involves identification and acquisition of personnel with skills and grades required to operate and maintain a system over its lifetime. Manpower requirements are developed and personnel assignments are made to meet support demands throughout the life cycle of the system. Manpower requirements are based on related ILS elements and other considerations. Human factors engineering (HFE) or behavioral research is frequently applied to ensure a good man-machine interface. Manpower requirements are predicated on accomplishing the logistics support mission in the most efficient and economical way. This element includes requirements during the planning and decision process to optimize numbers, skills, and positions. This area considers:. *Man-machine and environmental interface *Special skills *Human factors considerations during the planning and decision process Training and training devices Training and training devices support encompasses the processes, procedures, techniques, training devices, and equipment used to train personnel to operate and support a system. This element defines qualitative and quantitative requirements for the training of operating and support personnel throughout the life cycle of the system. It includes requirements for: *Competencies management *Factory training *Instructor and key personnel training *New equipment training team *Resident training *Sustainment training *User training *HAZMAT disposal and safe procedures training Embedded training devices, features, and components are designed and built into a specific system to provide training or assistance in the use of the system. (One example of this is the HELP files of many software programs.) The design, development, delivery, installation, and logistic support of required embedded training features, mockups, simulators, and training aids are also included. Technical data Technical Data and Technical Publications consists of scientific or technical information necessary to translate system requirements into discrete engineering and logistic support documentation. Technical data is used in the development of repair manuals, maintenance manuals, user manuals, and other documents that are used to operate or support the system. Technical data includes, but may not be limited to: *Technical manuals *Technical and supply bulletins *Transportability guidance technical manuals *Maintenance expenditure limits and calibration procedures *Repair parts and tools lists *Maintenance allocation charts *Corrective maintenance instructions *Preventive maintenance and Predictive maintenance instructions *Drawings/specifications/technical data packages *Software documentation *Provisioning documentation *Depot maintenance work requirements *Identification lists *Component lists *Product support data *Flight safety critical parts list for aircraft *Lifting and tie down pamphlet/references *Hazardous Material documentation Computer resources support Computer Resources Support includes the facilities, hardware, software, documentation, manpower, and personnel needed to operate and support computer systems and the software within those systems. Computer resources include both stand-alone and embedded systems. This element is usually planned, developed, implemented, and monitored by a Computer Resources Working Group (CRWG) or Computer Resources Integrated Product Team (CR-IPT) that documents the approach and tracks progress via a Computer Resources Life-Cycle Management Plan (CRLCMP). Developers will need to ensure that planning actions and strategies contained in the ILSP and CRLCMP are complementary and that computer resources support for the operational software, and ATE software, support software, is available where and when needed. Packaging, handling, storage, and transportation (PHS&T;) This element includes resources and procedures to ensure that all equipment and support items are preserved, packaged, packed, marked, handled, transported, and stored properly for short- and long-term requirements. It includes material-handling equipment and packaging, handling and storage requirements, and pre-positioning of material and parts. It also includes preservation and packaging level requirements and storage requirements (for example, sensitive, proprietary, and controlled items). This element includes planning and programming the details associated with movement of the system in its shipping configuration to the ultimate destination via transportation modes and networks available and authorized for use. It further encompasses establishment of critical engineering design parameters and constraints (e.g., width, length, height, component and system rating, and weight) that must be considered during system development. Customs requirements, air shipping requirements, rail shipping requirements, container considerations, special movement precautions, mobility, and transportation asset impact of the shipping mode or the contract shipper must be carefully assessed. PHS&T; planning must consider: *System constraints (such as design specifications, item configuration, and safety precautions for hazardous material) *Special security requirements *Geographic and environmental restrictions *Special handling equipment and procedures *Impact on spare or repair parts storage requirements *Emerging PHS&T; technologies, methods, or procedures and resource-intensive PHS&T; procedures *Environmental impacts and constraints Facilities The Facilities logistics element is composed of a variety of planning activities, all of which are directed toward ensuring that all required permanent or semi-permanent operating and support facilities (for instance, training, field and depot maintenance, storage, operational, and testing) are available concurrently with system fielding. Planning must be comprehensive and include the need for new construction as well as modifications to existing facilities. It also includes studies to define and establish impacts on life cycle cost, funding requirements, facility locations and improvements, space requirements, environmental impacts, duration or frequency of use, safety and health standards requirements, and security restrictions. Also included are any utility requirements, for both fixed and mobile facilities, with emphasis on limiting requirements of scarce or unique resources. Design interface Design interface is the relationship of logistics-related design parameters of the system to its projected or actual support resource requirements. These design parameters are expressed in operational terms rather than as inherent values and specifically relate to system requirements and support costs of the system. Programs such as \\"design for testability\\" and \\"design for discard\\" must be considered during system design. The basic requirements that need to be considered as part of design interface include: *Reliability *Maintainability *Standardization *Interoperability *Safety *Security *Usability *Environmental and HAZMAT *Privacy, particularly for computer systems *Legal See also *Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware) References The references below cover many relevant standards and handbooks related to Integrated logistics support. =Standards= *Army Regulation 700-127 Integrated Logistics Support, 27 September 2007 * British Defence Standard 00-600 Integrated Logistics Support for MOD Projects * Federal Standard 1037C in support of MIL-STD-188 * IEEE 1332, IEEE Standard Reliability Program for the Development and Production of Electronic Systems and Equipment, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. * MIL-STD-785, Reliability Program for Systems and Equipment Development and Production, U.S. Department of Defense. * MIL-STD 1388-1A Logistic Support Analysis (LSA) * MIL-STD 1388-2B Requirements for a Logistic Support Analysis Record * MIL-STD-1629A, Procedures for Performing a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) * MIL-STD-2173, Reliability Centered Maintenance Requirements, U.S. Department of Defense (superseded by NAVAIR 00-25-403) * OPNAVINST 4130.2A *DEF(AUST)5691 Logistic Support Analysis *DEF(AUST)5692 Logistic Support Analysis Record Requirements for the Australian Defence Organisation =Specifications - not standards= The ASD/AIA Suite of S-Series ILS specifications * SX000i - International guide for integrated logistic support (under development) * S1000D - International specification for technical publications using a common source database * S2000M - International specification for materiel management - Integrated data processing * S3000L - International specification for Logistics Support Analysis - LSA * S4000P - International specification for developing and continuously improving preventive maintenance * S5000F - International specification for operational and maintenance data feedback (under development) * S6000T - International specification for training needs analysis - TNA (definition on-going) * SX001G - Glossary for the Suite of S-specifications * SX002D - Common Data Model * AECMA 1000D (Technical Publications) - Refer to S1000D above * AECMA 2000M (initial provisioning) - Refer to S2000M above * DI-ILSS-80095, Data Item Description: Integrated Logistics Support Plan (ILSP) (17 Dec 1985) =Handbooks= * Integrated Logistics Support Handbook, third edition - James V.

In 1980, he began calling play-by- play for the Oklahoma City 89ers, a minor league baseball team. He broadcast for the Louisville Redbirds beginning in 1983. He also called Missouri Tigers men's basketball for many years and did Chicago Bulls radio from 1989 to 1991. Major League Baseball career Rooney broadcast for the Minnesota Twins in the mid-1980s. In 1988, he joined the Chicago White Sox' television crew; the following year, he switched to the team's radio booth, where he teamed up with Wayne Hagin (1989 to 1991) and Ed Farmer (1992 to 2005). In September 2005, it was announced that Rooney would be leaving the White Sox' radio crew after 18 years, due to a salary dispute with their new flagship station.http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/98374 His final broadcast with the team was Game 4 of the 2005 World Series, which ended in the White Sox' first Series championship since 1917.

Early life and education Kluckhohn matriculated at Princeton University, but was forced by ill health to take a break from study and went to convalesce on a ranch in New Mexico owned by his mother's cousin's husband, Evon Z. Vogt. During this period he first came into contact with neighboring Navajo and began a lifelong love of their language and culture. He wrote two popular books based on his experiences in Navajo country, To the Foot of the Rainbow (1927) and Beyond the Rainbow (1933). He resumed study at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and received his AB in Greek 1928. He then studied classics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1928‚Äì1930Papers of Clyde Kluckhohn - Special Collections - The University of Iowa Libraries For the following two years, he studied anthropology at the University of Vienna and was exposed to psychoanalysis. After teaching at the University of New Mexico from 1932‚Äì1934, he continued graduate work in anthropology at Harvard University where he received his Ph.D in 1936. He remained at Harvard as a professor in Social Anthropology and later also Social Relations for the rest of his life.Parsons, Talcott and Evon Z.

A key methodological approach that he developed together with his wife Florence Rockwood Kluckhohn and colleagues Evon Z. Vogt and Ethel M. Albert, among others, was the Values Orientation Theory. They believed that cross-cultural understanding and communication could be facilitated by analyzing a given culture's orientation to five key aspects of human life: Human Nature (people seen as intrinsically good, evil, or mixed); Man-Nature Relationship (the view that humans should be subordinate to nature, dominant over nature, or live in harmony with nature); Time (primary value placed on past/tradition, present/enjoyment, or future/posterity/delayed gratification); Activity (being, becoming/inner development, or doing/striving/industriousness); and Social Relations (hierarchical, collateral/collective-egalitarian, or individualistic). The Values Orientation Method was developed furthest by Florence Kluckhohn and her colleagues and students in later years.Kluckhohn, Florence R., & Fred L. Strodtbeck. (1961). Variations in Value Orientations. Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson.Russo, Kurt W. 2000. \\"Finding the middle ground: insights and applications of the value orientations method.\\" Yarmouth, ME: Intercultural Press, Inc. Kluckhohn received many honors throughout his career. In 1947 he served as president of the American Anthropological Association and became first director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard. In the same year his book Mirror for Man won the McGraw Hill award for best popular writing on science. Kluckhohn initially believed in the biological equality of races but later reversed his position. Kluckhohn wrote in 1959 that \\"in the light of accumulating information as to significantly varying incidence of mapped genes among different peoples, it seems unwise to assume flatly that ‚Äòman‚Äôs innate capacity does not vary from one population to another‚Äô.... On the premise that specific capacities are influenced by the properties of each gene pool, it seems very likely indeed that populations differ quantitatively in their potentialities for particular kinds of achievement.‚ÄùClyde Kluckhohn: Review; 'Man‚Äôs Way: a Preface to the Understanding of Human Society', by Walter Goldschmidt.

History Rock Valley College was founded in 1964 to allow students from the region in and around Rockford Public School District No. 205 the opportunity to receive post-secondary education similar to university curriculum. RVC‚Äôs district comprises all of Winnebago and Boone County and parts of Stephenson, Ogle, McHenry and DeKalb counties. Authorized by the Illinois General Assembly and signed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. in 1961, legislation was enacted that created the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE). The IBHE was tasked by statute with formulating a Master Plan for Higher Education in the state of Illinois. In July 1964 the higher education master plan was published by the IBHE, which led to the Junior College Act of 1965. Soon thereafter, a district-wide referendum was approved that authorized the founding of RVC. It received accreditation via the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1971. In April 1965, Clifford G. Erickson was chosen by the first Board of Trustees to be the first President of Rock Valley College, and classes began on September 29, 1965 for 1,054 students. However, the main campus was not ready for classes. Instead, during the first year, classes were held in various locations throughout Rockford, including Harlem High School, the Rockford YWCA, the National Guard Armory, and the Naval Reserve Armory. By Fall 1966, classes moved to three small wooden buildings at the current main campus location . The buildings, referred to as \\"temp building\\" on campus, remained active in a variety of capacities for 37 years. In October 1967, the groundbreaking for six permanent buildings occurred. It took five years to complete Classrooms I and II, a Boiler House, Educational Resource Center (ERC), Student Center (SC) and the Physical Education Center (PEC). In 1968 the college began an aviation maintenance program at the Rockford Airport (now the Chicago Rockford International Airport) and an automotive service tech program in the neighboring town of Belvidere. Both programs are still active. In January 1969, Dr. Karl Jacobs became the second RVC President. During his 28-year tenure, the college expanded both programs and locations. In 1970, the American Dental Association's Council of Education approved the RVC Dental Assisting Program. The next year, the college took over the Adult and Continuing Education program from the Rockford School District, offering personal enrichment and professional development classes to the public. A Tool and Die Apprenticeship program was added in 1974. In 1978, the college began offering college credit to high school students taking classes through the High School Connections program. In 1981 the college purchased an unused school building, Bell School, which is used for many of the community education classes. Dr. Jacobs also spearheaded the building of the Technology Center (now Woodward Tech Center or WTC) and the implementation of numerous technology programs. The Tech Center opened in 1987, helping with a cooperative education agreement reached the previous year with Chrysler Motor Corporation that allowed workers to take technology courses that went toward job training for the Belvidere plant as well as college credit. It also became the first testing location for robotics classroom software developed by the University of Michigan. Upon Jacobs' retirement, Roland Chapdelaine became the college's third president in 1997. He continued expansion of the college and its facilities. Under his leadership, the Student Center was remodeled, the Support Services Building (SSB) was built, and the state of the art Bengt Sjostrom Theatre with its retractable roof was unveiled. Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, Illinois Senator Dave Syverson, Larry Young, author Kimberla Lawson Roby, illustrator Tom Lichtenheld, and chancellor Susan Sciame-Giesecke, are members of the college alumni. Campus Rock Valley College is located on a tract of land at Mulford and Spring Brook roads in northeast Rockford. In addition to the main campus, RVC operates programs at owned facilities at the Stenstrom Center for Career Education on Samuelson Road, home to several health and technical programs, the Aviation Center at the Chicago Rockford International Airport in Rockford, and the Bell School Road Center, which houses the college‚Äôs Center for Learning in Retirement. Rock Valley College holds continuing education classes at more than 50 sites throughout its district, and operates employment and training programs at the Illinois Employment Training Center at 303 North Main Street in Rockford. Academics and demographics Rock Valley College is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) to offer certificates, diplomas and associate degrees. It received the maximum ten-year accreditation approval by the Higher Learning Commission of the NCA during its last review through the year 2014. It received initial accreditation in 1971 after applying for accreditation candidacy in 1967. Rock Valley College partners with area four-year colleges and universities, such as Northern Illinois University, University of Illinois, Springfield, and Western Illinois University as a part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide transfer agreement which ensures general education credits are transferable among more than 100 participating college or universities in Illinois. There are two primary educational tracks at RVC: Transfer Programs, and Career Educational Programs. The tracks offer a total of 33 associate degree programs, and 34 certificate programs to students of RVC. =Enrollment= As of April 13, 2009, for-credit Spring enrollment at RVC was 8,072, of which 3,569 were enrolled full-time, and 4,503 were enrolled part- time. In addition, 7,853 non-credit enrollees were reported by RVC for the same period. Dual credit students, who are obtaining college credit while attending high school accounted for 536 students of total enrollment. Overall student head count at the college rose 8 percent from 2008 school year. Most of the increase in enrollment was attributed to new freshmen beginning at community colleges, as well as the introduction of new programs at the college. =Libraries= Rock Valley College provides a library at its main Rockford, Illinois Campus. The library has over 100,000 volumes and equivalent online periodical and newspaper databases. It has facilities for study, research, leisure reading, class preparation, and wireless Internet access for students. Athletics Nine men's and women's intercollegiate sports are offered at RVC. The Golden Eagles compete in NJCAA Division III in volleyball, men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's soccer and men's and women's bowling. RVC has won six NJCAA National Championships in volleyball, golf, and tennis. The 2014 men's basketball team won the NJCAA DIII national tournament in Loch Sheldrake, NY at Sullivan County Community College, the first national championship in the program's 48-year history.http://rockvalleycollege.edu/Athletics/MensBasketball/nationalchampionship2014.cfm RVC was one of only four community colleges to field a football program among the 48-member Illinois Community College System. Due to funding and attendance issues, the RVC Board of Trustees voted to discontinue the football program on April 28, 2009. Theatre and arts The college Theatre Department offers year-round opportunities for students and community members through its two theatres: Rock Valley College Starlight Theatre and Rock Valley College Studio Theatre. The Starlight Theatre is housed in the award- winninghttp://www.studiogang.net/work/1998/starlighttheatre outdoor Bengt Sjostrom Theatre, which features a movable roof. Studio Theatre was housed in a converted barn on the campus, along with Theatre Department offices and costume storage facilities. Plans to relocate them from \\"the barn\\" to a new Arts Instructional Center (AIC) with modern amenities have been tabled by the college's Board of Trustees.

Guererro explained in a twenty-year anniversary interview: > I'm not quite sure how me and Thiebaud met; through mutual friends, I think. > We were skating together all the time, when he moved to the city and I was > giving him Powell gear, and that's, and then he got on Powell, you know, > after that‚Äîhe just felt it wasn't right, you know? And, he went to skate for > Natas. You know, he skated for, for, SMA for a while, and then the > opportunity came to do something with Real. He approached me, but also > Fausto and those guys approached me to be part of it, and at that point in > time, at Powell, I was sort of being put on the back burner‚Äî'cause all the > young guns coming, and I felt it, I knew, you know.

Guererro, an accomplished musician in addition to his ongoing role at Real, has praised Thiebaud for his commitment to the company, explaining that, \\"Jim has held it down ... and really is, the genius behind Real. It's all owed to the skaters and to Jim; all skaters past, present, and to come. '91‚Äîwhen we first got our boards in, and, um ... and that's why we're here today, twenty years later.\\" In 2012, Real released the Pushing series that featured video parts of its riders showcasing locations in the North American continent, according to the hometowns of the team riders‚Äîthe parts were named after the respective locations, e.g. Pushing Georgia and Pushing Vancouver. Senior team riders Dennis Busenitz, Ernie Torres, and Peter Ramondetta (with Kyle Walker) were featured \\"pushing\\" San Francisco, Colorado, and Oklahoma, respectively. The series blurb explained: \\"As part of this year's summer tour the REAL riders each went home to push. Not only to skate the streets they call home, but to push the areas themselves.\\" Actions REALized In May 2013, Thiebaud collaborated with longtime friend Billie Joe Armstrong from American band Green Day to form the Actions REALized X Green Day collaboration deck project in support of the Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland that is based in California, U.S. The Center is the Bay Area's sole independent children's hospital and a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the skateboard decks will be donated to benefit the Center's mission to care for every child who needs help, regardless of their financial status. The fundraising campaign is part of Real's \\"Actions REALized\\" division that undertakes projects based on the premise that \\"skateboarding can be a positive force for change\\", and past projects have contributed to efforts to combat childhood leukemia and the relief efforts in the wake of the 2011 Japanese earthquake.

Stranger has explained the original concept that underpinned AntiHero in the following manner: \\"Oh, there's was no concept ... well, maybe there was, I don't know. Just kind of balance out the rest, or something, with what was going on with us.\\" Phelps has stated further to Stranger's vague explanation: > I think if you pay attention to life and the way things are, that you, you > come out pretty jaded by, you know, life.

Critics describe the conference as having \\"loose standards\\", since it has accepted papers of dubious academic merit. Organizers stress inter-disciplinary communication, describing the conference as both wide in scope as a general international scientific meeting, and specifically focused in the manner of a subject-area conference. History WMSCI is organized by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics: IIIS (www.iiis.org). Its General Chair has usually been retired Professor Nagib Callaos. The conference is often held in Orlando, Florida.A Short CV of Professor Nagib Callaos The annual WMSCI Conference started in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1995 as ISAS (Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis). About 50 papers were presented. In 1997, after earning the non-financial sponsorship of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC), the conference name was changed to World Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics: SCI. In 2005 the acronym was changed to WMSCI because SCI coincided with the acronym of the Scientific Citation Index, and colocated conferences had been added since then. The multi-conference has grown to have about 900 registered participants, as of 2004; the majority of attendees present papers. Since its inception in 1995, more than 10,000 papers have been presented in WMSCI and its collocated conferences. Until 2005, WMSCI allowed about 15% of non-reviewed submissions, based on the importance of the topic or the potential presenter's curriculum vitae. In a workshop founded by the National Science Foundation, the general chair of the conference explained that they accepted non-reviewed papers because the conference is multi- disciplinary and scholarly associations of several conferences accept almost all submissions on a non-reviewed basis. The most prestigious and largest conferences of OR/MS (IFORS and INFORMS), for example, explicitly state on their web sites that \\"Contributed abstracts are not reviewed and virtually all abstracts are accepted.\\" Consequently, WMSCI 2005 general chair, Dr. Nagib Callaos, stated that since the conference is multi-disciplinary, he saw no problem with accepting for presentation (not necessarily publication) 15% of non-reviewed submissions, in order to follow the standards of other disciplines like those represented by the International Federation of Operations Research Societies (IFORS), Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS, the International Federation of Operations Research Societies (IFORS), the American Mathematical Society, etc.See for example http://meetings2.informs.org/sanfrancisco2014/abstract_contributed_i.html in which it is clearly stated that \\"Contributed abstracts are not reviewed and virtually all abstracts are accepted.\\" An article related to what has been presented at the mentioned workshop founded by the National Science Foundation can be found at http://www.iiis.org/contents/A_Case_Triggered_by_the_Acceptance_of_a_Bogus_Paper.pdf Since 2006 just-reviewed papers are accepted, authors of accepted papers have access to the reviews of the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their paper, and the reviewing process is based on double-blind and non-blind reviewing.WMSCI 2013WMSCI 2014The IIIS/SCI Conferences on Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics critical review by Justin Zobel when non-reviewed papers were accepted Mission WMSCI is a multi-disciplinary conference where participants focusing on one discipline may attend conferences from related areas. According to the organizers, \\"this systemic approach stimulates cross-fertilization among different disciplines, inspiring scholars, originating new hypothesis, supporting production of innovations and generating analogies, which is ... a fundamental aim in cybernetics\\".WMSCI 2009 Foreword Objectives of the conference include identification of synergetic relationships among Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, and establishing communication channels among academic, professional, and business worlds. Their mission statement is as \\"a forum for focusing into specific disciplinary research, as well as for multi, inter and trans-disciplinary studies and projects\\". Some say that its mission is rather opaque. This opaqueness might be perceived from a strictly disciplinary, or sub- disciplinary perspective. WMSCI is intended to be a forum for both inter- disciplinary scholars, researchers, and professionals, as well as disciplinary researchers who are interested in presenting their disciplinary research and share information and knowledge with researchers from other disciplinary researchers aiming for potential cross-fertilization and analogical thinking, which provide input to logical thinking and empirical hypothesis formulation. SCIgen paper acceptance and exposure of citing non-refereed papers In 2005, Jeremy Stribling, Daniel Aguayo, and Maxwell Krohn, three computer- science graduate students at MIT, submitted to WMSCI the paper Rooter: A Methodology for the Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy, generated by SCIgen, software they had developed to create nonsense papers in Computer Science. Stribling stated that the paper was submitted to WMSCI because of its repeated e-mails. In his words: \\"You see lists of speakers, and there's no one you've ever heard of... They spam us.\\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4449651.stm Papers generated by this software were submitted to other similar conferences. The promotional policy of WMSCI followed strictly the USA Congress CAN-SPAM Act of 2003-2008.Details for WMSCI promotional policy can be found at http://www.iiis2014.org/wmsci/Website/PromotionalPolicy.asp?vc=1. Following criticism of the per-conference-participant fees and their acceptance of talks without any reviewOn having a huge sadneess April 25, 2005 the organization responded as follows: Since 2006, the organization abandoned the policy of accepting for presentation (not necessarily publication) 15% of non-refereed papers. Papers of non-refereed presentations were eligible for publication in the post-conference edition of the proceedings if they are selected as the best paper by the respective session audience. Motivating their previous acceptance policy, based on 15% of non-refereed presentation which respective papers might be published if they are selected as the best of the respective sessions, the organization says: =Post-2005 changes of refereeing policies= The average acceptance rate in 2009 at WMSCI and related conferences was 32.12%, with the average of 4.93 reviewers per paper/abstract. A combination of double blind peer reviews and non-anonymous peer reviews was used, with a total of 11902 reviews for the 2413 submissions. The organizers claim that for the refereed papers, the acceptance policy of WMSCI is the majority rule in both kind of reviewing, i.e. A majority of double blind reviewers and a majority of non-anonymous reviewers should recommend the acceptance of a submissions in order to be accepted for presentation and publication in the respective proceedings. More details regarding this two- tier reviewing methodology can be found at http://www.iiis.org/peer- reviewing.asp. when there is a tie between any kind of reviewers (double blind or non-anonymous)the tendency is to accept the respective submission. When there are a double tie among both kind of reviewers the tendency is to not accept the respective submission. Acceptance Policy for Papers to be Presented at conferences Organized by IIIS This policy is (according to some people who contributed to this article) more liberal than that of other conferences using the alternative strategy, where papers are accepted when there is the positive agreement of the reviewers (This affirmation need to be referenced) According to the organizers, WMSCI's policy would probably increase the chances of accepting poor papers, but certainly decreases the chances of rejecting good papers. Motivating their acceptance policy, the organizers cite Ernst et al. who showed that the same paper was rated from \\"unacceptable\\" to \\"excellent\\" according to 6 out of 9 measures by 45 field experts. According to the organizers, their acceptance policy may be better suited for the purpose of bringing together multi-disciplinary engineering communities, and may reduce possibilities of plagiarism and fraud generated by the reviewing process (see also peer review, peer review failure).

Dry plate photograph of Jews gathering at Absalom's Tomb in the Kidron Valley, early 20th century. View towards the south-west from the Jewish cemetery, with the south-eastern corner of Temple Mount in the upper background. The upper Kidron Valley holds Jerusalem's most important cemetery from the First Temple period, the Silwan necropolis, assumed to have been used by the highest-ranking officials residing in the city, with rock-cut tombs dating between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 33, No. 2 (May, 1970), pp. 33-46 The upper Kidron Valley segment north of the Old City was one of the main burial grounds of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period, where hundreds of tombs have survived until today, while the segment east of, and opposite the Temple Mount, boasts several excellently preserved monumental tombs from the same period.Hachlili, Rachel. Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period. Boston: Brill, Leiden, 2005. Pages 2, 30-36, 237-242. Several of the Second Temple period tombs were also used later in time, either as burial or as shelters for hermits and monks of the large monastic communities which inhabited the Kidron Valley during the Byzantine Empire period (4th-7th century).Goodman, Martin. Jews in a Graeco-Roman World. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998. The ancient tombs in this area attracted the attention of ancient travelers, most notably Benjamin of Tudela.Adler, Marcus Nathan. The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela. London: Oxford University Press, 1907. A source of confusion is the fact that the modern name \\"Kidron Valley\\" (Nahal Kidron in Hebrew) applies to the entire length of a long wadi, which starts north of the Old City of Jerusalem and ends at the Dead Sea, while the biblical names Nahal Kidron, Emek Yehoshafat, King‚Äôs Valley etc. might refer to certain parts of this valley located in the immediate vicinity of ancient Jerusalem, but not to the entire wadi, and certainly not to the long segment crossing the Judean desert. Similarly, in Arabic every more substantial wadi has many names, each applied to a certain distinct segment of its course. Etymology The Hebrew name Qidron is derived from the root qadar, \\"to be dark\\", and may be meant in this context as \\"dusky\\". In Christian tradition the similarity between the Greek word for cedar, Œ∫Œ≠Œ¥œÅŒøœÇ (kedros), and the Greek name of the valley as used in the Septuagint, Kedron, has led to the Qidron Valley being wrongly called \\"Valley of the Cedars\\". Identification with biblical locations =Valley of Jehoshaphat= The Hebrew Bible talks of the \\"Valley of Jehoshaphat - Emek Yehoshafat\\" (), meaning \\"The valley where Yahweh shall judge.\\" Not all scholars agree with the traditional view that the Kidron Valley, as the valley situated between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives to the east, is the location of the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Kidron Valley was not associated with the Valley of Jehoshaphat until the 4th century AD, making this identification somewhat uncertain since no actual valley of this name is known to pre-Christian antiquity. Biblical commentator Adam Clarke claims that the Valley of Judgment is a symbolic place. =King's Garden and King's Valley= In the times of the Old Testament kings, the Kidron Valley was identified with, at least in part, the King's Garden; the kings owned land in the area. That the upper Kidron Valley was also known as the King's Valley, in which Absalom set up his monument or \\"pillar\\" (see ; no connection to the much later \\"Absalom's Pillar\\"), is problematic. The Bible does not make this identification explicit, and the association can only be inferred as associated with En-rogel, which is farther down the Kidron Valley towards the desert.Kloner, Amos, and Boaz Zissu. The Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period. Leuven: Peeters, 2007. The name 'King's Valley' may be derived from its location just east of the palace of David in the City of David on the western slopes of the Kidron Valley and south of where the platform was built.Asher, Adolf, trans. and ed. The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela. Vol. 1, Text, Bibliography, and Translation; vol 2, Note and Essays. New York: Hakesheth Publishing Co., 1840. Jan van Cootwijk, folio from the Itinerary of Jerusalem and Syria: Kidron Valley with Jesus' footprints near the bridge, Absalom's pillar (right), and the Tomb of the Virgin in the background. Antwerp, 1619. Monumental tombs Benei Hazir Tomb (left) and Tomb of Zechariah (right) The so-called \\"Tomb of Absalom\\" or the pillar of Absalom in Kidron Valley The three monumental tombs on the eastern side of the Kidron Valley are among the most well-known landmarks of ancient Jerusalem. These are, from north to south, the so-called \\"Tomb of Absalom\\" (Hebrew: Yad Avshalom), which rises in front of the so-called \\"Cave\\" or \\"Tomb of Jehoshaphat\\", the (correctly named) Tomb of Benei Hezir (Benei Hezir is the Hebrew for \\"sons of Hezir\\", meaning the Hezir priestly family ), and the so- called \\"Tomb of Zechariah\\", which could quite likely be the nefesh of the Tomb of Benei Hezir. Absalom's Tomb consists of two parts. First, a lower cube hewn out of the bedrock, decorated with engaged Ionic columns bearing a Doric frieze and crowned by an Egyptian cornice. This part of the monument contains a small chamber with an entrance and two arcosolia (arched funeral niches) and constitutes the actual tomb. The second part, built of ashlars, is placed on top of the rock-hewn cube. It consists of a square pedestal carrying a round drum, itself topped by a conical roof. The cone is slightly concave and is crowned by an Egyptian-style lotus flower. The upper part has the general shape of a tholos and is interpreted as a nefesh or monument for the tomb below, and possibly also for the adjacent \\"Cave of Jehoshaphat\\". The \\"Pillar of Absalom\\" is dated to the 1st century CE. Literally, the word nefesh means 'soul', but in a funerary context it is the term applied to a form of funerary monument. In descriptions of the tombs of the Jewish nobility, the pyramid shape is also emphasized as the mark of a tomb. This would imply that nefesh and pyramid were synonymous. The Jewish tombs in the Kidron Valley are the best examples of this form of nefesh.Cohen, Shaye J. D. From the Maccabees to the Mishnah. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1987. They appear as a rectangular, pyramid-capped monument. Similar forms of the nefesh decorate ossuaries, with the addition of a dome-capped column. In Jerusalem the nefesh as a tomb monument stood either above or beside the tomb; set on steps or on a base.Finegan, J. The Archeology of the New Testament. Princeton, 1969. Scriptural significance =Hebrew Bible= It was in this valley where King Jehoshaphat is thought to have overthrown the enemies of Israel (). King David fled through the Kidron Valley during the rebellion of Absalom (). Chapters 29, 30 and 31 of 2 Chronicles () cover King Hezekiah's call for the sanctification of the ministers of the Lord, the purification of unclean things, an invitation to all Israel and Judah to celebrate Passover in Jerusalem, and liturgical reforms. During the reforms of King Hezekiah around 700 BCE, as part of the ritual cleaning of the Temple, the priests removed the unclean items from the inner part of the Temple to the courts, and the Levites carried the unclean items to Wadi Kidron (). Kidron Valley in Jewish eschatology The Book of Joel mentions that God will assemble all nations in the \\"Valley of Jehoshaphat\\" (, ). =Gospels= According to the New Testament, Jesus crossed the valley many times travelling between Jerusalem and Bethany. The valley contains the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed the night before he was executed. The name Kidron was mentioned in John 18:1. Archaeological excavations =Upper course= The Akeldama Tombs The Akeldma Tombs were discovered in 1989 at theconfluence of the Kidron and Hinnom Valleys, south of Jerusalem's Old City, and were excavated and published by archaeologists Gideon Avni and Zvi Greenhut.Gideon Avni and Zvi Greenhut, The Akeldama Tombs: Three Burial Caves in the Kidron Valley, Jerusalem. Israel Antiquities Authority, 1996, In 1989, the Jerusalem Municipality conducted routine development work in the area. Upon widening a narrow street near one of the approaches to the Silwan village, bulldozers uncovered a number of square openings hewn into rock. The Israel Antiquities Authority immediately stopped the road construction. After uncovering the underground spaces, archaeologists found themselves standing inside large burial complexes which appeared intact. Moving carefully from one chamber to another, flashlights revealed an abundance of artifacts scattered on the floors, pottery and glass vessels, oil lamps and many ornamental ossuaries. The three large caves proved to be part of an extensive Jewish burial ground in use at the end of the Second Temple period, which terminated in the year 70 AD, when Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed by the Roman legions.Hirschfeld, Yizhar.

Little Sitkin Nautical Chart. Little Sitkin Island (; ) is a volcanic island in the Rat Islands archipelago of the Western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, about east of Davidof Island. Great Sitkin Island (which is essentially the same size as Little Sitkin) lies further east in the Andreanof Islands. Little Sitkin is roughly circular and about in diameter. The interior is extremely rugged and mountainous; only the lower slopes are grass covered. There are two prominent peaks, one high in the northeast part of the island and the other high in the southern part. Numerous streams are on the island but no lakes or ponds. The coast is generally bold, rocky, and precipitous, with a fringe of kelp wide. Small steam jets and hot springs are in the valley at the head of William Cove on the northwest of the island. Volcano Little Sitkin is a stratovolcano that erupted circa 1776, 1828 and 1900.Alaska Volcano Observatory ‚Äì Little Sitkin The 1776 eruption shows signs of being explosive. The volcano has had three cone building episodes separated by the formation of two calderas. A summit crater caps the youngest cone, about in diameter at the base. The active stratovolcano on Little Sitkin Island occurs within the eroded remnants of a nested double caldera of probable late Pleistocene age. The older caldera (Caldera One) is about in diameter and is centered slightly northeast of the island's midpoint. The caldera formed at the site of a large stratovolcano, the remnants of which are the oldest rocks exposed on the island. A second stratovolcano was constructed almost entirely of lava flows within Caldera One and attained a height of about . A cataclysmic eruption, possibly in early post-glacial time, resulted in the formation of a second, smaller caldera (Caldera Two) that partially destroyed this cone. Caldera Two is elliptical in outline and measures ; the inferred eastern and southern margins are coincident with those of Caldera One. Field relations suggest that the northern boundary of Caldera Two is a hinge along which a large block, comprising most of the Caldera One stratovolcano, was tilted southward during the caldera eruption. The highest peak on the island is on the post-caldera remnant of the second cone. A deposit of partly welded tuff up to thick extends from the remnant cone northwest across the Caldera Two boundary fault, to slightly beyond the inferred location of the Caldera One boundary fault. The deposit is thought to have been emplaced by one or more pyroclastic flows, possibly associated with formation of Caldera Two. Post-Caldera Two deposits are mainly lava flows. Two relatively recent aa flows have well developed levees; one originated from the breached central crater of Little Sitkin volcano, and the other from a fissure along the western trace of the Caldera One boundary fault.http://www.avo.alaska.edu/pdfs/cavwaleu_west.pdf Catalog of the Historically Active Volcanoes of Alaska, USGS, T.P.

Hawadax Island (; ) is an island in the Rat Islands archipelago of the western Aleutian Islands in the U.S. state of Alaska. The island was formerly known as Rat Island until May 2012 when it was renamed Hawadax Island, which is an Aleut name meaning \\"entry\\" and \\"welcome\\". The island has a land area of 10.3126 sq mi (26.7095 km¬≤) and no permanent population. It is within the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. It is in length and in width. The former name is the English translation of the name given to the islands by Captain Fyodor Petrovich Litke in 1827 when he visited the Aleutian Islands on a voyage around the world. The Rat Islands are very earthquake-prone as they are on the boundary of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. In 1965, there was a major earthquake with the magnitude 8.7 in the Rat Islands. Conservation and Restoration Hawadax Island The island was heavily infested with brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are considered a nuisance invasive species due to their negative impact on the population of ground-nesting wild birds.Rats wipe out seabirds on Alaska island The rats arrived on the island before 1780 due to a Japanese shipwreck. Since then, the rats had a devastating effect on local seabirds that have no natural defenses against the rats. Invasive rats are also present on 16 other islands in the Aleutian chain. In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which manages the refuge, was formulating plans to eradicate the rats. The eradication plan is modelled on a successful one to eliminate the Arctic fox from various Aleutian islands, where they were deliberately introduced for breeding. In September 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), in partnership with Island Conservation and The Nature Conservancy eradicated Norway rats with the first aerial application of bait in the State of Alaska. Some nontarget mortality was expected, but the actual quantity exceeded what was predicted. The Ornithological Council reported that more than 420 birds were killed as a result of the rat eradication program. Forty-six bald eagles died (exceeding the known population of 22 bald eagles on the island); toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of brodifacoum in 12 of the 16 carcasses tested. Of the 320 glaucous-winged gull carcasses collected, toxicology tests implicated brodifacoum in 24 of the 34 tested. Fifty-four carcasses of another 25 bird species were found.Steve Ebbert and Kathy Burek- Huntington. 2010.

Final report issued December 2010 With the exception of bald eagles, most bird populations surveyed increased in abundance so the impacts on non-target species are likely to be temporary. In June 2009, the island was declared rat-free for the first time in 229 years,Alaska's Rat Island rat-free after 229 years although the site was continually monitored for another two years for confirmation. The report found that the lead contractor which the FWS used, Island Conservation, had dropped more poisonous bait than they had proposed, including bait which was intended to be saved as a backup. The FWS asked the Ornithological Council to determine if Island Conservation had exceeded the limit of their poison quantities, but the council decided not to resolve any \\"legal questions\\". , the State of Alaska issued a Notice of Violation and FWS law enforcement is still investigating. Steve Delehanty, the manager of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (which includes the island) said that, \\"It was a learning experience, and we made mistakes together.\\" However, he also stated, \\"...if you do the math this was a rip-roaring conservation success.\\" Post eradication monitoring results have shown a strong positive response in terms of bird populations.

The species is named after John George Children. It is a nocturnal species occurring in the northern half of Australia and generally found on the ground, although it often climbs trees. Usually growing to about in length, it is typically a reddish-brown colour, darker on the upper surface, and with many darker blotches, especially on younger specimens. It feeds mostly on small mammals and birds, and as with other pythons, it constricts its prey before swallowing it whole. It is a popular pet among reptile enthusiasts. Taxonomy and naming Antaresia childreni is one of four species in the genus Antaresia, a genus in the family Pythonidae. The genus is named after the star Antares. John Edward Gray published the original description of the species in 1842, naming it Liasis childreni. Both the common name and the specific epithet, childreni, which is conserved in the current scientific name, are in honour of Gray's mentor, John George Children, a curator of the zoological collection at the British Museum around that time.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Antaresia childreni, p. 53). No subspecies are currently recognized. Some species of the genus Antaresia were formerly assigned to the genus Morelia.McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Tour√© TA (1999). Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 1. Washington, District of Columbia: Herpetologists' League. 511 pp. (series). (volume). Description Adults of A. childreni grow to a total length (including tail) around . The scales on the top of the head are enlarged, while those on the upper surface of the body are small and smooth, with a rainbow sheen that can be seen when exposed to direct sunlight. The upper surface of the snake is brown with darker spots in five or six longitudinal series. A dark streak on each side of the head passes across the eye. The lips are yellowish, spotted with brown. The lower surface of the snake is uniformly yellowish. The head of the snake is distinct from the neck. The nostril is superolateral, pierced in a large semidivided nasal scale. The eye is moderate in size, with a vertical pupil. The body is slightly laterally compressed. The tail is short. About 41 to 45 rows of dorsal scales cross the snake's back, and 257 to 287 ventral scales are seen along the lower surface. A single undivided anal scale is found immediately in front of the anus, and 38 to 53 subcaudal scales are on the lower surface between the anus and the tip of the tail, all or mostly in two rows. The rostral is broader than high, barely visible from above. The internasals are slightly longer than broad and are shorter than the anterior prefrontals. The second pair of prefrontals is in contact at the midline, or is separated by a small shield. These posterior prefrontals are sometimes broken into several shields. The frontal is one and a half times as long as broad, slightly shorter than its distance from the end of the snout, longer than the small parietals. Three to 10 small loreal shields are present, some almost granular, with 11 to 13 upper labials. Three or four of the posterior lower labials have deep pits. The anterior maxillary teeth and anterior mandibular teeth are very long, gradually decreasing in size posteriorly. The premaxillary bone also has teeth.Mehrtens JM (1987). Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . A. childreni: rainbow sheen A. childreni, young male Geographic range Antaresia childreni is found in Australia in the extreme north of Western Australia, the northern third of the Northern Territory, and northeastern Queensland, and also on the islands of the Torres Strait. The type locality is given by Gray (1842) as \\"‚Äî?\\", is listed as \\"N.W. Australia\\" by Boulenger (1893) in his Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History). Volume I., and is listed as \\"unknown\\" in Stimson (1969). Antaresia childreni occurs specifically in the region spanning the coast between the Kimberleys in Western Australia to Mount Isa in northwestern Queensland. Habitat Children's python is found in a variety of natural habitats, including forest, savanna, shrubland, grassland, and freshwater wetlands. Diet Feeding on a rodent The diet of Children's python consists of reptiles, birds, and small mammals, particularly microbats, which it catches by dangling from stalactites in caves, which they commonly inhabit, and snatching them out of the air as they fly past. Reproduction Antaresia childreni is oviparous, with up to 25 eggs per clutch. Females brood their eggs through a seven-week incubation period by coiling around them and occasionally shivering to keep them warm, which also affords the eggs some protection from predators. Juveniles are heavily blotched, but gradually become reddish-brown or brown as they mature. Captivity Children's python is often kept as a pet due to its good nature and less demanding requirements. The lifespan of captive specimens has been known to exceed 30 years. Juveniles are fed baby, hairless mice, while larger individuals can be fed on adult mice or small rats. Feeding should occur roughly once a fortnight. 256px References Further reading *Cogger HG (2014). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, Seventh Edition.

It is also used for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. It is used by mouth or injection into a vein. Side effects are very common. They can include low blood cell counts, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hair loss, and fever. Other severe side effects include allergic reactions and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the baby. Etoposide is in the topoisomerase inhibitor family of medication. It is believed to work by damaging DNA. Etoposide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Etoposide is used as a form of chemotherapy for cancers such as Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lung cancer, testicular cancer, lymphoma, nonlymphocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma multiforme. It is often given in combination with other drugs (such as bleomycin in treating testicular cancer). It is also sometimes used in a conditioning regimen prior to a bone marrow or blood stem cell transplant. =Administration= It is given intravenously (IV) or orally in capsule or tablet form. If the drug is given IV, it must be done slowly over a 30- to 60-minute period because it can lower blood pressure as it is being administered. Blood pressure is checked often during infusing, with the speed of administration adjusted accordingly. Side effects Common are: * infusion site reactions * low blood pressure * hair loss * pain and or burning at the IV site * constipation or diarrhea * metallic food taste * bone marrow suppression, leading to: ** decreased white blood cell counts (leading to increased susceptibility to infections) ** low red blood cell counts (anemia) ** low platelet counts (leading to easy bruising and bleeding) Less common are: * nausea and vomiting * allergic-type reactions * rash * fever, often occurring shortly after IV administration and not due to infection * mouth sores * acute myeloid leukemia (which can be treated with etoposide itself) When given with warfarin, it may cause bleeding. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Etoposide forms a ternary complex with DNA and the topoisomerase II enzyme (which aids in relaxing negative or positive supercoils in DNA), prevents re-ligation of the DNA strands, and by doing so causes DNA strands to break. Cancer cells rely on this enzyme more than healthy cells, since they divide more rapidly. Therefore, this causes errors in DNA synthesis and promotes apoptosis of the cancer cell. Chemistry An illustration of the wild mandrake, showing part of the rhizome (at bottom) Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin from the rhizome of the wild mandrake (Podophyllum peltatum). More specifically, it is a glycoside of podophyllotoxin with a D-glucose derivative. It is chemically similar to the anti-cancer drug teniposide, being distinguished only by a methyl group where teniposide has a thienyl. Both these compounds have been developed with the aim of creating less toxic derivatives of podophyllotoxin. The substance is a white to yellow-brown, crystalline powder. It is soluble in organic solvents. It is used in form of its salt etoposide phosphate. History Etoposide was first synthesized in 1966 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was granted in 1983. The nickname VP-16 likely comes from a compounding of the last name of one of the chemists who performed early work on the drug (von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin. Another scientist who was integral in the development of podophyllotoxin-based chemotherapeutics was the medical pharmacologist Hartmann F. St√§helin.

Name Known as \\"the City of the Five Names\\", it was eventually named in honor of Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of the United States. Weather The city temperature in summer reaches and drops to in the winter. The average temperature is . Geography Villa Hayes is situated on the north bank of the Paraguay River, north of Asunci√≥n City. Demography At the time of the 2002 census, Villa Hayes had a population of 19,001, (10,071 men and 9,930 women). Of these 2,049 lived in the city and 16,592 in the rural area. There is a number of different ethnicities among the city's inhabitants: Native American, European, menonita and Paraguayan. The Native Americans living in the city include members of the Nivacl√©, Angaite√ß√©, Chan√©, Mak√°, Chamacoco, and Toba Qom tribes. Economy ACEPAR (Aceros del Paraguay), Paraguay's principal steel manufacturer, is based in Villa Hayes, however most of the city's inhabitants work in the cattle trade, and to a lesser extent in agriculture. Tourism Villa Hayes has a museum where uniforms, weapons, photographs, and other artifacts from the Chaco War are displayed. There is also a display of antique coins as well as animals of the region. During the Chaco War, the Hospital de Sangre (Field hospital) stood in what is now the city's Main Square. The city's church and historic buildings are important tourist attractions. The Festival del Acero (Steel Festival) is celebrated annually and features many artistic and cultural presentations. There is a monument honoring American President Rutherford Hayes and another one for Benjam√≠n Aceval on the bank of the Paraguay River. These men played prominent roles in resolving Paraguay's borders after the War of the Triple Alliance. The Home Office and the Economics Faculty of the National University are located on one of the main streets of the city. In the nearby countryside are the hills Galv√°n and Confuso, as well as Pati√±o and the Natural Reserve Trinfunqu√© Park, which shelters many of the plants and animals typical of this region of Paraguay. The Melodia Cultural Centre is based in a house built around 1870 for General Bartolom√© Mitre. It is considered historically significant and is frequently visited by architecture students from all over the country. The Center includes a library, holds information classes and is an important promoter of local culture and education. History In its earliest origins, the town was known as Amancio Cu√©. In 1786 the city became the site of a Jesuit Mission founded by Father Juan Francisco Amancio Gonz√°lez y Escobar with the name Reducci√≥n Melod√≠a (Melody Mission) in honor of the Governor Pedro Melo. The town was re-established during the 1841-1862 government of Carlos Antonio L√≥pez and renamed Nueva Burdeos (New Bordeaux) by a colony of 120 French families. However, it did not prosper and was founded again the next year as Villa Occidental (Western Town). In the late 1860s, when Argentine soldiers occupied the city during the Paraguayan War, they called it Villa Argentina. Finally, the city was named Villa Hayes, in accordance with the decree signed by President C√°ndido Bareiro, on May 13, 1879. This name was chosen to honor of the United States President, Rutherford Hayes, who on November 13, 1878, had been asked to arbitrate between Paraguay and Argentina after the Paraguayan War. His award of the disputed Gran Chaco region to Paraguay made him a national hero. On 11/12/2018 Villa Hayes and Fremont Ohio USA (home and burial site of President Hayes) became sister cities. Transportation The main access to the city is via the Road IX Carlos Antonio L√≥pez or Transchaco Road. The principal public transport is by bus routes 46 and 5. Nicol√°s B√≥ Aerodrome (Sargento De Aviacion Nicolo Bo, ICAO:SGNB) is located near Villa Hayes, although it is used for training flights and does not have a paved runway or regular passenger service. Passenger airlines operate from Silvio Pettirossi International Airport, approximately 22 km southwest of Villa Hayes. Gallery File:Gobernaci√≥n de Pdte.

It is the largest state civil rights agency in the United States. It also provides representation to the victims of hate crimes. Originally a division within the Department of Industrial Relations, DFEH became a separate department in 1980. DFEH has a director who is appointed by the governor of California and maintains a total of five offices and five educational clinics throughout the state. Today, it is considered part of the California Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency. Kevin Kish, a noted civil rights attorney, was appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. on December 29, 2014 to be director of California‚Äôs Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), the largest state civil rights agency in the nation. The position of Director for the DFEH was made vacant following the abrupt resignation of the former director Phyllis W. Cheng. Mission The mission of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH or Department) is to protect Californians from employment, housing and public accommodation discrimination, and hate violence. The Department enforces California state laws that prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation employment, housing, and public accommodations and that provide for pregnancy leave and family and medical leave. The DFEH also accepts, investigates, mediates and prosecutes complaints alleging hate violence or threats of hate violence. Statutes Enforced The DFEH enforces the following California civil rights law: * Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12900 et seq.). * Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51 et seq.). * Ralph Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51.7). * Disabled Persons Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 54 et seq.). The FEHA (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12900 et seq.) is one of the leading state civil rights law in the nation. In employment, the FEHA prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of age (40 and over), ancestry, color, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), denial of family and medical leave, disability (mental and physical) including HIV and AIDS, gender, gender expression, gender identity, genetic information, marital status, medical condition (cancer and genetic characteristics), national origin, race, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding) and sexual orientation. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12926, 12940, 12945, 12945.2.) In addition to the prohibition against pregnancy discrimination afforded under Government Code section 12940, the FEHA also requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation, transfer, or leave for up to four months to employees disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945.2, subd. (a).) In housing, the Act provides protection from harassment and discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, source of income, disability, or genetic information. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12955.) The FEHA also bars retaliation against any person who has filed a complaint with the Department, participated in a Department investigation or opposed any activity prohibited by the Act. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12940, subd. (h).) Under the FEHA, the Department‚Äôs jurisdiction extends to individuals, private or public entities, housing providers, and business establishments within the State of California. The FEHA‚Äôs prohibitions against employment discrimination apply to employers with five or more employees. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12926, subd. (d).) The prohibition against workplace harassment applies to employers with one or more employees. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945, subd. (j) (4) (A).) Within the FEHA, the California Family Rights Acts (CFRA) allows an employee who has worked for at least 12 months, accrued a minimum of 1,250 hours during the preceding 12 months, and is employed at a worksite with 50 or more employees within 75 miles to take up to 12 work-weeks of protected leave. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945.2, . (a) & (b).) An eligible employee may take CFRA leave for his or her own serious health condition; to care for a parent, dependent child, or spouse with a serious health condition; or for care and bonding in connection with the birth, adoption, or placement of a child for foster care. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945.2, subd. (c).) An employer is required under the CFRA to reinstate the employee to the same or a comparable position upon the termination of the CFRA leave. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945.2, subd. (a).) Additionally, the CFRA expressly prohibits an employer from refusing to hire, discharging, suspending, or discriminating in any manner against an employee because the employee has requested CFRA leave, or has given information or testimony about his or her own or another employee‚Äôs CFRA leave. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12945.2, subd. (l).) Government Code section 12948 incorporates into the FEHA the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51), the Ralph Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51.7), and the Disabled Persons Act (Civ. Code, ¬ß 54 et seq.). The Unruh Civil Rights Act provides that: All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever. (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51.) The Ralph Civil Rights Act prohibits violence or threats of violence because of an individual‚Äôs actual or perceived of violence sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation or position in a labor dispute. (Civ. Code, ¬ß 51.7.) California‚Äôs Disabled Persons Act entitles all individuals with disabilities full and equal access to all places of public accommodation, amusement, or resort; medical facilities; common carriers, airplanes, motor vehicles, railroad trains, motorbuses, streetcars, boats, or any other public conveyances; private schools, hotels, lodging places, and other places to which the general public is invited. (Civ. Code, ¬ß 54.1.) FEHA History and Development On April 16, 1959, Governor Edmund G. ‚ÄúPat‚Äù Brown, Sr., signed the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), which took effect on September 18, 1959. The FEPA prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, and ancestry. The Act‚Äôs jurisdiction covered employers of 5 or more persons, labor organizations, employment agencies, and any person aiding or abetting the forbidden actions. In 1963 the Legislature passed the Rumford Fair Housing Act, prohibiting housing discrimination in all rental properties of four or more units on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and ancestry. In 1980, Governor Edmund G. \\"Jerry\\" Brown, Jr., and the Legislature reorganized civil rights enforcement. The FEPA and the Rumford Fair Housing Act were combined and renamed the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), to protect Californians from both employment and housing discrimination. The FEHA predates and provides broader protections than its federal counterparts, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Over the years, the FEHA has redressed civil rights violations faced by hundreds of thousands of Californians. Numerous decisions from the trial courts to the United States Supreme Court have affirmed the broad reach of the FEHA. Because of the Act, a vast number of employers and housing providers have changed their business practices to create a more level playing field for all Californians where they live and work. Under the FEHA, the DFEH receives, investigates, mediates, conciliates, and prosecutes discrimination complaints on behalf of individuals and groups or classes of aggrieved persons. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12930, subd. (f)(1).) The Department adopts, promulgates, amends, and rescinds procedural rules and regulations to carry out its investigation, prosecution, and dispute resolution functions and duties. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12930, subd. (e).) Additionally, the Department investigates, approves, certifies, decertifies, monitors, and enforces state contractors‚Äô compliance with California‚Äôs nondiscrimination laws. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12930, subd. (j).) Until December 31, 2012, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission adjudicated FEHA claims and promulgated regulations interpreting substantive rights under the FEHA. The Fair Employment and Housing Council, which replaces the separate Commission, exists within the Department, and promulgates regulations interpreting substantive rights under the FEHA. Senate Bill 1038 Governor Edmund G. \\"Jerry\\" Brown, Jr., signed into law Senate Bill 1038 (Committee on Budget & Fiscal Review) (Stats. 2012, ch. 46, ¬ß¬ß 18, 27-66, 68, 70, 101 &115) on June 27, 2012. SB 1038 transformed the role of the DFEH and the enforcement of the FEHA.Cheng, Phyllis W. (2 August 2012). \\"Transformative year for civil rights in CA\\". Daily Journal. http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/Publications/Articles/Transformative%20year%20for%20civil%20rights%20in%20CA%20PCheng%20DJ%208-2-12.pdf Effective January 1, 2013, among other changes, the bill amends the FEHA to: (1) eliminate the Fair Employment and Housing Commission and replace it with a Fair Employment and Housing Council within the Department; (2) transfer the Commission's regulatory function to the Department's Council; and (3) end administrative adjudication of FEHA claims. SB 1038 specifically authorizes the DFEH to: * File cases directly in state or federal court. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12930, subd. (h); 12965, subd. (a); 12981, subd. (a).) * Collect attorney fees and costs when the DFEH is the prevailing party in FEHA litigation. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 112965, subd. (b); 12989.2.) * Prior to filing a civil action, require all parties to participate in mandatory dispute resolution in the DFEH‚Äôs internal Dispute Resolution Division, free of charge to the parties. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12965, subd. (a); 12981, subd. (a).) Authority The DFEH is the State agency responsible for enforcing California‚Äôs civil rights laws and is the largest state civil rights agency in the nation. DFEH has five offices located in Elk Grove, Fremont, Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles. The Elk Grove office is designated as ‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù and is where the DFEH executive team works.DFEH Organization Chart http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/About/org%20chart%20%20new%201-1-13.pdf Divisions: * Enforcement * Dispute Resolution * Legal * Administrative The DFEH also maintains a Special Investigations Unit, Office of Contract Compliance Programs, a Legislative and Regulatory Unit, a Media and Public Affairs Unit and a Public Records Act Request Response Unit. DFEH Clinical Programs: * DFEH-UC Irvine School of Law Civil Rights Clinic. * DFEH-UCD Davis School of Law Employment Discrimination Program. * DFEH-CSU Bakersfield Graduate School Civil Rights Clinic. * DFEH-College of the Canyons Civil Rights Clinic. * DFEH-Rio Hondo College Housing Rights Clinic. * DFEH Civil Rights Graduate Fellowships (Graduate Legal Assistant Program). DFEH Procedural Regulations: * Effective October 7, 2011. * Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, ¬ß¬ß 10000-10066. Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful employment, public accommodation, or housing practice may file a verified complaint for investigation with the DFEH. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12960, 12963, 12980.) Filing an administrative complaint with the DFEH within one year of an alleged unlawful practice (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12960, subd. (d)), and receipt of a right-to-sue (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12965, subd. (b)), are prerequisites to filing a private action for employment discrimination under the FEHA. An aggrieved party may forgo having his or her employment discrimination complaint investigated by the DFEH and instead request an immediate right-to-sue from the Department. An immediate right-to-sue may be obtained from the DFEH online at www.dfeh.ca.gov. Only complainants represented by counsel are encouraged to obtain a right-to-sue online. The DFEH has unilateral discovery rights during the investigative process, which permit the DFEH to issue subpoenas (Gov. Code, ¬ß 129603.1), serve written interrogatories and requests for production of documents (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12963.2, 12963.4) and depose witnesses (Gov. Code, ¬ß 129603.3). If an individual or organization fails to comply with a subpoena, interrogatory, request for production, or examination under oath by refusing to respond fully or providing only objections, the DFEH may file a petition with a superior court for an order compelling compliance with the discovery, naming the individual or organization that failed to comply as the respondent. (Gov. Code, ¬ß 12963.5.) The period of time within which the Department may bring a civil action to prosecute a violator is extended by the length of time between the filing of the petition and the filing by the DFEH of a certified statement indicating the respondent's compliance with the court‚Äôs order compelling a response. (Gov. Code, ¬ß12963.5, subd. (f).) In the case of failure to eliminate an unlawful practice through conference, conciliation, mediation, or persuasion, the DFEH may bring a civil action in the name of the Department on behalf of the person claiming to be aggrieved. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12965, subd. (a); 12981, subd. (a).) Prior to filing a civil action, the Department must require all parties to participate in mandatory dispute resolution in the DFEH‚Äôs internal Dispute Resolution Division, free of charge to the parties, in an effort to resolve the dispute without litigation. (Id.) Dispute resolution is mandatory for all cause cases for which the DFEH will file a civil action. Mandatory dispute resolution is conducted behind a firewall by the DFEH‚Äôs attorney mediators. In civil actions alleging employment or housing discrimination, the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party, including the DFEH, reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees and costs, including expert witness fees. (Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 12965, subd. (b); 12989.2.)  Notable Cases  = Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Law School Admission Council, Inc. = In this case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) filed suit to halt ongoing harm to individuals with disabilities who sought to enter the legal profession. DFEH alleged that the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) which administers the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) subjected test takers who seek accommodations to onerous documentation requirements, denied requests for reasonable accommodations, and provided different and less desirable score reports to test takers who received the accommodation of additional test time. The complaint arose from a two-year government investigation by DFEH which began in January 2010. Early in the investigation, Phyllis W. Cheng, DFEH Director, personally issued a Director‚Äôs complaint alleging that LSAC denied reasonable accommodations to prospective test takers with disabilities. After the Director's complaint, the DFEH filed suit and then litigated the case in federal court in San Francisco. The United States Department of Justice intervened in the suit which expanded the scope of the case and allowed for nationwide recovery. The largest and only national DFEH case to date, the case was resolved by a settlement agreement (Consent Decree) which included an $8.73 million payment, of which $6.73 million were equally distributed to individuals nationwide who applied for testing accommodations on the LSAT from January 1, 2009 through May 20, 2014. The settlement was the product of a successful collaboration between state and federal agencies and the private bar and was submitted to the court for approval on May 20, 2014. On May 29, 2014, United States District Court Judge Edward M. Chen entered a Permanent Injunction forever banning LSAC from annotating or \\"flagging\\" the LSAT scores of test takers who took the examination with the accommodation of additional test time. In the past, LSAC had reported the scores of those test takers and identified that the test taker was an individual with a disability, that the test had been taken under non standard conditions and that the test scores had to be viewed with great sensitivity. In addition the Judge today gave court approval to the 61-page Consent Decree with extensive provisions and revisions to LSAC's practices regarding testing accommodations and which provides for $8.73 million in monetary relief. = Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Verizon Services Corp. = On January 19, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Mohr approved a $6,011,190 settlement in Dept. Fair Empl. & Hous. v. Verizon (Seales) (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2010, No. BC444066) for more than 1,000 current and former California employees to settle a class action lawsuit the DFEH filed challenging the company's family medical leave practices. The settlement covers Verizon's voice, data and video operations in California, which employ more than 7,000 people. The class action lawsuit was precipitated by a more than two-year-long investigation into Verizon's practices under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), which was conducted by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing's (DFEH) Special Investigations Unit (SIU). The lawsuit alleges that from 2007 to 2010, Verizon denied or failed to timely approve class members' requests for leave for their own serious health condition, to care for a family member with a serious health condition, or to bond with a new child. Settlement of the lawsuit was the second largest in DFEH history. Verizon also agreed to review and revise its leave policies and procedures, continue an existing internal review process that employees can invoke to appeal denials, train all California officers, managers, supervisors and human resources personnel on the procedures and submit regular updates to the DFEH regarding the company's compliance. In settling the matter, Verizon did not admit to liability. In addition to the CFRA class action, the Department also settled two companion group actions with Verizon: 1) a $444,960 Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) pregnancy discrimination group settlement for 42 employees denied time off for pregnancy-related medical reasons; and 2) a $467,466 FEHA disability discrimination group settlement for eight employees denied reasonable accommodation. Together, the DFEH achieved a total of $6,923,616 plus affirmative relief in the three Verizon settlements. = Farmworkers Sexual Discrimination Case = The Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) on Wednesday settled a sex discrimination and retaliation complaint filed by eight farm workers against a Napa Valley vineyard owner, a vineyard management company with a policy of not hiring women, and a Fresno-based farm labor contractor who refused to provide separate toilet facilities for men and women. The complaint, filed by two female laborers and their male co-workers who supported them, settled for $65,000 and significant changes in the companies‚Äô future business practices related to hiring of women, training and providing adequate toilet facilities. The workers allege that they were fired from their work on a 38-acre vineyard owned by Alsace Co. LP in June, 2013 after repeatedly requesting a second bathroom as required by law for their crew, which included both men and women. ‚ÄùWhen farmworkers in California‚Äôs multibillion dollar agricultural industry labor in unlawful conditions, it is of extreme concern to the Department, which is charged with protecting the people of California from employment, housing and public accommodations discrimination,‚Äù said Kevin Kish, DFEH Director. ‚ÄúMany farmworkers who lack formal education and English-language skills are unaware of their rights under the law and are reluctant to demand better working conditions, fearing that their demands will lead to their firing,‚Äù said Kish. ‚ÄúThis is what happened in this case. We are gratified that this group of farmworkers came forward and we were able to negotiate a just resolution.‚Äù According to the workers, there was only one portable toilet at the workplace for two work crews, which included men and women. California law requires at least two separate toilet facilities when both men and women are working together in agricultural operations. Alsace vineyard manager, Jeff Roberts of Farm West LLC, acknowledged that he was unhappy when women showed up in the crew, as he had a policy to hire only men in the vineyards he manages. Workers stated that their foreman told them that Roberts demanded that either the men or the women leave. When the women refused to leave and again complained about the restrooms, they were fired. The farm labor contractor, DJRAS Corp., doing business as Prime Harvest Contracting, admitted that the workers‚Äô supervisor received no training in anti-discrimination and retaliation laws. Even more important than the monetary settlement in this case is the ‚Äúaffirmative relief‚Äù which calls for significant changes in business practices, Kish said. As part of the settlement, Farm West, LLC, the vineyard management company, has agreed to change its policy to allow the hiring of women, will regularly report to DFEH on all company hires during the next three (3) years, and will receive training on anti-discrimination laws. Prime Harvest Contracting has agreed to train its staff and ensure that its crews have adequate restroom facilities at all work locations. The vineyard owner, Alsace Co. LP, has agreed to ensure that women are not discriminated against in hiring and employment in its vineyards, and that adequate toilet facilities are provided. The parties settled the farmworkers‚Äô claims at a mediation conducted by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, after the agency determined that laws it enforces were violated. = DFEH v. The Irvine Company, LLC, and Irvine Apartment Communities, L.P. = On December 17, 2015, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) announced it had reached a $175,000 settlement with the Irvine Company, LLC and Irvine Apartment Communities, LP, in two lawsuits filed by the Department over the companies‚Äô alleged discrimination against people with mental health disabilities. The settlement also includes four additional administrative complaints filed with DFEH. The lawsuits filed in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of two residents, and the administrative complaints filed on behalf of six additional residents, alleged the companies failed to accommodate tenants with mental health disabilities by taking steps to discourage tenants from keeping emotional support animals as a reasonable accommodation for their disabilities. The companies charged pet deposits and pet rent, imposed breed and size restrictions for legitimate support animals, and failed to engage in an interactive process to verify that tenants had genuine disabilities. The firms also lacked a uniform reasonable accommodation policy and failed to train their leasing professionals at their apartment communities about fair housing responsibilities toward people with disabilities. As a result, some tenants were evicted from their apartments or had their lease offers revoked. Others were forced to pay additional rent. In addition to paying compensation to plaintiffs and reimbursing DFEH for attorneys‚Äô fees, the companies have also agreed to adopt a comprehensive reasonable accommodation policy, provide training to employees, and hire a Compliance Manager to review requests for reasonable accommodation. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that The Irvine Co. cooperated with us to achieve this settlement, which compensates the plaintiffs and complainants for the harm they suffered and contains equitable relief designed to ensure that all tenants and applicants with disabilities will receive equal housing opportunities, including reasonable accommodations, as required by law,‚Äù said Kevin Kish, Director of DFEH. The Settlement Agreement also clarifies the right of the companies to request reliable third-party verification to show the need for a service animal. It also clarifies that ID cards, certificates for a ‚Äúregistered service animal‚Äù or online services providing ‚ÄúESA prescription‚Äù letters for sale are not sufficient verification. = DFEH v. Sandhu Brothers Poultry and Farming et al. = On January 25, 2016, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) announced it had obtained a $75,000 settlement in a sexual harassment case filed on behalf of a female farmworker who worked for Sandhu Brothers, a sweet potato farming operation in Stanislaus County. The case stemmed from a complaint by a female farmworker that she was harassed by a supervisor while working for Sandhu Brothers. The complaint alleged that the supervisor exposed his genitals to members of the crew, masturbated in front of the workers while driving a tractor, and made unwanted sexual advances to several female crew members. The complainant also alleged that she was groped by the supervisor and was fired after complaining to the company. A separate sexual harassment complaint by another worker involving the same company and the same supervisor was filed and resolved with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2013. After the allegations were investigated and substantiated by the DFEH, a complaint was filed in Stanislaus Superior Court in Modesto, California. The case was settled January 19, 2016. It would have gone to trial on February 2, 2016. As part of the settlement, the company has agreed to undergo sexual harassment training and implement sexual harassment prevention policies. ‚ÄúSexual harassment is a serious problem, especially in agriculture where many workers are often afraid to speak out and are unaware of their rights,‚Äù said DFEH Director Kevin Kish. ‚ÄúWe hope that this settlement will send a message to victims that the law will not tolerate this kind of behavior in the workplace and encourage employers to adopt effective training and prevention programs.‚Äù The lawsuit was filed against defendants Sandhu Brothers Growers dba Yam Gro, Gurinder Sandhu, and Bhupinder Sandhu. The case is titled DFEH v. Sandhu Brothers Poultry and Farming et al, Stanislaus County Superior Court Case Number 2006626.

As the leader of IHOPKC, Bickle oversees several ministries and a Bible school. Bickle has written a number of books and served as the pastor of multiple churches. Ministry Mike Bickle became an evangelical Christian at fifteen when his football coach paid his way to a Fellowship of Christian Athletes student conference in Estes Park, Colorado. After listening to Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach speak of his \\"personal relationship with Jesus,\\" Bickle committed himself to become an evangelical Christian. After serving as a pastor in several evangelical churches in St. Louis, Bickle moved to Kansas City to start the Kansas City Fellowship (now known as Metro Christian Fellowship) in November 1982. Eventually, Kansas City Fellowship joined the Association of Vineyard Churches led by John Wimber in 1990, and was renamed Metro Vineyard Christian Fellowship. It remained a part of that association of churches until 1996. During his tenure as the pastor of Metro Christian Fellowship, Bickle pastored a group known to both detractors and supporters as the Kansas City Prophets that, by some accounts, included Bob Jones, Paul Cain, John Paul Jackson, and others. Bickle asserted no formal group known as the Kansas City Prophets ever existed, but that the term \\"clustered a whole bunch of personalities into one group and one stereotype.\\" During his ministry, Bickle claims to have had several encounters with God, including hearing the audible voice of God and being taken to heaven twice. In 1999, Bickle stopped working for the church that he was pastoring, Metro Christian Fellowship, then a megachurch of over three thousand members. He then started the International House of Prayer (also known by its acronym IHOPKC). IHOPKC is most well known for its daily prayer meetings based on its \\"harp and bowl\\" worship model that are held 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year since September 19, 1999. IHOPKC also established a Bible college, known as the International House of Prayer University and several internships for young adults. In addition to these training programs, IHOPKC also organizes various evangelism and charitable programs locally and internationally. The ministry currently consists of approximately 2,500 full- time staff members, students, and interns. IHOPKC organizes the annual Onething conference at the Kansas City Convention Center. In 2010, the event saw over 25,000 young adults attend. The conference focuses on worship music and sermons on prayer, evangelism, and Christian eschatology. Bickle is known for dressing casually while preaching and for his avoidance of \\"charismatic self-referentiality\\". Bickle endorsed Ted Cruz for president in 2016. Theology Bickle's teachings have primarily focused on prayer, worship, fasting, the Great Commandment, with his own Trinitarian interpretation, the Great Commission, spiritual gifts, and the Bible with a particular focus on passion for Jesus, the first commandment, and Prophecy, preparing people spiritually by understanding what Jesus said about the end times. In 1988 Bickle began studying the Song of Songs, a book that he had dismissed in the past as being only for women. He interprets the Song of Songs as an allegory of the relationship between the body of believers (= the church) and God. After studying this book for several years, he began to focus his ministry primarily on the Great Commandment. Bickle teaches extensively on prayer. Bickle began teaching on the Tabernacle of David in 1983 after an experience in which he claims to have heard the audible voice of God. \\"In the May 1983 Solemn Assembly (corporate 21 days of fasting), the Lord spoke audibly commissioning us, saying: 'I will release 24-hour prayer in the spirit of the Tabernacle of David'.‚Äù He encourages churches and Christian ministries to develop a \\"culture of prayer\\" by developing continuous worship and prayer. Bickle has focused some of his teaching on God's spiritual purposes for Israel. He believes that it is important for Christians to pray for the spiritual salvation of the Jews. Reception There has been criticism of aspects of Bickle's theology and ministry practices. Aspects of his ministry which have been particularly controversial include his view of the prophetic ministry today. \\"Several cult-watching groups have expressed apprehension, and a few, condemnation. Even some Vineyard churches have expressed grave concerns about the direction the prophets are taking them.\\" Most of the criticism involving Bickle's ministry, however, focuses on the sexual activities of some of the ministers that were closely connected with his ministry in the 80s and 90s, including Bob Jones Background info on Bob Jones \\"Vineyard leaders took strong steps recently to discipline well-known \\"prophet\\" Bob Jones after Jones admitted to \\"Sexual misconduct (not adultery)\\" with two women.\\" \\"Vineyard leadership also is supporting the Joneses through regular counseling, visits by the Kansas City Metro Vineyard leadership, and monetary contributions.\\" and Paul Cain though neither has been involved with Bickle's ministry for several years as a result. However, as of 2017 Mike Bickle continued to praise Bob Jones and would credit him with the start of the International House of Prayer with no mention of the sexual abuse that had taken place because of the process of restoration he underwent.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rExwuePliDY In 1990 Kansas City pastor Ernie Gruen published a report entitled \\"Documentation of the Aberrant Practices and Teaching of the Kansas City Fellowship (Grace Ministries)\\". After the publication of this document, Bickle announced that he was submitting to John Wimber's oversight and joined the Association of Vineyard Churches in part to address the issues raised by his critics. Gibson notes \\"To Bickle, apparently, the Trinity is one of those \\"lesser doctrines\\" around which a true prophet may be misinformed.\\" \\"Gruen says he first became troubled about some of KCF's doctrines after a disagreement with Bickle during a pastor's retreat in 1984.\\" and \\"In a surprise announcement, he [Wimber] said that Bickle and his associates had agreed to submit themselves to his oversight and become part of Wimber's Vineyard Ministries. The KCF network of fellowships would become Vineyard churches.\\" \\"Despite the accusations of 'false prophecy and misconduct' directed at Bickle, Wimber stood by the Kansas City prophets and encouraged Bickle to bring his church into the AVC.\\" Bickle later noted that \\"We were tempted to say that the attacks were all of the devil. In retrospect, we see that God‚Äôs hand in all of this - even using the things that came from Satan‚Äôs hand as well. Some of the criticisms were valid (especially concerning our pride); others were not.\\" \\"To cap it all off, Mike Bickle received public correction (from Wimber) for exaggerating some prophecies, for allowing too much latitude with some prophetic ministers, and for unnecessarily provoking other Kansas City churches for making unwise statements about the role of KCF.\\" Bickle's ministry has since been endorsed by several American charismatic leaders, including Dr. Jack W. Hayford, Bill Bright, Loren Cunningham, and C. Peter Wagner. Bickle came under fire from the Anti-Defamation League for controversial statements deemed antisemitic and intolerant of Jews.

Mortality is correlated with both income and inequality. Population health has been defined as \\"the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group\\". According to Akarowhe (2018), the working definition of population health is expressed thus; population health is an art, process, science and a product of enhancing the health condition of a specific number of people within a given geographical area - population health as an art, simply means that it is geared towards equal health care delivery to an anticipated group of people in a particular geographical location; as a science, it implies that it adopt scientific approach of preventive, therapeutic, and diagnostic service in proffering medical treatment to the health problem of people; as a product, it means that population health is directed toward overall health performance of people through health satisfaction within the said geographical area; and as a process it entails effective and efficient running of a health management/population health management system to cater for the health needs of the people. It is an approach to health that aims to improve the health of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are \\"health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions\\". A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the social determinants of health, SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.Social Determinants of Health overview tab. The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream medicine. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of public health agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008. In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.. See also National Academies Press free publication: The Future of Public Health in the 21st Century. From a population health perspective, health has been defined not simply as a state free from disease but as \\"the capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes\\".Frankish, CJ et al. \\"Health Impact Assessment as a Tool for Population Health Promotion and Public Policy\\" . Vancouver: Institute of Health Promotion Research, University of British Columbia, 1996. Retrieved 12 October 2008. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in 1946 as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\"World Health Organization. WHO definition of Health, Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19‚Äì22 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.

Healthy People 2020 Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services, representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered social determinants of health and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.Health People 2020 Economic inequality Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from epidemiologists on the subject of economic inequality and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between socioeconomic status and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy, heart disease, ulcers, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, certain types of cancer, and premature aging. Despite the reality of the SES Gradient, there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest‚Äîsee also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to social status differences. Other researchers such as Richard G. Wilkinson, J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the Whitehall studies‚Äîa series of studies conducted on civil servants in London. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health- affecting habits such as exercise, smoking and drinking. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis‚Äîyet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from Luxembourg to Slovakia) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health‚Äîsuggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do. The concept of psychosocial stress attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as status and social stratification can lead to the many diseases associated with the SES gradient. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations‚Äîleading to greater levels of stress and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health. Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by Robert Sapolsky of Stanford University provides similar findings. Research There is well- documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization & costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.). There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes. Subfields =Family planning= Family planning programs (including contraceptives, sexuality education, and promotion of safe sex) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine. Family planning saves lives and money by reducing unintended pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. For example, the United States Agency for International Development lists as benefits of its international family planning program:USAID. Family planning .

Health care system interventions are mediated by the health care system and hospital leaders. Examples of these interventions include enhancing the efficacy of clinical mental health services, providing consultations and training for community partners, and sharing aggregate health data to inform policy, practice, and planning for public mental health. Public health practice interventions are mediated by public health department officials. These interventions include advocating for policy changes, initiating public service announcements to reduce the stigma of mental illness, and conducting outreach to increase the accessibility of community mental health resources. Elected officials and administrative policy makers implement social, economic, and environmental policy interventions. These can include reducing financial and housing insecurity, changing the built environment to increase urban green space and decrease nighttime noise pollution, and reducing structural stigma directed at those with mental illness. Population health management (PHM) One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as \\"the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the morbidity patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations\\".Hillman, Michael. Testimony before the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Ways and Means, hearing on promoting disease management in Medicare . 16 April 2002. Retrieved 12 October 2008. PHM is distinguished from disease management by including more chronic conditions and diseases, by use of \\"a single point of contact and coordination\\", and by \\"predictive modeling across multiple clinical conditions\\".Howe, Rufus, and Christopher Spence. Population health management: Healthways' PopWorks . HCT Project 2004-07-17, volume 2, chapter 5, pages 291-297. Retrieved 12 October 2008. PHM is considered broader than disease management in that it also includes \\"intensive care management for individuals at the highest level of risk\\" and \\"personal health management... for those at lower levels of predicted health risk\\".

Prior to the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through fee-for-service models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around pay for performance, a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable. In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim). As participation in value-based reimbursement models such as accountable care organizations (ACOs) increases, these initiatives will help drive population health. Within the ACO model, hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks, focus on prevention, and carefully manage patients with chronic diseases. Providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital. Studies have shown that inpatient admission rates have dropped over the past ten years in communities that were early adopters of the ACO model and implemented population health measures to treat \\"less sick\\" patients in the outpatient setting.Kutscher B. Outpatient care takes the inside track. Modern Healthcare. 2012. Retrieved 31 October 2015. A study conducted in the Chicago area showed a decline in inpatient utilization rates across all age groups, which was an average of a 5% overall drop in inpatient admissions. Hospitals are finding it financially advantageous to focus on population health management and keeping people in the community well. The goal of population health management is to improve patient outcomes and increase health capital. Other goals include preventing disease, closing care gaps, and cost savings for providers. In the last few years, more effort has been directed towards developing telehealth services, community-based clinics in areas with high proportion of residents using the emergency department as primary care, and patient care coordinator roles to coordinate healthcare services across the care continuum. Health can be considered a capital good; health capital is part of human capital as defined by the Grossman model. Health can be considered both an investment good and consumption good.Folland S, Goodman A, Stano M. The economics of health and health care (Vol. 6): Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education; 2007. Factors such as obesity and smoking have negative effects on health capital, while education, wage rate, and age may also impact health capital. When people are healthier through preventative care, they have the potential to live a longer and healthier life, work more and participate in the economy, and produce more based on the work done. These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of \\"reserves\\". The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the ‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

It is situated five miles west of Coleraine, and is part of Causeway Coast and Glens district. It is very popular with summer tourists, having numerous apartment blocks and two caravan sites. Castlerock Golf Club has both 9-hole and 18-hole links courses bounded by the beach, the River Bann and the Belfast to Derry railway line. The village had a recorded population of 1,287 people in the 2011 census, and has a local football team called Villagers FC.  History  The Earl-Bishop Local historical interest is concentrated on the 18th century Bishop of Derry's ruined palace, the Mussenden Temple on the clifftop, and the Black Glen set within the Downhill Estate, which is now owned by the National Trust. The palace and estate were created by Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol who was the Bishop of Derry in the 1780s. The Mussenden Temple, with its precarious perch on the basalt cliff edge is one of the most photographed scenes in Ireland. The 17th century Hezlett House is a thatched cottage with a cruck structure and is situated at the crossroads near the village. Built around 1691, it was originally a rectory or farmhouse. Also at the adjacent crossroads is an ancient tree. The bodies of the two victims of infamous dentist Colin Howell were found in Castlerock on May 19, 1991. Castlerock was relatively untouched by the Troubles, with only one fatal incident occurring in or near the village as part of the conflict. The \\"Castlerock killings\\" took place in March 1993, when four men were shot dead by a group calling itself \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\", a covername used by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). One of the men convicted for the murders was Coleraine loyalist Torrens Knight. Demography = 2001 Census = Castlerock is classified as a village by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with population between 1,000 and 2,250 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 1,326 people living in Castlerock. Of these: * 22.2% were aged under 16 and 22.3% were aged 60 and over * 46.6% of the population were male and 53.4% were female * 14.5% were from a Catholic background and 82.3% were from a Protestant background * 3.4% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were unemployed. For more details see: NI Neighbourhood Information Service =2011 Census= On Census day in 2011, 16.5% were from a Catholic background and 77.8% were from a Protestant background. Transport Castlerock railway station opened on 18 July 1853. Northern Ireland Railways currently run a mostly hourly service in both directions (west to Londonderry Waterside or east to Coleraine and onward to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Great Victoria Street) daily, and only five trains each way on Sunday. Ulsterbus services tend to coincide roughly with the times of the railway service and proceed either west towards Limavady or east to Coleraine. Facilities Castlerock is home to Guysmere Summer Camp, which is owned and run by the Presbyterian Church. Education *Hezlett Primary School *Ballyhacket Primary School  People  The actor James Nesbitt lived in Castlerock as a teenager. The village was a holiday destination for the famous author C. S. Lewis. Born in Belfast, he holidayed in Castlerock as a child and took inspiration from Downhill House for some of his books including The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Castlerock‚Äôs other famous (now)residents include one Stephen Ness. A well known local Ford salesman who became much more famous as a blogger of his exploits as a poker player, something he took up as an amateur in his past time but progressed to semi professional when head hunted by a sponsor who were reading his blogs. From here Stephen went on to play in many round the world poker tournaments winning on multiple occasions but culminating in a magnificent performance in the World Series of poker where he faced over 4,500 entrants to eventually finish in a superb 41st position unfortunately losing out to a ‚Äúbad beat‚Äù with the best hand when the ‚Äúchips‚Äù were in. He has also written a book called ‚ÄúThe Condom Kings‚Äù about Scottish brother who started an empire installing condom machines in pubs and clubs which is still for sale on various platforms and a well worthy read although the book didn‚Äôt have a massive success yet Stephen remains confident that writing the book was one of the best achievements he has undertaken and completed. Stephen has also tried his hand at acting but did not make the cut so often, he passed it off as a bad job then turned his hand to another passion in fishing which he is currently in the process of completing a second book called ‚ÄúThe Art of Passionate Fishing in Northern Ireland‚Äù which he expects to finish and publish early in 2022.

The band debuted at the Night Owl club in Toronto's Yorkville Village from August 5‚Äì10 and the following month recorded demos which later became the basis of a bootleg album, McKenna Mendelson Blues. Gerrard left the band in early October (immediately after a show at Massey Hall supporting The Fugs) because of artistic differences and was replaced by Mike Harrison (born November 1, 1948 in Brampton, Ontario), bassist from popular Canadian R&B; band Grant Smith & The Power. In November 1968, MMM opened for The Jeff Beck Group at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, United States, and garnered several standing ovations. =Early success in the UK= In December 1968, MMM reversed the trend of English bands coming to North America, and proceeded to England to gig and hopefully to pursue a major record deal. The band hit the stage almost immediately, their first show being at the Utrecht Pop Festival on December 27/28, 1968, filling a prime timeslot just vacated by Jimi Hendrix and his duo (Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell). MMM started soon thereafter gigging on an English club circuit which included such notables as The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Family, The Keef Hartley Band, Gun, and the newly formed Led Zeppelin. After several false starts, they signed with Liberty/United Artists in the spring of 1969, and in April 1969 recorded a best-selling album, Stink. It was subsequently reissued on CD. =Back to Canada= Homesickness, dissension in the ranks, and the vagaries of youth facilitated a return to Canada in June 1969. Shortly after the July 1969 release of Stink, Allied Records released the demos recorded in September 1968 as McKenna Mendelson Blues. MMM thus became Canada's first \\"major label\\" act to be the victim of a bootlegged album. However, while in Europe and England selections from the Stink album appeared on various blues samplers and compilations, notably Liberty's Gutbucket (1969), subtitled 'An Underworld Eruption', and Son of Gutbucket (1969). =GRT Signing and 1971 Album= Following \\"Stink\\", and a brief hiatus resulting from the internal dissension, the band reformed with Zeke Sheppard on bass and was signed in Canada by GRT Records. In 1971 Mainline recorded a second studio album, \\"Canada Our Home and Native Land\\" in San Francisco. The album featured horn arrangements on some tracks and was engineered by Fred Catero, who worked on many albums by top artists, including Bob Dylan, Al Kooper and Santana. The album had more of a production sheen than the \\"Stink\\" album, owing perhaps to the California influence and that of its producer Adam Mitchell, formerly of the Paupers. The subsequent supporting tour included dates in Australia. =The Mainline Bump n Grind Revue= In late 1971, Zeke Sheppard moved on to other things and the band, again by newspaper advertisement, hired Ted Purdy to take over the mantle of bass player for the otherwise intact band. In February 1972, the band recorded a live album featuring striptease artists at the run-down Victory Theatre, a vintage Toronto burlesque venue. The resulting album, \\"The Mainline Bump and Grind Review\\" was mixed at Moses Znaimer's Thunder Sound studios, long before Znaimer gained notoriety as the founder of CITY-TV. The album was recorded by Jay Messina and Jack Douglas on the Record Plant mobile studio out of New York City. Messina and Douglas later engineered the likes of John Lennon, Aerosmith and Lou Reed. The Record Plant mobile encountered difficulties crossing the border due to customs officers' unfamiliarity with high-tech equipment of such nature being packed into a truck, with the result that there were only a couple of hours to do a complete sound check prior to the performance. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that the band was in an advanced state of inebriation from drugs and alcohol, and consequently played at much higher volume during the performance than they had during the sound check. As a result, most of the individual instrument and vocal tracks were too distorted to be useful, which left only the house stereo pair for mixing. The mixing sessions at Thunder Sound were therefore quite protracted, and studio back-up vocal and horn tracks were added to buttress the live tracks. Mick Jagger dropped in one afternoon and enjoyed a convivial visit with the band while listening to the tracks. Despite the technical shortcomings of the recording, the concert became the stuff of minor legend with its combination of hard- driving covers of blues classics and the estimable performances of talented striptease performers. The tribute to vaudevillian burlesque form was completed by the use of a comedian as opening act and MC and the formal dinner-jacketed, tuxedoed attire of the band members. The critical acclaim that the \\"Mainline Bump n' Grind Revue\\" garnered was unfortunately not followed by commercial success. The 1972 Bump n Grind Revue is sometimes confused with a later burlesque show that the band performed at the Victory Theatre on New Year's Eve, 1974. That concert was recorded on video by TV Ontario, a public broadcaster, but was not the subject of a major label album release. The other main distinguishing feature of that show was that band members appeared in drag. =Mendelson Exits= By June 1972 Mendelson's continuing differences with McKenna led to his departure from the band. Mendelson's place was taken by the up-and-coming talent of Rick James, who would go on to great fame with multiple platinum albums for Motown and singles such as \\"Superfreak\\". The funk/R&B; stage presence of James seemed a mismatch for the sittin' down heavy blues signature of the band, but the formula worked, with large receptive crowds in venues such as Carleton and Dalhousie Universities. Eventually, however, the reconstituted band fell apart when James left the band and Nolasco pursued a record deal for what he viewed as a super-talented performer in Rick James‚Äîa goal that Nolasco would ultimately achieve in 1978 with the release of James' debut album, \\"Come Get It!\\". =McKenna and Mendelson--The Last Hurrah= After Mendelson left the band he pursued a solo career. In 1975, Mendelson was signed by Taurus Records and reunited with producer Mitchell and bassist Purdy to record a studio album, \\"Sophisto\\". The album was not a commercial success, so the label instead pursued a project in which Mendelson would reunite with McKenna and record a Mainline reunion album. This led to the album \\"No Substitute\\" released the same year featuring Mendelson, McKenna, and Purdy and with Jorn Anderson (from the \\"Sophisto\\" album) on drums. The sessions were rancorous with Mendelson at his dictatorial best and the album was, unsurprisingly, a failure. This was to be the last recording featuring Mendelson and McKenna as bandmates. With the exception of \\"No Substitute\\", Mainline's albums today remain available on music streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify. =Mainline Today= The Mainline reunion of the late 1990s gave rise to their best known \\"recent\\" gig at Toronto's El Mocambo Tavern. A reformed Mainline, without Mendelson, but with Mike McKenna (guitar, slide guitar, vocals), Tony Nolasco (drums, lead vocals), Mike Harrison (bass, vocals), Ted Purdy (acoustic guitar, vocals), and Bob Adams (harmonica) played to a sold-out crowd at The Elmo. A CD, Last Show @ The Elmo, was subsequently released by Bullseye Records.

The BCFCO film ratings are also used by Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan by bilateral agreement.  Rating System  Since January 1, 1997, the BCFCO has used the following motion picture rating system, based on the Canadian Home Video Rating System, for theatrical releases: *General. Suitable for viewing by persons of all ages. Occasional violence, swearing and coarse language, and the most innocent of sexually suggestive scenes and nudity, are permitted in this category. According to the Manitoba Film Classification Board (which now uses the same ratings as British Columbia), this rating is similar to the MPAA G rating used in the United States. *Parental Guidance. Parental guidance advised. Theme or content may not be suitable for all children although there is no age restriction. Motion pictures in this category may contain less subtle sexually suggestive scenes and nudity and a more realistic portrayal of violence than in the General category; coarse language may occur more often than in the General category. This rating is also similar to the similarly- named MPAA rating. *14A. Suitable for persons 14 years of age or older. Persons under 14 years of age must view these motion pictures accompanied by an adult. Motion pictures in this category may contain violence, coarse language or sexually suggestive scenes, or any combination of them. Most films rated PG-13 by the MPAA, and some rated R (typically for language), will be rated in this category. *18A. Suitable for persons 18 years of age or older. Persons under 18 years of age must view these motion pictures accompanied by an adult. Motion pictures in this category will contain horror, explicit violence, frequent coarse language or scenes that are more sexually suggestive than in the 14A category, or any combination of them. This is generally equivalent to the MPAA's R rating, although commercial films rated NC-17 may also receive the 18A rating by the BCFCO. *Restricted. Restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. Persons under 18 years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances. These motion pictures are \\"adult motion pictures\\", as defined in the Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes, violence or scenes referred to in Section 5(3) of the Act, or any combination of them. The director will assign this classification to motion pictures if the director considers that the theme, subject matter or plot of the adult motion picture is artistic, historical, political, educational or scientific. This is generally similar to the MPAA's NC-17 rating, although most commercial films will be edited to receive an 18A rating instead, as many theatres will not exhibit a Restricted film (much as most films rated NC-17 by the MPAA are edited to receive an R rating instead for their theatrical release). *Adult - Restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. Persons under 18 years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances. These motion pictures are \\"adult motion pictures\\", as defined in the Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes or scenes of brutality or torture to persons or animals, or any combination of them, that are portrayed in a realistic and explicit manner; however, the scenes would, in the director's opinion, be tolerable to the community. These films would typically not submitted for a rating to the MPAA in the United States. Titles in the \\"Restricted\\" and \\"Adult\\" categories have labelling and/or display restrictions under the Motion Picture Act for home video retailing purposes, but not those rated 18A or below.  The \\"Restricted Cougar\\" Symbol  The B.C. Film Classification Office originated the restricted cougar symbol in the August 1960 as an icon that audiences could easily associate with the former \\"Restricted\\" category, which was much broader in application than today's category. The B.C. Film Classification Office chose the cougar not only for its dramatic presence but also its significance as the largest wild cat native to BC.BC Film Classification Office Cougar symbol Retrieved 24 March 2007 The symbol was trademarked in 1965 and soon became identified with the movie-going experience, as an animated \\"Restricted Cougar\\" trailer typically preceded any film bearing the Restricted rating; according to the BCFCO, \\"the trailers also added a new excitement to the movie-going experience: when the Cougar made its way to the screen, audiences knew they were only moments away from the highly anticipated feature presentation.\\" The use of the symbol was discontinued with the adoption of the 18A rating in 1997, although the symbol itself remains a provincial trademark. In 2011, Consumer Protection BC made digital versions of several of the trailers available for viewing on YouTube.

It describes its mission as \\"to teach and disseminate the ethical, legal, and overall economic principles of a society of free and responsible persons.\\" According to Milton Friedman, it is \\"one of the leading universities in Latin America.\\" History It was founded in 1971 by Manuel F. Ayau, known as Muso. Its namesake is Francisco Marroqu√≠n, an early bishop of Guatemala and translator of Central American languages, but the university does not follow any of his teachings or philosophies. Started by members of Center for Economic and Social Studies with $40,000 and 125 students, UFM counts 2700 undergraduate students and 1500 graduate students as of 2009. The philosophy statement says that \\"universities need to place themselves beyond the conflicts of their time so that science and academic freedom ‚Äì which humankind will need at all times ‚Äì may be preserved.\\" Degrees In Guatemala, as in most of the rest of Latin America, the educational system concentrates students in their academic or professional discipline from the time of admission. Following secondary school, students are admitted to a particular school or department and, beginning the first year, they follow a prescribed program leading to a degree. =Undergraduate= Licenciatura degree (Licentiate): in most of Latin America, the degree most commonly awarded to undergraduate students is the licenciatura. Traditionally, it includes several more academic credits than does a B.A. or a B.S. * Disciplines: architecture, business administration, clinical nutrition, economics, education, international relations, law, political studies, public accounting and auditing, psychology (clinical and industrial). * M.D./D.D.S.: Students are admitted directly into medical and dental schools as high-school graduates. Then follows a three-year program of basic science studies after which students receive a B.S. degree. It is followed by four years of medical or three of dental studies and one year of internship for medical students. The, graduates receive an M.D.(doctor of medicine) or D.D.S. (doctor of dental surgery) degree. Dental graduates may pursue residency specialization into Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (four years), Peridodontics (2-3 years), Endodontics (2-3 years), Orthodontics (2-3 years), etc. * Associate degree: disciplines include art history and personnel administration. * Profesorado degree: the profesorado is a specialized degree for secondary school teachers. In many cases, it is required for employment: disciplines include art history, computer studies, social sciences and language. =Graduate= Master's degree disciplines: business administration (MBA); virtual business administration (online MBA); real estate project management (MAPI); entrepreneurial economics; international political economy; international relations, finance and taxation (MFIN); management of human resources; social sciences. Master's degree in the following medical specialties: internal medicine, ophthalmology, pediatrics, radiology. =Doctoral degree= Doctoral degree disciplines: economics, law, social sciences. Areas of instruction * Accounting * Architecture * Business administration * Clinical nutrition * Dentistry * Economics * Education * International relations * Journalism * Law * Medicine, including internal medicine; ophthalmology; pediatrics; and radiology * Political studies * Psychology * Social sciences Departments and projects The Ludwig von Mises Library has 100,000 visitors annually and is the most extensive collection of works on liberty in Latin America. There is a collection of the private libraries of prominent intellectuals and collectors: * Jos√© Cecilio del Valle, a founding father of Central American independence. * Carlos Elmenhorst, collector of Central American books and maps. * William Hutt, an English author and economist.Egger, John B. \\"William Harold Hutt (1899‚Äì1988): A Biographical Essay from an Austrian Perspective.\\" Mises.org. * Gordon Tullock, co-founder of the school of Public Choice * Sir Alan Walters, an economic advisor to Margaret Thatcher. At the beginning of the 2000s, the library started offering access to digital resources. It is subscribed to other services in this area including EBSCOHost databases, Oxford Scholarship Online, xRefer Plus and UpToDate, MDConsult and others. The library was chosen among all the libraries around the World within the 10 libraries to receive the Elsevier donation of 670 titles. The library site received the Arroba de Oro award in Guatemala for the best educational website. The Henry Hazlitt Center co-ordinates the courses of Economic Process (I, II and III) and Social Philosophy (Hayek and the Austrian School) that are offered to all undergraduate students in all schools. It also offers seminars and lectures for professors in order to improve their academic and pedagogic skills. The Center for the Study of Capitalism was founded in 2009 with the support of the university as a private, secular, coeducational, nonresidential, nonprofit center of study. It organizes socratic dialogue sessions with high school students and young entrepreneurs to study philosophical values as guides to excellence in thinking and action. Since its foundation, more than 1000 participants have joined philosophical discussions. The Arboretum awakens and cultivates the love for nature and conservation of plants and animals in the campus. The land of the university is a remnant of the Montano Forest of pine and Encino trees that used to cover Guatemala. The beautiful gardens have been carefully designed to integrate native and exotic species, which have been admired by students and visitors. Since the beginning, preservation of the forest was a priority, to the point that the library's architectural design of the buildings was done to keep the trees as intact as possible. New Media Department ‚Äì Creation, Implementation & Effective Management of Digital Resources ‚Äì The New Media Department specializes in streaming audio and video conferences in English and Spanish on topics related to classical liberal thought. Sampler: * Milton and Rose Friedman's Free to Choose series (in Spanish) * James Buchanan conference for the opening of Latin America's first Public Choice Center (2001) * Vernon L. Smith honorary doctorate ceremony (2004) * Interview of Milton and Rose Friedman for the 2002 Mont Pelerin Society General Meeting in London The New Media digital library includes 1,500 hours of digitized and indexed educational material, and receives over 1000 visitors daily from around the world. The Museo Popol Vuh Museum offers its visitors a unique journey through Guatemalan history, illustrated by one of the best collections of prehispanic and colonial art in the country. The museum is a scientific, private, nonprofit organization for the conservation, investigation and the popularization of Guatemala's cultural and archeological heritage. Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is a large Nahua painting on cotton cloth (lienzo) that belongs to the pre-Hispanic tradition of documenting stories of migrations and conquests within a geographic context. Considered the first map of Guatemala, it is one of the few sources from the 16th century that tell of the military campaigns of Jorge de Alvarado in 1527. A digitally-restored copy and an animated recreation of the story, exhibited at the campus, are based on the research done by Dutch archaeologist Florine Asselbergs. The ITA Scholarship Program (an acronym for Impulso al Talento Academico) stands for \\"promotion of academic talent.\\" The program grants scholarships for undergraduate degrees to the poorest, most highly qualified and most motivated students. The scholarship covers full tuition and fees, room and board, medical insurance, and a stipend for public transportation, books, and basic personal expenses. Traditions and landmarks Following Manuel Ayau, in 1972, the first class of students that entered to the university presented a pair of bronzed shoes to the founding rector, Ayau, as a joke. Since then the shoes are kept at the rector's office; as a way to remember to follow Ayau's steps and those of the founders of the university on the road to freedom. Honoring the champions of freedom, it has awarded honoris causa doctorates to scientists, intellectuals, businessmen, artists and others who have contributed to the sciences, the arts, the world of business and the cause of freedom. Four Nobel Prize winners have accepted an honorary degree awarded by the university: Friedrich Hayek; Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Vernon L. Smith.See the entire list, here (in Spanish). At the House of Freedom, the library is named after Ludwig von Mises; there are the Friedrich A. Hayek Auditorium and the Milton Friedman Auditorium. The department in charge of the courses of Social Philosophy and Economic Process is named after Henry Hazlitt. There is a Freedom Plaza and a terrace named after Rose Friedman. Mises's birthday, September 29, is celebrated by Professor Joseph Keckeissen's students with a Viennese party by the second semester of every year. It includes theatrical presentations, singing and dancing. Keckeissen attended Mises's Seminar in New York City and he began the theatrical tradition in the 1980s with the Guttenberg Society. Commencement ceremony ‚Äì On May and November, UFM celebrates commencement ceremonies. During these the graduating students receive their titles and diplomas. On that occasion the Board of Directors award the honoris causa doctorates. Honor graduates ceremony ‚Äì The night before the commencement ceremony, at UFM, they celebrate a ceremony and a cocktail party in praise of those students which graduate with honors, and to celebrate excellence (in Spanish). The honors awarded are cum laude, for those who obtained grades between 85 and 90: magna cum laude, for those who obtained grades between 91 and 94; and summa cum laude, for those who accumulated an average between 95 and 100. Inaugural Lesson ‚Äì The Inaugural Lesson enjoys a long academic tradition. At Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n it is a Commencement ceremony and an opportunity to get together the faculty and the students around the philosophy of freedom presented by a local or visiting professor. The first Inaugural Lesson, at UFM, was presented by vicerector emeritus Rigoberto Ju√°rez-Paz, and it was about Plato's Academy. =Landmarks on campus= Marroqu√≠n's bust, as the university is named after Bishop Marroqu√≠n, because he was the first prelate ordained in America in the colonial times. During his tenure as bishop, Marroqu√≠n took care of the rights of indigenous people and helped fund the first university in Central America. Marroqu√≠n's bust was donated to the university by Trustee F√©lix Montes in January 1975. The sculptor is Jos√© Nicol√°s. However, the university is nondenominational. Hayek's bust, as he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1974. He visited 1977, when he was awarded an honoris causa doctorate in social sciences. The House of Freedom, the auditorium of the Academic Building, is named for Hayek. His bust is located at the Ludwig von Mises Library and was donated by Walter S. Morris, of Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1991. Mises's bust, as he was a luminary of the Austrian School. He visited Guatemala when he was invited by the Centro de Estudios Econ√≥mico- Sociales and supported for the foundation of the university. His bust was donated by the class of 1975 by the School of Business. The Atlas Libertas is a bas relief placed on the main fa√ßade of the UFM Business School. A high- relief sculpture of a human figure supporting the universe seen from the back from head to hip. The universe is represented by a series of semicircles (abstract planets and gear mechanisms). The sculpture is made of brass plate with a cyan-colored finish, resembling oxidized copper. The Central Garden (renamed the Garden of Manuel Ayau) ismodeled after a Greek amphitheater and hosts the commencement ceremonies. The bust of Marroquin is the focus of the garden. In 2011, after the death of founder Ayau, it was renamed to honor him. The Academic Building's Garden is surrounded by classrooms and the administration offices, seven stories high. Nevertheless, with an air of a Japanese garden and pond, it is an oasis of tranquility, removed from the exuberance of the campus itself. There is a fountain at the Ludwig von Mises Library, near the Central Garden.

Created by David Michelinie, Bob Layton and John Byrne, Scott Lang first appeared in The Avengers #181 (March 1979) and in Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979) as the second superhero character to use the Ant-Man name in the Marvel Universe. He is a reformed thief and an electronics expert. He was a member of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy, the main character in the comic-book series FF and, in 2015, he became the title character in the series Ant-Man. Scott Lang is an ex-convict and electronics expert hired by Stark International, which enables him to steal the Ant-Man suit from Hank Pym, who had long since given up the name, to help his sick daughter. When Pym finds out, he gives the suit to Lang, allowing him to become the second Ant-Man. As Ant-Man, he serves as an Avenger for years, until he is killed during the Avengers Disassembled storyline. Years later, he is resurrected in the Avengers: The Children's Crusade mini- series. Following his resurrection, Lang heads the Future Foundation and founds his own company, the Ant-Man Security Solutions. Paul Rudd portrays Scott Lang in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Ant-Man (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Publication history Created by David Michelinie, Bob Layton and John Byrne, Scott Lang first appeared in The Avengers #181 (cover-dated March 1979) and as the second Ant-Man in Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979). Michelinie had long been an enthusiast of shrinking heroes, and saw Hank Pym's return to the Yellowjacket guise as an opportunity to take over the discarded Ant-Man identity. He explained how he came up with the character: Though Ant- Man's two-issue tryout in Marvel Premiere failed to garner the character his own series, the dynamic of a single father and reformed criminal in the superhero role struck a chord with readers and led to Ant-Man enjoying modest popularity and frequent appearances in Marvel Comics thereafter. Ant-Man appeared prominently in the 2012's FF series by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred. An ongoing series focusing on Lang, titled simply Ant-Man written by Nick Spencer and drawn by Ramon Rosanas, began in January 2015. After Marvel's Secret Wars event, the series continued with the title Astonishing Ant-Man. Fictional character biography =Early life= Scott Edward Harris Lang was born in Coral Gables, Florida.

In 2004, Zion & Lennox released their first studio album titled Motivando A La Yal under White Lion Records. After their first album , Zion & Lennox decided to start their own label, Baby Records Inc. The duo is made up of F√©lix Ortiz (Zion) and Gabriel Pizarro (Lennox).  Personal lives  F√©lix Ortiz Torres and Gabriel Pizarro were born in Carolina, Puerto Rico. They met in 1992, while living in the same neighborhood and having common interests in reggaeton. Their common taste for music quickly became a serious passion and a reason to work together and thoroughly in the reggaet√≥n genre, once Lennox's brother, whose nickname was Mackie, invited them to officially sing a theme in 2001, though they had already been a duo since 2000. While Zion & Lennox developed a deep interest in the new genre during that time, their focus was distinct from the most typical themes within the underground scene, in what they currently refer to as ¬´the commercial touch¬ª that reggaeton did not possess, that is, the kind of lyrics far from violence and sex. Since then they had been very popular within the underground scene, until they came to have their first great opportunity in the 2003 compilation album Desaf√≠o by the producers Luny Tunes together with Noriega. Both have relatives who are prominent singers in the reggaeton genre. Zion is the first cousin of chorus singer Jory Boy, who was part of the Nova & Jory duo, while Lennox is the brother of Luis Pizarro, better known as Mackie Ranks, of the former reggaeton duo Yaga y Mackie.  Career  They have been in the music business for a long time. They had minor hits such as \\"Baila Conmigo\\" for the 2003 compilation album \\"Desaf√≠o\\" and \\"Me Pones Tensi√≥n\\" for the album The Noise: La Biograf√≠a. These hits, along with others in the near future and increased radio play gave them more recognition. This gave them the chance to appear in major Reggaeton albums such as Luny Tunes' Mas Flow (2003) and Mas Flow 2 (2005), Blin Blin vol.1 (2003-4), Contra la Corriente (2004), and Cazadores, Primera B√∫squeda (2005). In May 2004, they released their first solo album, Motivando a la Yal. With the reggaeton genre becoming a worldwide phenomenon, Zion and Lennox's popularity increased. Motivando a la Yal: Special Edition was released a year later. The special edition had new songs along with remixed songs of the previous edition, such as \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Bachat√©alo\\", a remix to the song \\"Bandida\\", and a hip-hop remix of \\"Yo Voy\\" with Miri Ben- Ari, Fatman Scoop, and Pitbull entitled \\"Jump & Spread Out (DJ Precise and Cheeky Starr Version)\\". Both Zion and Lennox are very active with solo songs. Zion has been more notable with songs like \\"Yo Voy a Llegar\\" for Reggaeton producer DJ Nelson's compilation album Flow la Discoteka, \\"Al√≥cate\\" released on Luny Tunes's album Mas Flow 2.5, and \\"Con Ella Me Quedare\\" released in the fifth installment of the Alex Gargolas series, entitled Gargolas: The Next Generation. He also has turned up a new hit, \\"Que Pasara\\", for DJ Nelson's Flow la Discoteka 2. Zion has released a solo album entitled The Perfect Melody on June 5, 2007, with appearances by artists such as Akon and Play-n- Skillz. \\"The Way She Moves\\" is the lead single from the album and features Akon. Lennox has been working on songs on his own album, but has also been very active in bringing new artist to his label \\"Toma Enterprise\\". The label is set to release an album named Los Mero Meros. After three years of building their fan base and positive reputation with guest spots and compilation records, Zion & Lennox released their first full-length record, Motivando a la Yal. The record featured the work of renowned producers Luny Tunes, Noriega, Nely \\"El Arma Secreta\\", and Eliel, some of the most visible the style had to offer. Thanks to the record's success as it hit the charts with force, Zion & Lennox toured all over the Americas, performing before large and appreciative audiences. Soon industry demand and personal pressure caused Zion & Lennox to go in different directions. Boldly boasting to be one of the greatest singers ever to hail not only from Puerto Rico but all of Latin America, Ortiz started his own record label, Baby Records, for whom he is the flagship act and CEO. Lennox continues to make guest appearances and collaborate with important genre artists. Starting February 2008, Zion y Lennox engaged on a \\"reunited\\" tour promising a follow-up album In early 2010, they joined and signed a contract with Pina Records appearing on the compilation album Golpe De Estado (2010). In 2014, Zion and Lennox left Pina Records due to tensions financial allegations with Ralphy Pina. In 2016, they started working on their 4th album, Motivan2, under their new record label, Warner Music Latina, to which they signed an exclusive deal in December 2015. Their 4th album, Motivan2, was released in September 16 of 2016 which featured collaborations with Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Farruko, Daddy Yankee, Maluma & Don Omar. The music video for \\"Otra Vez\\", a song on that album featuring J Balvin, has received over 1.0 billion views on YouTube .

In the Civil War he enlisted in the 56th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and he served in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, during the Battle of Gettysburg and then in New York to quell \\"anti-Negro riots\\" there. Near the end of the war, he moved to California and became Hollister's accountant and secretary on the latter's San Justo Ranch surrounding the present city of Hollister. When that property was subdivided, the two bought the Cholame land. Jack married Hollister's daughter, Lucy Ellen (Nellie) in 1870 and became the largest wool grower in Central California, later switching to cattle and agriculture. Jack organized the County Bank of San Luis Obispo. The land was sold to the Hearst Corporation in 1966 and is still a working cattle ranch.David W.

James Dean On September 30, 1955, actor James Dean was killed in a traffic collision when college student Donald Turnupseed made a left turn without seeing Dean's Porsche 550 Spyder approaching at the junction of State Highways 41 and 46. On the same date in 2005, the State of California observed the 50th anniversary of Dean's death by naming the intersection as the James Dean Memorial Junction. A few hundred people, including state officials, a Dean family member, several Dean archivists and fans gathered at the junction and in Cholame to pay tribute to the actor. Near a local restaurant a memorial to Dean was erected in 1977 by a retired Japanese businessman from Kobe, Seita Ohnishi. The monument is made of stainless steel and surrounds a tree of heaven.

It is also the 42nd neighbourhood of the city. Construction of villas on the island started in the beginning of the 20th century, and a bridge from S√∂rn√§inen was opened in 1919. Kulosaari was an independent municipality since 1922 until 1946, when it was merged to Helsinki. Kulosaari from the air, looking westwards towards the centre of Helsinki. Kulosaari is home to 3,700 people (2003), and has a size of . The island is host to both Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking primary schools and the Kulosaari Secondary School (Kulosaaren Yhteiskoulu, or KSYK) international secondary school, as well as Br√§nd√∂ Gymnasium, a gymnasium for Swedish-speaking Finns. Trams served the island from 1910 to 1951 ‚Äì before the first bridge was completed, ferries were used to transport the trams. In 1982 Kulosaari got its own subway station, an original station of the Helsinki Metro. An important highway called It√§v√§yl√§, serving Helsinki's eastern suburbs, goes through the island, cutting it in two halves. Plan for the Br√§nd√∂ garden suburb, after Lars Sonck, c. 1909. Ribbinginhovi terraced housing, Armas Lindgren, 1920. History and Architecture The current Finnish name of district, Kulosaari, is relatively young; its Swedish spelling Br√§nd√∂ has been in use since 1808. As early as the 18th century, the island was called Stugu√∂ [lit: cottage island] or Stugulandet [lit: cottage land], based on a cottage owned by a fisherman. The island has long belonged to the lands of Kulosaari Manor, the manor house (designed by architect Carl Ludvig Engel, 1810) and grounds of which still exist, though it is situated on the adjacent island.N√§kym√§ Oy, Kulosaaren Kluvin puistoalueet - puistohistoriallinen selvitys, Helsingin kaupunki, 2010. So-called Br√§nd√∂ Villastad was founded in 1907 by a group of businessmen, architects and engineers outside the city of Helsinki, with the aim of forming on 250 acres of the barely inhabited island a town consisting of modern villas for middle-class families.Riitta Nikula, Architecture and Landscape: The Building of Finland, Otava, Helsinki, 1993. The architect Lars Sonck, who was a member of the company, drew up the town plan for the area in 1909, the town- planning principles of which were inspired by Austrian planner Camillo Sitte's influential book St√§dtebau as well as Garden City Planning derived from England, with Sonck striving to give as many house owners as possible direct access to the sea from their plot, while public buildings were placed further inland. In Sonck's first plan of Sonck, a formal connection was made between the highest point of the island, Vapaamuurarinm√§ki, marked later by the church bell tower, and the most remarkable natural formation on the island, the lagoon-like inland bay (Gloet or Kluuvi) on the southern seafront of the island. Built between the two was the Ribbinginhovi park all√©e. The villas and terraced housing built within the plan were designed mainly in accordance with the then prevailing Jugendstil architecture. The largest buildings built at that time were the Kulosaari Hotel (nowadays Wihuri House, company headquarters), 1917, also by Sonck, and the Domus apartment building (nowadays Br√§nd√∂ Gymnasium school), 1916, by architect J.S. Siren. Other notable buildings are the Kulosaari Casino, 1915 by Armas Lindgren and the Ribbinginhovi terraced housing, 1920, also by Lindgren. Kuulosaari church, 1935, was designed by architect Bertel Jung in the Jugendstil style, but the adjacent vast classical-functionalist campanile was designed later by Lindgren. Nowadays, Kulosaari is also noted for the location of a significant of purpose-built foreign embassy buildings, including those of China, India, Vietnam, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Columbia, Iraq and Iran.

The film earned Demi√°n Bichir the \\"Best Bichir in a movie\\" MTV Movie Awards- Mexico in 2003. Plot Lola, who works as a nightclub singer in Heaven, is sent by her boss Marina on a mission to Earth to save the soul of a Spanish boxer called Manny. His brain damaged in his last bout, with any blow liable to carry him off, he is deeply in debt and suicidal. Lola appears as his former lover, wanting to be with him again, and tries to get him to reconcile with his mother. Living with him and his mood swings is hard work however, he being a total chauvinist interested in little beyond boxing, food and sex. Carmen, who works as a waitress in Hell, is sent by her boss Davenport to get Manny into the ring again. She appears as his cousin and takes the spare room in the flat. While Lola plays the meek housewife, Carmen is flashy and lesbian. During the day, both she and Lola take jobs in a hypermarket, where they sympathise with the downtrodden staff and despise the corrupt management. Manny, as well as guilt over his breach with his mother, is regularly harassed by a couple of plain-clothes heavies sent by a corrupt police chief he owes money to. While the angelic Lola tries to buy time, the diabolic Carmen tells Manny that he could win the money by fighting again. Hell is getting very full and there are serious divisions among the management. In an effort to save his position, Davenport makes a secret deal with Marina, who he admires greatly. His argument is that without Heaven there would be no Hell, and vice versa. People on Earth, he feels, should have a free choice. So in this one case he is happy to see Manny choose Heaven, which is getting dangerously empty, and tells Carmen to work with rather than against Lola. The two women decide to rob the hypermarket and give the proceeds to Manny, who can pay off the cops with the stolen money and need never fight again. After lifting the day's takings from the cashier's office at gunpoint, they try to walk out through the crowded store, until two of the management start shooting. The women manage in the end to escape with the money, but on getting back to Manny's flat find the crooked police there with him. After he enables the two to escape the trap, the cops beat him to death. For that last sacrifice, after some debate he is allowed into Heaven. But Lola and Carmen are caught, and locked away in a Spanish prison for three years. When released, Carmen gets promotion in Hell far above her waitress status and is granted her wish of becoming a man again.

Played by Kavan Smith, Evan Lorne was first introduced as a recurring character in the seventh season of Stargate SG-1, holding the military rank of Major in the United States Air Force. He joins the Atlantis expedition after \\"The Siege\\" as one of the personnel on the Daedalus class battlecruiser. Lorne was a recurring character in seasons seven and ten in Stargate SG-1 and seasons two through five in Stargate Atlantis. Smith was originally supposed to play another character in Stargate Atlantis, but the producers eventually decided to keep Lorne, since he was popular with the fans according to Smith himself. He appears in a total of 29 episodes.  Character arc  Lorne first appears in Stargate SG-1 episode \\"Enemy Mine\\". Lorne reappears as a part of the new personnel sent after the Wraith siege by the Daedalus and serves as Atlantis' military second-in-command under Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. In \\"Runner\\", he assists Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, and Rodney McKay in the search for Aiden Ford. Lorne possesses the ATA gene, but it has never been revealed whether his gene is natural or artificial. He is seen piloting a Puddle Jumper in several episodes including \\"Condemned\\" and \\"The Hive\\". Lorne is one of the Atlantis Expedition members in \\"This Mortal Coil\\" that the Replicators take the form of, but they are all killed by Oberoth. In an alternate timeline shown in the episode \\"The Last Man\\", Lorne is a Major General and appears to be in command of the Stargate Command (SGC). Lorne also appears as the team leader of the SG-1 unit in an alternate universe in the SG-1 season 10 episode \\"The Road Not Taken\\". In \\"Doppelganger\\", Lorne threatens Sheppard while sleepwalking, believing him to be a Replicator. Lorne is stunned by Ronon Dex, and while being questioned by Dr. Kate Heightmeyer says that he \\"hadn't had a sleepwalking incident since he was ten.\\" Lorne's mother, an art teacher, taught him how to paint on weekends when he was growing up, and Lorne rekindles this muse during his stay on Atlantis. In \\"Tabula Rasa\\", Lorne, while being semiamnesiac, takes a severe overdose of a delaying medicine that is supposed to hold back the illness. This causes him (and all of his team) to become paranoid, aggressive and confused and they resort to shooting with stunners everyone they see even if they are not affected by the sickness. Eventually, though, a picture of Sheppard convinced him to assist Ronon treat the sick. He later apologised to Sheppard. Originally from San Francisco, California, Lorne also has a sister who has two young boys. He loves ice cream.  Conceptual history  The character was introduced in the Stargate SG-1 episode \\"Enemy Mine\\". Kavan Smith had formed a close relationship with director Peter DeLuise before being cast. When the development of the episode was finished, there were no plans of expanding Lorne's role in the franchise. Smith himself felt the part would not \\"necessarily\\" lead anywhere big. Sometime after shooting \\"Enemy Mine\\", the producers wanted to talk to Smith about the possibility of having him return to the spin off series, Stargate Atlantis. After the talk, Smith auditioned for a part, he won and received a different character. According to Smith, this character was more of a \\"military guy\\", but the producers eventually decided to give Smith back his old character, Lorne. Portraying actor, Smith at Stargate convention. When talking about season two of Stargate Atlantis, staff writer, Martin Gero said Lorne had become the most notable recurring character of the series. In an interview with Smith, it was revealed that Lorne's first name was decided to be \\"Evan\\", later confirmed by executive producer, Joseph Mallozzi. While fans on the other hand, have given him the first name, Marcus (or, alternately, Nick), the producers or writers have not responded to this. In the episode \\"Spoils of War\\", a character was going to call him \\"Uncle Evan\\", this scene was cut off, because of time constraints. At first, plot information about the episode, \\"Coup D'etat\\" was a bit scarce. Many fans speculated that they were going to kill Lorne off the show. Smith went and had a brief talk with the writing staff, responding to his worries that it was a part of a \\"cliffhanger\\". According to Smith, the only reason for making Lorne a recurring character was the positive feedback from fans. \\"Sunday\\" became the first episode to reveal information about Lorne's backstory. Smith described Lorne as \\"that sort of faithful, loyal guy that everybody kind of knows,\\" and representing a \\"steady constant.\\" On his own weblog, Joseph Mallozzi said that Lorne as a character would become more active during season 5.  Reception  Cynthia from Sci Fi Universe commented that Kavan Smith played a character who had the \\"same name\\" as the character he originally portrayed in Stargate SG-1, but was \\"not really the same guy\\". Concluding her review saying she reacted positive towards the evolution of the character. When talking about science fiction fandom, Smith said that he was \\"shocked\\" about the fan response to his character, further stating that this could only be possible in a science fiction television series. In the interview, Smith said that his \\"character seems to be developing ... I feel like his career is sort of moving ahead.\\" In an interview, Smith said he had evolved a strong fanbase, which started with his more obscure earlier work and has since followed him throughout his career. Because of the strong fan response, Smith has started to attend various Stargate conventions.

It is a simple example of a projective variety; formally, it is the Veronese variety when the domain is the projective line. For it is the plane conic and for it is the twisted cubic. The term \\"normal\\" refers to projective normality, not normal schemes. The intersection of the rational normal curve with an affine space is called the moment curve. Definition The rational normal curve may be given parametrically as the image of the map : u:\\\\mathbf{P}^1\\\\to\\\\mathbf{P}^n which assigns to the homogeneous coordinates the value : u:[S:T] \\\\mapsto \\\\left [S^n:S^{n-1}T:S^{n-2}T^2:\\\\cdots:T^n \\\\right ]. In the affine coordinates of the chart the map is simply : u:x \\\\mapsto \\\\left (x, x^2, \\\\ldots, x^n \\\\right ). That is, the rational normal curve is the closure by a single point at infinity of the affine curve :\\\\left (x, x^2, \\\\ldots, x^n \\\\right ). Equivalently, rational normal curve may be understood to be a projective variety, defined as the common zero locus of the homogeneous polynomials :F_{i,j} \\\\left (X_0, \\\\ldots, X_n \\\\right ) = X_iX_j - X_{i+1}X_{j-1} where [X_0: \\\\cdots: X_n] are the homogeneous coordinates on . The full set of these polynomials is not needed; it is sufficient to pick of these to specify the curve. Alternate parameterization Let [a_i:b_i] be distinct points in . Then the polynomial :G(S,T) = \\\\prod_{i=0}^n \\\\left (a_iS -b_iT \\\\right ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree with distinct roots. The polynomials :H_i(S,T) = \\\\frac{G(S,T)} {(a_iS-b_iT)} are then a basis for the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree . The map :[S:T] \\\\mapsto \\\\left [H_0(S,T) : H_1(S,T) : \\\\cdots : H_n (S,T) \\\\right ] or, equivalently, dividing by :[S:T] \\\\mapsto \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{(a_0S-b_0T)} : \\\\cdots : \\\\frac{1}{(a_nS-b_nT)}\\\\right] is a rational normal curve. That this is a rational normal curve may be understood by noting that the monomials :S^n,S^{n-1}T,S^{n-2}T^2,\\\\cdots,T^n, are just one possible basis for the space of degree homogeneous polynomials. In fact, any basis will do. This is just an application of the statement that any two projective varieties are projectively equivalent if they are congruent modulo the projective linear group (with the field over which the projective space is defined). This rational curve sends the zeros of to each of the coordinate points of ; that is, all but one of the vanish for a zero of . Conversely, any rational normal curve passing through the coordinate points may be written parametrically in this way. Properties The rational normal curve has an assortment of nice properties: * Any points on are linearly independent, and span . This property distinguishes the rational normal curve from all other curves. * Given points in in linear general position (that is, with no lying in a hyperplane), there is a unique rational normal curve passing through them. The curve may be explicitly specified using the parametric representation, by arranging of the points to lie on the coordinate axes, and then mapping the other two points to and . * The tangent and secant lines of a rational normal curve are pairwise disjoint, except at points of the curve itself. This is a property shared by sufficiently positive embeddings of any projective variety. * There are ::\\\\binom{n+2}{2}-2n-1 :independent quadrics that generate the ideal of the curve. * The curve is not a complete intersection, for . That is, it cannot be defined (as a subscheme of projective space) by only equations, that being the codimension of the curve in \\\\mathbf{P}^n. * The canonical mapping for a hyperelliptic curve has image a rational normal curve, and is 2-to-1. * Every irreducible non- degenerate curve of degree is a rational normal curve.

Scale bars indicate 100 nm. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) consisting of polyhedral protein shells filled with the enzymes ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO)--the predominant enzyme in carbon fixation and the rate limiting enzyme in the Calvin cycle--and carbonic anhydrase. Carboxysomes are thought to have evolved as a consequence of the increase in oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere; this is because oxygen is a competing substrate to carbon dioxide in the RuBisCO reaction. To overcome the inefficiency of RuBisCO, carboxysomes concentrate carbon dioxide inside the shell by means of co-localized carbonic anhydrase activity, which produces carbon dioxide from the bicarbonate that diffuses into the carboxysome. The resulting concentration of carbon dioxide near RuBisCO decreases the proportion of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation and thereby avoids costly photorespiratory reactions. The surrounding shell provides a barrier to carbon dioxide loss, helping to increase its concentration around RuBisCO. Carboxysomes are an essential part of the carbon dioxide-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Carboxysomes are the best studied example of bacterial microcompartments, the term for functionally diverse organelles that are alike in having a protein shell. Discovery Polyhedral bodies were discovered by transmission electron microscopy in the cyanobacterium Phormidium uncinatum in 1956. These were later observed in other cyanobacteria and in some chemotrophic bacteria that fixed carbon dioxide‚Äîmany of them are sulfur reducers or nitrogen fixers (for example, Halothiobacillus, Acidithiobacillus, Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus). The polyhedral bodies were first purified from Thiobacillus neapolitanus (now Halothiobacillus neapolitanus) in 1973 and shown to contain RuBisCO, held within a rigid outer covering. The authors proposed that since these appeared to be organelles involved in carbon fixation, they should be called carboxysomes. Architecture Model for the structure of the carboxysome. RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase are arranged in an enzymatic core (organized by various core proteins) and encapsulated by a protein shell. Structurally, carboxysomes are icosahedral, or quasi-icosahedral. Electron cryo-tomography studies have confirmed the approximately icosahedral geometry of the carboxysome, and have imaged protein molecules inside (presumed to be RuBisCO), arranged in a few concentric layers. The non-icosahedral faceted shapes of some carboxysomes can naturally be explained within the elastic theory of heterogeneous thin shells. The carboxysome has an outer shell composed of a few thousand protein subunits, which encapsulates a CO2-producing enzyme (carbonic anhydrase) and a carbon-fixing enzyme (RuBisCO). Proteins known to form the shell have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The protein that constitutes the majority of the shell forms a cyclical hexamer and belongs to BMC protein family. These hexamers, BMC-H proteins, are the basic building blocks of the shell. In some crystal forms the hexamers assemble further in a side-by-side fashion to form a tightly packed molecular layer, which presumably is how the facets of the shell are assembled. Small pores perforate many different types of BMC-H hexamers, and may serve as the route for diffusion of small substrates (e.g. bicarbonate) into and out of the carboxysome. Positively charged amino acids in the pores presumably help promote the diffusion of the negatively charged substrates and products. Other minor structural components of the shell that have been characterized include pentameric proteins (BMC-P proteins), which have been proposed to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral shell. A third building block of the carboxysome shell is a protein composed of two BMC domains in tandem (BMC-T proteins). Structurally, many of these are known to form trimers which are pseudohexameric. Some members of the BMC-T protein family stack in a face-to-face fashion and form tiny cages. Based on crystal structures, these protein cages have relatively large gated pores on both sides, and it has been proposed that the opening and closing of the pore could be controlled in a manner similar to an air-lock. Such an air-lock, in contrast to BMC-H proteins with constitutively open pores, has been suggested to serve as a route for larger substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) that must cross the shell. A number of viral capsids are also icosahedral, composed of hexameric and pentameric proteins, but currently there is no evidence suggesting any evolutionary relationship between the carboxysome shell and viral capsids. Two Types of Carboxysomes There are two types of carboxysomes. Although they may seem similar in appearance, they differ in their protein composition, including the form of RuBisCO they enclose. Furthermore, studies have revealed fundamental differences in their gene organization and possibly in how they assemble. Electron micrograph of (A) alpha-carboxysomes in Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and (B) beta-carboxysomes in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, indicated by arrows =Alpha-Carboxysomes= Alpha-carboxysomes are also referred as the cso type of carboxysome. They contain Form IA RuBisCO; they are found in alpha-cyanobacteria, some nitrifying bacteria, some sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Halothiobacillus neapolitanus), and some purple bacteria. The alpha-carboxysome was the first bacterial microcompartment to be purified and characterized. Electron microscopy studies on purified alpha-carboxysomes or cell sections containing alpha-carboxysomes revealed that they are typically 100-160 nm in diameter. Common building blocks for the shell of alpha- carboxysomes are called CsoS1A/B/C (BMC-H), CsoS4A/B (BMC-P), and CsoS1D (BMC-T). CsoS4A/B were the first BMC-P proteins to be experimentally demonstrated as minor components of the BMC shell (only 12 pentamers are required to cap the vertices of an icosahedron). CsoS1D is first BMC-T which has been structurally characterized; it is also the first example of dimerization of two BMC building blocks in a face-to-face fashion to create a tiny cage. The CsoS1D cage has gated pore at both end, which is proposed to facilitate large metabolites crossing the shell. In addition to the specific form of RuBisCO, other encapsulated proteins distinguish alpha-carboxysomes from beta-carboxysomes such as CsoS2 and CsoSCA. The CsoS2 protein has a very high pI and a unique primary structure. The primary structure of CsoS2 appears tripartite, composed of an N-terminal, middle- and C-terminal regions. Repetitive motifs can be identified in the N-terminal and middle regions. Recently, it was proposed to be an intrinsically disordered protein with an essential role in alpha-carboxysome assembly. CsoSCA is a shell-associated beta-carbonic anhydrase. Studies in Halothiobacillus neapolitanus have shown that empty shells of normal shape and composition are assembled in carboxysomal RuBisCO-lacking mutants, suggesting that alpha-carboxysome shell biogenesis and enzyme sequestration are two independent, but functionally linked processes. Intriguingly, carboxysomes of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus have been found to accommodate chimeric and heterologous species of RuBisCO and it is the large subunit of RuBisCO which determines whether the enzyme is sequestered into carboxysomes or not. =Beta-carboxysomes= The signature proteins of the beta-carboxysome are Form IB RuBisCO and a gamma carbonic anhydrase homolog. Beta-carboxysomes are typically bigger than alpha- carboxysomes: the observed diameters for them vary from 200 to 400 nm. The structural proteins that are essential for carboxysome formation are encoded in the conserved carboxysome locus known as the ccm locus. The ccm locus includes genes for core proteins CcmM and CcmN and the shell proteins CcmK (a BMC-H protein), CcmL (a BMC-P protein) and CcmO (a BMC-T protein). A full length CcmM protein consists of a gamma-carbonic anhydrase domain on and three to five small subunit-like domains (SSLDs; which resemble RbcS, the small subunit of RuBisCO) on its C-terminus. The ccmM gene contains an internal translation site that produces a short form of CcmM (a protein which only consists of SSLDs); both long and short forms of CcmM are required for carboxysome assembly. CcmN contains multiple hexapeptide-repeat domains on its N-terminus and a short Œ±-helical encapsulation peptide on the C-terminus. Other structural components of the carboxysomes are encoded outside of the ccm locus. CcmP is a BMC-T protein that is absolutely conserved among organisms that form beta-carboxysomes. CcmP pseudohexamer stacks to form a nanocompartment‚Äîan example of an air-lock forming protein. Likewise, in some cyanobacterial strains the beta-carboxysomes contain a beta-carbonic anhydrase that is not found in the ccm locus. The beta-carboxysome assembles from the inside out, first an enzymatic core forms that is subsequently encapsulated by a protein shell. Carboxysome assembly occurs through a series of protein- protein interactions: the enzyme RuBisCO and the two isoforms (full length and short form) of the CcmM protein interact by means of the SSLDs; in strains containing CcaA the beta-carbonic anhydrase is brought into the carboxysome core by interaction with the N-terminus of the full length CcmM. Once the procarboxysome (the carboxysome core) is formed, the N-terminus of the adapter protein CcmN interacts with the N-terminus of CcmM, while the C-terminus of CcmN recruits the shell proteins CcmK (BMC-H) and CcmO (BMC-T). The final step is the addition of the vertices formed by the BMC-P protein CcmL, which then fully cap the enzymatic core. Potential uses of the carboxysome in biotechnology As the case with other BMCs, the carboxysome is attracting significant attention by researchers for applications in synthetic biology. The transfer of a genetic module coding for an alpha-carboxysome has been shown to produce carboxysome-like structures in E. coli. Bioengineering of carboxysome shells have been shown feasible and beta-carboxysomes constructed with chimeric proteins or with chimeric shells has been reported. The introduction of carboxysomes into plant chloroplasts as part of a CO2 concentrating mechanism (such as that found in cyanobacteria) is predicted to have significant improvements on net CO2 fixation and yield. Expression of beta-carboxysomal shell proteins and Form IB Rubisco-CcmM complexes in tobacco chloroplasts has been achieved, but this did not result in compartments containing Rubisco. A further advance has been the construction of minimal alpha-carboxysomes from the cyanobacterium Cyanobium PCC7001 in tobacco chloroplasts containing Form IA Rubisco and the CsoS1A and CsoS2 proteins. As yet, identifiably functional carboxysomes have not yet been constructed in plant chloroplasts. Nonetheless, successful improvement of photosynthesis in plants using this approach is ultimately dependent on the operation of transporter proteins in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane to help generate a high concentration of bicarbonate inside the chloroplast.

Rational surfaces are the simplest of the 10 or so classes of surface in the Enriques‚ÄìKodaira classification of complex surfaces, and were the first surfaces to be investigated. Structure Every non-singular rational surface can be obtained by repeatedly blowing up a minimal rational surface.

This is used in the Enriques‚ÄìKodaira classification to identify the rational surfaces. proved that Castelnuovo's theorem also holds over fields of positive characteristic. Castelnuovo's theorem also implies that any unirational complex surface is rational, because if a complex surface is unirational then its irregularity and plurigenera are bounded by those of a rational surface and are therefore all 0, so the surface is rational. Most unirational complex varieties of dimension 3 or larger are not rational. In characteristic p > 0 found examples of unirational surfaces (Zariski surfaces) that are not rational. At one time it was unclear whether a complex surface such that q and P1 both vanish is rational, but a counterexample (an Enriques surface) was found by Federigo Enriques.

The school building opened in 1907 as \\"Davenport High School,\\" and is now one of three public high schools part of the Davenport Community School District. The school, whose western side is located along U.S. Highway 61, draws students primarily from the southern, eastern, and central portions of the city. The school has an enrollment of approximately 1,450 students in grades 9 through 12, and offers over 40,000 courses in a four-block schedule. Central also has a variety of extracurricular activities, clubs, and teams. The school also houses the Davenport School District's high school autism program. The school complex is part of the College Square Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Early years= High schools had operated in various buildings and Davenport since 1861, the longest-lived of those sites being in roughly the area where Seventh and Eighth, and Iowa streets are today. An early history of Davenport and Scott County stated that the building was opened in 1875, and \\"grew from year to year until the building was too small to accommodate the numbers.\\"Downer, Harry E., \\"History of Davenport and Scott County, Iowa,\\" Vol. 1, S.J. Publishing Co., Chicago, 1910. In 1900, a site for a future high school was secured at the old Griswold College property, roughly where 12th and Main streets are today. The school board agreed to purchase the property from the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa for $53,000, and voters agreed to move forward with the purchase. The Davenport history described the site as \\"an ideal one for the high school of this city. The ground covers a block in the central part of Davenport; it is beautifully situated, centrally located and readily accessible.\\" School board members spent time studying \\"the best high school structures in the Mississippi Valley,\\" and after outlining their wishes, the architectural firm of Clausen & Burrows were hired to draw up a blueprint for the new building. The H.B. Water Construction Co. of Danville, Ill., was hired as general contractor, and construction began in 1905. The groundbreaking was described as a \\"great outpouring of the inhabitants of this city,\\" with students and Bishop Morrison of the Diocese of Iowa participating. The building's facade was made of Marquette rain-drop sandstone and red tile roof, floors of terrazo mosaic and hardwood maple, and French plate-glass windows. Construction of the four-story tall (three stories above a \\"tall basement\\"), 202√ó204-foot building, was completed in January 1907, with a capital cost $347,000 and capacity for 1,600 students. The new building included a gymnasium, a 1,300-seat auditorium, a manual training room, science laboratories, a library, mechanical and free- hand drawing rooms, cafeteria and administrative offices. The science laboratories were described as being \\"the most abundantly supplied with the most modern apparatus and other means of successful instruction.\\" F.L. Smart was principal when the new high school opened; George Edward Marshall was named principal in 1907, and served until his death in 1932. The gymnasium, with seating for 4,000 people, is named after Marshall. In 1910, there were seven course of study, each 40 weeks long and \\"sufficient to meet the wants of all students of high school age.\\" Academic disciplines 100 years ago covered Latin, German, science, English, commercial business, manual training (for those entering industrial and technical careers) and domestic science. One hundred years later, much different courses of study are in place. =Davenport High to Davenport Central= For more than 40 years, the new Davenport High School building served as the city's lone high school, and until the late 1950s, the school also served the secondary education needs of much of Scott County as well. Bettendorf did not have its own high school until 1951, meaning many Bettendorf students wanting to further their education chose Davenport High. The same was true for many northern Scott County students prior to 1958, the year North Scott High School opened in Eldridge. As for Davenport, by the late 1950s, the city had grown to more than 80,000 residents, and one high school campus was no longer enough to meet the city's needs. West High School opened in 1960 to accommodate students from the fast-growing west and northwest parts of the city, plus the surrounding rural areas of which the Davenport School District encompassed. \\"Davenport High\\" then became Davenport Central, and served the central, southern and northeast areas of Davenport. The city's third high school ‚Äì North ‚Äì opened in a renovated junior high school building in 1985 and served the northwest areas of Davenport. Many additions and renovations have been made to the original 1905 high school building. Athletics The school participates in the Mississippi Athletic Conference, and athletic teams are known as the Blue Devils. School colors are red and blue. The school fields athletic teams in 21 sports, including: * Summer: Baseball, softball. * Fall: Football, volleyball, girls' swimming, boys' cross country, girls' cross country and boys' golf, Rugby. * Winter: Boys' basketball, girls' basketball, wrestling, boys' swimming and boys' and girls' bowling. * Spring: Boys' track and field, girls' track and field, boys' soccer, girls' soccer, girls' golf, boys' tennis and girls' tennis. The school also has a cheerleading squad and a competitive dance team. Davenport Central is classified as a 4A school (Iowa's largest 48 schools), according to the Iowa High School Athletic Association and Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union; in sports where there are fewer divisions, the Blue Devils are always in the largest class (e.g., Class 3A for wrestling, boys soccer, and Class 2A for golf, tennis and girls soccer). The school is a member of the 10-team Mississippi Athletic Conference (known to locals as the MAC), which comprises schools from the Iowa Quad Cities, along with Burlington, Clinton and Muscatine high schools. Davenport Central's biggest rivalries are with intercity rivals West and North high schools as well as Davenport Assumption High School, the city's private school. =Successes= Throughout the school's history, Davenport Central has enjoyed great success in many of its sports, earning many MAC conference titles and producing all- state athletes that have enjoyed success at the collegiate level and in their careers. For many years, Central ‚àí and Davenport High before that ‚àí enjoyed success in sports, including football, basketball, wrestling, track and baseball. Football teams, coached by the legendary Jesse Day, A.J. \\"Butch\\" Stolfa and Jim Fox won numerous state titles in football, including Class 4A playoff titles in 1973, 1976 and 1983. Many former Blue Devil players won all- state honors, and several went on to illustrious careers in professional football, including Roger Craig of the San Francisco 49ers. Overall, Central has won the most state championships in athletics of any high school in Iowa. From 1941 through 1970, Central ‚àí and Davenport High before that ‚àí won seven state titles and two runner-up trophies in boys basketball.State Basketball Tournament Game Results, 1940-1969, Iowa High School Athletic Association.State Basketball Tournament Game Results, 1970-1999, Iowa High School Athletic Association. Since then, Central teams have appeared in three state tournaments, winning two state runner up trophies (in 1979 and 2008).State Basketball Tournament Game Results, 2000-present, Iowa High School Athletic Association. During the 1993-94 Season, one of their most successful seasons, the Devils shot out of the gates and won a share of the MAC Conference Title. Before their 1st round playoff game against Clinton their star guard Terry Moore, sustained a knee injury. Although they won against Clinton they would fall to Bettendorf in the next round. The '94 team was led by Cory \\"CJ Sizzle\\" Johnson and Deshawn Wiggins and 6th man Markelus D'Antico. They were coached by legendary coach, Craig Wurdinger. Many girls' programs at Central have experienced success. One example is the volleyball program, which in 1981 won the Class 2A state title under coach Cindy (Smoker) Fredrick. Fredrick later became a successful Men's volleyball coach at Washington State University and the University of Iowa. * Baseball (11-time State Champions - 1940, 1941, 1944, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1960, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979 ) * Boys' Basketball (12-time State Champions - 1913, 1920, 1921, 1929, 1930, 1941, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1958, 1970) * Boys' Cross Country (2-time State Champions - 1951, 1971) * Football (6-time State Champions - 1955, 1957, 1962, 1973, 1976, 1983) * Boys' Tennis - 2007 Class 2A State Champions * Boys' Track and Field (14-time State Champions - 1915, 1931, 1935, 1942, 1947, 1952, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1982, 1983, 1984, 2005) * Girls' Track and Field (2-time Class 3A State Champions - 1982, 1984) * Volleyball (2-time Class 5A State Champions - 2012, 2013) * Wrestling (2-time State Champions - 1954, 1956) Performing Arts Choir The Vocal Music Program at Davenport Central travels and competes extensively, especially Central's two show choirs, \\"Blue Vibrations\\" (JV mixed) and \\"Central Singers, Inc.\\" (varsity mixed).

At an altitude of above sea level, Bald Knob is the third-highest point in West Virginia and the Allegheny Mountains. Description Bald Knob's elevation‚Äî only lower than the highest point in the Alleghenies, Spruce Knob)‚Äîgives it a unique hemiboreal ecosystem. While the lower and middle elevations of the mountain are populated by oak, hickory, birch, beech and maple, the summit dome was historically dominated by red spruce. Rowan, eastern hemlock, and balsam fir also occur above , though they are not as common as the spruce. The region was extensively logged from 1900 to 1960. Red spruce, being a valuable natural resource, attracted timber companies into the area. By 1940, the mountain had been stripped of nearly all virgin red spruce. The last harvest of red spruce and eastern hemlock on Bald Knob was in 1960. The summit was one of the last places logged by the Mower Lumber Company. Today, red spruce and other high elevation flora are making a comeback on the mountain; however, it will take many years for the area to fully recover.Tumult on the Mountain and On Beyond Leatherbark: The Cass Saga = Access = The mountaintop can be reached by hiking but is more commonly reached by riding the Cass Scenic Railroad, which transports visitors via old logging railroads to a sub-peak approximately 1/4 mile (0.4 km) north of Bald Knob.Cass Scenic Railway, Bald Knob Trip Climate Bald Knob generally experiences mild summers and cold winters. The summit and west facing slopes of the mountain receive an average of of precipitation per year and of snowfall. The annual record snowfall is over . Temperatures in the area have been known to reach ‚àí40 degrees Fahrenheit (‚àí40 ¬∞C). Winter conditions can occur anytime from early October through early May. Snowfall has been observed in the higher elevations in every month except July. Federal troops observed snowfall on August 13, 1861 at nearby Fort Milroy. The last freeze usually occurs in May and the first freeze usually occurs in September; however, freezing temperatures can occur anytime throughout the year. Current weather conditions for both the summit and base of the mountain at the town of Cass are available below. Accessing Bald Knob While most of Back Allegheny Mountain is owned by Monongahela National Forest, the summit at Bald Knob itself is part of Cass Scenic Railroad State Park. View from the Bald Knob observation deck, accessed via Cass Scenic Railroad Most visitors to Bald Knob come via train from Cass, but the site is also accessible by Forest Road 267B, which is closed to motorized vehicles most of the year. A two-mile hike from Odey Run can easily be walked or biked to arrive at Bald Knob. For safety reasons, hiking along the railroad grade itself is not permitted. Miscellaneous facts *Bald Knob is one of only four mountain summits in West Virginia that rise above 4,800 feet (1463.04 m), the other three being Spruce Knob, Thorny Flat, and an unnamed summit near Snowshoe, WV. *The south face of Bald Knob is the site of the headwaters of Leatherbark Run, West Virginia's highest stream. *Until 2001, Bald Knob was thought to be the second highest point in the state, but a survey conducted by Snowshoe Ski Resort using GPS technology concluded that Thorny Flat, the highpoint of Cheat Mountain, roughly south of Bald Knob, was approximately higher. Since then, at least one other summit on Cheat Mountain has been identified as being potentially a few feet higher than Bald Knob. *Bald Knob is the highest point reached by a standard gauge railroad east of the Mississippi River.

E. Marshall; 9 August 1867 ‚Äì 19 September 1941) was a British author, particularly well known for her works of popular national history for children. She is best known for her 1905 work Our Island Story: A History of England for Boys and Girls. Life She was born in Bo'ness, Scotland, and her father was John Marshall JP, an earthenware manufacturer. She was educated at a girls' boarding school called Laurel Bank, in Melrose. Between 1901 and 1904 she was the superintendent of a hall of residence for female students at the University of Glasgow, but, otherwise, she appears to have made her living throughout her life by writing. She never married. As is made clear by the Prefaces of her books from time to time, she travelled extensively after 1904, including to Melbourne, California and China, although her obituary in The Times stated that she spent most of her life in Oxford and in London, where she died. H. E. Marshall is famous for the aforementioned 1905 children's history of England, Our Island Story, illustrated by A. S. Forrest. In the USA the book was entitled An Island Story. The book was a bestseller, was printed in numerous editions, and for fifty years was the standard and much-loved book by which children learned the history of England. However a lot of this book is historically inaccurate and much of it uses Shakespeare's plays for historical sources; for example, the section on Richard III is really a summary of the play. The book went out of print in the 1960s, but in 2005, an alliance of the Civitas think-tank and various national newspapers reprinted it, with the aim of sending a free copy to each of the UK's primary schools. Readers of The Daily Telegraph contributed ¬£25,000 to the cost of the reprint. In 2010, then British Prime Minister David Cameron cited Our Island Story as his favourite childhood book.

Osmangazi is one of the central metropolitan districts of the city of Bursa in Bursa Province, as well as the fourth largest overall municipality in Turkey. The municipality has a population of approximately 778,843 as of 2012. On its own, it would be the 8th largest city in Turkey. The district has been shaped by several civilizations: Rome, Byzantines, Seljuqians, and Ottomans. The first marks of the Ottoman Empire exist within Osmangazi where it extended from the foot of Uludaƒü to the plain of Bursa. Within the boundaries of Osmangazi, approximately 1800 registered historical buildings exist. History It was stated that there were various settlements in Bursa and its surroundings by 4000 B.C. But the certain information related to the region belongs to 700 B.C. Homer called the region Mysia. There are two villages that are ancient Mysia settlements: Misi (G√ºm√º≈ütepe) and Misebolu. The region is called Phrygia in historical geography. It is known that Cimmerians, fleeing from the migration of the Scythians, put an end to Phrygian sovereignty. The name of Bursa comes from the founder of this city, Prussias, the King of Bithynia. The Bithynians, who migrated to the region in 7th century B.C., used the name Bithynia. It was pointed out that one of the most important commanders that Carthage had recommended the establishment of the City of Prusias and Olympus to King Prusian I. in 185 B.C. By that time, \\"Prusa\\" has been transformed to Bursa. When Bithynia joined the Roman Empire in 74 B.C., it became the Asian Province that was governed by proconsuls (head of the province), who were appointed in Rome. Bursa was under the sovereignty of the Byzantine Empire between 385-1326 A.D. The city became a thermal city after the thermal baths while silk production in the region started in 550 A.D. Bursa was seized by Osman I in 1307 and conquered by Orhan, the son of Osman I, on 6 April 1335. The capital of the empire was moved to Bursa in 1335 and new development movements were initiated. When Bursa was conquered, the city consisted of the inner castle, but Orhan had the Orhan Gazi Complex built out of the town. Public buildings such as mosques, baths, soup houses, hospitals, madrasahs were built out of the walls, where new settlements had been created, hence a new tradition of settling area had been established. Right after the conquest of Istanbul by Sultan Mehmed I., the active role of Bursa and its qualification as the administrative center had faded away. There are no buildings surviving from the Roman and Byzantine era. It is believed that the walls surrounding the city were built by Bithynians and used by the Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans after maintenance. Bursa had developed more than other cities in the first two centuries of Ottoman rule. It was filled with a number of architectural structures and became a trade city as well as a science city, where various famous madrasahs were located.

History Company founder Kenneth Moss made $1.5 million in the stock market before he was 26 (). He invested $1.15 million () of his own funds into the company, and received certification from the Federal Aviation Administration on August 7, 1973. The company was founded as a non profit; Moss reported that income in excess of operating costs would be donated to worthy causes such as free clinics, free schools, and artists. In order to avoid Civil Aeronautics Board regulation of its routes, it did not call itself an airline, but a travel club, with members voting on where the company's planes would fly. The company said that it had obtained landing rights in Hong Kong, Yugoslavia, and South America. It flew one aircraft, a DC-8-21 which was painted entirely in a semi- dark yellow with a waving hand as its logo on the tail. It was equipped with 149 seats with first class leg room and a 7-seat lounge that would allow the passengers to mingle. Many of the seats were later removed and replaced with pillows with seat belts. It was decorated in what the company described as a \\"far-out chocolate-and-cream color\\". In-flight service offered organic food, rock music, and a waterbed. Entertainment options included books, chess, video games, and a pinball machine. None of the company's flight personnel had less than 10,000 hours flight experience. The company planned to add additional aircraft to its fleet every time the membership increased by 8,000. Fares were announced as $69 from Honolulu to San Francisco, $12.50 from San Francisco to Los Angeles, $69 from Los Angeles to New York, and $100 from New York to Brussels. In order to get those discounted rates, travellers had to obtain a membership, with an annual fee of $50 for adults and $25 for kids under 12. The advertised fares were about $30 cheaper than other airlines for the flight from San Francisco to Honolulu, and about $200 less than usual for flights from the West Coast to Brussels. The company stated that three thousand people had signed up with the club before its first flight. Its first flight took place on September 18, 1973 from San Francisco to Honolulu. Demise Operations ended within a year of its creation due to low sales. In November 1973, overseas flights were scrapped because the company could not fill the flights. In May 1974, the company's aircraft was repossessed by the leasing company for non-payment. It flew an estimated 40 or 50 flights, mostly coast to coast, before operations ceased, but interest from members wasn't enough to fill the flights to make them profitable. Despite saying that flights to Hawaii would occur three times per month, it only flew there twice and the second time it had trouble obtaining fuel for the return flight. The company and its founder were charged in a civil suit by the State of California for false advertising and fraudulent business practices in late 1974. While the company had been set up as a non-profit business, the founder also set up three other for-profit corporations that were paid by the company to perform various services. Rolling Stone Magazine claimed that the founder stood to make several million dollars from the venture. In 1976, Ross settled the suit for $60,000, but paid no money because his net worth was listed as less than $1,000. After airline operations ceased, founder Kenneth Moss was charged with murder and unlawfully providing narcotics in the death of Robbie McIntosh the drummer of the band Average White Band at Moss's home in September 1974. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and four years' probation.

It is a popular pet among Australian reptile enthusiasts due to its small size and even temperament. No subspecies are currently recognized. Taxonomy Wilhelm Peters described the spotted python in 1873. A new subspecies, A. m. brentonoloughlini was described by Hoser (2003). but this taxon is not considered valid by other herpetologists. No subspecies of Antaresia maculosa are currently recognised. Description Adults average about in length. It has an irregular, blotched color pattern throughout its life. The blotches have ragged edges because the dark pigmentation occurs only on complete scales. Distribution and habitat Found in Australia from the extreme north of the Cape York Peninsula, south through eastern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Also on many islands off the coast of Queensland. The type locality given is \\"Rockhampton, Port Mackay, Port Bowen [= Port Clinton]\\" [Queensland, Australia]. L.A.

The Papua specimen was found behind discarded corrugated tin sheets beside a disused airstrip in Eucalypt savanna-woodland habitat dotted with numerous termite mounds. Feeding One of its favorite foods are the insectivorous bats that it catches at the entrance of their caves. Being the largest members of this genus, captive specimens will usually accept mice and other small rodents. Juvenile Spotted Pythons will usually feed on young lizards, mammals and the occasional amphibian. file:Python, Spotted.JPGSpotted Pythons are often mistaken for the Children's python Reproduction The spotted python is oviparous, with females laying up to 15 eggs in a clutch.

Typically they are effusive eruptions, with basaltic magmas of low viscosity, low content of gases, and high temperature at the vent. Very small amounts of volcanic ash are produced. This type of eruption occurs most often at hotspot volcanoes such as Kƒ´lauea on Hawaii's big island and in Iceland, though it can occur near subduction zones (e.g. Medicine Lake Volcano in California, United States) and rift zones. Another example of Hawaiian eruptions occurred on the island of Surtsey in Iceland from 1964 to 1967, when molten lava flowed from the crater to the sea. Hawaiian eruptions may occur along fissure vents, such as during the eruption of Mauna Loa in 1950, or at a central vent, such as during the 1959 eruption in Kƒ´lauea Iki Crater, which created a lava fountain 580 meters (1,900 ft) high and formed a 38-meter cone named Puu Puai. In fissure-type eruptions, lava spurts from a fissure on the volcano's rift zone and feeds lava streams that flow downslope. In central- vent eruptions, a fountain of lava can spurt to a height of 300 meters or more (heights of 1600 meters were reported for the 1986 eruption of Mount Mihara on Izu ≈åshima, Japan). Hawaiian eruptions usually start by the formation of a crack in the ground from which a curtain of incandescent magma or several closely spaced magma fountains appear. The lava can overflow the fissure and form aƒÅ or pƒÅhoehoe style of flows. When such an eruption from a central cone is protracted, it can form lightly sloped shield volcanoes, for example Mauna Loa or Skjaldbrei√∞ur in Iceland.  Petrology of Hawaiian basalts  The key factors in generating a Hawaiian eruption are basaltic magma and a low percentage of dissolved water (less than one percent). The lower the water content, the more peaceful is the resulting flow. Almost all lava that comes from Hawaiian volcanoes is basalt in composition. Hawaiian basalts that make up almost all of the islands are tholeiite. These rocks are similar but not identical to those that are produced at ocean ridges. Basalt relatively richer in sodium and potassium (more alkaline) has erupted at the undersea volcano of L≈çihi at the extreme southeastern end of the volcanic chain, and these rocks may be typical of early stages in the \\"evolution\\" of all Hawaiian islands. In the late stages of eruption of individual volcanoes, more alkaline basalt also was erupted, and in the very late stages after a period of erosion, rocks of unusual composition such as nephelinite were produced in very small amounts. These variations in magma composition have been investigated in great detail, in part to try to understand how mantle plumes may work.  Safety  Hawaiian eruptions are considered less dangerous than other types of volcanic eruptions, due to the lack of ash and the generally slow movement of lava flows. However, they can still cause injuries or deaths. In 1993, a photographer attempting to take pictures of a lava ocean entry died, and several tourists were injured, when a lava bench collapsed. In 2000, two people were found dead near a lava ocean entry from Kƒ´lauea, likely killed by laze. Sulfur dioxide emissions can also be fatal, especially to people suffering from respiratory ailments. In 2018 lava spatter from Kƒ´lauea broke a man's leg, and another 23 people on a tour boat were injured by a steam explosion at a lava ocean entry from the same eruption.

Starring Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend as two con men with Kate Beckinsale as their unwilling assistant, the film was produced by Winchester Films and partly funded by National Lottery money administered through the UK Arts Council. Shooting Fish aimed to transfer well to international markets that were keen on British films following the success of Four Weddings and a Funeral. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 17 October 1997 and in the United States on 1 May 1998. Plot Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart Townsend) are two orphans who meet in their twenties and vow to achieve their shared childhood dream of living in a stately home. In pursuit of this dream they spend their days living in a disused gas holder, spending as little money as possible and conning the upper classes out of their riches. During one of their cons, they encounter Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) who is a medical student who can type. Georgie becomes aware that the two are con-artists. But they manage to convince her that they are modern day Robin Hoods, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. When a con goes wrong, the two find themselves jailed. They later learn that their entire fortune is to be rendered useless as the Royal Bank of England is recalling the notes. Jez and Dylan decide they need to somehow escape and retrieve their money or risk losing it. Jez contacts Georgie and appeals to her to help. Georgie, unbeknownst to the guys needs money to save the Down syndrome foundation's mansion that her brother currently attends. She organises for Jez and Dylan to get released on compassionate leave under the guise of attending the cremation of a relative . While the ceremony is ongoing, they sneak out and retrieve the money and return before the prison warders suspect a thing. With the money hidden in the coffin they accidentally send it to be cremated and are returned to prison completely despondent. It turns out to be a double con as Georgie retrieves the money and buys her exes \\"champion\\" horse only to learn that the horse is a dud. When the guys get out she comes clean and they hatch another plan which will see the horse win a big race allowing them to charge stud fees. Everything works out and the horse romps to victory (thanks to inserting helium in the jockeys outfit). Georgie agrees to sell the now champion horse back to her ex. With the proceeds all 3 agree to save the foundation and as they drive to the foundation broke, Jez and Dylan realise they have finally found their stately home.

Most filming took place at Shepperton Studios and outside street locations in north London. Alexandra Palace features in one notable scene. The gas holder in which Dylan and Jez live no longer exists, having been situated in Mill Hill East up to the early 2000s. The crematorium scene was filmed in Garston, west Hertfordshire. The film would eventually make its nationwide screening in October 1997. Reception The film held its own commercially in the UK. Reviews at the time singled out Townsend for praise but felt the narrative contained one twist and turn too many. Others suggested the film was merely an 'Ealing Comedy' in modern form and lacked modern characterization. The 'soft comedic focus' however had been a deliberate plan by the production team who wanted to avoid the socio-political realism in comedies like Brassed Off and The Full Monty.

The RPC was formed in 1931 by members of the ILP who were especially unhappy with the gradualist policies of the Second Labour Government (1929-1931). The RPC was founded by Jack Gaster, a lawyer and son of Moses Gaster, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of England, and Dr C.K. Cullen, a medical inspector from Poplar. The RPC was particularly active in London and its initial focus was on advocating the disaffiliation of the ILP from the Labour Party. After it achieved this aim, in 1932, the RPC sought to bring about closer cooperation between the ILP and the Communist Party of Great Britain, and advocated affiliation to the Comintern. In 1933 the RPC successfully persuaded the ILP to adopt the policy of merging with the Communist Party, although this was never followed through. Within the ILP the RPC increasingly came to be seen as a vehicle for Communist entryists and aroused strong feelings of hostility. In 1934 there was a split in the ILP as some opponents of the RPC, led by John Middleton Murry and Elijah Sandham, left to form the Independent Socialist Party. By 1935 the RPC's influence was waning and, following internal divisions about the appropriate response to the Abyssinian Crisis in 1935, the leading members of the RPC decided to wind it up, leave the ILP and join the Communist Party.

His composition Visions of Terror and Wonder won the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Career Wernick began his musical studies playing the piano at age 11. His high school music theory teacher took notice of his abilities, and introduced him to Irving Fine, who was a composition professor at Harvard University at the time.Cheifetz, Tori. \\"Never Compromise.\\" The Jerusalem Post. January 28, 2009, p. 24. Wernick went on to complete his undergraduate studies with Fine at Brandeis University. While at Brandeis, Wernick also studied with Harold Shapero, Arthur Berger, and Leonard Bernstein. His studies at Tanglewood included composition work with Ernst Toch, Aaron Copland, and Boris Blacher and conducting studies with Leonard Bernstein and Seymour Lipkin. Wernick also studied at Mills College with Leon Kirchner.Hirshberg, Jehoash. \\"Wernick, Richard.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Wernick worked as a theater, film, television, and dance composer. His output during this time includes the film score for the short comedy A Bowl of Cherries. Wernick spent much of his career as a composition professor, teaching at SUNY Buffalo (1964‚Äì1965) and the University of Chicago (1965‚Äì1968). However, his longest tenure was at the University of Pennsylvania, from 1968 to 1996. For his notable students, David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered Wernick's time at University of Pennsylvania, especially during the 1970s, to represent the height of his compositional influence as part of the University's composition \\"triumvirate\\" (Wernick, George Crumb, and George Rochberg).Stearns, David Patrick. \\"Philadelphia's Latest Generation of Emerging Composers\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer. May 2, 2010, p. H01 In 1983, Riccardo Muti selected Wernick to be the Consultant for New Music to the Philadelphia Orchestra. His role as advisor was to assist Muti in identifying new works for the Philadelphia Orchestra to perform, with a stated emphasis on American composers.Holland, Bernard. \\"Riccardo Muti Makes Music His Way\\". The New York Times. October 9, 1983, Arts and Leisure p. 1 He held this position until 1989, when he was re- appointed as Special Consultant to the Music Director. He continued until the end of Muti's tenure with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1993.Theodore Presser Company. \\"Wernick, Richard\\" Wernick won the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his composition Visions of Terror and Wonder. He won Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards in 1986 for his Violin Concerto (first place, tie with Bernard Rands), 1991 (first place, for String Quartet No. 4), and 1992 (second place, for Piano Concerto). He has also received awards from the Ford, Guggenheim and Naumburg foundations. (See also List of Awards below.) Wernick lives outside of Philadelphia with his wife, bassoonist Bea Wernick. His son Adam Wernick is a theatrical composer who has won several Helen Hayes Awards. His other son Lew Wernick is also a musician. Compositional style Wernick has described his style as one that attempts to find common ground with an audience: > My expectation is that I'm not writing down to an audience, but I'm not > trying to write above their heads. I'm not writing to an audience which is > illiterate and I'm not writing to an audience which is technically educated > in music, but I do write for an audience that I assume has experience in > listening to music and is willing to at least meet me halfway. So I'll go > halfway to meet them.\\"Duffie, Bruce. \\"Composer Richard Wernick: A > Conversation with Bruce Duffie\\", December 27, 1993 As such, critics have sometimes identified his style as more audience- accessible, particularly when compared to more strictly serialist composers of the 20th century.Horowitz, Joseph. \\"Wernick's 'Introits and Canons'\\". The New York Times. January 15, 1978, p. 47. Harmonic analysis of Wernick's work suggests that his style makes reference to tonal harmony, but is usually based on fixed cells of intervals. He occasionally makes use of twelve-tone sequences and their permutations, but this technique is not necessarily a defining feature of his output. Wernick also makes extensive use of contrapuntal techniques, especially in his string quartets. In vocal and programmatic works, Wernick's choice of texts often reflect an ideological message. Kaddish Requiem mourns \\"the victims of Indochina,\\" referring to the contemporaneous Vietnam War as well as to related violence throughout the region. Likewise, the final movement of his Duo for Cello and Piano is a memorial for the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001. Several of his works, most notably Kaddish Requiem and Visions of Terror and Wonder, combine religious texts from multiple traditions. Performers with whom Wernick has frequently worked include the Juilliard String Quartet, the Emerson String Quartet, David Starobin, Mstislav Rostropovich, Jan de Gaetani, Lambert Orkis, and Gregory Fulkerson.

Its major incentive was the emergence of increasingly large and complex conurbations, tending even to a worldwide city. The study involves every kind of human settlement, with particular attention to geography, ecology, human psychology, anthropology, culture, politics, and occasionally aesthetics. As a scientific mode of study, ekistics currently relies on statistics and description, organized in five ekistic elements or principles: nature, anthropos, society, shells, and networks. It is generally a more scientific field than urban planning, and has considerable overlap with some of the less restrained fields of architectural theory. In application, conclusions are drawn aimed at achieving harmony between the inhabitants of a settlement and their physical and socio-cultural environments.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Etymology The term 'ekistics' was coined by Constantinos Apostolos Doxiadis in 1942. The word is derived from the Greek adjective Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ more particularly from the neuter plural Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨. The ancient Greek adjective Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ meant: \\"concerning the foundation of a house, a habitation, a city or colony; contributing to the settling.\\" It was derived from Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ (oikistƒìs), an ancient Greek noun meaning \\"the person who installs settlers in place\\". This may be regarded as deriving indirectly from another ancient Greek noun, Œø·º¥Œ∫ŒπœÉŒπœÇ (oikisis), meaning \\"building\\", \\"housing\\", \\"habitation\\", and especially \\"establishment of a colony, a settlement , or a town\\" (already in Plato), or \\"filling with new settlers\\", settling\\", \\"being settled\\". All these words grew from the verb Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒØŒ∂œâ (oikiz≈ç), to settle and were ultimately derived from the noun Œø·º∂Œ∫ŒøœÇ (oikos), \\"house\\", \\"home\\" or \\"habitat\\". The shorter Oxford English Dictionary contains a reference to an ecist, oekist or oikist, defining him as: \\"the founder of an ancient Greek ... colony\\". The English equivalent of oikistikƒì is ekistics (a noun). In addition, the adjectives ekistic and ekistical, the adverb ekistically, and the noun ekistician are now also in current use. The French equivalent is √©kistique, the German √ñkistik, the Italian echistica (all feminine). Scope In terms of outdoor recreation, the term ekistic relationship is used to describe one's relationship with the natural world and how they view the resources with in it. The notion of ekistics implies that understanding the interaction between and within human groups‚Äîinfrastructure, agriculture, shelter, function (job) -- in conjunction with their environment directly affects their well-being (individual and collective). The subject begins to elucidate the ways in which collective settlements form and how they inter- relate. By doing so, humans begin to understand how they 'fit' into a species, i.e. Homo sapiens, and how Homo sapiens 'should' be living in order to manifest our potential‚Äîat least as far as this species is concerned (as the text stands now). Ekistics in some cases argues that in order for human settlements to expand efficiently and economically we must reorganize the way in which the villages, towns, cities, metropoli are formed. As Doxiadis put it ‚ÄúEkistics is a science, even if in our times it is usually considered a technology and an art, without the foundations of a science. This is a mistake for which we pay very heavily.‚Äù Having recorded very successfully the destructions of the ekistic wealth in Greece during WWII, Doxiadis became convinced that human settlements are subjectable to systematic investigation. Doxiadis being aware of the unifying power of systems thinking and particularly of the biological and evolutionary reference models as used by many famous biologists-philosophers of his generation, especially Sir Julian Huxley (1887‚Äì1975), Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900‚Äì75), Dennis Gabor (1900‚Äì79), Ren√© Dubos (1901‚Äì82), George G. Simpson (1902‚Äì84), and Conrad Waddington (1905‚Äì75), used the biological model to describe the \\"Ekistic behavior\\" of Anthropos (the five principles) and the evolutionary model to explain the morphogenesis of human settlements (the eleven forces, the hierarchical structure of human settlements, dynapolis, ecumenopolis). Finally, he formulated a general theory which considers human settlements as living organisms capable of evolution, an evolution that might be guided by Man using \\"Ekistic knowledge\\". Ekistic units Doxiadis believed that the conclusion from biological and social experience was clear: to avoid chaos we must organize our system of life from Anthropos (individual) to Ecumenopolis (global city) in hierarchical levels, represented by human settlements. So he articulated a general hierarchical scale with fifteen levels of Ekistic Units:Ekistic Units Names of Units and Population Scale (final version, from C.A.Doxiadis' last book, ACTION for Human Settlements, p. 186, Athens Center of Ekistics, 1976): Note: The population figures below are for Doxiadis' ideal future ekistic units for the year 2100 at which time he estimated (in 1968) that Earth would achieve zero population growth at a population of 50,000,000,000 with human civilization being powered by fusion energy.City of the Future *Anthropos ‚Äì 1 *room ‚Äì 2 *house ‚Äì 5 *housegroup (hamlet) ‚Äì 40 *small neighborhood (village) ‚Äì 250 *neighborhood ‚Äì 1,500 *small polis (town) ‚Äì 10,000 *polis (city) ‚Äì 75,000 *small metropolis ‚Äì 500,000 *metropolis ‚Äì 4 million *small megalopolis ‚Äì 25 million *megalopolis ‚Äì 150 million *small eperopolis ‚Äì 750 million *eperopolis ‚Äì 7.5 billion *Ecumenopolis ‚Äì 50 billion In comparison, the United Nations population estimate, for the year 2100, at a constant growth rate, Uganda would form a small eperopolis, with a population of about 1 billion people, in an area of about 250,000 km¬≤ (4600 people/km¬≤, comparable to greater Tokyo today). Publications International Journal of Ekistics and the New Habitat: the problems and science of human settlements, 1957 to 2006 (paper editions): 2007-2018, occasional scholarly books were published on Ekistics such as \\"Dangerous ideas in Planning\\" 2015. As of 2019, the new revised online journal formed its esteemed international Editorial Advisory Board and both updated the formal name of the journal to above, and began calling for papers on special issues, such as for a special issue on Turkey, and Urbanism. Ekistics is a book by Konstantinos Doxiadis, published 1968. (often titled Introduction to Ekistics ) Ekistics is also an academic periodical, overlapping the fields of human geography, environmental psychology, and the sciences of the built environment, published monthly by Athens Center of Ekistics, since 1957 until 2006Athens Center of Ekistics on JSTOR Ekistics and the United Nations \\"Habitat\\" The formation of the World Society for Ekistics (WSE) represented a global inclusive concern for how the sum of human settlements were developing world wide. This concern covered how well settlements provided for human and ecological amenity, and how their structures and systems are impacting on the planet. The study of settlements from an Ekistic theory perspective includes how they have been transitioning with the emergence of high technology smart systems (eg. Smart Cities, Smart Citizens), and their impact on climate. This global knowledge base of researchers and practitioners, have been valued by the United Nations in their global agenda on Habitat. Invited to UN Habitat III, Quito, Ecuador, October 2016, The Oceanic Group of the WSE, with headquarters in Melbourne Australia, Swinburne University of Technology, launched the development of the new online journal project of Ekistics. The WSE Oceanic Group were also invited to give a statement on Human Settlement matters to Habitat III. The WSE has maintained strong relationships with the UN with invitations to present and contribute at Habitat I (1976), Habitat II (1996), and its current program, UN Habitat III (2016+).

In the Gylfaginning section of the Prose Edda Brimir refers to a hall in the heavens for good souls following Ragnarok where \\"plenty of good drink\\" will be available for those who take pleasure in it. In stanza 9 of V√∂lusp√°, the first poem of the Poetic Edda, Brimir and Blain are both interpreted as alternate names for Ymir, although distinction between origin and issue is often difficult to discern in Norse mythology: :\\"Then all the Powers went to the thrones of fate, :the sacrosanct gods, and considered this: :who should form the lord of the dwarfs :out of Brimir's blood and from Blain's limbs?\\" : ::‚Äî Larrington trans. Quoted by Snorri in Gylfaginning, he expands upon this and tells us that the dwarves were created from the dead flesh of Ymir whose body was used by Odin and his brothers to form the earth (\\"Brimir's blood\\" referring to the sea and \\"Blain's limbs\\" referring to the mountains that were made from his bones). Stanza 37 of the same poem mentions Brimir as the name of a giant who may or may not be Ymir as the owner of a beer hall: :\\"To the north there stood on Dark-of-moon Plains :a hall of gold of the lineage of Sindri :and another stood on Never-cooled Plain, :the beer- hall of the giant who is called Brimir.\\" : ::‚Äî Larrington trans. Snorri used this stanza as his basis for Brimir as a hall in the afterlife in Gylfaginning but whether the two residences are identical is uncertain. References *Faulkes, Anthony (transl.) (1987).

Feed corn is grown at higher elevations farther inland. Sugar cane and several varieties of bananas grow in the wetland areas. Cash crops include coffee, cocoa and kola. Locally grown bamboo and piassava palm are widely used for construction, mats and baskets. Many tropical fruits, domestic and wild, grow in the region including oranges, limes, mangos, soursop, breadfruit and coconut. The people keep poultry, cattle, sheep and goats to supplement their diets and to use for their products; the animals are found in and around most villages. Most animals are of pygmy variety, as larger varieties die quickly due to the heat and humidity. Prior to the civil war, the region's extensive rainforests contained a wide variety of wildlife including wild pigs, bongo, dik-dik, pangolin, civet, pygmy hippo, African buffalo and colobus monkey, all of which are hunted for food and hides. Also found are snakes, and very small populations of forest elephants and leopards. The warfare disrupted their habitats; in addition, many animals were killed in the course of the war and their populations have fallen.

Function  Catwalks are used to suspend lighting instruments and microphones directed at the stage. The catwalks provide easy access for theater personnel to perform common tasks. For example, lights may need to be accessed for maintenance, position adjustment, or addition and removal of gels and gobos.  Placement  Typically, catwalks are located in positions hidden from audience view or directly above an audience, and are considered \\"behind-the-scenes\\". For example, many proscenium theaters have a series of two or more catwalks running parallel to the proscenium arch above a false ceiling. Stairs or a ladder up to the catwalks is usually located somewhere backstage. In modern theatres, many architects design catwalks into the \\"look\\" of the theatre. In black box theatres, catwalks and pipe grids may be the only architectural feature. A catwalk may also be placed upstage of the proscenium as part of the fly system. These may be fixed, or they may be able to be raised and lowered.  Construction  =Structural= A Hub Electric designed catwalk Most catwalks have several battens (pipes) that lighting fixtures may be attached to. Lights are usually attached by a C-Clamp or a hook clamp around the pipes. In addition to this primary attachment, fixtures generally have an additional safety cable attaching them to the catwalk, so that if the clamp or bolt gives way, the safety cable will catch the light. This is used because the lights are generally very expensive and heavy, but mainly to protect the audience members and performers from the possibility of fixtures falling down from the catwalks. Catwalks often include a platform for a spotlight operator to work from. =Electrical= A typical catwalk has a built in Electrical conduit to carry power for the lighting fixtures from the dimmers. They often hold other electrical wiring, for example standard sockets for tools, coaxial cable for projection and video monitors, built-in safety lighting to protect technicians, audio cables, and special cables for headset communications with other technicians. Safety Since a catwalk is usually placed high above the floor, spaces where lighting instruments can go are usually chained or otherwise blocked off when a light is not present to prevent people and/or objects from falling through. The instruments themselves are attached by a safety chain to prevent them from falling. Technicians normally attach objects (such as wrenches) to themselves before going onto the catwalk, so that such objects cannot fall and possibly injure someone or damage something. This also prevents objects from falling into a place where they cannot be retrieved, such as between the catwalk floor and the ceiling, or into an HVAC vent. Sometimes, to create better lighting positions or allow more flexibility, catwalks have minimal railings. Because of this, sometimes it is necessary for people working on them to wear fall arrest to satisfy safety requirements, as the railing cannot be considered sufficient.

It is located on the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad and on Illinois Route 72, approximately east of Exit 111 on Interstate 39. History The community known today as Fairdale was platted in 1875 or 1876 (sources differ) and was centered on the property of farmer Henry Koch. The community's original name was Fielding, apparently named for a man named Albert Fielding. Early buildings in Fielding included Lewis Keith's general merchandise store, L.W. King's drug store, and a Methodist church. A post office was first established in the community in 1875 under the name Wallace (which was the name of the son of Henry Koch). Eventually, the growth of the neighboring community of Kirkland outpaced the growth of Fielding (Fairdale), possibly due to Kirkland's coaling and watering station. The name of the community (Fielding) and the name of the post office (Wallace) were both changed to Fairdale in late 1895 or early 1896. (The post office eventually closed in 1953.) =2015 tornado= On April 9, 2015, the community was struck by an EF4 tornado, which caused two fatalities, numerous injuries, and significant damage to commercial and residential buildings. According to local authorities, 15 to 20 homes were destroyed, and almost all of the buildings in the town \\"sustained damage of some sort\\". Technical rescue teams from DeKalb and Rockford assisted in searching the collapsed buildings for survivors. Education By 1881, a school had been established in Fielding (Fairdale). By the early 1900s, a two- year high school had opened, and in 1924 it became a four-year high school. The high school closed in 1945, but the school building continued to serve as an elementary school for the Kirkland School District until 1967. Since that time, the community has been part of what is now Hiawatha Community Unit School District 426, with most students attending schools in neighboring Kirkland. As of 2018, the former school building was a private residence.

Ysleta was settled between October 9 and October 12, 1680, when Spanish conquistadors, Franciscan clerics and Tigua Indians took refuge along the southern bank of the Rio Grande. These people were fleeing the Pueblo Revolt in New Mexico. Ysleta is the oldest European settlement in the area that is the present-day U.S. state of Texas. History =Settlement= Antonio de Oterm√≠n, the Spanish Governor, placed Fray Francisco de Ayeta as administrator of the refugee camp of those fleeing Pop√©'s rebellion in 1680. The refugee camp and mission was placed approximately three miles south of the Rio Grande at the time. The Rio Grande was prone to both flooding and silt deposit.Nancy Hamilton, \\"Ysleta, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed June 29, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association =Resettlement= The settlement and associated mission moved several times over the next few hundred years. In 1691, the original refugee mission was replaced by an adobe structure. A flood in 1740 washed away that mission. It was rebuilt on higher ground four years later. The Tigua (i.e. Tiwa people) of Ysleta were among the most faithful Christian converts in the area and the Spanish were keen to keep the settlement healthy and vibrant. In the period between 1829 and 1831, the river moved much further south than usual. In 1836, the new country of Texas claimed the new channel of the Rio Grande as the boundary. In 1848, with the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Ysleta was ceded to the United States. The mission was a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail trail from 1858 to 1861. =The City of Ysleta= The neighboring community and county seat of San Elizario was a center of Hispanic influence in an increasing Anglo- dominated post-Civil War period. In 1873, Ysleta made a bid to become the county seat, but the elections were ignored or inconclusive until 1878, after the Salt War period. In response, the people of Ysleta incorporated as a Texas city in 1880. There were internal disputes as to whether the tax burden was worth the status as a city. There was also much opposition from the growing community of El Paso as to whether an \\"Indian\\" city should be the county seat. The railroad did not come to Ysleta, and in a strongly disputed election in which counted votes were nearly three times the number of voters, the county seat was moved to El Paso in 1883. The town government dissolved in 1895. =Fire= A chemical fire in 1907 damaged the Ysleta Mission. In 1916, the Rio Grande was dammed and the area was heavily irrigated. The resulting rise in the water table brought salt to the surface and the land became suitable for only salt- tolerant crops such as cotton. =Annexation= In 1955, El Paso annexed Ysleta, although residents voted against the change. Ysleta was allowed to keep its own school district (which extends from the lower Valley into parts of Northeast El Paso), although that required an appeal to the Supreme Court. =Tiwa Revival= In the 1960s, Tom Diamond sued on the behalf of the Tiwa (known as the Tigua tribe in Spanish). The state of Texas was reluctant to recognize any Native American tribes, but in 1967 the Tiguas were formed legally as the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo. The next year, the United States Congress also recognized the tribe. Education Residents are served by the Ysleta Independent School District.

Pierre Remond de Montmort, ( not Raymond) a French mathematician, was born in Paris on 27 October 1678, and died there on 7 October 1719. His name was originally just Pierre Remond. His father pressured him to study law, but he rebelled and travelled to England and Germany, returning to France in 1699 when, upon receiving a large inheritance from his father, he bought an estate and took the name de Montmort. He was friendly with several other notable mathematicians, and especially Nicholas Bernoulli, who collaborated with him while visiting his estate. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1715, while traveling again to England, and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1716. De Montmort is known for his book on probability and games of chance, Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard, which was also the first to introduce the combinatorial study of derangements. He is also known for naming Pascal's triangle after Blaise Pascal, calling it \\"Table de M. Pascal pour les combinaisons.\\" Another of de Montmort's interests was the subject of finite differences. He determined in 1713 the sum of n terms of a finite series of the form :na + \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{1\\\\cdot 2} \\\\Delta a + \\\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot 3} \\\\Delta^2 a +\\\\cdots, where Œî is the forward difference operator, a theorem which seems to have been independently rediscovered by Goldbach in 1718.

The glued box joint has a high glued surface area resulting in a strong bond, on a similar principle to a finger joint. Box joints are used for corners of boxes or box-like constructions, hence the name. The joint does not have the same interlocking properties as a dovetail joint, but is much simpler to make, and can be mass- produced fairly easily. Creation Box joints are generally created by using the same profile but displaced for both halves. In modern workshops these are often made on table saws,https://www.woodcraft.com/blog_entries/box-joint- basics sometimes using dado-cutters. Custom machinery can cut the entire joint in one pass, using a suitable jig multiple pieces, even of opposing senses, can be cut at once. They were traditionally produced manually using a tenon saw and chisel, and fine cabinet makers still use these methods. Jigs can also be used, as with dovetails, to help produce a consistent result. Applications Box joint detail from the lid of an Enigma machine Applications include all sorts of wooden boxes and carcasses.

It was the launchpad for the global Twist craze in the early 1960s. Many claim The Peppermint Lounge was also where go-go dancing originated, although this claim is subject to dispute. Original Peppermint Lounge The Peppermint Lounge opened in 1958 at 128 West 45th Street in Manhattan. It had a lengthy mahogany bar running along one side, many mirrors and a dance floor at the back, a capacity of just 178 people, and a gay clientele. As the Twist craze hit in 1960‚Äì1961, celebrities swarmed into the Peppermint Lounge - Audrey Hepburn, Truman Capote, Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Liberace, No√´l Coward, Frank Sinatra, Norman Mailer, Annette Funicello, even the elusive Greta Garbo - to dance to the house band, Joey Dee and the Starliters. Jackie Kennedy was such an enthusiast that she arranged for a temporary \\"Peppermint Lounge\\" to be mounted in the White House. One such event even took place at a meeting of the austere Council of the Organization of American States. A sister club was opened in Miami Beach. The proprietor Ralph Saggesse appeared as a contestant on What's My Line? in 1961. During 1961, Paramount Pictures filmed the movie Hey, Let's Twist!, a fictional story of Dee and the Peppermint Lounge starring Jo Ann Campbell and Teddy Randazzo. At the end of the year, the Starliters' \\"Peppermint Twist\\" became a hit, spending three weeks at No. 1 in January 1962. This brought the club wide recognition, reinforced later in the year by Sam Cooke's \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\" which, while not mentioning the club by name, was about \\"a place/Somewhere up a New York way/Where the people are so gay\\". The movie and soundtrack album also did their part in making the Peppermint Lounge a world- famous venue. Successful singles spawned from Hey, Let's Twist! were the title track and \\"Shout ‚Äì Part I\\". Other albums released during this time were Doin' the Twist at the Peppermint Lounge, which was recorded live at the venue, and All the World's Twistin' with Joey Dee & the Starliters. The Beatles were filmed visiting the club during their first U.S. visit in 1964. Artists who performed at the Peppermint Lounge include the Beach Boys, the Ronettes (who made their professional debut here in 1961), the Crystals, the Isley Brothers, Chubby Checker, the Younger Brothers, Liza Minnelli and the Four Seasons. In the mid‚Äë1960s, the house band was the Wild Ones. The Denos, a traveling roadhouse band, were another featured act. Members of the Starliters later went on to form the Young Rascals. Both the NYC and Miami clubs were sold in 1965. The New York club was run by Genovese crime family captain Matty \\"The Horse\\" Ianniello, who managed numerous gay bars and strip clubs in Manhattan. It closed when it lost its liquor license on December 28, 1965. Hollywood The 128 West 45th Street venue reopened as a gay bar called \\"Hollywood\\", most notable for the 1970s DJ residency of Richie Kaczor, who went on to great success at Studio 54. G. G. Barnum's Room The 45th Street space reopened as G. G. Barnum's Room on July 20, 1978, and continued until November 1980.History of Gay Clubs in New York, with pictures of the outsides of the clubs: Male go-go dancers performed on trapezes over a net above the dance floor.Miezitis, Vida Night Dancin' New York:1980 Ballantine (Photography by Bill Bernstein) \\"G.

Barnum's Room was a popular meeting place for transsexuals, drag queens and homosexuals. The \\"G.G.\\" was a reference to the Ianniello-owned Gilded Grape located at 719 8th Avenue, a notorious gay bar which operated from the early 1970s until 1977. Second Peppermint Lounge In November 1980, after G. G. Barnum's closed, the Peppermint Lounge name was revived for a new music night club run by Frank Roccio and Tom Goodkind. The DJ was David Azarc. The club featured top international music acts from both alternative rock and the burgeoning hip hop scenes. Some of the regular featured acts were the Cramps, X, the Raybeats, the Go-Gos, Marshall Crenshaw, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Billy Idol, Afrika Bambaataa, the Bangles, the Waitresses and Joan Jett. VIP guests such as Mick Jagger and David Bowie added to the club's cachet. In March 1981, Yoko Ono visited the club in one of her first public appearances after the death of John Lennon, personally delivering a copy of their last single, \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\". In 1982, the Peppermint Lounge moved downtown to 100 5th Avenue, where it continued for several years before closing in 1985. The building at 128 West 45th Street was torn down in the mid-1980s. Racketeering case In 1986, Judge Edward Weinfeld sentenced Ianniello to six years in prison on a racketeering charge that involved skimming over $2 million from bars and restaurants (including Umberto's Clam House, the Peppermint Lounge and a topless bar called the Mardi Gras, all in Manhattan) secretly owned by Ianniello, his business partner Benjamin Cohen and seven associates.

Refugee and Migrant Justice also lobbied on behalf of cases both individually and collectively, and was concerned with monitoring public policy in the area of asylum. Background Refugee and Migrant Justice was founded in 1992 to be a centre for the provision of quality legal representation for those seeking protection under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and those who feared breaches of their human rights. The roots of the Refugee Legal Centre went back to the Refugee Unit of the UK Immigration Advisory Service, which was founded in 1976Refugee and Migrant Justice goes into administration as a legal assistance project for asylum seekers funded by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. As well as asylum seekers, RMJ represented unaccompanied children, and women trafficked into the sex industry. Governance Refugee and Migrant Justice was a registered charity. The quality of its work was subject to the regulations of the Legal Services Commission and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner. It was governed by an independent Board of Trustees, who were: * President: Professor Guy Goodwin-Gill, Fellow of All Souls College, University of Oxford * Chairman: Charles Morland * CEO: Caroline Slocock * Yemane Tsegai * Andrew Hutchinson * John Humpston * Hilary Pinder * Ruth Bundey * Annie Ledger Awards In 2005, Refugee and Migrant Justice was given a human rights award from Liberty, Justice and the Law Society for 'consistent and fearless use of the law to protect human rights and hold immigration and asylum policies up to the scrutiny of the courts'. Funding and closure Refugee and Migrant Justice was funded through a contract with the Legal Services Commission and by a relatively small level of donations. In 2009/10 it had annual income of ¬£15 million, and was the second-largest recipient of legal aid. The Ministry of Justice had implemented reforms to the legal aid system, introducing fixed-fee payments in 2007 followed by a transition to payment only on completion of each case. With some cases being protracted and therefore unpaid for up to two years, the amount owed to RMJ by the Commission escalated to ¬£2 million, precipitating a funding crisis. On 16 June 2010, Refugee & Migrant Justice was placed in administration, from which it did not recover. An emergency public appeal raised ¬£76,000 within 24 hours, but this was insufficient to rescue RMJ, and donations were returned. RMJ's 300 staff lost their jobs and 9,000 current clients were left without representation. The Legal Services Commission made arrangements for RMJ's clients to be transferred to new advisers within six weeks, and the Home Office said that they would not be disadvantaged by the transfer. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke claimed that RMJ's collapse was not due to delayed payments, but to RMJ's failure to improve efficiency as other providers had done.

The game was developed by Black Hole Entertainment, published by Cinergi Interactive and distributed by Electronic Arts. One unique aspect of the game is that it has an underground mode. This makes the game more challenging as the player has to work on two fronts and might have an army come from an unexpected area. In October 2006, EA shut down the online servers for the game.  Gameplay  The gameplay appears to be very similar to Warcraft III, especially considering the factions involved: The Empire (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, etc.), the Beasts (Lizardmen and other barbaric humanoid creatures), and the Fallen (Undead and eldritch monsters). The player has to gather resources (gold, wood, and gems) to produce units and buildings, as well as to research spells and upgrades. The player can also select units and give them orders to attack, move or build. Different unit types are built at different structures. It follows the \\"old-school\\" style of RTS gameplay that was commonplace in the 1990s in titles such as Warcraft II, StarCraft and the Age of Empires series. Leveling system A unit can gain levels in the game through killing enemy units and so gather experience points. By gaining a level a unit becomes stronger. Almost all units in the game can level up to level 5 except for mechanical units, phoenixes and most of the spell-caster units. The Empire and The Beast units level individually and The Fallen as collective by gathering experience points in their Soul Trap.The game guide that comes with the game Characters Alric do Rei He is a young mage of the Obsidian Tower. His master dies just before the Beasts' invasion begins, so Alric has no other choice but to take his master's place as High Lord of the Council of Mages, an organization of powerful wizards who govern Noran. It seems that only his visions and knowledge of spells can save the Empire from total annihilation and he's also often called \\"Chaosbringer\\", because of his \\"defence\\" of Castle Margoth, which ended up destroying not just most of the armies of the Beast Invaders, but the castle itself as well. He has the habit of surviving the most dangerous situations with ease, an ability which greatly angers his enemies, particularly his nemesis, Keran Kessertin. Dunehelm Bellangere He's in command of Noran's garrison and he's the Lord of Castle Margoth, as well as Alric's best friend and disciple. He is very brave as he faces every kind of hideous creatures without any fear, and he never loses his mind. He gets great importance in the story when a rebelling lord, Vangarath captures Alric, and he has to liberate the wizard. Ruannon Flamebringer A wizard who died ages ago and is considered the greatest wizard of the Obsidian Tower. Alric do Rei, as stated by Lord Keran, is largely like Ruannon and therefore can be his true successor and ultimately the person ending the menace of the Fallen race. Ruannon, in his lifetime, fought the Fallen several times and uncovered much of their dark plans. He defeated the Two Fathers of the Fallen and sealed them away in the Chamber of Screams. He discovered the true nature of the Heart of the Void, a stone which the Fallen can use to melt the world, in which the stone resides, into their own dark plane of existence and crafted the Three Seals, which prevent the Stone from working and as a last line of defense constructed, using mostly only his vast amounts of magical power, the Obsidian Tower and founded the Council of Mages to guard the Stone and the Order of Ruannon to watch over the Seals and the Chamber of Screams. After his death, his remains where buried in an elven forest. Decades later, Princess Domina promises him to release his soul if he agrees to tell her the location of the seals, and Ruannon, without a second of hesitation agrees to comply, greatly easing the work of the Fallen. Keran Kessertin The leader chanter of the Fallen Swarms, who obeys the Ageless Ones, the leader of the Fallen. His quest is to seize the Heart of the Void, an artifact that was created by the Dark Dreamer in order to melt this world into their own. To complete this mission, he first disguises himself as a wizard of the Empire and sends Alric to Castle Margoth, hoping he will be killed in the fighting. Greatly amused by Alric's survival, he tries yet again to remove Alric from his way by sending him to his own domain, where to he, in Alric's absence, invited several Warlords in order to craft an Alliance against the Beast Invaders. Alric is captured by Lord Vangarath when he visits him to prove he's still alive. Dunehelm Bellangere and Lady Tierna finally free him after a long battle and while doing so also quell the rebellion. Alric, convinced that Lord Keran is a betrayer, questions him in the great hall of the Council of Mages. Keran, seeing no way out of the situation, transforms into his horrifying Voidwalker form and quickly teleports away from the place. He returns to the Underworld, only to find that the Ageless Ones are greatly disappointed by his failures, claiming that all the long years of careful planning and scheming were just a waste of time. The Ageless Ones order him to reunite the Fallen Swarms. Eagerly awaiting for a chance to show that he can still be of use, he takes the mission and successfully reestablishes control over the Hive Queens. Reaffirmed in Keran's abilities, he's ordered by the Ageless Ones to open the First Seal of Ruannon, which seals away the power of the Heart of the Void. He successfully gets to the Ice Cavern in Teonia, eliminating most of the Teonian Knights during his march. Within the depths of the Ice Cavern he breaks the First Seal. He's granted a boon for his success, the Dark Dreamer, Overlord of his Homeworld decides to transform him into an Avatar of his will. In the meantime, Alric meets the Order of Ruannon, who claim to have a dark lore, to face the threat posed by Keran. Alric gains the aid of the Order of Ruannon, and two Disciples of Ruannon erect two Firewall which destroy any Fallen that pass through it, cornering the Fallen in the Ice Cave. During his transformation, Keran's forces defend him and he finishes his metamorphosis just in time. With his newfound power, he easily repels the Empire's attacks, and by passing through the Firewall, he proves that he has become immune to Ruannon's lore. He proceeds and kills the two Disciples, destroys the Firewalls and his army destroys all opposition. He returns to the Underworld, but everything is changed, the Dark Dreamer's boon amuses the Ageless Ones and he takes firm leadership of the Fallen Swarm. While Vangarath is breaking the Second Seal, he heads directly to the Field of Sorrows, where the Beast and Empire armies are battling each other. By summoning forth the Beholder from the Dimensional Gates he easily annihilates them both and then Domina and two of her Matriarchs destroy the Third Seal. Killing off most of the magi of the Order of Ruannon who try to prevent the breaking of the Third Seal, he heads to the Chamber of Screams located nearby and with little to no effort undoes the trap that holds the Two Father of the Fallen captives. Keran becomes overconfident and proclaims his and the Fallen's inevitably victory. As an Alliance is forged between the Beast and Empire forces to face the Fallen threat, Keran orders Vangarath to keep this \\"marriage of fools\\" entertained, while he and the Two Fathers move to invade Wermona, capital of Noran in order to seize the Obsidian Tower and with it, the Heart of the Void. Although Keran succeeds in doing so, Vangarath fails and is killed by Alric and Dragga. Alric and Dragga then march to the Obsidian Tower only to find that the ceremony of fusing this world into that of the fallen's has already begun. Dragga, ignoring Alric's warning rushes to the Heart of the Void and kills one of the Two Fathers, but is handcuffed to the floor by a powerful spell. Alric arrives and successfully eliminates the other Father and tries to destroy Keran himself as well. His powers, vastly alike to that of Ruannon's fail against Keran and Alric is killed, though not before dispelling Dragga's handcuffs, who then proceeds to destroy the Heart of the Void. The story ends with Keran staring at the remains of the Heart of the Void, most probably unable to realize or accept his defeat. His fate from that moment on is unknown. Inquisitor Belloq The leader of the Holy Legion, which is the most effective and well-equipped part of the Empire's army. He is jealous, vain and confident, as he keeps himself the most heroic army leader. He is such descended that he calls underworld demons into arms for his crusade's succession. He is finally killed by Tyron Gral's army for a stolen talisman. Lord Vangarath Formerly a lord of one of the Noran's counties, he rebels against the council and captures Alric. Alric is then freed by Dunehelm Bellangre and Lady Tierna. Defeated, it is revealed that he is one of the Fallens' elite chanters, though he manages to escape. Later on, he rediscovers a Dimensional Gate, which allows vastly more powerful creatures of their own dark plane of existence to enter this world. He's then ordered by the Ageless Ones to break the Second Seal of Ruannon. Compared to the First and Third Seals, he breaks the Second Seal with relative ease. As an Alliance is forged between the Beast and Empire forces to face the Fallen threat, Keran orders Vangarath to keep this \\"marriage of fools\\" entertained, while he and the Two Fathers move to invade Wermona, capital of Noran in order to seize the Obsidian Tower and with it, the Heart of the Void. Although Keran succeeds in doing so, Vangarath fails and is killed by Alric and Dragga. Princess Domina Princess of the Dark Elves, a society of elves, banished under the ground. They evolved to match their new environment. They have light, pale skin and have turned to dark magics, particularly Necromancy. Decades after their banishment, Domina is a young princess of the Dark Elves and is at war with Lord Shaiton, who seeks to seize the Throne from her. Keran meets her during his quest to seize the stolen Hive Queen from a group of Dark Elves. Domina tells Keran of her aims and reveals that Shaiton abducted the Hive Queen in order to gain advantage over Domina and defeat her. Domina offers her help to recapture the Queen and asks Keran to, in return, kill Shaiton. Lord Keran accepts and a temporary alliance is forged. Together they reclaim the Hive Queen and kill Shaidon. Domina then asks the Ageless Ones to let her join their campaign against the surface dwellers. She claims that she has the means to discover the location of the Three Seals, by seeking out Ruannon's soul and simply contact him, as she can speak the language of the dead. Having no better plan, the Ageless Ones give her a chance and control over the Hive Army. By combining the Dark Elf and the Hive armies, she massacres the underground city of the dwarves and undoes the Stone Gate which seals the Underworld away from the land above. She claims that it was the Elves, who imprisoned her race under the ground, and driven by great anger, kills a great number of Elves and converts them to an army of skeletal servants. She then fights her way to the Tomb of Ruannon and summons the wizard's soul. Domina promises him to release his soul if he agrees to tell her the location of the seals, and Ruannon, without a second of hesitation agrees to comply. Although she does not directly participate in battle for a long time from that point on, she does continue to send reinforcements to Lord Keran to help him in his quest for the First Seal, particularly the horrifying Avenger, towering abominations, who act as living siege weapons. Later into the story she accompanies Keran to the Field of Sorrows, where Keran, after carefully examining the Seal, tells Domina that it is of elven magic, and it will take him a plenty of time to break it. Domina laughs at Keran and reminds him that she's of elven blood as well, and she can helps Keran break the Third Seal. Keran claims that for her help, she'll be rewarded greatly by the Dark Dreamer. She successfully breaks the Seal and disappears from the story. What happened to her after that is unknown. Tyron Gral The master chieftain of the Beast. He keeps himself a messiah as he receives visionic messages from the Ancient Spirits. He is cruel and harsh, even with his own people. There is no other reason for his life than annihilating the humans and the elves, no matter what it costs. He thinks that the existence of the Fallen is just a myth, so he doesn't deal with it. He is killed by the queen of the lizardmen because of his aggressive wills. Dragga Tyron's son, who is loyal to his father at first, but as he faces the threatening danger of the Fallen that Tyron doesn't deal with, he turns against him. He joins his forces with Alric and the Empire's forces to defeat the Fallen together. As his father dies, he becomes the new chieftain. At the end of the game, he kills the chanters who want to release the power of the Heart of the Void, including Lord Kerran. Sseeth The chieftain of the lizardmen, the old allies of the Beast. He is wise and he supports Dragga's will instead of Tyron.

He is known mainly for Tower of Babel. Bunner's works have been praised by librarians for its \\" technical dexterity, playfulness and smoothness of finish \\". Biography Henry Cuyler Bunner was born in Oswego, New York to Rudolph Bunner, Jr. (1813‚Äì1875) and Ruth Keating Tuckerman (1821‚Äì1896) and was educated in New York City. His paternal grandparents were Rudolph Bunner (1779‚Äì1837) and Elizabeth Church (1783‚Äì1867), the daughter of John Barker Church (1748‚Äì1818) and Angelica Schuyler (1756‚Äì1814). In 1886, he published a novel, The Midge, followed in 1887 by The Story of a New York House.

His verses Airs from Arcady and Elsewhere (1884), containing the well-known poem, The Way to A ready; Rowen (1892); and Poems (1896), edited by his friend Brander Matthews, displaying a light play of imagination and a delicate workmanship. He also wrote clever vers de soci√©t√© and parodies. One of his several plays (usually written in collaboration), was The Tower of Babel (1883). His short story Zenobia's Infidelity was made into a feature film called Zenobia starring Harry Langdon and Oliver Hardy by the Hal Roach Studio in 1939.

The Faculty of Actuaries was one of two actuarial bodies in the UK, the other was the Institute of Actuaries, which was a separate body in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. While the Faculty of Actuaries and the Institute of Actuaries were separate institutions, they worked very closely together, and the professional qualifications and professional standards for actuaries were identical in each of them. On 25 May 2010, voting members of the Faculty who took part in a ballot voted to merge the Faculty with the Institute of Actuaries, thus creating the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which came into being on 1 August 2010, superseding the Institute of Actuaries which ceased to exist on that date. Establishment of the Faculty of Actuaries The Faculty of Actuaries was founded by 38 Scottish actuaries on 4 January 1856 with the aim of representing the interests of actuaries practicing in Scotland. In September 1868, the Faculty of Actuaries became the first actuarial organisation to be granted a royal charter. The Royal Charter confirmed the Faculty's role and the right to confer qualifications, i.e. the Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries (FFA). Since then there has been an underpinning concept of professional behaviour and the implicit right, or even duty, to discipline members who did not conduct themselves appropriately. Over the last two decades the Faculty workeded closer and closer with its sister body the Institute of Actuaries and, prior to the merger of the two bodies, reached a stage where almost all aspects of both bodies were run jointly; for example whilst Maclaurin House in Edinburgh was the home of Faculty Council the main purpose of the executive in Maclaurin House is to provide professional regulation services to all members of the UK Actuarial Profession. In November 2006 the incoming President of the Faculty announced his intention to investigate whether or not the time was now right to restructure to reflect the reality of the arrangements between the Faculty and the Institute and to move towards merger of the two bodies. After investigation and consultation of the issues Faculty Council elected to actively pursue merger with the Institute. On 17 March 2008 a group of 10 members of the Faculty requisitioned a Special General Meeting which was duly held on 16 April 2008. Of the 137 voters; ‚Ä¢ 61% supported a resolution to explore improved co-operation in the joint governance of the bodies and as part of this to consider annually renewable delegations ‚Ä¢ 58% supported a resolution directing Council to arrange detailed consultation with the membership; and ‚Ä¢ 53% suggested a resolution directing Council to cancel the proposed in principle vote and instead to put to members a range of options and to facilitate a single transferable vote. As a result, in late 2008 both the Faculty and Institute arranged a survey of the whole membership to ascertain their view in principle on a merger between the two bodies. At the closing date on 8 August 2008 some 1,366 Faculty members voted on this in principle survey with 65% of those voting supporting merger, whilst 6,928 Institute members voted of which 84% supported a merger. The Faculty and the Institute continues, in line with the majority vote, to continue to work up proposals for merger. However, a formal opposition group, FIDELIS ‚Äî The Actuarial Defence Group (), was formed in November 2008 by several members including Past Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the two bodies to oppose the merger. A formal vote on the combined merger, name change and new charter was held on 23 July 2009, when the Faculty vote passed the required threshold but the Institute vote failed. Following extensive consultation with members of both the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries, a revised merger proposal was put to members on 25 May 2010. Voting members of the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries voted to merge the bodies to form the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. After approval by the Privy Council, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries came into being on 1 August 2010. Examinations This section is out of date and requires significant revisions. Qualification through the Faculty consisted of a combination of examinations and courses. The examinations could only be taken upon having officially joined the body, unlike many other countries where exams may be taken earlier; although a candidate was able to offer proof of having previously covered topics (usually while at University) in order to be exempt from taking certain subjects. The examinations were split into four sections: Core Technical (CT), Core Applications (CA), Specialist Technical (ST), and Specialist Applications (SA). Study material for the examinations was usually obtained through the official bookshop of the Faculty of Actuaries eShop, The Actuarial Profession's bookshop or through the Actuarial Education Company (ActEd),Acted The Actuarial Education Company a subsidiary of BPP Actuarial Education Ltd. In addition to examinations and courses, it was required that the candidate both complete at least three years work as an actuary and be at least 23 years of age to qualify as a \\"Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries\\" (FFA) Becoming a student, Actuarial Profession, Faculty and Institute of Actuaries =Core examinations= The Core Technical section consisted of the 8 exams and a \\"Business Awareness Module,\\" CT9. These were usually first sat by a candidate and included the underlying mathematics involved in actuarial work as well as an introduction to financial and economic issues. These were also the most common exams for which candidates may get exemptions. While these were the first exams, candidates coming from a less mathematical background often found these more difficult than the later ones due to the mathematical theory content. Topics covered included annuities, stochastic modelling, time series, and triangles. The Core Applications section consisted of two exams and a modeling course, CA2, that focus on the application of concepts learned, especially to insurance companies. This included the communications model, CA3, which tested the candidate on their ability to communicate complex actuarial concepts to others. =Specialist examinations= The Specialist Technical section represented the first time the candidate has a choice of which exams to take. The candidate chose two from the various actuarial specialist subjects i.e. Health and Care, Life Insurance, General Insurance, Pensions, Finance or Investments and further technical knowledge on said subjects is attained. The Specialist Applications section allowed the candidate to choose one area for which they take the SA paper and attain full Fellowship; leading to many referring to this as the \\"Fellowship paper.\\" However, as the rules on the ordering of examinations were relaxed, this examination may be taken before taking some earlier examinations resulting in candidates qualifying on other papers.

Depending on the University, a different number of courses may be recognised for exemption. The examinations and the exemption pass level for the examinations is usually externalised by members of the Faculty and/or Institute of Actuaries. Naturally, the quality of the courses and lecturing at these universities are a determinant as to whether the course is recognised by the Faculty of Actuaries. Most universities offering actuarial science courses also require the student in addition to complete various other related topics, including statistics, mathematics, applied mathematics, economics and accounting for recognition of an actuarial degree. Upon completion of the university degree, students would then complete all remaining examinations through the Faculty of Actuaries to qualify as an actuary and become a Fellow of the Faculty of Actuaries(FFA). Universities offering accredited actuarial courses include: * AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, AUSTRALIA * BULAWAYO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ZIMBABWE * DUBLIN CITY UNIVERSITY, IRELAND * CASS BUSINESS SCHOOL, ENGLAND * CITY UNIVERSITY, ENGLAND * HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY (EDINBURGH), SCOTLAND * IMPERIAL COLLEGE (LONDON) TANAKA BUSINESS SCHOOL, ENGLAND * LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, ENGLAND * MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY (SYDNEY), AUSTRALIA * NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE * NORTH WEST UNIVERSITY (POTCHEFSTROOM), SOUTH AFRICA * QUEENS UNIVERSITY BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND * STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY, SOUTH AFRICA * SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, WALES * UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA * UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, IRELAND * UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN, IRELAND * UNIVERSITY OF KENT AT CANTERBURY, ENGLAND * UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA * UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER, ENGLAND * UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA * UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES (SYDNEY), AUSTRALIA * UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA * UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA (UiTM), MALAYSIA * UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND * UNIVERSITY OF THE FREE STATE (BLOEMFONTEIN), SOUTH AFRICA * UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND (JOHANNESBURG), SOUTH AFRICA Other qualifications recognised by the Faculty of Actuaries for exemption from certain examinations included: * ACCA Qualification * Chartered Financial Analyst (formerly membership of the Association for Investment Management and Research) * Fellowship of the Chartered Insurance Institute * Fellowship of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants * Fellowship of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales * Fellowship of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland * MBA Membership Categories In total there were approximately 2500 members of the Faculty of Actuaries falling into the following categories. Membership data, Actuarial Profession, Faculty and Institute of Actuaries * Student actuaries who are members of the Faculty who are taking exams; * Associates are members who had completed both the CT and CA subjects and had completed one year's worth of relevant work-based skills experience; * Affiliates were members of the Faculty of Actuaries who were kept up-to-date with the developments within the Actuarial Profession through publications and were able to participate in meetings, research and conferences; * Fellows were full members of the Faculty who had met the training demands by both completing all the examinations and meeting the work experience requirements. Fellows had the right to call themselves 'Actuaries'.

It is used by very few passengers (as low as 1, 404 in 2018-19), but provides a commuter service for the workers at the nearby Springfields Westinghouse nuclear fuel production complex. Trains do not call at Salwick on Sundays. Modernisation The modernisation and electrification of the Preston to Blackpool North line, and hence the station was announced in December 2009. The modernisation included rebuilding and raising the road bridge in the station vicinity for necessary electrification clearance and completely new signalling of the entire line along with rationalisation of the lines and removal of the spur into the nuclear facility nearby. The removal of the signal box along with four others along the line was included as part of the works.

It is overlooked by the dramatic mountain terrain of the 'Braes of Balquhidder', at the head of Loch Voil. Balquhidder Glen is also popular for fishing, nature watching and walking. History =Middle Ages= St Angus came to Balquhidder Glen in the 8th or 9th century and recognised what the Celts called a \\"thin place\\" where the boundary between Earth and Heaven was close. He knelt and blessed the glen at the spot where the house \\"Beannach Aonghais\\" (Gaelic 'blessing of Angus') now stands and built a stone oratory at Kirkton, where he spent the rest of his life. Angus was the first to bring Christianity to Balquhidder. Balquhidder lies close to the Highland boundary and thus came earlier into the nominal ownership of lords possessing charters issued by the royal court in Edinburgh. The parish became crown land from 1436. Crown charters could mean nothing if not accepted by the people on the ground. Stewart of Baldorran was appointed baillie for the crown lands of Balquhidder in 1488 and his descendents remained. In 1500 and 1511, the parish was granted to court favourites. In 1475, James III appointed Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, as his Lieutenant, responsible for \\"good order\\" in areas which included Argyll & Lorn and, among other territories, Balquhidder. This authority was repeated by the crown for the Earl‚Äôs successors in 1504, 1525 and 1549. By 1500, the Stewarts of Appin had become bound as vassals to the Earl of Argyll. In 1566, John Stewart, 5th of Appin signed bonds of manrent giving his allegiance to Colin Campbell of Glenorchy. The descendants of a \\"Bishop Laurancii\\" or Labhruinn were recorded at Kildonan, Ardchattan on the North Shore of Loch Etive in 1420. These ‚Äòdescendents of Laurence‚Äô acquired the Gaelic name mhic Labhruinn (pronounced VicLaurin‚Äù = MacLaurin), thus recalling their descent from a well known and probably respected clergyman. The Earls of Argyll settled people amenable to their authority, as they did elsewhere, often supplanting the earlier inhabitants. Thus, it appears probable that both the MacGregors and MacLaren/MacLaurin lineage from Appin were introduced to Balquhidder and other locations in Perthshire, around Loch Tay, as the result of Campbell expansion. The first documentary record of both MacLarens and MacGregors in Balquhidder was in the rentals for Invernentie in 1512. The idea of the Clan MacLaren having been in Balquhidder since the 9th century was a myth invented by James Logan and Donald MacLaurin in 1845 and printed in MacIan's \\"Costumes of the Clans\\". http://glendiscovery.com/the_clans_of_balquhidder.htmlhttp://clanmclaurin.org =Early modern era= The Reverend Robert Kirk, who translated parts of the Gaelic Bible and wrote The Secret Commonwealth, also lived here for several years from 1664.Henderson, Lizanne; Edward J. Cowan (2001). Scottish Fairy Belief: A History. Dundurn Press Ltd. . Rob Roy lived and died in Balquhidder. After his principal creditor, James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose seized his lands, Rob Roy waged a private blood feud against the duke until 1722, when he was forced to surrender. Later imprisoned, he was finally pardoned in 1727. He died in his house at Inverlochlarig Beg, Balquhidder, on 28 December 1734.Louis Albert Necker, A voyage to the Hebrides, or western isles of Scotland;: with observations ..., p.80 Glen Buckie, now a quiet backwater on the south side of Balquhidder Glen was the scene of one of the last acts of the 1745 Jacobite rising. Dr Archibald \\"Archie\\" Cameron of Locheil had returned to Scotland in the early 1750s hoping to raise support for a possible last-ditch coup against George II. He was captured in the glen, and was later hanged in London, the last Jacobite to be executed for treason. Balquhidder today Rob Roy's Grave.Postcard c.1910-1920 The local kirkyard is the final resting place of Rob Roy; his grave is marked with the appropriately defiant motto 'MacGregor Despite Them'. He lies with the remains of his wife and two sons, the graves marked by three flat stones. One of these is contemporary, but the remaining two are re-used medieval grave monuments. Behind the present kirk is Tom nan Angeae, the hill of fire, where until the 19th-century hearth fires were renewed at Beltane and Samhain to encourage ancient gods to bring warmth to the land. St Angus was buried at the foot of this hill and a flagstone laid over him which stands today in the present church. This stone, formerly in the floor of the medieval church, has a crudely incised figure of a priest holding a chalice. The carving is probably late medieval in date. There are some foundations of the east end of the small medieval parish church of Balquhidder around the grave of Rob Roy and his family (which seem deliberately to have been buried at the site of its altar). A few metres to the west are the roofless ruins of this building's 17th-century successor. The present church, built on a new site to the north of the ancient graveyard, is of 19th-century date. As well as the slab attributed to St. Angus, the ancient, primitive font, probably of early medieval origin, is preserved in this building. There is a display on the history of Balquhidder in the church, which is open to the public during the summer, when there is also a programme of evening concerts in the building. The Callander and Oban Railway reached Balquhidder in 1871 but the line closed in 1965. The site of Balquhidder railway station is now a holiday park with log cabins, caravans, camping etc. Until 1993, Balquhidder had its own primary school, with a single teacher.Memoir of Joan Mann, the last headteacher of Balquhidder Since this was closed, the children of the village have been schooled at Strathyre. The name Balquhidder is commemorated in other Scottish areas of the world including South Australia. A large sheep property in the hills of South Australia is called Balquhidder. The village is also commemorated in song in a traditional Scottish air, \\"The Braes o' Balquhidder\\", written by Robert Tannahill (1774‚Äì1810) which appears in R. A. Smith's \\"Scottish Minstrel\\" (1821‚Äì1824) ‚Äì Vol. I, p. 49 and Vol. IV, p. 89, and which has been recorded by the Tannahill Weavers, among others. The \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" is a variant of this song.

The current bridge opened in 1985, but is the third bridge at the same location. Often referred to as the Cambie Street Bridge, it connects Cambie Street on the south shore of False Creek to both Nelson and Smithe Streets in the downtown peninsula. It is the easternmost of False Creek's fixed crossings; the Burrard and Granville bridges are a little more than a kilometre to the west, and the new Canada Line SkyTrain tunnel is built just west of the Cambie Bridge. History The first Cambie Street Bridge, opened in 1891, was built as a simple piled-timber trestle with a trussed timber swing span near the middle. It cost $12,000 (CAD). =Second bridge= The second Cambie Street Bridge, or \\"Connaught Bridge\\", less than a year before its closure. The next bridge was a four-lane, medium level steel bridge, long and carrying streetcar tracks. It was completed in 1911 for $740,000, opening to traffic on May 24, 1911. The following year, Canada's Governor General, the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, accompanied by the Duchess and their daughter, Princess Patricia, visited Vancouver to officiate at a ceremony renaming the new crossing as the \\"Connaught Bridge\\" on September 20, 1912. The name \\"Connaught\\" never caught on, and most people continued to call it simply the \\"Cambie Street Bridge\\", after the street that runs across it, Cambie Street, named for pioneer Vancouver resident Henry John Cambie. The navigation span was a steel through-truss swing span which the city would open on four hours' notice. In 1953, it opened 79 times. Even in its later years, it was opened once or twice a week. The trusses of the swing span projected through the bridge deck, dividing the two outer lanes from the two inner lanes. This contributed to many motor vehicle collisions. In April 1915, the creosoted wood deck caught fire, with the collapse of a steel side span.

The entire Cambie crossing was closed for nine months, starting November 1984, while the present, six-lane, concrete bridge was merged with the existing approaches. The new bridge cost $52.7 million and was opened on December 8, 1985, after being built to a tight timescale so as to be available for Expo 86 in May 1986. City engineer W.H. Curtis was assisted by E.A. West, Assistant City Engineer, Streets & Structures, who was closely involved in its construction. The 1985 bridge is of a twin post- tensioned prestressed concrete type in a continuous span. The total structural length is ; it carries 6 lanes of traffic and a pedestrian walkway. The colouring of the concrete was obtained through the addition of volcanic ash from Mount Lassen to the mix. Under the bridge's south end is the Neighbourhood Energy Utility, a city-owned heat transfer station that provides heating and hot water to all new buildings in Southeast False Creek.Neighbourhood Energy Utility.

Brown was named an All-America kicker by Bluechip Illustrated and an All-Midlands region choice by SuperPrep in 1994. In Carroll Senior High School's first ever 4A playoff game in 1994, Brown kicked four field goals, including a long of 50 yards, and the unranked Dragons defeated No. 2 Waxahachie, 26‚àí23. The following week Brown was knocked out of the game in the first quarter with a concussion and Carroll was eliminated from the playoffs. The Dragons went 38‚àí5 during Brown's tenure with the Dragons. College career Brown was a four-year starter at kicker and won two national championships at the University of Nebraska. Brown broke numerous school records while playing at Nebraska, including most career points (388), most field goals made (217), most consecutive field goals made (17), most PATs made (217), most consecutive PATs made (114), most points scored by kicking during a season (116) and career (388), most points scored by a freshman (97 in 1995), and most PATs made during a season without a miss (62 of 62 in 1997). Several of these records were later broken by former Philadelphia Eagles kicker, Alex Henery. His younger brother, Drew Brown, followed in his footsteps by becoming University of Nebraska's Place Kicker in 2014. He previously was the kicker for Southlake Carroll before his career with Nebraska like his brother. Professional career =Pittsburgh Steelers= Brown was selected in the seventh round (228th overall) of the 1999 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He saw action immediately in his rookie season leading the team in scoring with 105 points while seeing action in all 16 games of the regular season. Brown remained with the Steelers through the 2001 season, but had a crucial field goal blocked in the AFC Championship game that was returned for a touchdown. Brown also struggled in the team's first season at Heinz Field, including missing 4 field goals in a 13‚àí10 loss to the arch- rival Baltimore Ravens. Following the 2001 season, Brown sought free agency and was granted the right to sign with another team. In 2002, Brown chose to sign with the newly formed Houston Texans as a restricted free agent. The Steelers chose not to match the Texans' offer, opting to initially go with Todd Peterson before selecting kicker Jeff Reed after Peterson was injured mid-season. =Houston Texans= Brown won the job as a placekicker for the Texans and held the position for the first eight years of the franchise's history. On Christmas Eve 2006, Brown nailed a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Texans their first-ever win over the Indianapolis Colts. Brown kicked five field goals on October 7, 2007, against the Miami Dolphins at home, including the game-winner on a career-long 57-yarder with one second remaining. Brown set an NFL single-game record with three field goals of 54 yards or more, hitting two 54-yarders earlier in the game. Neil Rackers, Connor Barth, Morten Andersen, Sebastian Janikowski, Phil Dawson, Josh Scobee, and Blair Walsh are the only other kickers to kick three field goals of 50+ yards in a single game. Brown was given an extension on June 16, 2009, worth $10 million over 4 years. It also included $2.5 million in guarantees.Texans reward kicker Brown with 4-year extension Brown missed two game-tying field goals vs the Colts and Titans on Monday Night Football in week 9 and 11 of the 2009 season. On September 3, 2010, Brown was released from the Texans after losing a training camp battle to Neil Rackers. Brown was the last remaining member of the inaugural 2002 team. =San Diego Chargers= Brown signed with the Chargers on October 20, 2010, after an injury to Nate Kaeding. On October 24, 2010, Brown kicked his first field goal as a San Diego Charger against the New England Patriots, later making his second field goal. With 27 seconds left in the game, he missed a 50-yard field goal which would have tied the game. It was the only one he missed out of 5 attempts in 3 games. Brown was cut on November 23. =Dallas Cowboys= On December 31, 2010, Brown was signed to a two-year contract by the Dallas Cowboys, who were looking for him to compete the next year with David Buehler for the kicker job, so he was declared inactive for the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles. On July 28, 2011, he was released after the team decided to sign undrafted free agent Kai Forbath and not have to pay Brown's scheduled $911,000 salary. Charity work Off the playing field, Brown has demonstrated a commitment to charity. During his three seasons for the Steelers, Brown was active in the Pittsburgh community. He volunteered his efforts for The Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and Junior Achievement‚Äôs ‚ÄúKickin‚Äô for Kids‚Äù program. During his recent career with the Texans, Brown has raised $384,000 for Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital Charity Care Program through the program Kris Brown‚Äôs Kick Club. The program's mission is to provide hope, medical resources, and healing for patients at Texas Children's Hospital that do not have the ability to provide these for themselves and to increase community awareness about their needs. His involvement stemmed from a personal experience that Brown dealt with as a child. His sister April was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the age of 11. She recovered and has been in remission for 13 years. The support his family received during the ordeal served as the inspiration to form Kris Brown's Kick Club. On March 7, 2004, Brown greeted President George W. Bush when he landed at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. Bush honored Brown and Texas Children's Hospital for their charity efforts. In addition, Brown started the ‚ÄúKicks for Kids‚Äù program in 2002, partnering with Ikon and Academy Sports & Outdoors to donate $800 to the Houston Texans Foundation for every point that Brown scored on the field. On August 2012, a report from The Kansas City Star mentioned that Brown's company, Savoreaux, Inc. was holding a job fair for his Dunkin Donuts locations that had recently opened. The report went on to state that Brown had retired from football. Personal life Brown is co-owner and chief executive officer of the Berliner Group, a Dunkin' Donuts franchisee in Kansas City and Omaha. Currently, the Berliner Group has one store operating in both Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. Two additional stores are being built in Omaha, with plans to open those locations by the end of 2014. He has currently opened a store in Council Bluffs, Iowa and Wichita, Kansas. He is currently in the midst of opening a store in Liberty, Missouri and Gladstone, Missouri is the next coming months.

Born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, Perkins was apprenticed to a goldsmith. He soon made himself known with a variety of useful mechanical inventions and eventually had twenty-one American and nineteen English patents. He is known as the father of the refrigerator.History of refrigeration He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1813. Early life Jacob went to school in Newburyport until he was twelve and then was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Newburyport named Davis. Mr. Davis died three years later and the fifteen- year-old Jacob continued the business of making gold beads and added the manufacture of shoe buckles. When he was twenty-one he was employed by the master of the Massachusetts mint to make a die for striking copper pennies bearing an eagle and an Indian.  Innovations  = Nail machines = In 1790, at the age of 24, in Byfield, he created machines for cutting and heading nails. In 1795, he was granted a patent for his improved nail machines and started a nail manufacturing business on the Powwow River in Amesbury, Massachusetts. =Cannon boring= During the War of 1812 he worked on machinery for boring out cannons. =Hydrostatics= He worked on water compression and invented a bathometer or piezometer to measure the depth of the sea by its pressure. =Engraving= The Perkins D Cylinder Printing Press Perkins created some of the best steel plates (as noted from English Engravers) for engraving, and started a printing business with engraver Gideon Fairman. They began with school books, and also made currency that was not being forged. In 1809 he bought the stereotype technology (prevention of counterfeit bills) from Asa Spencer, and registered the patent, and then employed Asa Spencer. Perkins made several important innovations in printing technology, including new steel engraving plates. Using these plates he made the first known steel engraved USA books (The Running Hand, school books, 8 pages each). He then made currency for a Boston Bank, and later for the National Bank. In 1816 he set up a printing shop and bid on the printing of currency for the Second National Bank in Philadelphia. His quality American bank currency attracted attention of the Royal Society who were busy addressing the problem of massively forged English notes. In 1819, with his printing business partner, Gideon Fairman, they employed Asa Spencer and went to England at Charles Heath's urging in an attempt to win the ¬£20,000 reward for \\"unforgable notes\\". Sample notes were shown to the Royal Society president Sir Joseph Banks. They set up shop in England, and spent months on example banknotes, but unfortunately for them, Banks thought that the inventor should be English by birth. Printing English notes ultimately proved a success and was carried out by Perkins in partnership with the English engraver-publisher Charles Heath and his associate Gideon Fairman. Together they formed the partnership Perkins, Fairman and Heath. Heath and Perkins also had support from their brothers. Perkins, Fairman and Heath was later renamed, when his son-in-law, Joshua Butters Bacon, bought out Charles Heath and the company was then known as Perkins, Bacon. Perkins Bacon provided banknotes for many banks, and foreign countries with postage stamps.McConnell (2004) Stamp production started for the British government in 1840 with the 1d black and the 2d blue postage stamps, which incorporated an anti-forgery measure in the form of a complicated background produced by means of the rose engine. Their stamps were the first known preglued stamps. Also concurrently, Jacob's brother ran the American printing business, and they made money on important fire safety patents. Charles Heath and Jacob Perkins worked together and independently on some concurrent projects. =Hermetic tube= Jacob Perkins has patents for Heating and Air Conditioning technology. In 1829‚Äì30, he went into partnership with his second son Angier March Perkins, manufacturing and installing central heating systems using his hermetic tube principle. He also investigated refrigeration machinery after discovering from his research in heating that liquefied ammonia caused a cooling effect. =Steam power= In 1816, Jacob Perkins had worked on steam power with Oliver Evans in Philadelphia. In 1822 he made an experimental high pressure steam engine working at pressures up to . This was not practical for the manufacturing technology of the time, though his concepts were revived a century later. Perkins' boiler was the first example of a flash boiler and one of the first examples of a contra-flow heat exchanger. The water-tube boiler consisted of heavy cast iron straight, square-section water-tubes across the firebox, joined by unheated pipes outside it. These tubes were arranged in three layers, with water pumped into the upper layer and steam extracted at the lower, giving that contra-flow arrangement. In 1927, Loftus P. Perkins, a descendant, lectured on these boilers and displayed a copper pipe, apparently from a engine of a type that was in use up until 1918. Perkins' high-pressure steam technology was also used in another invention, the steam gun. This was an early fully automatic machine gun, powered by steam rather than by gunpowder. Although not the first automatic firearm, it was the first to also have a high magazine capacity of more than a handful of rounds. It operated with musket balls at a cyclic firing rate of 1,000 rounds per minute. It is reported to have been rejected by the Duke of Wellington as 'too destructive'. In 1827 he became the first person in England to use a uniflow steam engine. A locomotive on the South Eastern Railway was converted to the Uniflow system in 1849, although it is not known whose idea this was. Perkins applied his Hermetic tube system to steam locomotive boilers and a number of locomotives using this principle were made in 1836 for the London and South Western Railway. This was a very early example of a high pressure steam locomotive. = National Gallery of Practical Science = In 1832 Perkins established the National Gallery of Practical Science on Adelaide Street, West Strand, London. This was devoted to showing modern inventions. A popular feature was his steam gun, which did not find favour with the military.Morus (1998) pp. 75‚Äì83 = Refrigeration = Portrait of Perkins, American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge 1835 Perkins is credited with the first patent for the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, assigned on August 14, 1834Greville Bathe and Dorothy Bathe, Jacob Perkins, His Inventions, His Times & His Contemporaries, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1943, P. 149 and titled, \\"Apparatus and means for producing ice, and in cooling fluids\\". The idea had come from another American inventor, Oliver Evans, who conceived of the idea in 1805 but never built a refrigerator. The same patent was granted in both Scotland and England separately. Financial problems detailed Jacob Perkins and Charles Heath had many business successes, but also had financial difficulties, but usually not at the same time. The accounting records for their printing business shows the two borrowed from the business, and sold shares back and forth when necessary in any and all business ventures, and kept detailed records. This professional relationship ended when Jacob's son-in-law, Joshua Butters Bacon, bought out Charles Heath's share of their shared printing business, which then became Perkins Bacon. At one point he became involved in lawsuits and had to close his engine factory. Patents Jacob Perkins has many patents: * GB 4400/1819.

Family Jacob was married on November 11, 1790 to Hannah Greenleaf of Newbury and together they had nine children. His second son, Angier March Perkins (1799‚Äì1881), also born at Newburyport, went to England in 1827, and was in partnership with his father (later taking over the business on the latter's death). His grandson, Loftus Perkins (1834‚Äì1891), most of whose life was spent in England, experimented with the application to steam engines of steam at very high pressures, constructing in 1880 a yacht, the Anthracite. Death He retired in 1843 and died in London on 30 July 1849, at 83 years of age. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

P. Lovecraft in many of his weird fiction stories, which combines real and fictitious locations. This setting has since been elaborated on by other writers working in the Cthulhu Mythos. The phrase was not in use during Lovecraft's own lifetime. Instead the phrase Lovecraft Country was coined by Keith Herber for the Lovecraftian role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. The phrase is only one of many attempts to label the setting of Lovecraft's works, though with the 2020 HBO television series Lovecraft Country arguably the one gaining the most traction. Alternative phrases include Arkham County, Miskatonic County and the Miskatonic region. Origin The term was coined by Keith Herber and then popularized by Chaosium, the producers of the Lovecraftian role-playing game Call of Cthulhu. =Alternative phrases= Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi refers to the area as the Miskatonic region, after its fictional river and university. Lovecraft biographer Lin Carter calls it Miskatonic County, and the film Color Out of Space refers to it as Arkham County, although Lovecraft indicates that at least some of his fictional towns were located in the real-life Essex County of Massachusetts. Just as Arkham County is fictitious, Matt Ruff places some of the events of his book in the equally fictitious Devon County of Massachusetts.https://www.tor.com/2016/11/23/toto-i-dont-think-were-in-arkham- any-more-matt-ruffs-lovecraft-country/ Lovecraft's fiction Map of Lovecraft country. Lovecraft first used a New England setting in his 1920 short story \\"The Terrible Old Man\\", set in Kingsport. \\"The Picture in the House\\" (written later in 1920), is the first of his stories to mention both Arkham and the Miskatonic Valley. The story begins with a manifesto for why the New England countryside is a fitting backdrop for his horror stories: > \\"the true epicure of the terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable > ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, esteem most of > all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the > dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness, and ignorance combine to > form the perfection of the hideous.\\" In a 1930 letter to Robert E. Howard, Lovecraft attempted to explain his fascination with New England as a setting for weird fiction: \\"It is the night- black Massachusetts legendary which packs the really macabre 'kick'. Here is material for a really profound study in group neuroticism; for certainly, none can deny the existence of a profoundly morbid streak in the Puritan imagination.\\" Specifically, Lovecraft was inspired by the cities and towns in Massachusetts. However, the specific location of Lovecraft Country is variable, as it was moved according to Lovecraft's literary needs. The location of Arkham was moved, as Lovecraft decided that it would have been destroyed by the Quabbin Reservoir, which was created to supply Boston with fresh water. This is alluded to in \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", as the \\"blasted heath\\" is submerged by the creation of a fictionalized version of the reservoir. Lovecraft first mentioned Arkham's Miskatonic University in \\"Herbert West‚ÄìReanimator\\", written in 1921‚Äì22. He added Dunwich to his imaginary landscape in 1928's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\", and expanded it to include Innsmouth in 1931's The Shadow over Innsmouth. Other Lovecraft stories that make use of Lovecraft Country settings include \\"The Festival\\", \\"The Colour out of Space\\", \\"The Strange High House in the Mist\\", \\"The Dreams in the Witch House\\", and \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\". Derleth's additions August Derleth, Lovecraft's friend, discouraged other Cthulhu Mythos writers from setting their stories in Lovecraft's New England. But he himself attempted to fill in the blanks of the setting, particularly in his posthumous \\"collaborations\\" with Lovecraft‚Äîactually Derleth's stories based on fragments, notes or ideas that Lovecraft left behind after his death. The Lurker at the Threshold is set in Billington's Wood, a fictional forest north of Arkham, while \\"Witches' Hollow\\" takes place in the titular valley in the hills to the west of the town. The title of \\"The Fisherman of Falcon Point\\" refers to a promontory on the Atlantic coast south of Innsmouth. \\"Wentworth's Day\\" and \\"The Horror from the Middle Span\\" take place in the area north of Dunwich, while \\"The Gable Window\\" concerns a house on the Aylesbury Pike. Other uses While the phrase originated in the role-playing community, it now sees widespread usage. Lovecraft Country was the title of a 2016 novel by Matt Ruff. The novel was subsequently adapted by HBO for television. The resulting TV series, also called Lovecraft Country, premiered in August 2020. Return to Lovecraft Country was a collection of short stories set in \\"the New England of H.P. Lovecraft\\", published by Triad Entertainments in 1996. The editor, Scott David Aniolowski, has also done editorial work for Chaosium. Eternal Lovecraft, a short-story collection published by Golden Gryphon Press in 1998, has a section called \\"Lovecraft Country\\". The phrase occurs in popular discussions of Lovecraft's connection to the region. The Harvard Law Record used the phrase in an October 20, 2005 article: Locations The most important portion stretches along the Miskatonic River valley, from Dunwich in its far western headwaters to its mouth entering the Atlantic Ocean between Arkham, Kingsport, and Martin's Beach.\\" These locations, along with Innsmouth, are a list of the most significant locations in Lovecraft Country. However, as certain Lovecraft stories take place in other areas of New England, including southern hills of Vermont (the setting of The Whisperer in Darkness) as well as Lovecraft's hometown of Providence, Rhode Island, where he set such works as The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and \\"The Haunter of the Dark\\", this broader area is sometimes to also be considered part of Lovecraft Country. =Arkham= =Dunwich= =Innsmouth= =Kingsport= Kingsport is a fictional town in the writings of H. P. Lovecraft and used by subsequent writers in his tradition. The town first appeared in Lovecraft's short story \\"The Terrible Old Man\\". ;Inspiration and description Abbott Hall in Marblehead, Massachusetts Kingsport is based on Marblehead, Massachusetts, a town bordering Salem. In his letters, Lovecraft described Kingsport as being an idealised version of Marblehead. It is described as having rocking cliffs. These cliffs are based on those in Marblehead and Rockport. According to Will Murray, Kingsport is adjacent to Innsmouth. The town's exact location moved around according to Lovecraft's literary needs. Lovecraft created Kingsport before he saw its real-life model. When Lovecraft visited Marblehead in 1922, he became enamored of the town and wrote with much feeling in 1929 concerning his experiences there. Lovecraft wrote of seeing the snow-covered town at sunset and of experiencing his \\"first stupefying glance of MARBLEHEAD'S huddled and archaick roofs\\". He also remarked that \\"that instant -- about 4:05 to 4:10 pm., Dec. 17, 1922 -- [was] the most powerful single emotional climax during my nearly forty years of existence.\\" ;Later writers According to later writers, the town was founded in 1639 by colonists from southern England and the Channel Islands. It soon became a seaport and center for shipbuilding. Influenced by the Salem witch trials, the town hanged four alleged witches in 1692. During the American Revolutionary War, the port was briefly blockaded by the British when the town's merchants turned to privateering against the British fleet. In the 19th century, sea trade dwindled and the town turned to fishing as the main industry. Kingsport's economy continued to dwindle into the 20th century and today relies primarily on tourism for income. ;Appearances in Lovecraft's works * \\"The Terrible Old Man\\" (1921): The eponymous resident of Kingsport lives on Water Street near the sea. * \\"The Festival\\" (1923): The unnamed narrator is summoned to Kingsport to participate in a strange ceremony held by his distant relatives. * The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926): Nyarlathotep expresses admiration for Kingsport's \\"antediluvian\\" architecture and marvelous seacoast.

In September 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War, Colonel Benedict Arnold led a force of 1,100 Continental Army troops on an expedition from Cambridge in the Province of Massachusetts Bay to the gates of Quebec City. The expedition was part of a two-pronged invasion of the British Province of Quebec, and passed through the wilderness of what is now Maine. The other expedition invaded Quebec from Lake Champlain, led by Richard Montgomery. Unanticipated problems beset the expedition as soon as it left the last significant colonial outposts in Maine. The portages up the Kennebec River proved grueling, and the boats frequently leaked, ruining gunpowder and spoiling food supplies. More than a third of the men turned back before reaching the height of land between the Kennebec and Chaudi√®re rivers. The areas on either side of the height of land were swampy tangles of lakes and streams, and the traversal was made more difficult by bad weather and inaccurate maps. Many of the troops lacked experience handling boats in white water, which led to the destruction of more boats and supplies in the descent to the Saint Lawrence River via the fast- flowing Chaudi√®re. By the time that Arnold reached the settlements above the Saint Lawrence River in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men. They had traveled about through poorly charted wilderness, twice the distance that they had expected to cover. Arnold's troops crossed the Saint Lawrence on November 13 and 14, assisted by the local French-speaking Canadiens, and attempted to put Quebec City under siege. Failing in this, they withdrew to Point-aux-Trembles until Montgomery arrived to lead an unsuccessful attack on the city. Arnold was rewarded for his effort in leading the expedition with a promotion to brigadier general. Arnold's route through northern Maine has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Arnold Trail to Quebec, and some geographic features in the area bear names of expedition participants. Background On May 10, 1775, shortly after the American Revolutionary War began, Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen led an expedition that captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the British Province of New York.Desjardin (2006), p. 9 Allen and Arnold were aware that Quebec was lightly defended; there were only about 600 regular troops in the entire province.Stanley (1973), p. 29 Arnold, who had done business in the province before the war,Desjardin (2006), p. 8 also had intelligence that the French- speaking Canadiens would be favorably disposed toward a colonial force.Desjardin (2006), p. 11 Arnold and Allen each made arguments to the Second Continental Congress that Quebec could and should be taken from the British, pointing out that the British could use Quebec as a staging area for attacks down Lake Champlain and into the Hudson River valley. Congress did not want to alarm the people of Quebec, and rejected these arguments.Smith (1907), Volume 1, p. 237 In July, amid concerns that the British might use Quebec as a base for military movements into New York, they changed their position, and authorized an invasion of Quebec via Lake Champlain, assigning the task to Major General Philip Schuyler of New York.Smith (1907), Volume 1, pp. 241‚Äì242 Planning A 1760 map by British engineer alt=This manuscript map shows the highland area that Arnold had to cross. Montresor's route is traced, being roughly similar to Arnold's eventual route traversing the Kennebec, Dead, and Chaudi√®re Rivers. Arnold, who had hoped to lead the invasion, decided to pursue a different approach to Quebec. He went to Cambridge, Massachusetts in early August, and approached George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, with the idea of a second eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City.Smith (1907), Volume 1, pp. 398‚Äì399 Washington approved of the idea in principle, but sent a message to General Schuyler on August 20 to ensure his support of the endeavor, since the two forces would need to coordinate their efforts.Martin (1997), pp. 108‚Äì109 Arnold's plan called for the expedition to sail from Newburyport, Massachusetts along the coast and then up the Kennebec River to Fort Western (now Augusta, Maine). From there, they would use shallow-draft river boats called bateaux to continue up the Kennebec River, cross the height of land to Lake M√©gantic, and descend the Chaudi√®re River to Quebec. Arnold expected to cover the 180 miles (290 km) from Fort Western to Quebec in 20 days,Martin (1997), p. 121 despite the fact that little was known about the route.Randall (1990), pp. 151‚Äì152 Arnold had acquired a map (copy pictured at right) and journal made by British military engineer John Montresor in 1760 and 1761, but Montresor's descriptions of the route were not very detailed, and Arnold did not know that the map contained some inaccuracies or that some details had been deliberately removed or obscured.Smith (1903), p. 17 Washington introduced Arnold to Reuben Colburn, a boat builder from Gardinerstown, Maine, who was in Cambridge at the time. Colburn offered his services, and Arnold requested detailed information about the route, including potential British naval threats, Indian sentiment, useful supply opportunities, and an estimate of how long it would take to construct bateaux sufficient for the contemplated force. Colburn left for Maine on August 21 to fulfill these requests.Desjardin (2006), p. 13 Colburn asked Samuel Goodwin, the local surveyor in Gardinerston, to provide maps for Arnold. Goodwin, who was known to have Loyalist sympathies, provided maps that were inaccurate in the routes, distances and other important features they described.Randall (1990), p. 152 On September 2, Washington received a letter from General Schuyler in reply to his August 20 message. Schuyler agreed with the suggested plan, and Washington and Arnold immediately began to raise troops and place orders for supplies.Randall (1990), pp. 147‚Äì150 Recruitment and preparations for departure Because there had been little direct action at Boston after the Battle of Bunker Hill in June, many units stationed in the American camps besieging the town were bored with garrison life and eager for action.Smith (1907), Volume 1, pp. 506‚Äì507 Arnold selected a force of 750 men from the large number who expressed interest in the proposed expedition. Most of these were divided into two battalions: one commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Roger Enos and the other by Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Greene. The rest were placed in a third battalion under Daniel Morgan that included three companies‚Äî250 men‚Äîof Continental riflemen from Virginia and the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment.Desjardin (2006), pp. 16‚Äì17 These frontiersmen, from the Virginia and Pennsylvania wilderness, were better suited to wilderness combat than to a siege, and had been causing trouble since arriving outside Boston.Randall (1990), p. 150 The entire force numbered about 1,100.Smith (1903), pp. 22,57 Among the volunteers were other men who rose to later prominence during and after the war, including Aaron Burr, Return J. Meigs, Henry Dearborn, and John Joseph Henry.Desjardin (2006), pp. 199‚Äì203 Washington and Arnold were concerned about Indian support for (or opposition to) the effort, as well as the reception Arnold's forces might receive from the Canadians once they arrived near the Saint Lawrence River. On August 30, Washington wrote to General Schuyler of a meeting he held with an Abenaki chief, \\"[The chief] says the Indians of Canada in general, and also the French, are greatly in our favor, and determined not to act against us.\\"Desjardin (2006), p. 14 Four Abenakis accompanied the expedition as scouts and guides.Martin (1997), p. 116 Cambridge to Fort Western alt=Arnold is shown wearing a military uniform: blue coat over buff waistcoat and trousers, red waistband, tricorner hat. In the background a town is visible, as are trees that look something like palm trees. On September 2, as soon as General Schuyler's agreement with the expedition was known, Arnold wrote a letter to Nathaniel Tracy, a merchant of his acquaintance in Newburyport. He asked Tracy to acquire sufficient shipping to transport the expedition to Maine without drawing the attention of Royal Navy ships patrolling the area. The sea voyage was viewed by both Arnold and Washington as the most dangerous part of the expedition, because British patrols were highly effective at interfering with colonial shipping at the time.Randall (1990), p. 151 The expedition began its departure from Cambridge on September 11, marching to Newburyport. The first units to leave were composed largely of men from that area, to whom Arnold had given extra time so that they would be able to see their families once more before the expedition left Newburyport. The last troops marched off on September 13; Arnold rode from Cambridge to Newburyport on September 15 after making final purchases of supplies. Headwinds and fog delayed the departure of the expedition from Newburyport until September 19\\\\. In twelve hours, they reached the mouth of the Kennebec River. They spent the next two days negotiating the island channels near its mouth and sailing up the river.Martin (1997), p. 119 Arriving in Gardinerston on the 22nd, they spent the next few days at Reuben Colburn's house, organizing supplies and preparing the boats they would use for the rest of the expedition.Smith (1903), pp. 58‚Äì83 Arnold inspected Colburn's hastily constructed bateaux, finding them, in a portent of troubles to come, to be \\"very badly built\\", and \\"smaller than the directions given\\".Martin (1997), p. 120 Colburn and his crew spent the next three days building additional bateaux. Arnold's troop movements did not escape British notice. General Thomas Gage in Boston was aware that Arnold's troops were \\"gone to Canada and by way of Newburyport\\", but he believed the target to be Nova Scotia, which was at the time virtually undefended.Randall (1990), p. 159 Francis Legge, the governor of Nova Scotia declared martial law, and on October 17 sent a message to England laden with rumors about American actions that turned out to be false. Admiral Samuel Graves eventually received intelligence about Arnold's activities, reporting on October 18 that the American troops \\"went up the Kennebec River, and 'tis generally believed are for Quebec\\".Randall (1990), p. 160 Scouting As the troop transports arrived, Arnold dispatched some of the men in the already-constructed bateaux up the Kennebec River 10 miles (16 km) to Fort Western, and the others by foot on a track leading to Fort Halifax, 45 miles (72 km) up the Kennebec. While waiting for the bateaux to be completed, Arnold received word from scouts Colburn had sent out to reconnoiter the proposed route. Their reports included rumors of a large Mohawk force near the southernmost French settlements on the Chaudi√®re River. The source of these rumors was Natanis, a Norridgewock Indian believed to be spying for Quebec's governor, General Guy Carleton; Arnold discounted the reports. Arnold and most of the force had reached Fort Western by September 23.Smith (1903), p. 83 The next day, Arnold sent two small parties up the Kennebec. One, under Pennsylvania Lieutenant Archibald Steele, was ordered to scout as far as Lake M√©gantic to gather intelligence. The second, under Lieutenant Church, was to survey the route as far as the Dead River, at a place known to the local Indians as the Great Carrying Place, so that Arnold might better estimate how far the column would need to travel each day. Early troubles The full expedition set out from Fort Western on September 25.Smith (1907), Volume 1, p. 531 Morgan's riflemen led the way, blazing trails when necessary. Colburn and a crew of boatwrights came in the rear, to repair bateaux as needed.Desjardin (2006), p. 55 Morgan's group traveled relatively lightly, as they would be working to make the trail, while the last group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Enos, carried the bulk of the supplies.Martin (1997), p. 122 The expedition arrived at its first target, Fort Halifax, a decaying relic of the French and Indian War, on the second day. There was a rough track from Fort Western, so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be portaged around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip.Desjardin (2006), p. 57 Arnold, rather than traveling in a heavy bateau, traveled in a lighter canoe so that he might move more rapidly among the troops along the travel route. Arnold reached Norridgewock Falls, location of the last settlements on the Kennebec, on October 2\\\\. Even at this early date, problems were apparent. The bateaux were leaking, resulting in spoiled food and a continual need for repairs. The men were constantly wet, due not only to the leakage but also the frequent need to pull the heavy boats upstream. As temperatures began to drop below freezing, colds and dysentery set in, reducing the effectiveness of the force.Martin (1997), pp. 123‚Äì124 The portage around Norridgewock Falls, a distance of about one mile (1.6 km), was accomplished with the assistance of oxen provided by the local settlers, but it took almost a week to complete; Arnold did not depart from there until October 9\\\\. Colburn's crew devoted some of this time to making repairs on the bateaux.Smith (1903), p. 109 Most of the expedition reached the Great Carrying Place on October 11, and Arnold arrived the next day. This stretch of the trek was complicated by heavy rains, rendering the portages difficult due to extremely muddy conditions.Desjardin (2006), pp. 63‚Äì64 The Great Carrying Place alt=A head-and-shoulders portrait. Morgan is in a brigadier's uniform (one star on the shoulder epaulet), blue jacket with gold facing. He is balding with white hair, and stares without expression over the viewer's right shoulder. The Great Carrying Place was a portage of roughly 12 miles (19 km), bypassing an unnavigable section of the Dead River, the tributary of the Kennebec that the expedition was to follow. The portage included a rise in elevation of about 1,000 feet (305 m) to the high points of the carry, with three ponds along the way.Desjardin (2006), p. 68 Lieutenant Church, the leader of the survey team, described the route as a \\"bad road but capable of being made good\\", an assessment that turned out to be somewhat optimistic.Martin (1997), p. 125 The vanguard of the main body, led by Daniel Morgan, met Lieutenant Steele's scouting party en route to the first pond.Desjardin (2006), p. 48 This party had successfully scouted the route to the height of land above the Dead River, but the men were near starvation. Their supplies had been depleted, and they were largely subsisting on a protein-rich diet of fish, moose, and duck.Desjardin (2006), pp. 31‚Äì48 Most of the men continued to supplement their meager supplies with the local wildlife as the expedition continued. Church, in his description of the route, had failed to account for the heavy rains and the boggy conditions between the first and second ponds. Rain and snow slowed the long portage, and the expedition had its first casualty when a falling tree killed one of the party. Some of the men who drank the stagnant waters along the way became violently ill, forcing Arnold to order construction of a shelter at the second pond as cover for the sick, and to send some men back to Fort Halifax for supplies that had been cached there.Martin (1997), pp. 125‚Äì126 The first two battalions finally reached the Dead River on October 13, and Arnold arrived three days later. At this point, Arnold wrote a number of letters informing Washington and Montgomery of his progress. Several letters intended for Montgomery were intercepted and turned over to Quebec's Lieutenant Governor Hector Theophilus de Cramah√©, giving Quebec its first notice that the expedition was on its way.Martin (1997), pp. 126‚Äì127 Arnold also dispatched the survey team again, this time to mark the trail all the way to Lake M√©gantic.Smith (1903), p. 131 Ascending the Dead River Progress up the Dead River was extremely slow. Contrary to its name, which supposedly described the speed of its currents, the river was flowing rapidly enough that the men had trouble rowing and poling against the current. The leaky boats spoiled more of the food, forcing Arnold to put everyone on half rations. Then, on October 19, the skies opened, and the river began to rise in the pouring rain. Early on October 22, the men awoke to discover that the river had risen to the level of their camp, and they had to scramble to even higher ground for safety. When the sun rose they were surrounded by water.Martin (1997), p. 127 After spending most of that day drying out, the expedition set off on October 23\\\\. Precious time was lost when some of the men mistakenly left the Dead River and ascended one of its branches, having been fooled by the high water. Soon after, seven bateaux overturned, spoiling the remaining food stores. This accident compelled Arnold to consider turning back. He called together his nearby officers for a council of war. Arnold explained that although the situation was grim, he thought that the expedition should continue. The officers agreed, and decided to pick an advance party that would proceed as rapidly as possible to French settlements on the Chaudi√®re, and work to bring supplies back. The sick and infirm were to retreat to American settlements in Maine.Martin (1997), pp. 130‚Äì131 Further back on the route, Lieutenant Colonel Greene and his men were starving. They had little flour, and were consuming candle tallow and shoe leather to supplement their minimal rations. On October 24, Greene attempted to catch up with Arnold, but was unable to do so because Arnold had moved too far ahead. When he returned to camp, Lieutenant Colonel Enos had arrived, and they held their own council. Enos's captains were united in wanting to turn back despite Arnold's most recent orders, which were to press ahead. In the council, Enos cast a tie- breaking vote in favor of continuing, but in a meeting with his captains after the council, announced that because they were insistent on returning, he was acceding to their decision, and would return. After giving Greene's men some of his supplies, Enos and 450 men turned back.Desjardin (2006), pp. 80‚Äì81 { alt=See caption. alt=See caption. } Lake M√©gantic Chaudi√®re Falls, painting by alt=A relatively wide cascade descends perhaps 20 feet (6 meters). Woods are visible above the falls, and the view before the falls includes scraggly coniferous trees growing out of a grassy area. The impact of the inaccurate maps was felt when the expedition reached the height of land.Smith (1903), pp. 4‚Äì23 Portions of the advance party became lost in swampy bogs (the area surrounding Spider Lake on the topographic map shown above) that were not on those maps, resulting in delays reaching Lake M√©gantic. Although this part of the party crossed the height of land on October 25, it was not until two days later that they reached the lake.Martin (1997), pp. 134‚Äì135 On October 28, the advance party descended the upper Chaudi√®re, destroying three of their bateaux when they turned over and crashed into rocks above some falls on the river. The next day they encountered several Penobscot Indians, who confirmed that they were not far from Sartigan, the southernmost French settlement on the Chaudi√®re.Martin (1997), p. 136 Arnold, when he reached Lake M√©gantic, sent a man back to the two remaining battalions with instructions on how to navigate the swampy lands above the lake. However, the way Arnold described the route included information from the incorrect maps that he had not seen on the route.Desjardin (2006), p. 90 As a result, some elements of the expedition spent two days lost in swamps before the majority finally reached the falls on the upper Chaudi√®re on October 31.Martin (1997), pp. 137‚Äì138 Along the way, Captain Henry Dearborn's dog was eaten, an event recorded in his diary: \\"[They ate] every part of him, not excepting his entrails; and after finishing their meal, they collected the bones and carried them to be pounded up, and to make broth for another meal.\\"Desjardin (2006), p. 99 Arrival at Quebec Arnold first made contact with the local population on October 30. Sympathetic to his plight, they supplied provisions and cared for the sick; some were well paid for their aid, while others refused payment.Desjardin (2006), p. 112 Arnold distributed copies of a letter written by Washington asking the habitants to assist the expedition, and Arnold added promises to respect the persons, property, and religion of the locals. Jacques Parent, a Canadien from Pointe- Levi, notified Arnold that Lieutenant Governor Cramah√© had ordered the destruction of all boats on the southern banks of the Saint Lawrence after receiving the intercepted communications.Lanctot (1967), pp. 97‚Äì98 On November 9 the expedition finally reached the Saint Lawrence at Pointe-Levi, across the river from Quebec. Arnold had about 600 of his original 1,100 men,Smith (1907), Volume 1, p. 152 and the journey had turned out to be 350 miles (560 km), not the 180 that Arnold and Washington had thought it would be.Smith (1903), p 231 From John Halstead, a New Jersey-born businessman who operated a mill near Pointe-Levi, Arnold learned of the arrest of his courier and the interception of some of his letters. Halstead's mill became the organizing point for the crossing of the Saint Lawrence. Some of Arnold's men purchased canoes from the habitants and the local Saint Francis Indians, and then transported them from the Chaudi√®re to the mill site.Desjardin (2006), p. 128 The forces crossed the Saint Lawrence on the night of November 13‚Äì14 after three days of bad weather, likely crossing the mile-wide river between the positions of HMS Hunter and HMS Lizard, two Royal Navy ships that were guarding the river against such a crossing.Smith (1903), pp. 251‚Äì255 The city of Quebec was then defended by about 150 men of the Royal Highland Emigrants under Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean, supported by about 500 poorly organized local militia and 400 marines from the two warships.Alden (1969), p. 205 When Arnold and his troops finally reached the Plains of Abraham on November 14, Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender, to no avail. The Americans, with no cannons or other field artillery, and barely fit for action, faced a fortified city. After hearing rumors of a planned sortie from the city, Arnold decided on November 19 to withdraw to Pointe-aux-Trembles to wait for Montgomery, who had recently captured Montreal.Thayer (1867), p. xiv Aftermath Roger Enos, one of Arnold's subordinate commanders on the Quebec expedition When Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles on December 3, the combined force returned to the city and began a siege, finally assaulting it on December 31.Stanley (1973), pp. 88‚Äì95 The battle was a devastating loss for the Americans; Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan was captured along with more than 350 men.Stanley (1973), p. 104 Arnold did not learn until after the battle that he had been promoted to brigadier general for his role in leading the expedition.Martin (1997), p. 195 The invasion ended with a retreat back to Fort Ticonderoga, Montgomery's starting point, during the spring and summer of 1776. Arnold, who commanded the army's rear guard in the later stages of the retreat, was able to delay the British advance sufficiently to prevent them from attempting to reach the Hudson River in 1776.Stanley (1973), pp. 139‚Äì144 Enos and his detachment arrived back in Cambridge late in November. Enos was court-martialed, charged with \\"quitting his commanding officer without leave\\".Randall (1990), pp. 179‚Äì180 He was acquitted, and returned to service as Lieutenant Colonel of the 16th Connecticut Regiment.Maine Federation of Women's Clubs, The Trail of the Maine Pioneer, 1916, page 297Bruce Lancaster, The American Revolution, 2001, page 111Robert P.

He and two others escaped captivity in August 1776 and retraced the trek in the opposite direction, once again with meager resources. They benefited from better weather and equipment the expedition had abandoned along the way. Fobes reached his home near Worcester, Massachusetts at the end of September, and eventually rejoined the army.Desjardin (2006), pp. 205‚Äì207 Captain Simeon Thayer kept a journal which was published by the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1867 as The invasion of Canada in 1775.Thayer & Stone, p. i After being captured at Quebec, Thayer was exchanged on July 1, 1777 and returned to the Continental Army with the rank of major.Thayer & Stone, p. 45 He distinguished himself during the Siege of Fort Mifflin in November 1777 and briefly assumed command after the post's commandant was wounded.McGuire, p. 203 Legacy A number of geographic features along the route of the expedition bear names related to the expedition. East Carry Pond, Middle Carry Pond, and West Carry Pond are all on the route of the portage at the Great Carrying Place, which is in the Carrying Place of Maine.Desjardin (2006), p. 33 Arnold Pond is the last pond on the Dead River before crossing the height of land.Desjardin (2006), p. 38 Mount Bigelow in Maine was named for Major Timothy Bigelow, one of Arnold's officers. The wilderness portion of the route through Maine, roughly from Augusta to the Quebec border, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as the \\"Arnold Trail to Quebec\\". The Major Reuben Colburn House, which served as Arnold's headquarters, is now a state historic site administered by the non-profit Arnold Expedition Historical Society, and is also listed on the National Register. Both Fort Western and Fort Halifax are National Historic Landmarks, primarily for their age and their role in earlier conflicts. A historical marker in Danvers, Massachusetts commemorates Arnold's expedition, placed by the Massachusetts Society, Sons of the American Revolution. There is also a historical marker in Moscow, Maine placed in 1916 by the Kennebec chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and two at Skowhegan Island in Maine placed in 1912 and 2000 by the Eunice Farnsworth Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In Eustis, Maine, on the western shore of Flagstaff Lake, stands a marker commemorating the expedition. The lake was created in the 20th century by damming the Dead River, inundating part of the expedition route. Mount Bigelow, whose first recorded ascent was by Timothy Bigelow, stands just south of the lake. In the fall of 1975, there was a reenactment of this expedition as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations.

There have been Jewish communities in Anatolia since at least the fifth century BCE and many Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire in the late 15th century, including regions now part of Turkey, centuries later, forming the bulk of the Ottoman Jews. Today, the vast majority of Turkish Jews live in Israel, while modern-day Turkey continues to host a modest Jewish population. History =Roman & Byzantine rule= Sardis Synagogue was a section of a large bath-gymnasium complex, that was in use for about 450‚Äì500 years. According to the Hebrew Bible, Noah's Ark landed on the top of Mount Ararat, a mountain in the Taurus Mountains in eastern Anatolia, near the present-day borders of Turkey, Armenia, and Iran. Josephus, Jewish historian of the first century, notes Jewish origins for many of the cities in Anatolia, though much of his sourcing for these passages is traditional.Flavius Josephus, The Antiquities of the Jews (Project Gutenberg eText, William Whiston trans., 2006), Chapter 1, Book 1. The New Testament has many mentions of Jewish populations in Anatolia: Iconium (now Konya) is said to have a synagogue in Acts of the Apostles 14:1 and Ephesus is mentioned as having a synagogue in Acts 19:1 and in Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. The Epistle to the Galatians is likewise directed at Galatia, which once held an established Jewish population. Based on physical evidence, there has been a Jewish community in Anatolia since the fourth century BCE, most notably in the city of Sardis. The subsequent Roman and Byzantine Empires included sizable Greek-speaking Jewish communities in their Anatolian domains which seem to have been relatively well-integrated and enjoyed certain legal immunities. The size of the Jewish community was not greatly affected by the attempts of some Byzantine emperors (most notably Justinian I) to forcibly convert the Jews of Anatolia to Christianity, as these attempts met with very little success.G. Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State The exact picture of the status of the Jews in Asia Minor under Byzantine rule is still being researched by historians.For a sample of views, see J. Starr The Jews in the Byzantine Empire, 641‚Äì1204; S. Bowman, The Jews of Byzantium;, R. Jenkins Byzantium; Averil Cameron, \\"Byzantines and Jews: Recent Work on Early Byzantium\\", Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 20 Although there is some evidence of occasional hostility by the Byzantine populations and authorities, no systematic persecution of the type endemic at that time in western Europe (pogroms, the stake, mass expulsions, etc.) is believed to have occurred in Byzantium.The Oxford History of Byzantium, C. Mango (ed.) (2002) =Ottoman era= Krymchak, a Turkic-speaking Crimean Jew (Crimean Khanate, Ottoman Empire) The first synagogue linked to Ottoman rule is \\"Tree of Life\\" () in Bursa, which passed to Ottoman authority in 1324. The synagogue is still in use, although the modern Jewish population of Bursa has shrunk to about 140 people.International Jewish Cemetery Project ‚Äì Turkey The status of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire often hinged on the whims of the sultan. So, for example, while Murad III ordered that the attitude of all non-Muslims should be one of \\"humility and abjection\\" and that they should not \\"live near Mosques or tall buildings\\" or own slaves, others were more tolerant.M. J. Akbar, \\"The shade of swords: jihad and the conflict between Islam and Christianity\\", 2003, (p. 89) The first major event in Jewish history under Turkish rule took place after the Empire gained control over Constantinople. After Mehmed the Conqueror's conquest of Constantinople he found the city in a state of disarray. After suffering many sieges, the devastating sack of Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and the arrival of the Black Death pandemic in 1347,The Black Death, Channel 4 ‚Äì History. the city was a shade of its former glory. Since Mehmed wanted the city as his new capital, he decreed its rebuilding.Inalcik, Halil. \\"The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229‚Äì249.pg236 In order to revivify Constantinople he ordered that Muslims, Christians and Jews from all over his empire be resettled in the new capital. Within months, most of the Empire's Romaniote Jews, from the Balkans and Anatolia, were concentrated in Constantinople, where they made up 10% of the city's population.Avigdor Levy; The Jews of the Ottoman Empire, New Jersey, (1994) At the same time, the forced resettlement, though not intended as an anti-Jewish measure, was perceived as an \\"expulsion\\" by the Jews.J. Hacker, Ottoman policies towards the Jews and Jewish attitudes towards Ottomans during the Fifteenth Century in \\"Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire\\", New York (1982) Despite this interpretation, Romaniotes would be the most influential community in the Empire for a few decades, until that position would be lost to a wave of Sephardi immigrants. Sultan Bayezid II sent Kemal Reis to save the Sephardi Jews of Spain from the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 and granted them permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire. The number of Romaniotes was soon bolstered by small groups of Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1421 and 1453. Among these immigrants was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati, a German-born Jew of French descent ( Sarfati \\"French\\"), who became Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting European Jewry to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he stated, \\"Turkey is a land wherein nothing is lacking,\\" and asking, \\"Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians?\\"B. Lewis, \\"The Jews of Islam\\", New York (1984), pp. 135 ‚Äì 136 The greatest influx of Jews into Anatolia Eyalet and the Ottoman Empire occurred during the reign of Mehmed the Conquerors's successor, Bayezid II (1481‚Äì1512), after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, the Kingdom of Portugal, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily. The Sultan issued a formal invitation and refugees started arriving in the empire in great numbers. A key moment occurred in 1492, when more than 40,000 Spanish Jews fled the Spanish Inquisition.Kamen, Henry (1998). The Spanish Inquisition: a Historical Revision. Yale University Press. . At that point in time, Constantinople's population was a mere 70,000 due to the various sieges of the city during the Crusades and the Black Death, so this historical event was also significant for repopulation of the city. These Sephardi Jews settled in Constantinople as well as Thessaloniki. The Jews satisfied various needs in the Ottoman Empire: the Muslim Turks were largely uninterested in business enterprises and accordingly left commercial occupations to members of minority religions. They also distrusted the Christian subjects whose countries had only recently been conquered by the Ottomans and therefore it was natural to prefer Jewish subjects to which this consideration did not apply.H. Inalcik; The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300‚Äì1600, Phoenix Press, (2001) Painting of a Jewish man from the Ottoman Empire, 1779. The Sephardi Jews were allowed to settle in the wealthier cities of the empire, especially in Rumelia (the European provinces, cities such as Constantinople, Sarajevo, Thessaloniki, Adrianople and Nicopolis), western and northern Anatolia (Bursa, Aydƒ±n, Tokat and Amasya), but also in the Mediterranean coastal regions (Jerusalem, Safed, Damascus, and Egypt). ƒ∞zmir was not settled by Spanish Jews until later. The Jewish population in Jerusalem increased from 70 families in 1488 to 1500 at the beginning of the 16th century. That of Safed increased from 300 to 2000 families and almost surpassed Jerusalem in importance. Damascus had a Sephardic congregation of 500 families. Constantinople had a Jewish community of 30,000 individuals with 44 synagogues. Bayezid allowed the Jews to live on the banks of the Golden Horn. Egypt Eyalet, especially Cairo, received a large number of the exiles, who soon outnumbered Musta'arabi Jews. Gradually, the chief center of the Sephardi Jews became Thessaloniki, where the Spanish Jews soon outnumbered coreligionists of other nationalities and, at one time, the original native inhabitants. Although the status of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire may have often been exaggerated,B. Lewis, The Jews of Islam, PUP, (1987) 137‚Äì141 it is undeniable that they enjoyed tolerance. Under the millet system they were organized as a community on the basis of religion alongside the other millets (e.g. Eastern Orthodox millet, Armenian Apostolic millet, etc.). In the framework of the millet, they had a considerable amount of administrative autonomy and were represented by the Hakham Bashi, the Chief Rabbi. There were no restrictions in the professions Jews could practice analogous to those common in Western Christian countries.L. Stavrianos; The Balkans since 1453, NYU Press (2000) There were restrictions in the areas Jews could live or work, but such restrictions were imposed on Ottoman subjects of other religions as well. Like all non-Muslims, Jews had to pay the hara√ß \\"head tax\\" and faced other restrictions in clothing, horse riding, army service etc., but they could occasionally be waived or circumvented.D. Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700‚Äì1922, CUP, 2005 Jewish leader Abraham Salomon Camondo's silver Torah case, Constantinople, 1860 ‚Äì Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme Jews who reached high positions in the Ottoman court and administration include Mehmed the Conqueror's Minister of Finance (Defterdar) Hekim Yakup Pa≈üa, his Portuguese physician Moses Hamon, Murad II's physician ƒ∞shak Pa≈üa and Abraham de Castro, master of the mint in Egypt. During the Classical Ottoman period (1300‚Äì1600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews were the most prominent under the millets, the apogee of Jewish influence could arguably be the appointment of Joseph Nasi to sanjak-bey (governor, a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of Naxos.Charles Issawi & Dmitri Gondicas; Ottoman Greeks in the Age of Nationalism, Princeton, (1999) Also in the first half of the 17th century the Jews were distinct in winning tax farms, Haim Gerber describes it: \\"My impression is that no pressure existed, that it was merely performance that counted.\\"Studies in Ottoman Social & Economic Life, Heidelberg, (1999); the essay is entitled: Muslims & Zimmis in the Ottoman culture and society by Haim Gerber, Jerusalem, (1999) Friction between Jews and Turks was less common than in the Arab territories. Some examples: During the reign of Murad IV (1623‚Äì40), the Jews of Jerusalem were persecuted by an Arab who had purchased the governorship of that city from the governor of the province. Under Mehmed IV (1649‚Äì87), the 1660 destruction of Safed occurred.Sidney Mendelssohn.The Jews of Asia: especially in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. (1920) p.241. \\"Long before the culmination of Sabbathai's mad career, Safed had been destroyed by the Arabs and the Jews had suffered severely, while in the same year (1660) there was a great fire in Constantinople in which they endured heavy losses...\\" An additional problem was Jewish ethnic divisions. They had come to the Ottoman Empire from many lands, bringing with them their own customs and opinions, to which they clung tenaciously, and had founded separate congregations. Another tremendous upheaval was caused when Sabbatai Zevi proclaimed to be the Messiah. He was eventually caught by the Ottoman authorities and when given the choice between death and conversion, he opted for the latter. His remaining disciples converted to Islam too. Their descendants are today known as D√∂nmeh. Ottoman Jewish wedding. Morris Schinasi, Ottoman Jewish businessman, who immigrated to the United States in 1890. The history of the Jews in Turkey in the 18th and 19th century is principally a chronicle of decline in influence and power; they lost their influential positions in trade mainly to the Greeks, who were able to \\"capitalize on their religio-cultural ties with the West and their trading diaspora\\". An exception to this theme is that of Daniel de Fonseca, who was chief court physician and played a certain political role. He is mentioned by Voltaire, who speaks of him as an acquaintance whom he esteemed highly. Fonseca was involved in negotiations with Charles XII of Sweden. Ottoman Jews held a variety of views on the role of Jews in the Ottoman Empire, from loyal Ottomanism to Zionism.Michelle U. Campos, \\"Between \\"Beloved Ottomania\\" and\\"The Land of Israel\\": The Struggle over Ottomanism and Zionism Among Palestine's Sephardi Jews, 1908‚Äì13\\", International Journal of Middle East Studies 37:461‚Äì483 (2005). Emmanuel Carasso, for example, was a founding member of the Young Turks, and believed that the Jews of the Empire should be Turks first, and Jews second. As mentioned before, the overwhelming majority of the Ottoman Jews lived in Rumelia. As the Empire declined however, the Jews of these region found themselves under Christian rule. The Bosnian Jews for example came under Austro-Hungarian rule after the occupation of the region in 1878, the independence of Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia further lowered the number of Jews within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. Early republic The Jewish population of Ottoman Empire had reached nearly 200,000 at the start of the 20th century. The territories lost between 1829 and 1913 to the new Christian Balkan states significantly lowered this number. The troubled history of Turkey during the 20th century and the process of transforming the old Ottoman Empire into a secular nation state after 1923, however, had a negative effect on the size of all remaining minorities, including the Jews. After 1933, a new law put into effect in Nazi Germany for mandatory retirement of officials from non-Aryan race. Thus, the law required all the Jewish scientists in Germany to be fired. Unemployed scientists led by Albert Einstein formed an association in Switzerland. Professor Schwartz, the general secretary of the association, met with the Turkish Minister of Education in order to provide jobs for 34 Jewish scientists in Turkish universities especially in Istanbul University.Klaus-Derlev GROTHUSEN, 1933 Yƒ±lƒ±ndan Sonra Alman Bilim Adamlarƒ±nƒ±n T√ºrkiye'ye g√∂√ß√º, Belleten, sayi 180 T.T.K Ankara s.537 However, the planned deportation of Jews from East Thrace and the associated anti-Jewish pogrom in 1934 was one of the events that caused insecurity among the Turkish Jews.Rifat Bali, Yeni Bilgiler ve 1934 Trakya Oraylari-I, in Tarih ve Toplum 186/1999 The effect of the 1942 Varlƒ±k Vergisi (\\"Wealth Tax\\") was solely on non-Muslims ‚Äì who still controlled the largest portion of the young republic's wealth ‚Äì even though in principle it was directed against all wealthy Turkish citizens, it most intensely affected non Muslims. The \\"wealth tax\\" is still remembered as a \\"catastrophe\\" among the non-Muslims of Turkey and it had one of the most detrimental effects on the population of Turkish Jews. Many people unable to pay the exorbitant taxes were sent to labor camps and in consequence about 30,000 Jews emigrated.Faik √ñkte, \\"The tragedy of the Turkish Capital Tax\\", Kent 1987 The tax was seen as a racist attempt to diminish the economic power of religious minorities in Turkey. World War II Grand Synagogue of Edirne Administrative building backside of the Grand Synagogue of Edirne Turkey served as a transit for European Jews fleeing Nazi persecution during the 1930s and 1940s. Even though Turkey remained neutral during World War II (until its symbolic declaration of war on Nazi Germany on 23 February 1945) and officially forbade granting visas to German Jews, individual Turkish diplomats (such as Necdet Kent, Namƒ±k Kemal Yolga, Selahattin √úlk√ºmen and Behi√ß Erkin) did work hard to save Jews from The Holocaust. Stanford Shaw claims that Turkey saved 100,000, whereas Rifat Bali claims Turkey saved 15,000 and another historian, Tuvia Friling, an Israeli expert on the Balkans and the Middle East, claims 20,000.Shoah: Turkey, the US and the UK, page 5 In his book Arnold Reisman, accepts a figure of 35,000 comprising 15,000 Turkish Jews from France, and approximately 20,000 Jews from Eastern Europe.Shoah: Turkey, the US and the UK A memorial stone with a bronze epitaph was inaugurated in 2012, as the third of individual country memorials (after Poland and the Netherlands) at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp for eight Turkish citizens killed during the Nazi regime in the said camp. The Turkish Ambassador to Berlin, H√ºseyin Avni Karslƒ±oƒülu stated in an inauguration speech that Germany set free 105 Turkish citizens, held in camps, after a mutual agreement between the two countries, and these citizens returned to Turkey in April 1945, although there is no known official record for other Turkish Jews who may have died during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. According to Rƒ±fat Bali, Turkish authorities bear some responsibility for the Struma disaster, killing about 781 Jewish refugees and 10 crew, due to their refusal to allow the Jewish refugees on board to disembark in Turkey. William Rubinstein goes further, citing British pressure on Turkey not to let Strumas passengers disembark, in accordance with Britain's White Paper of 1939 to prevent further Jewish immigration to Palestine. Emigration from Turkey to Israel Bet Israel Synagogue (ƒ∞zmir) Ashkenazi Synagogue of Istanbul When the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, Aliyah was not particularly popular amongst Turkish Jewry; migration from Turkey to Palestine was minimal in the 1920s. As in other Muslim-majority countries, discrimination later became the main \\"push\\" factor that encouraged emigration from Turkey to Palestine. Between 1923 and 1948, approximately 7,300 Jews emigrated from Turkey to Mandatory Palestine. After the 1934 Thrace pogroms following the 1934 Turkish Resettlement Law, immigration to Palestine increased; it is estimated that 521 Jews left for Palestine from Turkey in 1934 and 1,445 left in 1935. Immigration to Palestine was organized by the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Aliya Anoar Organization. The Varlƒ±k Vergisi, a capital tax which occurred in 1942, was also significant in encouraging emigration from Turkey to Palestine; between 1943 and 1944, 4,000 Jews emigrated. The Jews of Turkey reacted very favorably to the creation of the State of Israel. Between 1948 and 1951, 34,547 Jews immigrated to Israel, nearly 40% of the Turkish Jewish population at the time. Immigration was stunted for several months in November 1948, when Turkey suspended migration permits as a result of pressure from Arab countries. In March 1949, the suspension was removed when Turkey officially recognized Israel, and emigration continued, with 26,000 emigrating within the same year. The migration was entirely voluntary, and was primary driven by economic factors given the majority of emigrants were from the lower classes. In fact, the migration of Jews to Israel is the second largest mass emigration wave out of Turkey, the first being the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. After 1951, emigration of Jews from Turkey to Israel slowed perceptibly. In the mid 1950s, 10% of those who had moved to Israel returned to Turkey. A new synagogue, the Neve ≈ûalom was constructed in Istanbul in 1951. Generally, Turkish Jews in Israel have integrated well into society and are not distinguishable from other Israelis.Toktas, Sule. \\"Cultural Identity, Minority Position and Immigration: Turkey's Jewish Minority vs. Turkish-Jewish Immigrants in Israel.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 44.3 (2008): 511-25. Print. However, they maintain their Turkish culture and connection to Turkey, and are strong supporters of close relations between Israel and Turkey.  Democratic Party Period  On the night of 6/7 September 1955, the Istanbul Pogrom was unleashed. Although primarily aimed at the city's Greek population, the Jewish and Armenian communities of Istanbul were also targeted to a degree. The damage caused was mainly material (a complete total of over 4,000 shops and 1,000 houses ‚Äì belonging to Greeks, Armenians and Jews ‚Äì were destroyed) it deeply shocked minorities throughout the country.Dilek G√ºven, Nationalismus, Sozialer Wandel und Minderheiten: Die Ausschreitungen gegen die Nichtmuslime der Tuerkei (6/7 September 1955), Universitaet Bochum, 2006On the history of the Jews in Turkey from the multi-party period onward, see Rifat Bali, Model Citizens of the State: The Jews of Turkey during the Multi-Party Period. Lanham, Maryland: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press and Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, 2012. Later period Neve Shalom Synagogue, completed in 1951 in the Galata district of Istanbul, Turkey. Yenik√∂y Synagogue in Istanbul The present size of the Jewish Community was estimated at 17,400 in 2012 according to the Jewish Virtual Library. The vast majority, approximately 95%, live in Istanbul, with a community of about 2,500 in ƒ∞zmir and other much smaller groups located in Adana, Ankara, Bursa, √áanakkale, Edirne, Iskenderun and Kirklareli. Sephardi Jews make up approximately 96% of Turkey's Jewish population, while the rest are primarily Ashkenazi Jews and Jews from Italian extraction. There is also a small community of Romaniote Jews and the community of the Constantinopolitan Karaites who are related to each other. The city of Antakya is home to ten Jewish families, many of whom are of Mizrahi Jewish extraction, having originally come from Aleppo, Syria, 2,500 years ago. Figures were once higher but families have left for Istanbul, Israel and other countries. Turkish Jews are still legally represented by the Hakham Bashi, the Chief Rabbi. Rabbi Ishak Haleva, is assisted by a religious Council made up of a Rosh Bet Din and three Hahamim. Thirty-five Lay Counselors look after the secular affairs of the Community and an Executive Committee of fourteen, the president of which must be elected from among the Lay Counselors, runs the daily affairs. The Istanbul community also has 16 synagogues and well kept and guarded cemetery. In 2001, the Jewish Museum of Turkey was founded by the Quincentennial Foundation, an organisation established in 1982 consisting of 113 Turkish citizens, both Jews and Muslims, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the arrival of the Sephardic Jews to the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish-Jewish population is experiencing a population decline, and has dwindled to 17,000 in a few years from an original figure of 23,000. This is due to both large-scale immigration to Israel out of fear of antisemitism, but also because of natural population decline. Intermarriage with Turkish Muslims and assimilation have become common, and the community's death rate is more than twice that of its birth rate. Antisemitism According to researchers at Tel Aviv University, antisemitism in the media and books was creating a situation in which young, educated Turks formed negative opinions against Jews and Israel. However, violence against Jews has also occurred. In 2003, an Istanbul dentist was murdered in his clinic by a man who admitted that he committed the crime out of antisemitic sentiment. In 2009, a number of Jewish students suffered verbal abuse and physical attacks, and a Jewish soldier in the Turkish Army was assaulted. The Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul has been attacked three times. First on 6 September 1986, Arab terrorists gunned down 22 Jewish worshippers and wounded 6 during Shabbat services at Neve Shalom. This attacked was blamed on the Palestinian militant Abu Nidal. The Synagogue was hit again during the 2003 Istanbul bombings alongside the Beth Israel Synagogue, killing 20 and injuring over 300 people, both Jews and Muslims alike. Even though a local Turkish militant group, the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, claimed responsibility for the attacks, police claimed the bombings were \\"too sophisticated to have been carried out by that group\\", with a senior Israeli government source saying: \\"the attack must have been at least coordinated with international terror organizations\\". Traditionally, aliyah from Turkey to Israel has been low since the 1950s. Despite the antisemitism and occasional violence, Jews felt generally safe in Turkey. In the 2000s, despite surging antisemitism, including antisemitic incidents, aliyah remained low. In 2008, only 112 Turkish Jews emigrated, and in 2009, that number only rose to 250. However, in the aftermath of the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, antisemitism in Turkey increased and became more open, and it was reported that the community was also subjected to economic pressure. A boycott of Jewish businesses, especially textile businesses, took place, and Israeli tourists who had frequented the businesses of Turkish Jewish merchants largely stopped visiting Turkey. As a result, the number of Turkish Jews immigrating to Israel increased. By September 2010, the Jewish population of Turkey had dropped to 17,000, from a previous population of 23,000Chief Rabbinate of Turkey - Numbers: Total is estimated at around 23.000. The 25th community in size according to WJC data. Currently, the Jewish community is feeling increasingly threatened by extremists. In addition to safety concerns, some Turkish Jews also immigrated to Israel to find a Jewish spouse due to the increasing difficulty of finding one in the small Turkish Jewish community. In 2012, it was reported that the number of Jews expressing interest in moving to Israel rose by 100%, a large number of Jewish business owners were seeking to relocate their businesses to Israel, and that hundreds were moving every year. In October 2013, it was reported that a mass exodus of Turkish Jews was underway. Reportedly, Turkish Jewish families are immigrating to Israel at the rate of one family per week on average, and hundreds of young Turkish Jews are also relocating to the United States and Europe.Jews flee Turkey over anti- Semitism ‚Äì Ynetnews. 24 October 2013 Turkey and Israel Arkada≈ü Association in Yehud, Israel. Turkey is among the first countries to formally recognize the State of Israel. Turkey and Israel have closely cooperated militarily and economically. Israel and Turkey have signed a multibillion-dollar project to build a series of pipelines from Turkey to Israel to supply gas, oil and other essentials to Israel. In 2003 the Arkada≈ü Association was established in Israel. The Arkada≈ü Association is a Turkish‚ÄìJewish cultural center in Yehud, aiming to preserve the Turkish-Jewish heritage and promote friendship (Arkada≈ü being the Turkish word for Friend) between the Israeli and Turkish people. In 2004, the √úlk√ºmen-Sarfati Society was established by Jews and Turks in Germany. The society, named after Selahattin √úlk√ºmen and Yitzhak Sarfati, aims to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue and wants to inform the public of the centuries of peaceful coexistence between Turks and Jews. Diaspora The various migrations outside of Turkey has produced descendants of Turkish Jews in Europe, Israel, United States, and Canada. Today, there are still various synagogues that maintain Jewish-Turkish traditions. The Sephardic Synagogue Sephardic Bikur Holim in Seattle, Washington was formed by Jews from Turkey, and still uses Ladino in some portions of the Shabbat services. They created a siddur called Zehut Yosef, written by Hazzan Isaac Azose, to preserve their unique traditions. In recent years, several hundred Turkish Jews, who have been able to prove that they are descended from Jews expelled from Portugal in 1497, have emigrated to Portugal and acquired Portuguese citizenship.

As of 2005 it was owned by Liberty Global Europe (see history, below), having been divested by NTL. It was rebranded as UPC Ireland (now called Virgin Media Ireland). Services The company held cable television licences for Dublin, Galway, and Waterford cities (with the Dublin licences also covering Leixlip, County Kildare, Dunboyne, County Meath, and Bray, County Wicklow). It also held MMDS franchises for cells covering the above counties, as well as County Mayo. It provided an analogue cable television service (with a very high take up in its areas passed), which provided the Irish terrestrial channels, plus BBC One, BBC Two, UTV, Channel 4, Sky1 and a small number of other channels. It also provided a digital television service, with over a third of its customer base taking a digital service. The company also converted its entire MMDS network to digital, with an offering of approximately seventy TV and radio services, while MMDS was switched off. In its final years, the company rolled out broadband and enabled one third of its Dublin and 100% of its network in Galway and Waterford for broadband, becoming a major broadband provider in Ireland. History =RT√â / Telecom √âireann ownership= The company began operations in 1970 as RT√â Relays, a subsidiary of Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. It carried four channels ‚Äì RT√â Television, BBC1, BBC2, and Ulster Television. In 1984, the company merged with Dublin Cable Systems, itself the product of a merger of Marlin Cable with Phoenix Relays. In 1986, the Irish Government began to allow Irish cable companies to carry non-terrestrial (i.e. satellite) services. In the same year, RT√â merged all of its cable operations (including two other cable companies, Galway Cablevision and Waterford Cablevision) to form Cablelink Limited. As Cablelink, the company was Ireland's largest cable company by far, and expanded to a fifteen channel service (plus premium channels) gradually. In 1990, Telecom √âireann acquired 60% of the company from RT√â. The biggest controversy the company managed to embroil itself during this time was a dispute with British Sky Broadcasting over carriage fees for Sky One and Sky News. This led to the two channels being pulled from the platform from 1992 to 1994. The \\"return of Bart Simpson\\" was prematurely announced by Cablelink several times before the channels actually reappeared. The company also wished to develop broadband services in 1997/1998 but there was an embargo on developing and selling Internet services by the main shareholders, Telecom √âireann, but the management felt if it were developed and a trial launched then there would be no stopping this. To conceal this from the Board, they hired a small Dublin company The Communications Interactive Agency to manage and run the trial. To this end all purchases of equipment and Internet Services were done in their name. At the time they were one of the first to demonstrate VOIP in Ireland as a commercial service which was done by the then managing director Alex Gogan at the Press Launch, by dialling live the Speaking Clock in New York using Net2phone.com service. At the time they were one of the first companies in Europe to trial and launch Broadband services. What stopped the trial from becoming a full roll out across their network was the purchase by NTL. It took the company almost four more years to integrate NTL Broadband service. =Sale to NTL= In 1999, as part of the privatisation of Eircom, the Government put pressure on the shareholders of Cablelink to sell the company. Part of the reason was that Eircom was regarded by some as a \\"spoiler shareholder\\" in Cablelink, refusing to allow the company to compete in the voice telephony market that it dominated. The company was put up for auction, with bidders including Esat Telecom Group, NTL, and UPC, as well as CMI Cable and Irish Multichannel. It was eventually announced that NTL would acquire the company for IR¬£535.18m (nearly ‚Ç¨680 million). Under NTL, the company was renamed NTL Ireland on 3 July 2000, and began offering telephony and internet services. The company began to upgrade its network and in 2001 launched its digital television service. However the company lost two managing directors during the time NTL ran the franchise. The biggest crisis erupted in early 2001, when NTL stopped selling its direct telephony and high-speed internet services, and halted the roll out of its upgraded hybrid fibre coax network. This led to a very public row with the Commission for Communications Regulation, and the resignation of Ian Jeffers, the NTL executive who had been assigned to the Dublin operation upon the NTL takeover. Some years later, the company was forced to suspend its telephone service after problems with the equipment emerged. =Sale to Liberty Global= Despite NTL Ireland turning a profit as a result of its expected merger with Telewest, the Irish assets were then considered non-core. In May 2005, NTL sold its Irish business to Morgan Stanley (on behalf of Liberty Global Europe (then called UGC Europe)). MS Irish Cable Holdings, a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, held the stake on UGC's behalf, until the deal received regulatory clearance. However a Competition Authority investigation into the proposed resale of the company to Liberty Global Europe took place. On 4 November 2005 it was announced the Competition Authority had cleared the deal, subject to the appointment of an independent director to the board of UPC Ireland and restrictions on the influence of John C. Malone on the running of the Irish business. The deal was approved by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Miche√°l Martin on 5 December 2005, and closed on 12 December 2005. At the time, Liberty used the \\"Chorus NTL\\" brand (under licence) in Ireland. Most aspects of the company were merged with Chorus (billing, website etc.). After a period branded as \\"Chorus NTL\\", the company carried out an extensive upgrade of the cable television networks it acquired, then re-launched as UPC Ireland. In an interview with Marketing (Ireland's Marketing and Media Monthly) Ed Sawday, Sky Ireland's head of Marketing, stated \\"it's interesting what UPC have done with the brand. They've been in a period of hiatus in delivering a recognizable brand to their customers ‚Äì is it NLT or Chorus? When NTL rebranded in the UK as Virgin Media, it was almost an overnight transition\\", according to the article Sawday did not believe that UPC wish to be marred by older companies brands. In early 2006 the two companies were placed under a single management team. On 3 July 2006 it was reported on RT√â News that as part of the merger, up to 350 jobs would be lost, including the closure of NTL's call centre in Waterford. In December 2006 NTL's customer service department closed, and customer service was transferred to the former Chorus call centre in Limerick. In January 2007, billing was transferred to a new system.  Rebranding  On 25 January 2007, NTL Ireland updated the electronic programme guide software to remove the NTL logo and all mention of the NTL name. However the UPC name did not replaced it, the areas which contained the NTL logo simply being left blank. The colour scheme was still NTL's. From 31 January 2007, NTL and Chorus began advertising jointly, although the adverts were simply the ongoing campaign from NTL with the Chorus logo added to them. In a Sunday Business Post article on 11 February 2007, UPC Ireland's marketing manager revealed that the rebrand was due to take place no later than May 2007. That did not happen, although, from July 2007, a composite \\"Chorus NTL\\" logo has been used in all advertising, with the tagline \\"A UPC Company\\" below. It was then expected that the full rebrand would take place in early 2008. In late September and early October NTL included a leaflet with its bills stating a new logo would appear on bills from 21 October. Although many took that to read that the relaunch would happen on that day, this did not occur. On 14 August 2007 NTL launched a personal video recorder, the UPC Mediabox. Chorus then launched the same device in its cable areas in Autumn 2007. This was followed, on 30 October 2007, NTL and Chorus' websites were merged under a single site, though the composite Chorus NTL logo was used on the site rather than the UPC logo. Most users of the EPG were switched fully to the new UPC EPG, taking the NTL EPG off air. The company was rebranded on 4 May 2010.

E. Smith, was a Canadian religious leader and politician. A social gospeller, Smith was for many years a minister in the Canadian Methodist Church before starting his own \\"People's Church\\". He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922 as a Labour representative. In 1925, he became a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Early life Smith was born on October 20, 1871, in Guelph, Ontario, the son of William George Smith and Elizabeth Bildson, working-class immigrants from England. He worked as a machinist's apprentice and later a bookbinder to contribute to the family's income. His family later moved to Hamilton, where he developed an interest in religion after joining the Gore Street Methodist Church. After passing an oral examination, he became a lay preacher in 1988. In 1890 Smith was transferred to MacGregor, Manitoba, to begin field work. His appointment came from James Woodsworth, and father of J. S. Woodsworth. Smith was a vocal supporter of Thomas Greenway's Liberal government in Manitoba during the 1890s. During the Manitoba Schools Question, he defended the Greenway government's decision to remove funding from French- language denominational schools. Ordination After three years' work as a probationer, Smith enrolled as a student for the ministry at Wesley College in Winnipeg in 1893. He was formally ordained to the ministry in 1897. He married Maude Mercy Rogers in 1898, with whom he would have seven children. After working in Dauphin, Manitoba, and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Smith was stationed at the MacDougall Memorial Methodist Church in north-end Winnipeg in 1902. Left-wing politics Smith's political views now turned to labour, and he spoke in support of Labour MP Arthur Puttee's re-election in the 1904 federal election. Smith left Winnipeg in 1906, and moved to Portage la Prairie. In 1910, he accepted ministerial work in Nelson, British Columbia. He spoke at Socialist Party gatherings, and became acquainted with Jack Johnstone, later a leading figure in the Communist Party of the United States. Smith returned to Manitoba in 1913, to accept a position as minister of the wealthy First Methodist Church in Brandon. Smith was an advocate of church union with the Presbyterians throughout the 1910s. In 1925, this union came about via the creation of the United Church of Canada. Smith was asked to consider running in the 1917 federal election as a supporter of Robert Borden's Union government of pro-conscription Liberals and Conservatives. Although he rejected these requests, Smith's name was put forward for the Unionist nomination in Brandon. Borden's government was supported by both mainstream labour and the Methodist Church, and some local government supporters believed Smith's name would aid their cause. Asked to make a speech at the nomination meeting, he informed the delegates that he had no confidence in either of the older parties, and did not believe the Union arrangement would make any difference. To the surprise of none present, Smith did not receive the nomination. Socialist politics In 1917, Smith read The Communist Manifesto for the first time. He later claimed that the work was \\"like a revelation\\". Smith's religious views were, by his own admission, unorthodox for the standards of his age: he believed that the message of Jesus was \\"the proclamation of a new social order of human society\\", and rejected the \\"harsh theologies\\" of mainstream Christian churches. \\"In my sermons\\", he wrote, \\"no miracle was required to explain the birth of Jesus or his life and teachings ... His name was to be cherished because He died as a leader of the people, for His principles and in protest against the unjust rulers of His day\\". After reading The Communist Manifesto, Smith eventually reached the conclusion that Jesus was a communist. Smith's views had not yet developed to this stage in 1917, however, and he joined the social reformist Dominion Labour Party at the end of the First World War. Smith supported the strikers from his pulpit during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and opened his church to Brandon civic workers who voted for a parallel strike in their city. As a member of the Brandon Trades and Labour Council, Smith provided extensive logistical support to Brandon's strike committee. He also testified before the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations. Not surprisingly, Smith's labour activities were opposed by more conservative figures in his Methodist church. At a special meeting of the church board held on May 26, 1919, a prominent church member moved that Smith \\"be restrained from any further preaching in First Church\\". No formal charges were made against him, and the motion was withdrawn. Nonetheless, his role as Brandon's Methodist minister had become untenable. On June 8, he announced the formation of a new People's Church in the city. People's Church On June 22 the first meeting of the People's Church was held, with roughly 400 people in attendance. Despite his commitment to the People's Church, Smith did not intend to leave the Methodist Church. He hoped to secure a leave from the Church so that he could pursue his work with the People's Church. The Methodist Stationing Committee initially granted his request, but when a motion was called to put all special cases before the committee as a whole, the decision was rescinded. Smith was determined that the People's Church would spread across Canada, offering an alternative to the traditional church. In 1920 he travelled to Western Canada and established the People's Church in Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, and Edmonton. In 1923 Smith moved to Toronto and began working with the Toronto People's Church. Labour MLA In 1920, Smith was prevailed on to run for the provincial legislature as a labour candidate. He received the nomination of a local group called the \\"Brandon Labour Party\\", which was aligned with the Winnipeg branch of the Dominion Labour Party. He was successful in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Stephen Emmett Clement by 604 votes. Some of Smith's opponents blamed vote-splitting by the Liberals and Conservatives for his victory. For the next two years, Smith sat with the labour parliamentary group led by Fred Dixon in the legislative opposition. Unlike other labour members, Smith did not join the Independent Labour Party when the Winnipeg branch of the Dominion Labour Party split in late 1920. In August 1921, he instead attended a meeting of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council which led to the creation of the Canadian Labour Party. While joining the CLP took Smith on a different path from his co-legislators, he remained a member of the labor parliamentary group. Labour's political support in Manitoba had declined somewhat by the 1922 provincial election. Smith lost his seat to John Edmison, who ran as a \\"fusion\\" candidate of the local Liberals and Conservatives. No longer receiving a salary as a Methodist minister or Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Smith experienced financial difficulties in Brandon and decided to return to Ontario. He moved to Ontario in 1923, and immediately started a People's Church in Toronto. Smith was also involved in the Forum Committee of the local Labour Temple, and became a prominent member of the Canadian Labour Party in the city. Unlike James Simpson, Smith supported opening the CLP to members of the newly formed Communist Party of Canada. Joining the Communist Party Smith's personal philosophy continued to develop in this period, and in January 1925 he made the decision to join the Communist Party himself. His membership in the party was confirmed at a small upstairs room at 8 Gerrard Street East in Toronto, where a meeting of the party was held. He later explained his decision to a Toronto Star reporter by arguing that communism was a part of man's social evolution. Smith remained a member of the Communist Party for the rest of his life. Still a prominent figure in Toronto, he often defended the Communist Party against threats from hostile governments. He became a prominent organizer for the Canadian Labour Defence League across Canada in the 1920s, and served as its general secretary until it was shut down by the Canadian government in 1940. He campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925 federal election as a candidate of the CLP in the northern Ontario riding of Port Arthur‚ÄîThunder Bay. He finished fourth, with 1,363 votes. The winner was William Fitzgerald Langworthy of the Conservative Party. At the time of the election, Smith described his occupation as \\"educationalist\\". He ran again in the 1926 election, and finished third with 1,382 votes. The winner was Conservative Donald James Cowan. Smith ran for municipal office in Toronto during this period. In 1925, he ran for alderman in Ward Seven as a candidate of the Labour Representation Political Association, a broad-tent group aligned with the Canadian Labour Party. He was defeated, and lost a second time in 1926. He also ran as a candidate of the Ontario division of the CLP in the 1926 provincial election, receiving 416 votes in Hamilton Centre. The winner on that occasion was Thomas Jutten of the Ontario Conservative Party. In the 1930 federal election he ran as an independent candidate in Fort William winning 594 votes. Opposition to Trotskyism During the late 1920s, Smith became a prominent opponent of Trotskyism within the Communist Party of Canada. He supported the removal of Maurice Spector and Jack MacDonald from the CPC, and endorsed Tim Buck, a strong supporter of Joseph Stalin, to become the party's new leader in 1929. In his autobiography, Smith accused Leon Trotsky of attempting to betray the Russian Revolution, alleging that he had been \\"in the service of British agents\\" in 1926. With the Canadian Labour Party falling into disarray, Smith returned to northern Ontario for the federal election of 1930 to contest Fort William as an independent candidate. He received 594 votes, finishing third. The winner was Robert James Manion, who later served as leader of the federal Conservative Party. Stalinism Smith visited the Soviet Union for the first time in 1932 and wrote favourably of the experience upon his return. In July 1936, he traveled to Spain during the Spanish Civil War as an emissary of the \\"Friends of the Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion\\". Smith was one of Tim Buck's most vocal defenders in the early 1930s, when Buck was detained and nearly killed in the Kingston Penitentiary. In the 1934 provincial election, Smith ran as a candidate of the Ontario Communist Party against Conservative Premier George Henry in the constituency of York East. He finished fourth, though still polling a respectable 664 votes. Later in 1934, Smith polled a surprisingly high 8,500 votes for Mayor of Toronto. In 1934, he was arrested on charges of sedition (under section 98 of the Criminal Code) and was later acquitted. Returning again to northern Ontario, Smith ran for the House of Commons as a candidate of the Communist Party candidate in the 1935 federal election, receiving 1,161 votes for a fourth-place finish in Port Arthur. The winner was Clarence Decatur Howe of the Liberal Party. Later years Smith largely curtailed his political activities after this time, though he remained an active figure within the Communist Party. He returned to Manitoba for the 1945 federal election, and campaigned for the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party had renamed itself) in his old riding of Brandon. He received 497 votes, finishing fourth. The winner was Liberal James Ewen Matthews. Smith died in 1947. His autobiography, All My Life, was published posthumously in 1949. The work chronicles his religious and political evolution, and gives extensive consideration to the Communist Party's struggles of the 1930s. Joseph Stalin is never mentioned by name in this book. To the end of his life, Smith argued that his beliefs were a reflection of the message promoted by Jesus. A. E. Smith's son, Stewart Smith, was a leading member of the Communist Party in his own right.

The film is an examination of the life of Saint Francis of Assisi. Plot Francesco, the spoiled son of Pietro Bernardone, a wealthy textile merchant, returns from fighting in the war between Assisi and Perugia a changed man. Struck by a feverish illness that has forced him to leave the war, Francesco lies on his bed tormented by visions of his past when he was a boisterous, arrogant youth. During a long recovery process, he slowly finds God in poverty, chastity and obedience, experiencing a physical and spiritual renewal. Healthy again, Francesco returns to his normal life as a rich young man. However, to the consternation of his parents, he begins to spend most of his time surrounded by nature, flowers, trees, animals and poetry as he becomes more and more reluctant to resume his prior lifestyle. Pietro's obsession with gold now fills Francesco with revulsion, creating an open confrontation between Francesco and Pietro. Francesco wanders into the basement where the family business is located. He feels the heat and humidity of the dye vats, passing through colorful lots of drying cloth, to see the workers with their families laboring in the heat without much rest. Rejecting his father's offer to take over the family business, he instead pulls the laborers out of the building to enjoy the daylight. Then he throws the costly textiles out of the window to the poor gathered below. When his father sees the loss, Francesco invites him to join in throwing the cloth out the window so he can know the joy of being free of worldly possessions. Pietro, completely frustrated, beats Francesco, drags him to the bishop's palace and humiliates his son in front of Assisi's bishop and the rest of the population. Lovingly, Francesco renounces all worldly possessions and his middle-class family including the name \\"Bernardone\\", removes his brilliant clothing and leaves Assisi, naked and free from his past, to live in the beauties of nature as an ascetic to enjoy a simple life as a man of God. Francesco comes upon the ruins of the chapel of San Damiano, where he hears God's voice asking him to \\"restore My Church.\\" Believing the Voice means San Damiano, Francesco begins to beg for rocks to rebuild that church. Much to the dismay of his family, some of Francesco's friends join him. He gradually gains a following from the sons of the wealthy, who begin to minister among the poor and the suffering. The bishop supports Francesco, since he is rebuilding a church without pay and performing the works of mercy Christ demands of His followers. Francesco's friend Bernardo happily joins him after returning from the Fourth Crusade, a venture that left him in sorrow and emptiness. Two other friends, Silvestro and Giocondo, admiring Francesco's new vocation, help to rebuild San Damiano. During a rainy afternoon, Francesco and his friends separate to beg food from the families of Assisi. Francesco comes to his family's home. Seeking forgiveness, he begins to recite the Beatitudes, causing his mother much anguish while Pietro pretends not to hear, refusing to be reconciled with their son. Clare, a beautiful young woman also from a wealthy family, serves and cares for lepers of the community. She joins the brothers in their life of poverty. Meanwhile, in Assisi, the city's nobility and wealthy merchandising families protest against Francesco and his group, worried about them \\"corrupting\\" the whole of Assisi's youth, and they command Francesco's friend Paolo to hinder and stop the so-called \\"minor brothers.\\" One day the rebuilt chapel is set on fire, and one of Francesco's followers is killed. (This scene, introduced for dramatic effect, is unhistorical.) That people can hate so much causes Francesco much sorrow. He blames himself but cannot understand what he has done wrong. He then decides to walk to Rome and to seek out the answers from Pope Innocent III. In Rome, Francesco is stunned by the enormous wealth and power shown in the clothing of the papal court surrounding the throne of St. Peter. When granted an audience with the Pope, Francesco breaks from reciting Paolo's carefully prepared script and calmly protests against pomp and worldliness, reciting some of Jesus' words from the Sermon on the Mount praising humility to protest that Christ's teachings are totally opposite to Rome's obsession with wealth. The cardinals, bishops and abbots of the papal court are insulted at having the words of Jesus thrown in their faces. Francesco and his friends are expelled. Finally accepting his admiration toward Francesco, Paolo decides to join them. Francesco tries to protect Paolo, saying that he is not one of them, but his friend insists on joining the friars, convincing Francesco of the sincerity of his conversion, and they are put out with the others. On his throne Pope Innocent, seemingly waking from a dream, orders Francesco and his friends to be brought back. The Pope addresses Francesco: \\"In our obsession with original sin we have forgotten original innocence.\\" In language from one of the Psalms, Innocent prays that Francesco's order \\"flourish like the palm.\\" Then to everyone's astonishment, Pope Innocent kneels, kisses Francesco's feet and blesses him and his companions, wishing for them a long worldwide society of men and women willing to serve God in humility. One of the final lines places the sincerity of the Pope's response in question when an unnamed cardinal, observing what the Pope has done, comments to a bishop: \\"Don't be alarmed, His Holiness knows what he is doing. This is the man who will speak to the poor, and bring them back to us.\\" This line actually has some historical value since the heretical Cathars, otherwise known as Albigensians, dressed as humbly as Francesco and his followers, were finding followers in Southern France and other parts of Europe by denouncing the wealth of the Catholic Church, while rejecting many Catholic dogmas and doctrines, especially the need for an ordained priesthood. The film finishes with the sight of Francesco slowly walking alone into the distance in the countryside as Donovan sings \\"Brother Sun and Sister Moon.\\" Cast * Graham Faulkner as Francesco di Bernardone * Judi Bowker as Clare Offreduccio * Leigh Lawson as Bernardo di Quintavalle * Kenneth Cranham as Paolo * Lee Montague as Pietro di Bernardone * Valentina Cortese as Pica di Bernardone * Alec Guinness as Pope Innocent III * Michael Feast as Silvestro * Nicholas Willatt as Giocondo * John Sharp as Bishop Guido * Adolfo Celi as Consul * Francesco Guerrieri as Deodato Production Featuring Zeffirelli's signature lush photography in Brother Sun, Sister Moon indicates that it was conceived and executed in much the same visual manner as his Academy Award- winning adaptation of Romeo and Juliet (1968). The film attempts to draw parallels between the work and philosophy of Saint Francis and the ideology that underpinned the worldwide counterculture movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. The film is also known for the score composed by Riz Ortolani. Frank Grimes originally was offered the lead role of Francesco di Bernardone, but Zeffirelli changed his mind at the last minute and withdrew his offer. Al Pacino screen tested for the role, but Zeffirelli objected to Pacino's theatrical style. Robin Askwith revealed in his autobiography that he was cast in the film but later was fired. Lynne Frederick auditioned for the role of Clare of Assisi, and was first runner up. Candace Glendenning also tested for the role but was considered to be \\"too exotic looking\\". The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction (Lorenzo Mongiardino, Gianni Quaranta, Carmelo Patrono). Reception Brother Sun, Sister Moon received mixed reviews on its release. Roger Ebert harshly criticized the film, writing that it had \\"an excess of sweetness and light\\", and that its dialogue consisted of \\"empty, pretty phrasing\\". The New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby similarly wrote that the film \\"confuses simplicity with simple-mindedness\\". Canby contrasted it negatively with The Flowers of St. Francis, a 1950 film on the same subject. Both reviewers especially criticized the scene where Francis appears before Pope Innocent III, calling it gaudy and excessive. Ebert wrote, \\"does the Pope always have 200 divines on hand just to hold an audience for a few barefoot monks?\\" However, Christopher Hudson of The Spectator called Brother Sun, Sister Moon \\"a beautiful and simple film\\" and especially praised its cinematography, though he acknowledged \\"the limitations of the script\\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 4.9/10. Soundtrack The romantic soundtrack was by Riz Ortolani with songs by the Scottish singer- songwriter Donovan, which reflected the 'flower power' mood of Zeffirelli's film and the cinematography in particular. Donovan also sang all the songs on the soundtrack itself. The soundtrack album mainly featured Riz Ortolani's music. In 2004, Donovan re-recorded the songs from the long out-of-print soundtrack. Brother Sun, Sister Moon was released exclusively on iTunes Store.

Bresee (December 31, 1838 ‚Äì November 13, 1915) was the primary founder of the Church of the Nazarene, and founding president of Point Loma Nazarene University. Lake Junaluska, NC Early life and ministry Bresee was born on a farm near Franklin, New York, and raised there and in nearby Davenport. He was converted to Christianity in the Methodist Episcopal Church in Davenport in 1856 and delivered his first sermon later that year. He helped his family move to Iowa in 1857 and entered the Methodist Episcopal ministry in Iowa soon afterward. In 1860 he married Maria Hebbard, his sweetheart from back in New York. Bresee was a pastor in Iowa from 1857 until 1883, serving various charges including East Des Moines, Chariton, Wesley Chapel (Des Moines), Broadway Church in Council Bluffs, Red Oak, and Creston. He also served a term as a presiding elder (now district superintendent) and was a delegate to 1872 General Conference of the M. E. Church, held at Brooklyn, New York. In 1883 he relocated his large extended family (which included six children, his parents, and a nephew) to the West Coast. He was appointed to Fort Street Methodist Church (now First United Methodist Church) in Los Angeles, California, then to Pasadena First, and later to Simpson Tabernacle (L.A.), Asbury M. E. Church (L.A.) and Boyle Heights (also in L. A.). In California, he also served as a presiding elder of the Los Angeles District and as a delegate to the 1892 General Conference of his church. He had also chaired the committee that recommended Simpson College become a four‚Äìyear college, raised the money for buildings there like College Hall, now \\"the college‚Äôs primary historic landmark,\\" and served on their board of trustees for 16 years, part of that time as board president. In Los Angeles, he was a trustee for the University of Southern California and worked with J. P. Widney to save the College of Liberal Arts there.\\"Why These Schools? Historical Perspectives on Nazarene Higher Education,\\" by Stan Ingersol Church of the Nazarene In 1894 Bresee withdrew from the appointive ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church in order to serve as pastor to the Peniel Mission, an independent ministry to the homeless of Los Angeles. Over the next year, a rift opened between Bresee and the Peniel Mission's founders, Rev Theodore Pollock Ferguson and his wife, Manie Payne Ferguson. Bresee became convinced that the best ministry for the urban poor was to create strong churches that ministered to entire families. The Fergusons, the mission founders, believed that the Peniel Mission should focus, instead, on the \\"down and outer.\\" In October 1895, Bresee and Dr. Joseph Pomeroy Widney, a leading Los Angeles physician and former president of the University of Southern California, joined with numerous lay men and women to form a new church. Widney suggested the name \\"Church of the Nazarene,\\" because he said it identified the ministry with the toiling masses of common people for whom Jesus lived and died. The new church in Los Angeles prospered. In 1898 there were two new congregations in the greater San Francisco area. Widney also departed that year and returned briefly to the Methodist church before forming his own independent congregation. From 1903 on, Bresee began a process of systematic church planting, and by 1907 there were congregations of the Church of the Nazarene up and down the West Coast and as far east as Illinois. In 1907, Bresee led the Church of the Nazarene into a union with another Wesleyan-holiness denomination, the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America, a similar group that originated in New England and extended from Nova Scotia, down New England and the Middle Atlantic states, and westward to Iowa. Meeting in Chicago for their First General Assembly, the two groups formalized their merger, adopting the name Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene and electing two general superintendents (bishops)--one from the western group and one from the eastern body. Bresee was the first general superintendent elected, and he was soon joined by H. F. Reynolds of Brooklyn as the second one. The following year, at Pilot Point, Texas, the Second General Assembly of the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene was held and a southern body, the Holiness Church of Christ, merged with the Pentecostal Nazarenes. E. P. Ellyson of Texas was elected to join Bresee and Reynolds on the Board of General Superintendents. Bresee served as the senior general superintendent of the church until his death in 1915. During these years, Bresee continued serving as pastor of Los Angeles First Church of the Nazarene until 1911, when he retired from that position. And he edited the Nazarene Messenger, a large weekly paper, from 1898 until 1912. Through the paper, he rallied his people and knit strong familial bonds among the Nazarenes. When a group of women wanted to create a Bible school in Los Angeles, Bresee consented (somewhat grudgingly) to assist them, and became the president of the college, serving in that capacity until 1911. That school became known as Pasadena College until 1973, when it moved to San Diego. It has been known since as Point Loma Nazarene College and Point Loma Nazarene University.  Death  His health deteriorated in his later years from injuries suffered in a near-fatal electric car accident in 1900. Phineas F. Bresee died in 1915. References Further reading *Bangs, Carl (1995).

Bresee"},{"id":"2380653","text":"Nelson Erazo (born March 20, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name Homicide. He is currently competing on the independent circuit and for National Wrestling Alliance. He is best known for his time in Impact Wrestling, where he is a one-time X Division Champion and three-time World Tag Team Champion, having won the NWA World Tag Team Championship twice and the TNA World Tag Team Championship once with tag team partner Hernandez. He is also known from his time in Ring of Honor, where he held the World Championship once, as well as Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), where he is a one-time World Tag Team Champion and winner of the Tango & Cash Invitational tournament alongside B-Boy, and Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW), where he has held both the Heavyweight Championship and the Tag Team Championship seven times each. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1993‚Äì1997)= A native of Brooklyn, Erazo was a wrestling fan from the age of five and decided that he wanted to become a wrestler at the age of fifteen. After amassing a series of athletic qualifications including football and amateur wrestling, he was offered a scholarship to the University of Miami, which he rejected, preferring to pursue \\"fast money\\". Erazo trained himself as a wrestler in a bodega, debuting on March 5, 1993. After wrestling for three years without any formal training, Erazo attended a professional wrestling school in New Jersey operated by Manny Fernandez. Erazo worked on the independent circuit throughout the 1990s. In 1997, Erazo was part of faction called The Wrecking Crew in Bobby Lombardi's Long Island Wrestling Federation (LIWF). Then while on a year-long hiatus from wrestling, he operated a training school in Cypress Hills New York known as LIWF's \\"The Doghouse\\" along with Laithon and Lowlife Louie. The Doghouse/LIWF produced approximately 22 graduates, including a number of ROH wrestlers, such as Low Ki. Erazo also formed a tag team called The Natural Born Sinners with Boogalou (which saw Boogalou wear a Leatherface mask and Homicide wear a Michael Myers mask). =Jersey All Pro Wrestling= The Nation of Immigration (1997‚Äì1999) Homicide joined Jersey All Pro Wrestling on September 7, 1997 and quickly became a mainstay of the promotion. He formed a tag team with Kane D known as The Nation of Immigration (N.O.I.), and on March 22, 1998, The N.O.I. defeated The Sickness and The Blood Angels in a three-way tag match for the JAPW Tag Team Championship in Newark, New Jersey. They lost the title to The Skin Head Express on May 20, but regained them on August 25, defeating Russ and Charlie Haas in a weapons match. Their second reign lasted until January 29, when they lost to D-Sex. Homicide would later hold the title twice more, with Don Montoya and with B-Boy. Heavyweight Champion (1999‚Äì2005) Homicide won the JAPW Heavyweight Championship for the first time on July 9, 1999 by defeating Don Montoya in Bayonne, New Jersey. He lost the title to Chino Martinez on August 29. His second reign began when the champion, Jason, vacated the title on November 18, 2000 by no-showing the event. Homicide defeated Jay Lover for the vacant title that same night in the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. He lost the title to one of his students, Low Ki, on July 7, 2001. Three more Heavyweight Championship reigns followed in 2001 and 2002, with Homicide firmly establishing himself as a dominant player in JAPW. Homicide's increasing commitments, including tours of Japan with Big Japan Pro Wrestling and ZERO-ONE, led to a decline in his involvement in JAPW after late-2002. Dan Maff, another student of Homicide's, won the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on December 13, 2003. He held the title throughout 2004. In March 2005, however, Homicide and Maff had a legitimate falling-out, with Homicide announcing that Maff had betrayed him, and that he would refuse to work for any promotion which employed Maff. This effectively led to Maff being blacklisted from the professional wrestling indy circuit. As a result, the JAPW Heavyweight Championship was vacated. Jay Lethal had pursued the JAPW Heavyweight Championship for several months and was widely expected to be the next champion. The title was put on the line in a match between Lethal and an undisclosed opponent on March 26. The opponent was revealed to be the returning Homicide, who defeated Lethal for an unparalleled sixth JAPW Heavyweight Championship. His reign lasted until May 21, when Lethal finally won the belt in a four-way match. The following week, Homicide announced that he was temporarily leaving JAPW, but promised to go on a \\"murdering spree\\" and become a seven-time JAPW Heavyweight Champion when he returned. Return (2005‚Äì2012) Homicide at a JAPW show in 2008 On October 22, 2005, Homicide teamed with his long-term nemesis Teddy Hart to defeat the Backseat Boyz for the JAPW Tag Team Championship. Their reign lasted until November 12 of that year, when Kashmere and Acid regained the title. On June 9, 2007, Homicide and his Latin American Xchange partner Hernandez defeated Jay Lethal and Azrieal to win the JAPW Tag Team titles, which they would hold for over a year before dropping them to The Full Blooded Italians of Little Guido and Tracy Smothers on November 15, 2008. On October 27, 2007, Homicide made good on his word when he defeated Low Ki to win the JAPW Heavyweight Title for a record‚Äìsetting seventh time. He would, however, lose the title back to Low Ki that same night when Teddy Hart attacked him during a tag team match between LAX and BLKOUT, where both the Heavyweight and the Tag Team titles were on the line. On May 22, 2010, Homicide wrestled one of his biggest matches in JAPW, defeating Japanese legend Jushin Thunder Liger in the main event of the show. Homicide returned to JAPW on April 14, 2012, when he and Eddie Kingston defeated Philly's Most Wanted (Blk Jeez and Joker) to win the vacant JAPW Tag Team Championship. =Ring of Honor= Feud with Steve Corino (2002‚Äì2003) Homicide at an ROH event. Homicide's first main independent exposure came in 2002 when he was recruited by the upstart Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion. He and Boogalou wrestled on the first ever ROH show, The Era of Honor Begins, on February 23, and were defeated by the Boogie Knights, by way of DQ. The Natural Born Sinners were a dominant tag team in ROH, beating The Carnage Crew at the July 27 Crowning a Champion event, and also won at the August 24 Honor Invades Boston event, defeating Tony Mamaluke and James Maritato. After Boogalou suffered an injury and then jumped ship to Rob Black's Xtreme Pro Wrestling promotion, Homicide appeared alone at Glory by Honor. Responding to a challenge from The Backseat Boyz, he invited anyone in the locker room to be his partner. Steve Corino responded to his offer, and Corino and Homicide faced the Backseat Boys later that night. In the course of the match, Corino turned on Homicide after Homicide accidentally hit him, superkicking his partner and leaving the ring, enabling the Backseat Boyz to easily defeat Homicide. Homicide and Corino would begin a four-year rivalry, with Corino criticizing Homicide's lifestyle and somewhat checkered past. The feud culminated in a match at the One Year Anniversary Show on February 8, 2003 in Queens, New York. Homicide was the hometown favorite, but lost to Corino following interference from The Group, Corino's entourage. After the match, Corino applied a cobra sleeper to Homicide, instigating a worked riot. After regaining some momentum by defeating Christopher Daniels on the April 12 ROH event, The Epic Encounter, Homicide defeated CM Punk in a match for the number one contendership on April 26 at Retribution: Round Robin Challenge II. Homicide faced ROH World Champion Samoa Joe on May 31 at Do or Die, hoping not only to win the title, but to gain revenge on Joe for helping Corino defeat him in his hometown. Despite the support of his manager, Julius Smokes, and his close friend and former student, Low Ki, Homicide lost to Joe, after getting distracted by Smokes and Ki arguing outside the ring. Homicide was undefeated in ROH throughout June and July, and on August 16, 2003, at Bitter Friends, Stiffer Enemies he defeated Corino in a rematch of their February encounter. After twenty minutes of fighting which saw both men bleeding and carrying injuries, Homicide trapped Corino in a modified STF, prompting Corino's corner man, Guillotine LaGrande, to throw in the towel, awarding the match to Homicide. In the course of the match, Corino suffered a legitimate ruptured eardrum, and permanently lost most of the hearing in his left ear following a stiff slap to the side of the head from Homicide. Following high- profile victories over Samoa Joe and B.J. Whitmer, Homicide faced Corino for a third time on November 29, 2003, at War of the Wire in a barbed wire match. This time Julius Smokes threw in the towel for Homicide after Corino throttled him with a length of barbed wire. Corino offered Homicide a handshake after the match, indicating that he finally respected Homicide, but Homicide refused to shake his hand. The Rottweilers (2004) Homicide faced A.J. Styles at The Battle Lines Are Drawn on January 10, 2004. After Styles was thrown from the ring, Homicide dove over the top rope in pursuit and landed in the third row of the audience, briefly knocking himself unconscious and injuring his shoulder and ribs. Styles quickly capitalized on Homicide's vulnerabilities, defeating him following a Styles Clash. After defeating CM Punk at The Last Stand, Homicide took a hiatus from Ring of Honor to \\"find himself\\", sending word through Julius Smokes that when he returned, he wanted a shot at Samoa Joe and the ROH Heavyweight Championship. Homicide challenged Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship once more at Reborn: Stage 1 on April 23. Homicide showed signs of anger and frustration throughout the match, and after he scored what appeared to be a three count with a roll-up, but what the referee of the match ruled only a two count, he turned into a villainous character by knocking him out. As the recovered Joe went to attack Homicide, the lights in the arena went out and in the darkness Homicide threw a fireball at Joe, which led to him getting disqualified in the match. After the match, Homicide attacked referees and wrestlers who came to the ring to aid the badly burned Joe, before being apprehended by the rest of the locker room. In subsequent weeks, Homicide defeated fan favorites Bryan Danielson and Spanky, cheating and threatening referees in both matches. Homicide faced Joe for the ROH Heavyweight Championship for a third time on May 22 at Generation Next, with Joe retaining in a match which saw him bleed for the first time in ROH. Homicide and Joe continued to feud throughout the summer of 2004, with Homicide recruiting a stable known as The Rottweilers (originally Low Ki, Ricky Reyes, Rocky Romero and Julius Smokes) to help him defeat Joe. Despite the best efforts of The Rottweilers, Joe defeated Homicide to retain his title in a fourth match on July 23 at Death Before Dishonor II: Night 1. The Rottweilers worked as a unit throughout the remainder of 2004, helping one another win matches. Best of Five Series and feud with Jay Lethal (2005) In January 2005 Homicide began a \\"best of five\\" series with American Dragon. Homicide was victorious in the first two matches, a submission match and a taped fist match, but lost the remaining three matches - a falls count anywhere match, a lumberjack match and a steel cage match at The Final Showdown on May 13, 2005. Following his loss to American Dragon, Homicide and the Rottweilers began a feud with Jay Lethal. On May 7 at Manhattan Mayhem, Homicide and Low Ki teamed together to defeat Lethal and Samoa Joe. Lethal was stretchered from the arena wearing a neck brace, apparently badly injured. With Lethal injured, Homicide turned his attentions to James Gibson, whom he defeated on June 12 at The Future Is Now. After the match, The Rottweilers continued to attack Gibson until Lethal made his return and saved Gibson. This led to a match between Lethal and Homicide on July 9 at Escape from New York, which Homicide won. On July 23 at The Homecoming, Homicide and two fellow Rottweilers (Low Ki and Ricky Reyes) defeated Samoa Joe, James Gibson and Jay Lethal in a six-man tag match. Low Ki fought Lethal to a no contest on August 12 at Redemption, after Homicide came to ringside after the match to attack Lethal. His plan was foiled by Matt Hardy, who intercepted Homicide and then defeated him in a scheduled singles bout. On August 13 at Punk: The Final Chapter, Lethal and Samoa Joe defeated Homicide and Low Ki by disqualification after Homicide elbow-dropped the referee. From that point on, Lethal began feuding primarily with Low Ki. Feud with Colt Cabana (2005‚Äì2006) At Unforgettable on October 2 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Homicide teamed with Japanese wrestler Kenta Kobashi to defeat Samoa Joe and his stablemate Low Ki. Homicide teamed with Low Ki on October 14 at Enter the Dragon in a match that saw him lose to Cabana and his old rival Steve Corino, newly returned to the promotion. He faced Cabana in a singles match at Vendetta on November 5 that ended in a no contest. On November 19 at A Night of Tribute, Homicide faced Cabana once again in a no disqualification rematch. Following interference from Julius Smokes and Grim Reefer, Homicide forced Cabana to submit by strangling him with a coat hanger. On December 3 in New York City at Steel Cage Warfare, Homicide lost to Corino in a rematch from their feud of 2003. During the match, Homicide separated his shoulder, but opted not to have surgery. As a result of his injury, Homicide was unable to compete at the following show, Final Battle 2005. He did show up, however, but with the intent on killing Steve Corino. Following Corino's match, Homicide ran down to the ring and attacked him. Colt Cabana ran down to the ring to save Corino, only to have Homicide pour Drano down his throat. On January 14, at ROH's Hell Freezes Over Homicide lost the Full Impact Pro Heavyweight Championship to Bryan Danielson in a three-way match which also included Roderick Strong, ending his reign of over 15 months. On February 25 at the Fourth Anniversary Show, Homicide defeated Cabana in a \\"Ghetto Fight\\". Homicide went on to defeat Cabana once again on March 31. On April 1, in a Chicago Street Fight, Cabana finally defeated Homicide. Following the match, Homicide and Cabana embraced, with Cabana having won Homicide's respect. Ring of Homicide (2006) Throughout mid-2006, Homicide resisted Combat Zone Wrestling's (CZW) invasion of Ring of Honor until May 13, 2006, when he defeated Necro Butcher after a wild brawl in Edison, New Jersey, which involved over 600 chairs being thrown into the ring by the fans. He also challenged Bryan Danielson for the ROH World Championship on June 3, but lost due to referee stoppage, prompting Homicide to attack referee Todd Sinclair. After defeating Chris Hero, the leader of the CZW invasion, on June 17, Homicide said he would quit Ring of Honor if he did not win the ROH World Championship by the end of the year. His frustration with Ring of Honor grew when he was counted-out during an ROH Pure Championship bout with Nigel McGuinness on June 24. On July 15, Homicide took part in a five-on-five Cage of Death match pitting members of the Ring of Honor roster against members of the CZW roster, winning the bout for his team by pinning Nate Webb. Following the match, Homicide told Ring of Honor commissioner Jim Cornette that he wished to be rewarded with a shot at the ROH World Championship, a match with Steve Corino and the re-instatement of Low Ki, who Cornette had suspended several months earlier. After Cornette granted the first two \\"wishes\\" but refused to bring back Low Ki, Homicide spat in his face, prompting Cornette and his bodyguard, Adam Pearce, to beat Homicide down. A match was scheduled for August 5 between Homicide and Pearce, which eventually turned into a tag team match involving Homicide, BJ Whitmer, Steve Corino and Adam Pearce. Homicide then began teaming with Samoa Joe against the Briscoes. His feud with Jim Cornette came to an abrupt end, when Cornette left Ring of Honor on November 4, 2006. On November 25, Homicide and Samoa Joe beat the Briscoes in a Street Fight, thus ending their feud. Homicide then focused on facing Bryan Danielson for the ROH World Championship at Final Battle 2006. He stated that if he did not win the ROH World Title at Final Battle, he would leave ROH. On December 23, Homicide defeated Bryan Danielson in 29:12 to win the ROH title. Adam Pearce and Shane Hagadorn attacked Homicide at one point and it was stopped, but the ref refused to end it on a DQ. At another point, Danielson would not break on the ropes and again the ref refused to call a DQ. Danielson even managed to get his hand on the rope after a Cop Killa. Homicide finally won with a lariat. World Championship reign and farewell (2007) Homicide in 2008 Homicide defended successfully against Chris Hero and Samoa Joe on January 26 and 27. Homicide then successfully defended the championship against Jimmy Rave on February 16 in the same building where he won the belt, the Manhattan Center in New York City. The next evening, however, in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania National Guard Armory, Homicide was defeated for the ROH World Championship by Takeshi Morishima, a Japanese professional wrestler visiting the United States. The two would compete against each other again at Fifth Year Festival: Chicago, when Homicide teamed with Samoa Joe to face Morishima and Nigel McGuinness. On March 30, 2007, Homicide won a match against Christopher Daniels at All Star Extravaganza 3. After the match, Jim Cornette returned alongside Adam Pearce and Shane Hagadorn and they delivered a beating to Homicide until Colt Cabana and Delirious made the save. The next night, Homicide in a surprise match teamed with Colt Cabana for the first time to defeat Brent Albright and Adam Pearce at Supercard of Honor 2. On May 2, 2007, Ring of Honor announced on their website that they had signed a Pay-per- view deal with G-Funk Sports & Entertainment. Following the announcement, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pulled Homicide and Austin Aries, both under contracts with TNA, from all Ring of Honor shows. Homicide competed in what was to become his final match at Good Times, Great Memories held on April 28, a Four Corners Survival match against Brent Albright, B.J. Whitmer and Jimmy Rave. At Respect is Earned on May 12, the night ROH taped their first pay-per- view, Homicide returned to deliver a farewell speech in front of his hometown crowd of New York City. The Latin American Xchange (2008) Over a year later, Homicide returned to ROH as part of the TNA tag team LAX, replacing The Motor City Machine Guns who were originally booked. On October 24, 2008 in Danbury, Connecticut, Homicide and his partner Hernandez won a four-way, non- title Iron Team match against Kevin Steen and El Generico, Sweet 'n' Sour Inc.'s Chris Hero and Davey Richards and The Age of the Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black).

On November 19, 2006, LAX defeated America's Most Wanted (AMW) to retain the NWA World Tag Title at Genesis. On December 10, 2006 LAX defeated AMW in a non-title flag match at Turning Point. Homicide (right) and Hernandez after TNA show in Brentwood, Essex (2008) LAX went on to defend the tag title against Team 3D at Final Resolution, without Konnan at ringside - who was beaten down by Team 3D (in a kayfabe angle to explain Konnan's absence for surgery) - and retained after Brother Runt, dressed like Santa Claus and apparently drunk, gave a diving headbutt to Homicide, and caused Team 3D to be disqualified. On February 27 edition of Impact!, LAX attacked Johnny Rodz as they were in New York. This was done in retaliation to the attack on Konnan, as was the attack on Brother Ray's uncle a few weeks previous. Johnny Rodz was the man who trained Brother Devon to be a wrestler. Team 3D, in retaliation to that, then made a challenge to LAX, offering to face them at Destination X in a Ghetto Brawl. LAX accepted the offer and defeated Team 3D at the event. LAX later challenged Team 3D to an electrified steel-cage match at Lockdown, at which LAX lost the NWA World Tag Team Championship to Team 3D.

On the September 10 edition of Impact!, Homicide turned heel by attacking Hernandez and joining World Elite (Eric Young, Sheik Abdul Bashir, Kiyoshi and the British Invasion), thus signaling the end of the Latin American Xchange. Afterwards Homicide's character became an uncontrollable loose cannon, attacking anyone from his opponents to announcers and referees after his matches, rarely being seen with the other members of World Elite. On the October 22 edition of Impact! Homicide defeated the X Division Champion Amazing Red to earn himself a return match for the title at Turning Point. At the Pay-Per-View Red defeated Homicide to retain his title. On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night edition of Impact!

After the match Homicide also attacked Jeff Hardy, who made his return to the company after a four-year absence, but ended up being laid out after a chair shot and the Twist of Fate. This event would also mark the last time World Elite was mentioned on TNA television. After spending the next couple of months wrestling mainly on Xplosion, Homicide returned to Impact! on March 22, showing signs of a face turn when he came out to check on his former partner Hernandez, who was being helped by medics after he had been laid out by his new World Tag Team Championship partner Matt Morgan. At Lockdown Homicide defeated Brian Kendrick, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin in a four-way Xscape match to earn the right to challenge for the vacant X Division Championship in a three-way match against Kazarian and Shannon Moore, later in the night.

In the main event of the third pay-per- view Street King, a four-way elimination match for the UWF Championship, Homicide managed to eliminate Bestia, before being eliminated himself by Ricky Reyes. Eventually, Rasche Brown went on to become the inaugural champion. On June 29, 2012, Homicide took part in Extreme Rising promotion's first event in Corona, New York, defeating Devon Storm. On November 17 at Remember November, Homicide was defeated by Rhino in the first round of the Extreme Rising World Championship tournament. On June 23, 2013, Homicide and Eddie Kingston were defeated by the Steiner Brothers at a House of Hardcore event. On November 9, Homicide and Kingston were defeated by Devon and Matt Hardy at House of Hardcore 3. On September 19, 2014, Homicide returned to Chikara, when he, Hernandez and Chavo Guerrero, Jr., representing LAX, took part in the 2014 King of Trios. They were eliminated from the tournament in the first round by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus and Mark Angelosetti). =Return to ROH (2010‚Äì2013)= On September 11, 2010, Homicide made his return to Ring of Honor at the live Glory By Honor IX pay-per-view, where he confronted Roderick Strong, who had just defeated Tyler Black for the ROH World Championship. On October 1 Homicide wrestled his first match since his release from TNA, defeating Tony Kozina at a Ring of Honor Wrestling taping. On December 18 Homicide made his ROH pay-per-view debut at Final Battle 2010, where he defeated ROH World Television Champion Christopher Daniels in a non‚Äìtitle match to earn a shot at the ROH World Championship at the following pay-per- view. Homicide received his shot at the ROH World Championship on February 26, 2011, at 9th Anniversary Show, but was unable to regain the title from Roderick Strong in a No Holds Barred match. On March 19 at Manhattan Mayhem IV, The Latin American Xchange wrestled their first match together in 19 months, when they faced the ROH World Tag Team Champions, The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) in a losing effort. Homicide then began feuding with The Embassy, suffering an upset loss against Tommaso Ciampa on April 2 at Honor Takes Center Stage, albeit following outside interference from Princess Mia. After the match Homicide threw a steel chair at the Embassy's barrister R.D. Evans. Homicide faced Ciampa in a rematch on May 6, but was defeated again following outside interference from Mia and a brass knuckles shot from Ciampa. Afterwards, Homicide took out his frustrations on Embassy member Ernesto Osiris. Following the event, R.D. Evans filed a storyline lawsuit against Homicide, accusing him of attempted murder, assault and battery, attempted sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On June 26 at Best in the World 2011, Homicide defeated Embassy's newest member Rhino in a Street Fight. The event marked Homicide's final appearance for ROH as he had signed an exclusive contract with the Urban Wrestling Federation. Homicide returned to ROH on September 17 at the Death Before Dishonor IX internet pay-per-view, as his UWF contract prohibited him only from working television shows and regular pay-per-views. At the event, Homicide teamed with fellow TNA alum and ROH World Television Champion Jay Lethal in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Embassy representatives Rhino and Tommaso Ciampa, when Ciampa pinned Homicide. Homicide's next ROH appearance took place on March 4, 2012, at the 10th Anniversary Show, where he was defeated by Mike Bennett. At the May 18 tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Homicide returned to ROH, saving Eddie Edwards from Mike Bennett and \\"Brutal\\" Bob Evans, before turning on him and laying him out with Da Cop Killa. On June 24 at Best in the World 2012: Hostage Crisis, Homicide defeated Edwards in a singles match. As a result, Homicide was granted a shot at the ROH World Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Kevin Steen, on August 3. On August 17, 2013, Homicide returned to ROH, forming a new tag team with Eddie Kingston. In their return match, the two defeated Marshall Law (Q.T. Marshall and R.D. Evans). Following the main event of the evening, Homicide and Kingston attacked new ROH World Tag Team Champions, reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly), before announcing their intention of taking down \\"corporate ROH\\" and revealing their team name as \\"Outlaw Inc.\\". Homicide and Kingston, however, claimed that they had come to ROH to help Match Maker Nigel McGuinness and take out those they felt were bad for the promotion. As part of the gimmick, Homicide and Kingston wore suits and followed the Code of Honor. After defeating The American Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) on November 16, Outlaw Inc. were named the next challengers for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. Outlaw Inc. received their title shot on December 14 at Final Battle 2013, but were defeated by reDRagon. Post-match, Homicide announced that they were no longer going to play by ROH's rules. =Dragon Gate USA (2010‚Äì2011)= On October 29 at the Bushido: Code of the Warrior pay-per-view, Homicide made his debut for Dragon Gate USA, in a match, where he, representing the World‚Äì1 stable, defeated Rich Swann. Afterwards, Homicide was attacked backstage by Jon Moxley, a member of the rival Kamikaze USA stable. At the following day's tapings of Freedom Fight 2010, Homicide and his World‚Äì1 stable mate BxB Hulk defeated Kamikaze USA's Jon Moxley and Akira Tozawa in a tag team match. After the match both Homicide and Hulk were laid out by Kamikaze USA. On January 30, 2011, at United: Finale Homicide faced Moxley in a No Rules match. Homicide dominated the match, before suddenly allowing Moxley to pin himself for the win. After the match Homicide explained that he did not care about winning or losing and continued to attack Moxley, before he was saved by Akira Tozawa. =Return to TNA (2013‚Äì2015)= On March 17, 2013, Homicide returned to TNA to take part in the tapings of the 10 Reunion One Night Only pay-per-view, teaming with Hernandez in a three-way tag team match, where they were defeated by Team 3D and which also included Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian). Two days later, LAX defeated The Disciples of the New Church (Sinn and Slash) at the tapings of the Hardcore Justice 2 pay-per-view. Homicide made another return to TNA on July 18 to take part in the Destination X episode of Impact Wrestling. Entering a tournament to determine the new X Division Champion, he was defeated by Sonjay Dutt in a first round three-way match, which also included Petey Williams. Homicide returned to TNA on June 26, 2014, to take part in the tapings of Destination X, losing to Samoa Joe in a three-way match, which also included Tigre Uno. Following the taping, it was reported that Homicide was back in TNA full-time going forward. On the April 10, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling, Homicide returned to attacking The Rising and joining The Beat Down Clan, most likely to replace Samoa Joe who had left the company. The following week on Impact Wrestling, Homicide was assigned by MVP to attack Kurt Angle, which led to a backstage brawl spilling into the ring which caused both The BDC and The Rising to get involved. Then Homicide suffered a shoulder injury. During his injury, The Beat Down Clan was dissolved on July 15, 2015. Homicide's profile on the Impactwrestling.com roster page was moved to the alumni section on July 24, confirming his departure from the company. = Second return to Impact Wrestling (2017‚Äì2018) = On March 16, 2017 episode of Impact, Homicide returned with Konnan, reforming The Latin American Xchange (LAX) alongside newcomers Ortiz, Santana and Diamante. On the July 5, 2018 episode of Impact, he turned on LAX by forming an alliance with King and his former tag team partner Hernandez, turning heel in the process. They later became known as The OGz. At the Bound for Glory on October 14, The OGz lost to LAX in a Concrete Jungle Death match. After several months, Homicide was moved to alumni section of the website. = National Wrestling Alliance (2019‚Äìpresent) = Homicide debuted for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) at their television tapings on September 30 for NWA Power. At the tapings he formed an alliance with Eddie Kingston.https://411mania.com/wrestling/spoilers-from-first-nwa-power-taping/ Personal life Erazo hoisting the flag of Puerto Rico. Erazo is a member of the large Puerto Rican community in New York, colloquially known as \\"Nuyoricans\\". He initially wrestled as The Latin Terror, a reference to his Latin American ethnicity. However, Erazo grew bored with the gimmick in 1995 and decided to create a new character based on his own past. He had been a gang member as a youth, and he incorporated this into the Homicide character, taking his ring name from an episode of America's Most Wanted where a man was arrested for the crime of homicide. Erazo has subsequently stated that he represents both \\"New York and Puerto Rico\\", frequently implementing the flag of Puerto Rico into his wrestling apparel and often carrying it unmodified to the ring. Outside of professional wrestling, Erazo was married in 1994 and is the father of two children, a son and a daughter.

Cruel became popular when it was published as video game for Microsoft Windows by Microsoft in 1990 as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.0. Cruel has since been remade for other platforms by several vendors. Rules Cruel uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The aces are placed face up to act as the foundations, upon which the suits will be built in sequence. The rest of the cards are shuffled and then dealt in 12 tableau piles, each with four cards. The aim of the game is to place all the cards on the foundation piles, ordered from ace to king, using an unlimited number of moves. For each move the player chooses any one of the top (exposed) cards from a tableau pile and places it either: * on another tableau pile ‚Äì on the next higher value in the same suit (for example, the 5‚ô£ can be placed on the 6‚ô£), or * on a foundation pile ‚Äì on the next lower value in the same suit (for example, the 8‚ô£ can be placed on the 7‚ô£). Only one card may be moved at a time. At any time the player may have the tableau piles re-dealt, whereby they are collected together in sequence (from left to right, row by row) without shuffling and dealt in piles of four. This is activated by the \\"Deal\\" button. The game is won when all the cards are on the foundation piles. The game is lost if no more moves are possible even if re-dealt.

Following Takeda Shingen's death, Baba served his successor Takeda Katsuyori. He led the Takeda army's right-wing in the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, and was killed in combat during that engagement.

WEBrick was primarily written by Masayoshi TakahashiGnome's guide to WEBrick and Yuuzou Gotou, with contributions from other developers via the open-source model of software development. It uses basic access authentication and digest access authentication for different kinds of servers that it can create - HTTP based server, HTTPS server, proxy server and virtual-host server.Investigating the impacts of web servers on web application energy usage - IEEE Construction of several non-HTTP servers such as the Day Time Server which uses the Daytime Protocol rather than the HTTP is also facilitated by WEBrick. It is used by the Ruby on Rails and Padrino frameworks to test applications in a development environment as well as production mode for small loads. It is now a part of Ruby standard library. History WEBrick has originated from an idea in an article named \\"Internet Programming with Ruby\\" in Open Design, a Japanese Engineering magazine. It was initially developed as a toolkit for the development of HTTP servers using Ruby. Due to the nature of open source model and contributions from several Ruby developers across the world, WEBrick was greatly augmented and was eventually bundled as a standard library from Ruby 1.8.0. The WEBrick ERB Handler and WEBrick Proxy Server were first introduced in Ruby 1.9.3, while the WEBrick Virtual Host was included from Ruby 2.0.0. Usage A WEBrick server understands only the language of servlets. It uses multiple independent servlets, joined together by the programmer, for handling CGI scripts, ERB pages, Ruby Blocks and directory listings to provide a web application or to service a request URI on a per-host or per-path basis. For example, HTTPServlet::FileHandler, HTTPServlet::ProcHandler, HTTPServlet::CGIHandler, HTTPServlet::ERBHandler are the examples of the standard servlets that WEBrick comes with. WEBrick is included in Ruby and hence is available to the user at no additional cost. WEBrick has been written completely in Ruby and supports several standards such as HTTP, HTML and even RHTML. During the development stage, there is no necessity for the installation of a discrete web server since WEBrick is already built into the Rails framework. It is the default web server when the Ruby application is deployed without any procfile on Rails. Furthermore, since being implemented entirely in Ruby, direct calls can be made from WEBrick to the Rails application. On the whole, it provides a reliable, low configuration option for testing in development. Instantiating servers =Instantiating an HTTP server= The following commands are used to start an HTTP Server at the required port. # Include WEBrick class with require require 'webrick' # FileHandler servlet provides the option to choose which files from user to serve # The following code shows how to serve them from the folder 'myapp' root = File.expand_path '/var/myapp/' # Instantiating a new server with HTTPServer.new on port 1234 serving the documents from root folder server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new :Port => 1234, :DocumentRoot => root # The following proc is used to customize the server operations server.mount_proc '/' do request, response response.body = 'Hello, world!' end # The following command will provide a hook to shut down the server (often done with Ctrl+C) trap('INT') {server.shutdown} # Start the server server.start Servlets can be mounted to provide advanced custom behavior as compared to a proc,proc to increase the modularity. =Starting a virtual host= WEBrick creates a listening port. Various other ports as ‚Äòvirtual hosts‚Äô can also be created at the same time which do not listen as shown below: #Creating a virtual host that doesn't listen vhost = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new :ServerName => 'vhost.example', :DoNotListen => true, # ... # Mounting the virtual host created above similar to the way HTTP server was mounted vhost.mount '/', ... # This host, when mounted to the listening server host, will now act as a virtual host server.virtual_host vhost :DocumentRoot should be provided or an instance of a servlet should be set up to service a request URI; otherwise a 404 error will be returned. =Instantiating an HTTPS server= By just enabling SSL and providing an SSL certificate name, an HTTPS server can be initiated with a self-signed certificate that changes with every restart of the server. # In addition to webrick, we will require webrick/https too for SSL functionalities require 'webrick' require 'webrick/https' # Providing certificate name. This, however, will be a self-generated self-signed certificate cert_name = [%w[CN localhost],] # Enabling SSL and providing the certificate name will instantiate HTTPS server server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 1234, :SSLEnable => true, :SSLCertName => cert_name) However, a pre-determined key and certificate can also be provided for instantiating HTTPS Server as shown below: # In addition to the above two, we'll need openssl to read SSL certificates and keys require 'openssl' # Read the saved certificate and its signature key from the local directory cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new File.read '/var/myapp/cert.pem' pkey = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new File.read '/var/myapp/pkey.pem' # Pass the certificate and the key as separate parameters while instantiating with HTTPServer.new server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port => 1234, :SSLEnable => true, :SSLCertificate => cert, :SSLPrivateKey => pkey) =Starting a proxy server= WEBrick can also proxy GET, HEAD and POST requests: # Instantiating a proxy server is similar, except that it is handled by HTTPProxyServer servlet require 'webrick/httpproxy' proxy = WEBrick::HTTPProxyServer.new :Port => 1234 # Providing the hook out from the current thread trap 'INT' do proxy.shutdown end Limitations Unlike most of the servers that are used in production, WEBrick is not scalable since it is a single threaded web server by default.Heroku Ruby default web server Hence, multiple requests at the same time cannot be handled and the subsequent requests would have to wait till all the previous requests have been handled, incurring a large delay. Hence, developers prefer other multi-threaded full-fledged web servers like Lighttpd and Mongrel for deploying their Rails applications.NetBeans Ruby and Rails IDE with JRuby (FirstPress) By Chris Kutler, Brian Leonard See also * Mongrel (web server) * Apache * nginx * Lighttpd References  External links  * Gnome's Guide to WEBrick * Ruby Standard Library doc - WEBrick * WEBrick High Performance Category:Free web server software Category:Ruby (programming language) Category:Web server software for Linux ","title":"WEBrick"},{"id":"2380675","text":"A variety of isomers of methyl indole derivatives are known: *1-methylindole *2-methylindole *skatole (3-methylindole) *4-methylindole *5-methylindole *6-methylindole *7-methylindole External links * ","title":"Methylindole"},{"id":"2380680","text":"The TVR Sagaris is a sports car designed and built by the British manufacturer TVR in their factory in Blackpool, Lancashire. Overview TVR Sagaris rear Front view in British racing green The Sagaris made its debut at the MPH03 Auto Show in 2003. The pre-production model was then shown at the 2004 Birmingham Motor Show. In 2005, the production model was released for public sale at TVR dealerships around the world. Based on the TVR T350,\\"TVR Sagaris  First Drives\\" March 2005, retrieved on 2009-05-08 the Sagaris was designed with endurance racing in mind. The multitude of air vents, intake openings, and other features on the bodywork allow the car to be driven for extended periods of time on race tracks with no modifications required for cooling and ventilation. The final production model came with several variations from the pre-production show models, e.g. the vents on the wings are not cut out, different wing mirrors, location of the fuel filler, and bonnet hinges (along with other variations). As with all the TVRs of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Sagaris ignores the European Union guideline that all new cars should be fitted with ABS and at least front airbags, because Peter Wheeler believed that such devices promote overconfidence and risk the life of a driver in the event of a rollover‚Äîwhich TVRs are engineered to resist.\\"The Wheeler Interview: Ted quizzes TVR's Chairman on ABS, airbags and safety\\" 18 April 2004, retrieved on 2009-01-31 It also eschews electronic driver's aids (such as traction control or electronic stability control). The car's name comes from the sagaris, the Greek name of a lightweight battle-axe used by the Scythians, which was feared for its ability to penetrate the armor of their enemies. The car was designed by Graham Browne. Daniel Boardman, the Chief Engineer involved in the Sagaris project, was frustrated with well-known TVR quality issues, such as: water ingress, carpets coming unstuck, and tricky handling. Boardman spent considerable time ensuring the Sagaris was engineered properly from the start. The suspension was designed to eliminate bump-steer, the dampers were tuned with input from the Bilstein and Multimatic, the bonnet was redesigned to work as well as any conventional steel bonnet, and door seals were meticulously checked to ensure no water ingress. Motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson described the resulting product as ‚Äúthe best TVR ever made.‚Äù In 2008, TVR unveiled the Sagaris 2, which was designed to replace the original Sagaris. The prototype had minor changes to the original car, including a revised rear fascia and exhaust system, and modifications to the interior.

It was used most frequently in the Kingdom of Hungary, and also in the Habsburg Monarchy. The term was derived from the Latinized name for the central Serbian region of Ra≈°ka (; ). In medieval and early modern Western sources, exonym Rascia was often used as a designation for Serbian lands in general, and consequently the term Rasciani became one of the most common designations for Serbs. Because of the increasing migratory concentration of Serbs in the southern Pannonian Plain, since the late 15th century, those regions also became referred to as Rascia, since they were largely inhabited by Rasciani (Rascians). Among those regions, term Rascia (Ra≈°ka) was most frequently used for territories spanning from western Banat to central Slavonia, including the regions of Syrmia, Baƒçka, and southern Baranja. From the 16th to the 18th century, those regions were contested between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, and today they belong to several modern countries (Serbia, Romania, Hungary, Croatia). Approximate territory, according to various sources, ethnographically identified as new \\"Rascia\\" between the 16th and 18th centuries In a wider perspective, the term was also used for some other related South Slavic groups of the Habsburg Monarchy, such as the Catholic Bunjevci and ≈†okci (designated as \\"Catholic Rascians\\"). Although they were certainly mostly Serbs, the term Rascians has wider meaning and includes all southern Slavs except Bulgarians. The reason for this is very mixed terminology of individual nations and ethnic groups immigrated to Hungary. They were distinguished by their religion as the \\"Catholic Rascians\\" Dalmatians, or as they are today called Bunjevci (which are they were originally from Dalmatia). Rascians mostly became Serbs but in Hungary there are and Rascian Croats.Ladislav Heka, 2019, The Vlach law and its comparison to the privileges of Hungarian brigands, https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id;_clanak_jezik=325892 #page=32 Etymology The demonym ; ; ; , anglicized as \\"Rascians\\".

History Ethnic territory of the Serbs and other South Slavs in the Pannonian Plain between the 16th and 18th centuries (according to Jovan Cvijiƒá and Du≈°an J. Popoviƒá) The defeats at the hand of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century forced the Serbs to rely on the neighbouring states, especially Hungary. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbian territories in 1439, Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá fled to the Kingdom of Hungary where he was given a large territory in southern Pannonia, while his son Grgur ruled Serbia as an Ottoman vassal until his removal in 1441. ƒêuraƒë's daughter Katarina of Celje (1434‚Äì56) held Slavonia. Having picked the losing side in the Hungarian civil war, the Brankoviƒá dynasty were stripped of their estates in Hungary upon Matthias Corvinus' coronation in 1458. Left on its own, the Serbian Despotate lost the capital, Smederevo, to the Ottomans in 1459. Serbs migrated to Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Zeta, and in larger numbers to Hungary, where the immigrants were well- received. Many Hungarians left the frontier for the safer interior, leaving the southern Hungarian kingdom almost abandoned. The settlement of Serbs in Syrmia, Baƒçka, Banat and Pomori≈°je strengthened the Hungarian hold of these sparse areas, most exposed to Ottoman expansion. Following the Ottoman conquest, a large part of the Serbian nobility were killed, while what survived crossed into Hungary, bringing their subjects, including many farmer families, with them. Matthias Corvinus complained in a letter from 1462 that 200,000 peoples during the previous three years had been taken from his country by Turks, this information was used as a reference for Serbian migration to Hungary.Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá, 2004, The Serbs, https://books.google.hr/books/about/The_Serbs.html?id=Ki1icLbr_QQC&redir;_esc=y #page=115 Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá, –°–µ–æ–±–∞ –°—Ä–±–∞ —É –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤–∏–Ω—É –£–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫—É —É XIV –∏ XV –≤–µ–∫—É, (Migration of the Serbian people to the Kingdom of Hungary in the fourteenth and fifteenth century){\\"–£ —ò–µ–¥–Ω–æ–º –ø–∏—Å–º—É –í–µ–Ω–µ—Ü–∏—ò–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–º–∞ –∏–∑ 1462. –∫—Ä–∞—ô —Å–µ –∂–∞–ª–∏–æ –¥–∞ —Å—É —É –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–∫–ª–µ —Ç—Ä–∏ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ, –¥–∞–∫–ª–µ –æ–¥ 1459, –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏ –∏–∑ —ö–µ–≥–æ–≤–µ –∑–µ–º—ô–µ –æ–¥–≤—É–∫–ª–∏ –≤–∏—à–µ –æ–¥ 200.000 —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞.

(I have to mention here that due to misunderstandings in the old Hungarian original collection, this number was used as a reference to the Serbs who immigrated to Hungary. This information was taken by Konstantin Jireƒçek, then Aleksa Ivic, and later repeated many times, and this error will be difficult and slow corrected} https://www.rastko.rs/rastko- hu/istorija/istorija/Cirkovic_Seobe.html King Matthias won over Vuk Grgureviƒá in 1465 and proclaimed him a duke over Serbs in Syrmia and the surroundings, which intensified Serb migration; showing his military prowess with bands of Serb warriors, Vuk was proclaimed Serbian Despot in 1471 (thereby restoring the title). The Serbian Despot's army participated in the Ottoman-Hungarian Wars, penetrating into Ottoman territory, which saw large numbers of Serbs retreating with the Hungarian army. A letter of King Matthias from 12 January 1483 mentions that 200,000 Serbs had settled the Hungarian kingdom in the last four years. Despot Vuk and his warriors were greatly rewarded with estates, also including places in Croatia. Also, by this time, the Jak≈°iƒá family had become increasingly notable, and held estates stretching over several counties in the kingdom. The territory of Vuk Grgureviƒá (1471‚Äì85), the Serbian Despot in Hungarian service (as \\"Despot of the Kingdom of Rascia\\"), was called \\"Little Rascia\\". Since the 15th century, the Serbs made up a large percentage of the population on the territory of present-day Vojvodina. Because of this, many historical sources and maps, which were written and drawn between 15th and 18th centuries, mention the territory under the names of Rascia (Ra≈°ka, Serbia) and Little Rascia (Mala Ra≈°ka, Little Serbia). =Between Ottomans and Habsburgs= The Map of Gerardus Mercator from 1590, using the name \\"Rascia\\" as designation for the region of Banat Map from 1609, using the name \\"Rascia\\" as designation for the region of lower Slavonia After 1526, many Serbs (called \\"Rascians\\") settled in Slavonia. In 1526‚Äì27, Jovan Nenad ruled a territory of southern Pannonia during the Hungarian throne struggle; After his death (1527), his commander Radoslav ƒåelnik ruled Syrmia as an Ottoman and Habsburg vassal until 1532, when he retreated to Slavonia with the Ottoman conquest. Many of the Syrmian Serbs then settled the Kingdom of Hungary. A 1542 document describes that \\"Serbia\\" stretched from Lipova and Timi»ôoara to the Danube, while a 1543 document that Timi»ôoara and Arad being located \\"in the middle of Rascian land\\" (in medio Rascianorum). At that time, the majority language in the region between Mure»ô and K√∂r√∂s was indeed Serbian. Apart from Serbian being the main language of the Banat population, there were 17 Serbian monasteries active in Banat at that time. The territory of Banat had received a Serbian character and was called \\"Little Rascia\\". In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose up against the Ottomans, during the Long Turkish War (1593‚Äì1606) which was fought at the Austrian-Ottoman border in the Balkans. The Serbian patriarchate and rebels had established relations with foreign states, and had in a short time captured several towns, including Vr≈°ac, Beƒçkerek, Lipova, Titel and Beƒçej. The rebels had, in the character of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church and an important figure in medieval Serbia. The war banners had been consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising had been aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njegu≈° of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje. Because of the substantial number of Serbs (Rascians), who belonged to the Ottoman social and fiscal category of vlachs (), parts of the Sanjak of Pakrac and Sanjak of Po≈æega were also referred to as Mala Vla≈°ka (). In the 17th and early 18th century, the territory of lower Slavonia was called Mala Ra≈°ka (), due to its large number of Serbs. In 17th-century Habsburg usage, the term \\"Rascian\\" referred most commonly to the Serbs who lived in Habsburg- controlled territory, then more generally to Orthodox Serbs, wherever they lived, and then more generally still to speakers of Serbian language. Throughout the 17th century, former counties of Po≈æega, Baranya and Syrmia were often mentioned as \\"R√°corsz√°g\\" (Hungarian term for the region of Rascians). The Emperor's so-called \\"Invitatorium\\" in April 1690, for example, was addressed to Arsenije III as \\"Patriarch of the Rascians\\", but Austrian court style also distinguished between \\"Catholic Rascians\\" and \\"Orthodox Rascians\\". In 1695, Emperor Leopold issued a protective diploma for Patriarch Arsenije and the Serb people, whom he called \\"popolum Servianum\\" and \\"Rasciani seu Serviani\\". =18th century= Engraving \\"Old Rascian with son\\", by Martin Engelbrecht (1684‚Äì1756) In official Habsburg documents from the 18th century the Serbs of Habsburg Monarchy were mentioned as Rasciani (\\"Rascians\\"), Natio Rasciana (\\"Rascian nation\\"), Illyri (\\"Illyrians\\") and Natio Illyrica (\\"Illyrian nation\\"). During the Kuruc War (1703‚Äì1711) of Francis II Rakoczi, the territory of present-day Vojvodina was a battlefield between Hungarian rebels and local Serbs who fought on the side of the Habsburg Emperor. Darvas, the prime military commander of the Hungarian rebels, which fought against Serbs in Baƒçka, wrote: We burned all large places of Rascia, on the both banks of the rivers Danube and Tisa. =1801‚Äì48= When the representatives of the Vojvodinian Serbs negotiated with the Hungarian leader Lajos Kossuth in 1848, they asked him not to call them Raci, because they regard this name insulting, since they had their national and historical endonym ‚Äì Serbs. The initial name of the city of Novi Sad, Ratzen Stadt (Rascian/Serb City) derived from the name. The Tab√°n quarter of Budapest was also called R√°cv√°ros in the 18th-19th centuries due to its significant Serb population. Since the 19th century, the term Rascians is no longer used. Religion Imaginary Coat of arms of Rascia, from the Fojnica Armorial After the Great Serb Migration, the Eparchy of Karlovac and Zrinopolje was established in 1695, the first metropolitan being Atanasije Ljubojeviƒá, the exiled metropolitan of Dabar and Bosnia.

It was released on 25 March 2004, by the small Dutch label Transmission Records. It is After Forever's first full-length album since the dismissal of guitarist and composer Mark Jansen, whose musical tastes had strongly influenced the sound of their first work Prison of Desire (2000) and their successful second offering Decipher (2001). In this work After Forever choose a new musical direction, mostly revolving around elements of progressive metal instead of the gothic and symphonic metal of previous albums. The creative process for Invisible Circles took more than a year and required the use of three recording studios in the Netherlands and Germany. A long tour to support the album brought the band to some of the most important European rock festivals and to Central and South America. Invisible Circles is a concept album about the dynamics of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse. The theme was inspired by guitarist Sander Gommans' work as an art teacher, in direct contact with dysfunctional families and teen-age problems. It is also a metal opera, with a storyline that follows the lives of an abused child and her parents since her conception to adulthood. The album was received with mixed reviews, but entered the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium. Background By the end of 2001, After Forever appeared as rising stars on the dynamic scene of Dutch metal, which included bands like The Gathering, Within Temptation, Gorefest and Ayreon. Their second album Decipher (2001) had received very positive reviews and their name was well known in the underground scene of the Netherlands. Critics were impressed by the remarkable musicianship of the young members of the band and in particular by Floor Jansen‚Äôs vocals, both in studio and in live performances. In contrast with these premises for a bright future, the relationships within the band were not so idyllic. Soon after the release of Decipher, After Forever faced a strong creative contrast between founding member and guitarist Mark Jansen and the rest of the band. Mark Jansen had been the main composer of the band together with Sander Gommans and his love for movie soundtracks and classical music had had a strong influence on the musical style of After Forever‚Äôs first two albums, Prison of Desire (2000) and Decipher. Moreover, his interest for religious and moral themes had characterized his lyrics for many songs, often collected under a common title (e.g. The Embrace That Smothers and My Pledge of Allegiance). In the next album, Mark Jansen meant to further explore complex interactions between classical instruments, choruses in Latin and death metal elements, while Gommans and the others preferred a more direct and aggressive approach to music, retaining some elements that made the sound of the band recognizable, but expanding it in new and different directions. These musical differences led to Mark Jansen leaving the band, in what he felt as an actual dismissal. He quickly formed another band called Sahara Dust, which later developed into the symphonic metal band Epica. His place was taken by Bas Maas, who had been the guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band was working at a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers. In Jansen‚Äôs words \\"the EP Exordium was like an introduction to this new full length album and the subjects of the lyrics are already connected to the concept (...) meaning they are also dealing with modern, social problems\\". The reviewers noticed some musical changes in the new work, but some of them suspended their judgement, waiting for a full album to express their opinions about the new course of After Forever. Concept and storyline The concept of Invisible Circles was shaped by After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking inspiration from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems had given him the desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: \\"Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will come back at the beginning of a circle, although you have tried to get out of that particular circle.\\" The plot revolves around a dysfunctional family, comprising a father, a mother, their daughter and the father's mother. The story begins with two lovers, whose relationship is running dry. They decide to have a child, which the woman believes may save their relationship (\\"Between Love and Fire\\"). The birth of a baby girl destroys in the mother her hopes for a brilliant professional career and smothers her passion. On the other hand, the newborn child causes in the father a stiffening of his feelings and the refusal to compromise his career for a \\"spoilt brat\\" (\\"Sins of Idealism\\"). The girl, perceived in the family as an unwanted burden, tries to adapt to the psychological abuse she receives, but she is the object of frequent quarrels and grows sad and depressed (\\"Beautiful Emptiness\\"). She searches for quietness and strength in her inner fantasy world, and friendship and love on the internet, becoming ever more detached from the real world and eccentric in the eyes of her schoolmates and parents (\\"Eccentric\\", \\"Digital Deceit\\", \\"Through Square Eyes\\"). The line of pain that connects the child to her parents appears indestructible and the situation gets worse when the father thinks of leaving (\\"Blind Pain\\", \\"Two Sides\\"). The intervention of the girl's grandmother reveals that the father was himself a neglected child and a victim of his family (\\"Victim of Choices\\"). The father's anger is a reaction to his abuse as a child and this realization seems to soften the girl's pain, bringing her out of her defensive shell (\\"Reflections\\"). In conclusion, the grown-up daughter, now a mother herself, faces the same dilemmas of her parents and is bound to repeat her parents' mistakes, closing the invisible circle that endures from one generation to another (\\"Life's Vortex\\"). Production Sander Gommans started the composition of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs. Meanwhile, his fianc√©e Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album. The band reunited at Excess Studios in Rotterdam in July 2003, a few weeks after recording Exordium, to arrange the new songs and to record the instrumental tracks, under supervision of producer Hans Pieters and sound engineer Dennis Leidelmeijer. Every member of the band contributed to the music, which is credited for the most part to all six musicians. When the instrumental tracks were ready, the band moved in August 2003 to Gate Studio in Wolfsburg, Germany, where all solo vocal parts were arranged by the band, under supervision of American singer and producer Amanda Somerville. She also contributed, along with Jay Lansford, the recited parts that connect the songs to each other and explain parts of the plot. The solo vocals of Jansen, Gommans and Bas Maas were recorded separately by producers Sascha Paeth and Michael ‚ÄúMiro‚Äù Rodenberg. Female soprano vocals, grunts and clean male vocals represent in the songs different feelings and behaviours of the characters. The final stage of the recording process was executed at Arts Music Recording studio in Rhoon from 20 to 24 October 2003, under supervision of Peter Arts. The orchestra and choir parts were arranged there by Cees‚Äô Kieboom, who also contributed some additional keyboards to smooth the transition between the different instrumental parts. The final mixing of all the parts was executed by Sascha Paeth at The Pathway Studio in Wolfsburg, Germany in November and December 2003, except the instrumental introduction \\"Childhood in Minor\\" mixed by Sander Gommans. The album was mastered at Sound Factory by Peter van 't Riet for a release in early 2004. Invisible Circles was released by Transmission Records on 25 March 2004. \\"Digital Deceit\\" was the only single issued from the album and released on 20 May 2004. A high tech video clip was produced for the song by D'iMages, the same company that had done the video clip for the 2003 single \\"My Choice\\", extracted from Exordium. The video was aired on Dutch MTV and on local musical TV stations. Packaging After Forever in 2003, wearing the black and blue costumes and with Lando van Gils still a member of the band The artwork for the album was created by German designer Carsten Drescher and his graphics company Media Logistics. Drescher was responsible for the After Forever logo and the cover concepts of every After Forever album and single since then. The girl he photographed is in fact his daughter Aimee Drescher, who also appeared in the video clip for the song \\"Digital Diceit\\". He inserted the photos in a dark urban landscape tinted blue, completing the front cover artwork with the digital overlay of circles in the water to evoke the title of the album. The same circles were extensively used in the CD booklet and in every other artwork related to the album. Together with the dominant blue colour the circles were also present in the live show scenography. The photos of the band were taken by Dutch photographer Angelique van Woerkom in November 2003 and each member dressed in a tight black and blue suit with a lightning motif, the same colors of the CD sleeve. The same suits were used for the video clip of the single \\"Digital Deceit\\" and sometimes appeared in live shows during the following tour. On 11 November 2016, Invisible Circles was re-released on streaming, containing a remastered version of the album along with single edits, previously unreleased studio sessions and an interview. Physically, this edition was released on 2 December as a three-disc set and included a similarly expanded edition of Exordium on disc three. Tour The Invisible Circles tour started in February 2004, just before the album release, in Mexico, home of the independent label Raw Metal Records, which distributed After Forever albums for all the American continent. An intensive European tour followed, touching the Netherlands, Germany and France. Two months after the release of the album, keyboard player Lando van Gils left the band on amicable terms. He played his last gig with the band at The Bosuil, Weert, on 14 May 2004. He was replaced by keyboard player Joost van der Broek, coming from the Dutch progressive rock band Sun Caged, who completed the rest of the tour. Van den Broek had played with Floor Jansen during the Star One tour of 2002, where he also met Gommans. The tour brought the band to play at the important Graspop, Pinkpop and Dynamo festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Pinkpop Festival performance on 30 May 2004, was televised for a Dutch TV station. The first leg of the tour culminated with the performance at the Wacken Open Air festival, on 7 August 2004. New dates of the tour were added at the end of the year, but some shows were cancelled when drummer Andr√© Borgman was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with lung cancer at an initial stage. The official site of the band reported the news of Borgman‚Äôs illness and confirmed some shows, with Ayreon, Star One and Gorefest drummer Ed Warby standing-in for Borgman. The band spent the first half of 2005 concentrating on the material for the new album Remagine, while Borgman received intensive treatment to cure his cancer. Luckily, the cures were successful and Borgman was back behind his drum kit for the final leg of the Invisible Circles tour in South America in August 2005. Critical and commercial reception After the almost unanimous praise received by the album Decipher and the perplexities raised by the new musical direction of the EP Exordium, there were great expectations for the new album by fans and specialized press alike. The complexity of the music and concept of Invisible Circles produced mixed reviews, ranging from highest praise to complete failure, even in the same publication. The bold move of making a concept album about such a controversial matter was generally appreciated but, as Eduardo Rivadavia said in his AllMusic review, this could be a \\"slightly overambitious creation\\". The Maximum Metal reviewer states that \\"concept albums are always hard to pull off and not many bands can do it well\\" and \\"here is another failed attempt\\". It was the general opinion of most reviewers that Floor Jansen's lead vocals are at her best and \\"her performance here is powerful, dramatic and very impressive overall, no matter how she chooses to sing\\". However, her lyrics were sometimes considered a weak point of the album, despite the fact that the band \\"placed as much emphasis\\" on them \\"as they did on the music\\". Sam Grant of Sonic Cathedral Webzine considered them \\"trite\\" and \\"disappointing\\". In particular, the spoken dialogue by Somerville and Lansford was generally considered badly acted and detrimental to the music which, on the contrary, was generally considered the strong point of the album. The change of musical direction, with the introduction of progressive metal elements, and the many variations of style adopted in the songs were generally praised, to the point that a Metal Storm reviewer compares After Forever to \\"Symphony X with Floor Jansen on vocals\\". Only a few reviewers remained nostalgic of the gothic and symphonic sound of Decipher and denounced a \\"lack of direction\\" and \\"too much confusion\\" in the music of the album. The album sold enough in the Benelux to remain in the Dutch Mega Album Top 100 chart for eleven weeks and in the Belgian Ultratop 50 Albums chart for two. It reached position No. 24 in the Netherlands and position No. 74 in Belgium. The single \\"Digital Deceit\\" reached position No. 41 in the Single Top 100 chart in the Netherlands.

The highway travels east-west on the north side of the Columbia River, opposite Interstate 84 (I-84) to the south in Oregon. SR 14 forms a section of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway and begins at an interchange with I-5 in Vancouver. The highway travels east as a four-lane freeway through Camas and Washougal and intersects I-205. SR 14 continues east as a two-lane highway through Clark, Skamania, Klickitat, and Benton counties before it ends at an interchange with I-82 and U.S. Route 395 (US 395) near Plymouth. SR 14 was established in 1968 as the successor to US 830, created in 1926 with the original United States Numbered Highways, and Primary State Highway 8 (PSH 8). PSH 8 was added to the state highway system in 1905 as a short road along the Columbia River between Washougal and Lyle and was extended westwards to Vancouver and eastwards to Maryhill by 1913. PSH 8, designated as the Evergreen Highway, was extended east to the Tri-Cities in 1949 and this section was retained during the 1964 state highway renumbering and the decommissioning of US 830\\\\. Route description SR 14 eastbound in Vancouver SR 14 begins as a continuation of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway in downtown Vancouver at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5, Washington Street, and C Street, located on the first exit on I-5 north of the Interstate Bridge, which provides access to Portland, Oregon. The four-lane freeway travels eastward, between the Columbia River and the Seattle Subdivision of the BNSF Northern Transcon route to the south and Pearson Field to the north, and intersects Southeast Columbia Way in a single-point urban interchange, providing access to the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District. SR 14 continues southeast through suburban Vancouver, intersecting Riverside Drive in a partial cloverleaf interchange, Lieser Road in a diamond interchange, and Ellsworth Avenue in a partial diamond interchange, before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-205 north of the Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, providing access to eastern suburbs of Portland. SR 14 travels east through an interchange with Southeast 164th Avenue before leaving Vancouver, heading towards Camas. The freeway intersects Southeast 192nd Avenue in unincorporated Clark County before entering the city of Camas at an interchange with its business route on 6th Avenue. SR 14 narrows to two lanes on Lady Island and enters downtown Camas after crossing the Camas Slough. The highway serves as a four-lane freeway bypass of Camas and travels through two partial double roundabout interchanges with SR 500, which travels northwestward to Orchards, and 2nd Street in Washougal. SR 14 continues east past the Steigerwald Lake, Franz Lake, and Pierce national wildlife refuges, all located within Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area in Clark and Skamania counties. The highway also passes the Bonneville Dam in North Bonneville and the Bridge of the Gods before reaching Stevenson, the county seat of Skamania County. SR 14 leaves Stevenson traveling eastwards through the community of Carson River Valley and a series of tunnels along the Columbia River before crossing over the White Salmon River into Klickitat County near Underwood. The high bridge here carries SR 14 across the Klickitat River at Lyle, Washington. The highway intersects SR 141 Alternate and the Hood River Bridge, unsigned SR 35, before reaching the cities of White Salmon and Bingen, where it passes the local Amtrak station and travels through a junction with SR 141\\\\. SR 14 continues east and crosses the Klickitat River into Lyle and forms the southern terminus of SR 142, which travels northeast towards Goldendale. The highway travels east to a junction with US 197 near Dallesport and to Wishram, passing its Amtrak station. SR 14 leaves the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area west of Maryhill, where the highway intersects its spur route and US 97, forming a short concurrency with the latter. SR 14 continues northeast along the Columbia Hills and the Columbia River into Benton County, reaching a junction with SR 221 in Paterson. The highway ends at a diamond interchange with I-82 and US 395 northeast of Plymouth, located north of the Umatilla Bridge. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 14 was east of its interchange with I-205 in Vancouver, serving 72,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was in Maryhill, serving 500 vehicles. SR 14 between Vancouver and Maryhill is designated as part of the National Highway System for its whole length, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the same corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. History SR 14 at its interchange with I-205, built in the 1970s The first highway that traveled through the Columbia River Gorge was surveyed in 1905 at a cost of $15,000 (equivalent to $ in ) by the state of Washington as a wagon road connecting Washougal in Clark County to Lyle in Klickitat County that was designated as secondary State Road 8. State Road 8 was extended east from Lyle to Maryhill and northeast to the county seat of Goldendale in 1907. The secondary highway, named the North Bank Highway, was re-aligned in 1913 to follow closer to the Columbia River and was extended west to Vancouver and east to Mabton via Satus Pass. State Road 8 was co- signed with US 830 after the United States Numbered Highways were approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926, also creating a short concurrency with US 97. The North Bank Highway was constructed with macadam pavement and was dedicated from Lyle to Dallesport in 1934, shortly before State Road 8 was re-designated as PSH 8 and the Evergreen Highway in 1937, traveling east from Vancouver to Mayhill and north to Yakima. SSH 8E, a branch of PSH 8, was also established in 1937 and ran east from PSH 8 in Maryhill to Paterson and north to PSH 3 in Prosser. SSH 8E was replaced by the Maryhill‚ÄìKennewick branch of PSH 8 in 1943, amidst proposals to extend the Evergreen Highway to the Tri-Cities in 1949. US 197, a spur of US 97, was created in 1952 and became concurrent with US 830 and PSH 8 from the Dallesport area to a junction with its parent route in Maryhill. A section of the winding PSH 8 between Maryhill and Roosevelt was replaced with a new highway running along the north bank of the river in June 1964. PSH 8 was replaced fully by US 830 during the 1964 state highway renumbering, but US 830 was decommissioned in 1968 before the new state routes were codified. SR 14, previously on the route of US 12, was established in 1968 and remains the designation for the Evergreen Highway. The concurrency with US 197 was removed by WSDOT in 1980, but was not recognized by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials until their general meeting in September 2006. The eastern terminus of SR 14 was moved south from Kennewick in 1985 to an interchange with I-82 that was completed in 1981. The western terminus at I-5 in Vancouver was rebuilt in 1984 with more ramps to allow for fully- directional navigation, at the cost of land from Fort Vancouver Park. Several new interchanges were built in the late 1980s in eastern Vancouver to bring SR 14 to full grade separation. Spur route SR 14 has a spur route in Maryhill that connects the eastbound lane of the main highway to US 97 northbound. The spur route was established in 1991 during a re-alignment of the two highways in Maryhill and, during its annual AADT survey, WSDOT calculated that 1,400 vehicles used the highway in 2012.

The character was portrayed by actress Eileen Fulton for 50 years from May 1960, until the last broadcast television episode aired in September 2010, with Fulton becoming one of the longest-serving soap opera actors in the United States. Lisa is considered to be the first soap \\"vixen\\" and was one half of an early \\"super couple\\" of Bob and Lisa Hughes. Casting As the World Turns creator and longtime head writer Irna Phillips created Lisa in the late 1950s originally as a short-term character. In a 2007 interview with the Archive of American Television, Fulton explained that ATWT's casting director contacted her agent, wanting to audition another of his clients, Lois Smith, for the role, but because Smith was unavailable, he recommended they audition Fulton instead. Lisa was kept on the As the World Turns canvas due to Fulton's day-to-day acting improvement. A Procter & Gamble executive said to Fulton six months into her run as Lisa, \\"I want to tell you what a wonderful job you are doing, because when you first came on the show we thought, 'We can't keep her. She's not very good.'\\"Eileen Fulton says farewell to As the World Turns Fulton's eagerness to play Lisa as a villainess contributed to the character's popularity and therefore its longevity. In the Archive of American Television interview, Fulton explained that the character was originally written to be a \\"nice girl\\", which she did not find compelling as an actress, and that, while she read Phillips' lines exactly as they appeared on the script, she said them with a \\"scheming tone\\" in her voice. When Phillips saw Fulton's performance she said \\"I can write for that little rascal. She can play a bitch!\\" In The Soap Opera Encyclopedia, Christopher Schermering writes, \\"Although Lisa was guilty of many lapses, nothing made her more hated by her audience of housewives than a simple sequence in which she hired a maid to clean house and went gallivanting about town. When mother-in-law Nancy complimented Lisa on what a nice home she had made for Bob, audiences were furious.\\" A scheming \\"vixen\\" in her early years, TIME magazine once referred to Lisa as a \\"superbitch\\" and the \\"most hated woman on TV.\\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-3,00.html Since those days, Lisa has gone on to become a well-respected presence in Oakdale (the fictional town in which As the World Turns is set), often offering advice and support to the town's younger residents. When the character of Lisa was introduced in 1960, the name \\"Lisa,\\" which had only seen a popular resurgence in the previous ten years, was the sixth most popular baby name in the United States.Cleveland Evans: Baby names revolved around TV‚Äôs ‚ÄòWorld‚Äô Fulton's Lisa was credited with speeding up the popularity of the name for baby girls; \\"Lisa\\" became the most popular name for girls between the years of 1962 and 1969. Lisa back in a 1960s episode The character departed on May 3, 1965 and briefly crossed over into her own primetime spinoff series, Our Private World, for a few months in 1965, during which Lisa left Oakdale and moved to Chicago. She returned to Oakdale on January 16, 1967, where she remained until the final episode in 2010. Recasts and temporary replacements for Lisa were Pamela King filling in as Lisa during 1964 and Betsy von Furstenberg playing the role from late 1983 to early 1984 during a contract dispute between Ms. Fulton and Procter & Gamble. On multiple occasions from 1991 to 1994, former movie actress Jane Powell and soap veteran Maeve McGuire replaced Ms. Fulton during that same the time period as did soap opera veteran Jennifer Bassey. Australian actress Carmen Duncan, best known to US audiences for her role as Iris on Another World, filled in for Fulton for three episodes in late 2004 while she was on emergency medical leave. The character had become so integral to the story on As the World Turns that by 1987, actress Fulton was credited with playing the role of \\"Lisa\\" at the end of each day's show, and not with a surname (which was Mitchell at that time; Lisa had many marriages through the years). Fulton would be credited simply as playing \\"Lisa\\" with no character surname until the show ended its run in 2010. In its final years, Fulton along with a number of other veteran actors were rarely seen on canvas. In a 2009 interview, Fulton was confused as to why the writers found it so difficult to write for older characters. \\"It could be an age thing, but one of my favorite soaps is the British series EastEnders. They have no problem with featuring older actors. And giving them romantic and dramatic storylines.\\" Character history =Bob and \\"Scheming Lisa\\"= The character first appeared in May 1960, as the fianc√©e of medical student Bob Hughes (Don Hastings). They soon eloped when they discovered that Lisa was pregnant. Though Bob's and Lisa's parents were at first opposed to their marriage (they believed the pair to be too young), they accepted it when they learned of Lisa's pregnancy. The young couple moved in with Bob's parents, Chris (Don MacLaughlin) and Nancy Hughes (Helen Wagner), while Bob finished his residency at Oakdale Memorial Hospital. Lisa initially demonstrated her scheming ways by faking \\"difficulties\\" with her pregnancy to get out of helping her new mother-in-law with the household chores. However, Nancy and Lisa eventually became very close, forming a bond that would remain intact for decades (even after Lisa and Bob divorced). Lisa's new sister-in-law, however, Penny Hughes (Rosemary Prinz) (who also was still living with Chris and Nancy) and Lisa took an immediate dislike to one another. Penny, who had lost a baby, and recently learned she could no longer have children, resented Lisa's pregnancy. Lisa disliked Penny and her best friend Ellen Lowell (Patricia Bruder), who she felt thought they were better than herself, while Ellen and Penny found Lisa to be an idle gossip. The animosity between Penny and Lisa led to considerable tension in the Hughes home, with Lisa exploiting Penny's emotional estrangement from Chris and Nancy, attempting to further alienate Penny from her parents. (Though Lisa and Penny would eventually become a bit more friendly as they both matured, Lisa maintained an adversarial relationship with Ellen right up until Ellen left Oakdale in the late 1990s.) A year into Bob and Lisa's marriage, after their son Tom was born, Lisa became tired of living as the wife of a young resident, resenting Bob's long hours in the hospital. She had an affair with flashy businessman Bruce Elliott, asking him to take her with him when he left town, but he told her the affair was just a diversion for him, and that he cared nothing for her. Meanwhile, Bob, whom she had already alienated, had found out about the relationship and divorced Lisa. Lisa responded by poisoning Tom's mind against his father, eventually fleeing to California with Tom, without Bob's knowledge. When Bob finally tracked them down, he found Lisa in a near- catatonic state, following a brutal rape. He brought her back to Oakdale, enlisting the help of Sylvia Hill, a nurse with whom Bob had been involved. Once Lisa recovered from the trauma, she attempted to guilt Sylvia into ending her relationship with Bob, falsely suggesting that she was the only thing preventing Bob and Lisa to reconcile. Nancy also cautioned Sylvia that Lisa was the only person she would ever accept as her daughter-in-law. Though Sylvia eventually decided to end her relationship with Bob, Bob informed Lisa that he was not interested in a reconciliation with her. =Our Private World= Rejected, Lisa moved to Chicago in mid-1965 (with the character relocating to the primetime soap Our Private World), where she became involved with the Eldridge brothers. She married wealthy John Eldridge, but soon began a torrid affair with his brother Tom. When the affair was revealed, Lisa fled Chicago in disgrace. It was revealed in the early 1990s that Lisa was in fact pregnant when she left, and that the Eldridge family had paid Lisa a hefty divorce settlement, in exchange for her having nothing to do with her baby. The baby, Scott Eldridge, was presumably born during the several-month-long lapse between when Our Private World went off the air in the fall of 1965 and when Lisa and Eileen Fulton returned to As the World Turns in the spring of 1966; viewers were not made aware of Scott's existence until he tracked Lisa down as an adult in 1992. =Return to Oakdale= Several months after leaving Chicago, Lisa resurfaced in Oakdale, and began having an affair with Dr. Michael Shea, a charming, manipulative sociopath. Though she asked Michael to leave his wife so they could be married, especially after Lisa discovered she was pregnant, Michael refused. After Lisa's baby, Charles \\"Chuckie\\" Shea was born, Lisa told Michael's wife, Claire English Lowell Cassen Shea (Barbara Berjer), who was Ellen Lowell Stewart's mother, about the affair and about her son. Clare was drinking, something she did a lot of in those days. Claire told Michael she wanted him to marry Lisa and make his son legitimate. Claire then let it slip that there had been another illegitimate child in the family. Michael put things together and figured out that Ellen was the mother of that child and that her son was Dr. Dan Stewart, a bright young doctor that Shea resented. He made it his business to tell Dan the truth. When Claire learned this, she stabbed him with a letter opener. Michael, who had been let go from Memorial Hospital after the loss of a patient, agreed to keep quiet about what Claire had done if he could be reinstated. Claire divorced Michael. A short while later, Michael decided that he wanted to play a role in his son's life, and tried to get Lisa to marry him, but by this time, she wanted nothing to do with him. Around the same time, Lisa's son Tom had returned from Vietnam with a drug habit. One night, Michael caught Tom breaking into his office to steal drugs, and Michael used this information to blackmail Lisa into marrying him. By this time, Lisa hated Michael with a passion, and though she did marry him (to save Tom), she refused to have any kind of a sexual relationship with him. Michael responded by orchestrating a series of events designed to make Lisa appear as an unfit mother, so he could divorce her and sue for custody of Chuckie. However, in early 1970, Michael was murdered, and Lisa was nowhere to be found. Tom was the prime suspect, and, thinking his mother had committed the murder, he said little to demonstrate his innocence. When Lisa returned to town, she could not remember the events leading to Michael's murder, but eventually the murder was revealed to have been committed by the mother of a young woman with whom Michael had had an affair. Lisa had a few more flings, including one with Bob's older brother, Don Hughes (then played by Peter Brandon, attorney Dick Martin (Edward Kenner, minister Wally Matthews (played by future co-star Trapper John, M. D. Charles Siebert), and the rich Simon Gilby (played by soap opera veteran Jerry Lacy (whose ward Meredith dated Lisa's son Tom]. Around this time, she believed herself to be pregnant, though her doctor (played by future As the World Turns head writer Douglas Marland later revealed Lisa suffered from an ovarian cyst. =Lisa, Grant and Joyce= In 1973, Tom and his young brother Chuckie were struck by another driver. Though Tom survived, Chuckie was killed in the accident. The grief was almost too much for Lisa to bear but she received a great deal of support and love from her former mother-in-law Nancy Hughes, as well as from a new man in her life, Grant Colman (James Douglas), an attorney who had recently joined Chris Hughes' law firm. Grant and Lisa fell in love and planned to be married, but on the day of the ceremony, Grant's ex-wife, Joyce (Barbara Rodell) crashed their wedding to announce that during their marriage, she and Grant had had a son of whom Grant was unaware. Grant postponed the wedding to investigate, and determined that he and Joyce had indeed had a son who had since been adopted. He decided not to interfere in the boy's life, and let him remain with his adoptive parents. Grant and Lisa were finally married, but Joyce continued to scheme and interfere in their lives, and for a while they also had to contend with the equally scheming Valerie Conway was also attempting to seduce both Bob and Grant at the same time. Lisa eventually pointed Valerie in Bob's direction, so she would stay away from Grant. Though Grant and Lisa were very happy together, Lisa's ongoing jealousy of Joyce and later Valerie continue to be a problem, and at one point, Grant asked Lisa for a divorce. Lisa pretended to be ill, and staged an elaborate scheme designed to demonstrate Valerie's true calculating ways. Though she succeeded in this, Grant and Lisa's lives continued to be complicated, this time by a new woman, Tina Cornell, who had a played a role in the previous manipulations involving Valerie, and was injured as a result. Lisa invited Tina to recuperate with her and Grant. Tina told Lisa that she had developed agoraphobia, but she in fact was becoming obsessed with Grant. When Lisa discovered this, she ordered Tina to leave, but Grant saw this as just another case of Lisa's jealousy. He and Lisa separated, but when Tina attempted to seduce him, he realized that Lisa had been right all along. Though he claimed to be through with scheming women, Joyce now reentered Grant's life, pretending to be terminally ill. Though Lisa disputed Joyce's claims of illness, Grant believed her and the two became engaged. He learned that Lisa was correct, but Lisa was hurt by Grant's refusal to believe her, and refused to give her relationship with Grant another try. Grant left town in late 1981, though he and Lisa would get over their bitterness and would become friends again. =Whit and Earl= In 1982, Lisa eloped with wealthy businessman Whit McColl. Their lives were soon complicated by the arrival in town of Lucinda Walsh (Elizabeth Hubbard), who claimed Whit was responsible for the suicide of her husband, Whit's former business partner. Lisa became very close to Whit's two sons, Brian and Kirk McColl, and when Whit was murdered in 1984, Lisa continued to serve as a mother figure to her stepsons Kirk (Christian LeBlanc) and Brian (Mark Pinter). Though deeply saddened by Whit's death, Lisa embarked on two new business ventures during this period that would help her through the sorrow. In 1985, Lisa joined her friends, Kim Sullivan Hughes (Kathryn Hays) and Barbara Ryan to launch Fashions, a high-end boutique showcasing top designs. Kim and Barbara eventually both sold their shares in the business to Lisa; she remains the sole owner through the show's conclusion in 2010. In 1986, Lisa and Craig Montgomery (Scott Bryce) purchased a restaurant formerly known as Caroline's, and reopened it as The Mona Lisa. Lisa became the sole owner when Craig left Oakdale in the late 1980s, and presumably still operates the restaurant today although it was neither seen nor referred to on camera after 2005. In addition to these two businesses, Lisa also co-owns the Lakeview Hotel with Lily Snyder (Noelle Beck); she owned and operated the Argus newspaper and was a partner in the nightclub Java (which has since been sold a number of times and later became Metro). In 1986, though Brian McColl's girlfriend Shannon O'Hara (who herself had become very close to Lisa), she met Shannon's uncle, the mysterious, charming Earl Mitchell (screen veteran Farley Granger). The two began dating, and though Earl had a mysterious side, disappearing without explanation for days on end, Lisa agreed to marry him. A few months into their marriage, Earl disappeared, and Lisa soon received a message that Earl had been kidnapped. Her ex-husband Grant returned to Oakdale to show his support. Lisa received a call from someone who claimed to know of Earl's whereabouts, but when she drove to meet him, her brakes failed. She was not injured, but started to see images of Earl and hear his voice, causing her family to worry and question her sanity. The truth about Earl was finally revealed: he was an Interpol agent who'd been killed while attempting to investigate James Stenbeck (Anthony Herrera). =Later years= In 1992 and 1993, Lisa stood up to her friends, lawyer Jessica Griffin (Tamara Tunie) and writer Duncan McKechnie (Michael Swan), when she voiced her opinion that she believed the black Jessica and white Duncan should not be married or have children (an opinion that flew in the face of Fulton's actual beliefs). Through compassion and education, Lisa warmed to Jessica and Duncan's union and was even asked to become godmother to their child, Bonnie, which she accepted. In late 1994, Lisa married Eduardo Grimaldi, a Maltese gangster. Lisa's happiness lasted only a few weeks, because Eduardo was shot by an associate, and was rushed to Oakdale Memorial. His cousin Orlena Grimaldi found him in his room and killed him, resulting in Lisa believing Eduardo's death was due to medical incompetence on the part of John Dixon (Larry Bryggman), who was on duty in the ER when he was brought in. Lisa sued John for malpractice, threatening to end his career, before the truth of Eduardo's death came out. John took revenge on Lisa by wooing her and proposing to her, only to publicly dump her at their engagement party. She and John remained estranged for some time, until he and their mutual friend Barbara Ryan (Colleen Zenk Pinter) rescued Lisa from Martin Chedwyn, a criminal who had forced Lisa to marry him as part of a scheme to smuggle assets out of Hong-Kong before the changeover in government in 1999. Lisa forgave John for the public spectacle at their engagement party, and the two remained on good terms thereafter. In the early 2000s (decade), Lisa befriended Oakdale newcomer Isaac Jenkins, introducing Isaac to her goddaughter Bonnie McKechnie (whom he would later marry), and partnering with Isaac and Bonnie in their new club Java. She would remain involved with Java until Isaac and Bonnie left town, at that time, selling her shares in the club. She was featured in a tribute episode in May 2000, honoring Fulton's and costar Don Hastings' 40th anniversaries on the show, in which a mean spirited tabloid story causes Lisa and Bob to reminisce about key events in their lives (via flashbacks). In more recent years, Lisa has retreated from the spotlight, interfering in the lives of her son Tom (Scott Holmes) and daughter-in-law Margo Hughes (Ellen Dolan), and mentoring Oakdale's younger residents. In June and July 2008, Lisa became involved in the dramas between Barbara, Paul, Meg and Sofie. This ended when Paul Ryan found Sofie dead in her hotel room. It was revealed that Cole had killed Sofie. Lisa played a key role in organizing Tom and Margo's twenty-fifth anniversary party. Eileen Fulton as Lisa Grimaldi in a screencap from the April 22, 2009 episode. Lisa reappeared in April 2009 to be involved in the mystery of Luke and Noah's kidnapping. Final years and ATWT cancellation During the final years of ATWT, Lisa's portrayer Eileen Fulton criticized producers over the lack of airtime for her character, as well as other longtime characters, whose screentime had dramatically diminished in favor of younger cast members. In 2008, she appeared three - four times per month, but played a large role in the April 2010 episode depicting Bob and Kim's second wedding.

The group currently consists of Deacon the Villain, Kno, and Natti. The group's discography includes multiple mixtapes and studio albums, which have been subject to widespread critical acclaim for their production and lyrics. The group has been covered in various media outlets including The Source, URB, Spin, XLR8R, and The Onion. Early beginnings In 1999, Deacon the Villain and Kno met at Club Kaya in Atlanta, Georgia at an event for the now defunct Blaze Magazine that included various members of Atlanta's own Dungeon Family. They had talked online previously through an emcee named Jugga the Bully, who hosted an open mic called Underground Live at the Moorehouse college campus, which they both frequented. At the time, Kno was in the group The Continuum, and Deacon was in the group Illstar. Deacon soon returned to his home state of Kentucky and Kno eventually followed. Following several conversations of working together, the two first planned an EP where Kno was only producing and Deacon was rhyming, but soon Kno contributed as an emcee as well. Musical career =2001‚Äì2005: Will Rap for Food, SouthernUnderground and Sloppy Seconds= The group's debut studio album, Will Rap for Food, was released in October 2001, and was described by Pitchfork Media as \\"a solid, accessible debut, filled with clever rhymes and tremendously consistent production\\". In April 2003, Mr. SOS joined the group on the album SouthernUnderground, which was independently released on Freshchest Records. The album featured guests including Masta Ace, Supastition and others, alongside production from Domingo and RJD2, but again mostly Kno. M.F. DiBella of AllMusic commented on \\"a lyrical deftness and genuine feel for the music rarely seen in the bling- conscious rap of the latter-day era\\". The group landed a distribution contract with Caroline Distribution in 2004, and SouthernUnderground was the first project re-released after inking the deal with Will Rap For Food being re- released shortly thereafter in 2005. Throughout 2003‚Äì2005, the group throughout the U.S. and Canada, appearing onstage alongside notable acts such as Nappy Roots, Cee-Lo Green of Goodie Mob and touring extensively with People Under the Stairs, Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan and Brand Nubian. The group also released the mixtapes Sloppy Seconds Volume One in 2003 and Sloppy Seconds Vol. 2 in 2005. =2006‚Äì2008: Mr. SOS leaves, Natti joins, A Piece of Strange and Dirty Acres= Following SouthernUnderground, Mr. SOS left the group on peaceful terms. Soon after, the two remaining members met Natti, a fellow Kentucky emcee. Deacon and Kno describe his joining as a casual process, with Natti already being featured on Sloppy Seconds Vol. 2 and being involved in Deacon's side group Kynfolk. Natti would be the final member to join the group and end its formation. CunninLynguists released the third studio album, A Piece of Strange, on January 24, 2006 via Caroline Records and Groove Attack Distribution. It features guest spots included Cee-Lo Green, Immortal Technique and Tonedeff, among others, and is entirely produced by Kno. The album marked a significant turning point in the group's musical career, with the members turning their lyrics and music into more passionate material, and minimizing their \\"silliness\\". Hype gave the album a five star review describing it as \\"the best album of the last 12 months\\". URB gave the album four stars, describing it as \\"a piece of beauty, a soulful and sweeping assemblage of cuts that ride a steady wave of infectious momentum\\", and The A.V. Club commented on Kno's \\"masterful, adventurous production\\". The release of A Piece of Strange also saw their profile rise and cultivating a bigger and dedicated fanbase, as they toured abroad multiple times in support of the release, appearing live alongside notable acts such as Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and The Strokes. CunninLynguists released their fourth studio album, Dirty Acres, on November 27, 2007 through a joint venture between their own label APOS Music and Swedish-based label Bad Taste Records. Produced entirely by Kno, it features artists such as Devin the Dude, Phonte of Little Brother and Witchdoctor, and was described by CMJ New Music Monthly as \\"a defiant album that questions everything, even the assumed standards of hip hop\\". It was lauded by Michael Kabran of PopMatters as \\"easily one of the best hip-hop albums of 2007 and arguably one of the best albums of the past decade\\". CunninLynguists made their way across the United States, Europe and Canada in support of the album, headlining the Dirty Acres Tour in 3 parts over the course of 2008. =2009‚Äì2013: Oneirology and Strange Journey Volumes One and Two= The group released two mixtapes in 2009, Strange Journey Volume One and Strange Journey Volume Two. On March 22, 2011, the group released the fifth studio album, Oneirology. HipHopDX said about the album: \\"This project combines creative sounds with inventive rhymes and stands as an example of how a great group can come together to craft a well-made album worthy of praise.\\" Its concept revolves around Oneirology, the scientific study of dreams. =2014‚Äìpresent: Strange Journey Volume Three= In 2014, CunninLynguists released a mixtape, Strange Journey Volume Three. It was curated entirely by the group's fans who gave feedback on and suggested ideas for song concepts, features, packaging, and artwork. It features guest appearances from Aesop Rock, Del the Funky Homosapien, and Murs. The same year, CunninLynguists' lexicon was also found to be one of the richest among rappers who perform in English. In 2017, the group released the sixth studio album, Rose Azura Njano. It features guest appearances from Jason Coffey, Trizz, and Farah Elle. Name The name CunninLynguists is a play on the terms \\"cunnilingus\\" and \\"linguistics\\", an oral sex act performed on a woman and the study of language, respectively. When the group was first forming, Deacon and Kno casually came up with the name, not intending for it to be permanent nor serious, instead only wanting listeners to not take their music as seriously as their music sounded. In 2009, XXL included the group as having one of the worst names in hip hop. Style At the group's beginning, members Kno and Deacon focused on energetic wordplay and outlandish rhymes, only at times delving into deeper and more introspective material, such as \\"Mic Like a Memory\\" or \\"Family Ties\\" from Will Rap For Food. This continued up until their critically acclaimed album A Piece of Strange, which featured more serious songs, such as \\"Brain Cell\\", and playful ones, such as \\"Beautiful Girl\\". The group has been applauded for their ability to craft poetic songs that are also very musically enjoyable. Throughout CunninLynguists' career, they have collaborated with a wide array of other notable artists, such as Anna Wise, Aesop Rock, Big K.R.I.T, Cee-Lo Green, Celph Titled, Del the Funky Homosapien, Devin the Dude, E-40, Hilltop Hoods, Immortal Technique, Killer Mike, Macklemore, Masta Ace, Murs and Sean Price, among many more. Members Kno and Deacon the Villain are the founding and current members of CunninLynguists and have been found on every CunninLynguists album thus far since the group's inception in March 2000. CunninLynguists would later go on to work with various Dungeon Family members such as Cee-Lo Green, Big Rube, Khujo Goodie, EJ The Witchdoctor and Killer Mike, with the latter comparing CunninLynguists' sound to Dungeon Family \\"in its heyday\\". Kentucky-based emcee Natti has been involved in the group from November 2004 until the present (appearing on all material since Sloppy Seconds Volume 2). Natti has released his first solo album, Still Motion, on September 24 (September 30 in CD form). As of January 2006, the duo of Kno and Deacon have begun work as a production duo under the banner A Piece of Strange Music. Together, they began producing for artists such as Devin the Dude and Immortal Technique, among others. Florida-based emcee Mr. SOS was a part of CunninLynguists from July 2002 to October 2004 (appearing mainly on SouthernUnderground and Sloppy Seconds Volume One).

Theory and method Visual sociology can be theoretically framed around three themes. Pauwels suggests that the framework is based on the origin and nature of visuals, research focus and design, and format and purpose. There are at least three approaches to doing visual sociology: =Data collection using cameras and other recording technology= In this context, the camera is analogous to a tape recorder. Film and video cameras are particularly well suited as data gathering technologies for experiments and small group interactions, classroom studies, ethnography, participant observation, oral history, the use of urban space, etc. The tape recorder captures things that are not preserved in even the best researchers' field notes. Similarly, tape recordings preserve audible data not available in even the most carefully annotated transcripts: timbre, the music of a voice, inflection, intonation, grunts and groans, pace, and space convey meanings easily (mis)understood but not easily gleaned from written words alone. By opening another channel of information, visual recordings preserve still more information. For instance, the raised eyebrow, the wave of a hand, the blink of an eye might convert the apparent meaning of words into their opposite, convey irony, sarcasm, or contradiction. So, regardless of how one analyzes the data or what is done with the visual record, sociologists can use cameras to record and preserve data of interest so it can be studied in detail. Visual recording technology also allows us to manipulate the data. Visual recording can be used to represent other forms of recording technology and non-digital multimedia. Visual recordings have long been employed by natural scientists because they make it possible to speed up, slow down, repeat, stop, and zoom in on things of interest. It is the same in the social sciences, recordings facilitate the study of phenomena that are too fast, or too slow, or too infrequent or too big or too small to study directly \\"in the life.\\" Most importantly, through editing visual sociologists can juxtapose events to produce meanings. Sociologists may also be able to put cameras in places where one would not put a researcher: where it is dangerous, or where a person would be unwelcome, or simply to remove the observer effect from particular situations, e.g., studying social behavior among school children on a playground. Photo elicitation is another technique of data gathering. This methodological tool is a combination of photography as the visual equivalent of a tape recorder, and ethnography or other qualitative methods. Photo elicitation techniques involve using photographs or film as part of the interview‚Äîin essence asking research subjects to discuss the meaning of photographs, films or videos. In this case the images can be taken specially by the researcher with the idea of using them to elicit information, they can belong to the subject, for example family photographs or movies, or they can be gathered from other sources including archives, newspaper and television morgues, or corporate collections. Typically the interviewee's comments or analysis of the visual material is itself recorded, either on audio tape or video, etc. Photo voice is a related research method in which researchers give those being studied still or movie cameras. Research participants are taught to use the image making technology but are then responsible for making photos or movies which are subsequently analyzed either by the researchers or the participants, or both. The first use of photo voice was by Wang and Burris (published in 1994), where they defined it as \\"a method through which knowledge would be generated by people who were normally passive objects in the research process.\\" In any case, in this first sense visual sociology means including and incorporating visual methods of data gathering and analysis in the work of sociology. This method has recently been transferred to other academic disciplines, notably having been pioneered in contemporary religious research.Dr. Sarah Dunlop Values and Significance: A case study exploring the search for meaning among young people in Eastern and Central Europe, a paper given at the BSA Sociology of Religion Study Group Annual Conference 2008 'Religion and Youth' Dr. Sarah Dunlop \\"Visualising Hope.\\" published 2008 by YTC Press. =Studying visual data produced by cultures= Visual sociology attempts to study visual images produced as part of culture. Art, photographs, film, video, fonts, advertisements, computer icons, landscape, architecture, machines, fashion, makeup, hair style, facial expressions, tattoos, and so on are parts of the complex visual communication system produced by members of societies. The use and understanding of visual images is governed by socially established symbolic codes. Visual images are constructed and may be deconstructed. They may be read as texts in a variety of ways. They can be analyzed with techniques developed in diverse fields of literary criticism, art theory and criticism, content analysis, semiotics, deconstructionism, or the more mundane tools of ethnography. Visual sociologists can categorize and count them; ask people about them; or study their use and the social settings in which they are produced and consumed. So the second meaning of visual sociology is a discipline to study the visual products of society‚Äîtheir production, consumption and meaning. =Communication with images and media other than words= A third dimension of visual sociology is both the use of visual media to communicate sociological understandings to professional and public audiences, and also the use of visual media within sociological research itself. In this context, visual sociology draws on the work of Edward Tufte, whose books Envisioning Information and The Visual Display of Quantitative Information address the communication of quantitative information. Qualitatively, visual sociology can be analyzed through content analysis, semiotics, and conversation analysis. Visual sociology considers the logics of presentation of sociological and anthropological documentarians and ethnographers like Robert Flaherty, Konrad Lorenz, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and Frederick Wiseman. Visual sociology also requires the development of new forms‚Äîfor example, data driven computer graphics to represent complex relationships e.g., changing social networks over time, the primitive accumulation of capital, the flow of labor, relations between theory and practice.

Parker Jr. and was first published in 1978 by Cedarwinds (0915297019). In Once a Runner, Parker illustrates the hard work and dedication that is required of an elite runner. A reissue was released in 2009. The novel was followed by the sequel Again to Carthage in 2008 and the prequel Racing the Rain in 2015. Plot summary The novel opens with a physically fit young man standing on a track, watching as \\"the night joggers\\" toil around him. He begins to walk toward the starting post and thinks that now that the Olympic games are over for him, he does not know what he will do with his life. The man starts to walk around the track and thinks back to four years ago. Quenton Cassidy is a collegiate runner at fictional Southeastern University based on the University of Florida. He is a distance runner who specializes in the Mile. After writing a petition for the college's athletes protesting a dress and conduct code, Quenton is suspended from the university and prohibited from competing in the university's annual track meet. Cassidy drops out, moves to a cabin in the woods, and submits himself to a brutal training regimen. He is under the coaching of fictional gold medalist Olympian Bruce Denton, based on Jack Bacheler. His plan is to compete at the Southeastern Relays against the best miler in the world, John Walton (obviously based on John Walker). Because he is barred from competing at the meet, Denton comes up with a plan to disguise him as a Finnish runner attending a nonexistent university in Ohio. Cassidy, who has always dreamed of running a sub 4:00 mile, spends many months training for the race of his life, urged on by Denton, who is nearing the end of his running career due to injuries. After completing an agonizing interval workout of 60 quarter miles, Cassidy finally believes he is ready to face Walton. The night before the race, Cassidy performs a ritual of his to prepare himself for the meet‚Äîhe walks a mile on the Southeastern track, putting all of his \\"demons\\" in a symbolic \\"orb\\" that will hold them in during the race and allow him to push through the pain. The next day, Cassidy arrives disguised at the meet but spends more than an hour warming up on the cross-country course near the track. As the race draws nearer, Quenton fights to keep control of his adrenaline and anxiety, waiting until the race starts so he can unleash them. A large part of a chapter is devoted to the race itself, which comes down to a contest between Cassidy and Walton in the final lap. The novel describes the effect lactic acid has on Quenton as he fights to close in on Walton, who has a slight lead. Excruciatingly, Cassidy reels Walton in and outsprints him in the final straight to win the race in a time of 3:52.5. After the race, the scene changes back to Cassidy standing at the Southeastern track, walking through the last lap of a mile. Quenton reflects upon his running career and realizes that while it is over for him, there is much to be left behind on the track. When he reaches the end of the lap, he reaches into his bag and pulls out a box with a silver Olympic medal inside. Cassidy thinks to himself that he can live with leaving behind his old life, and with a bittersweet feeling walks off into the night. Critical reception Once a Runner, while dismissed by some critics as a cult classic that generally appeals only to competitive runners, has received considerable critical praise from Sports Illustrated magazine, Track & Field News, and Runner's World magazine. Characters *Quenton Cassidy ‚Äì The protagonist of the book, Cassidy is a collegiate runner whose dedication to the sport forces him to choose to drop out of school and run under the coaching of Bruce Denton (see below). *Bruce Denton ‚Äì A fictional Olympic champion runner who becomes Cassidy's friend and coach. *Jerry Mizner ‚Äì Cassidy's best friend and teammate. *Andrea Cleland ‚Äì Cassidy's girlfriend. *Dick Doobey ‚Äì The head football coach at Southeastern.

History of archaeological research The first archaeologist to examine the site, George Rawlinson, noted a brick of king Nebuchadrezzar II of the Neo- Babylonian Empire mentioning the city of Kutha. The site was also visited by George Smith and by Edgar James Banks.Edgar James Banks, Cutha, The Biclical World, sol. 22, no. 1, pp. 61‚Äì64, 1903 Tell Ibrahim was excavated by Hormuzd Rassam in 1881, for four weeks. Little was discovered, mainly some inscribed bowls and a few tablets.

Reade, Rassam's Excavations at Borsippa and Kutha 1879-82, Iraq, vol. 48, pp. 105‚Äì116, 1986 Kutha and its environment Kutha lies on the right bank of the eastern branch of the Upper Euphrates, north of Nippur and around northeast of Babylon. The site consists of two tells or settlement mounds. The larger main mound is long and crescent-shaped. A smaller mound is located to the west. The two mounds, as is typical in the region, are separated by the dry bed of an ancient canal, the Shatt en-Nil. Kutha in textual sources According to the Tanakh, Cuthah was one of the five Syrian and Mesopotamian cities from which Sargon II, King of Assyria, brought settlers to take the places of the exiled Israelites (). II Kings relates that these settlers were attacked by lions, and interpreting this to mean that their worship was not acceptable to the deity of the land, they asked Sargon to send an Israelite priest, exiled in Assyria, to teach them, which he did. The result was a mixture of religions and peoples, the latter being known as \\"Cuthim\\" in Hebrew and as \\"Samaritans\\" to the Greeks.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews ix. 14, ¬ß 3 Kutha is also the name of the capital of the Sumerian underworld, Irkalla. Alfred Jeremias, The Babylonian conception of heaven and hell, D. Nutt, 1902 In the Assyrian inscriptions \\"Cutha\\" occurs on the Shalmaneser obelisk, line 82, in connection with Babylon. Shulgi (formerly read as Dungi), King of Ur III, built the temple of Nergal at Cuthah,Year Names of Shulgi at CDLI which fell into ruins, so that Nebuchadnezzar II had to rebuild the \\"temple of the gods, and placed them in safety in the temple\\".ib. 51b This agrees with the Biblical statement that the men of Cuthah served Nergal.II Kings xvii. 30 Josephus places Cuthah, which for him is the name of a river and of a district,Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, ix. 14, ¬ß 1, 3 in Persia, and NeubauerAdolf Neubauer, La G√©ographie du Talmud, p. 379, 1968 says that it is the name of a country near Kurdistan. The so-called \\"Legend of the King of Cuthah\\", a fragmentary inscription of the Akkadian literary genre called nar√ª, written as if it were transcribed from a royal stele, is in fact part of the \\"Cuthean Legend of Naram-Sin\\", not to be read as history, a copy of which found in the cuneiform library at Sultantepe, north of Harran.O. R. Gurney, The Sultantepe Tablets (Continued). IV. The Cuthaean Legend of Naram-Sin, Anatolian Studies, vol. 5, pp. 93‚Äì113, 1955 Sumu-la-El, a king of the 1st Babylonian Dynasty, rebuilt the city walls of Kutha.Year Names of Sumulael at CDLI The city was later defeated by Hammurabi of Babylon in the 39th year of his reign.Year Names of Hammurabi at CDLI Ibn Sa'd in his Kitab Tabaqat Al-Kubra writes that the maternal grandfather of Abraham, Karbana, was the one who discovered the river Kutha. In The Last Pagans of Iraq: Ibn Wa·∏•shiyya and His Nabatean Agriculture, Jaakko H√§meen-Anttila says: \\"One might also mention the rather surprising story, traced back to 'Ali, the first Imam of the Shiites, where he is made to identify himself as ‚Äúone of the Nabateans from Lutha‚Äù (see Yaqut, Mu'jamIV: 488, s.v. Kutha). It goes without saying that the story is apocryphal, but it shows that among the Shiites there were people ready to identify themselves with the Nabateans. Thus it comes as no surprise that especially in the so- called ghul√†t movements (extremist Shiites) a lot of material surfaces that is derivable from Mesopotamian sources (cf. H√§meen-Anttila 2001), and the early Shiite strongholds were to a great extent in the area inhabited by Nabateans. \\"Yaqut also notes, \\"the identification of Kutha as the original home Shiah Muslims believe to be the Abrahamic roots of Islam. Yet the identification of Kutha, and by extension also Abraham, with the Nabateans is remarkable.\\" Al- Tabari says in The History of Prophets and Kings that the prophet Ibrahim was the son of his mother Nuba or Anmatala, who was the daughter of Karita who dug the river Kutha, named after his father Kutha.

She was launched on 14 June 2006 in Portsmouth Naval Base by VT Group shipbuilders in Portsmouth, England, and is the fourth vessel of the , with a displacement of 2,000 tonnes and a 30 mm Oerlikon KCB gun in place of the 20 mm gun fitted to Tyne River-class ships. Clyde was decommissioned on the 20 December 2019 at HMNB Portsmouth and was returned to her owners at BAE Systems Maritime - Naval Ships, https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest- activity/news/2019/december/20/191220-hms-clyde-homecoming although the ship remained under lease from BAE Systems to the Royal Navy until the end of March 2020. In August 2020 Clyde was transferred to the Kingdom of Bahrain. Operational history HMS Clyde at anchor in Fox Bay, West Falkland, July 2011 Clyde was the first ship built entirely in Portsmouth Naval base for 40 years and has been constructed alongside the bow and superstructure sections for the new Type 45 destroyers and . She was named in a ceremony on 7 September 2006 as she had not received a traditional launching ceremony. HMS Clyde was commissioned into the Royal Navy in a ceremony at Portsmouth Naval base on 30 January 2007. She and her ship's company went through a rigorous series of trials and safety training before undergoing operational sea training off Scotland. After being commissioned into active service she was sent to the South Atlantic to relieve as the Royal Navy's patrol vessel in the area based in the Falkland Islands. Unlike predecessors in this role Clyde will stay in South Atlantic waters for the foreseeable future, with a contract in place for her to remain in the Falkland Islands until 2018. In January 2011, the government of Brazil denied HMS Clyde access to Rio de Janeiro in solidarity with Argentinian claims over the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute, as Uruguay had done with the previous September. On 18 November 2015, HMS Clyde assisted in the rescue of 347 passengers and crew from the cruise ship Le Boreal drifting off the Falkland Islands after an engine room fire. At , it took the Clyde four hours to reach the stricken ship, which was off the north end of Falkland Sound. Clyde resupplied one of the two larger lifeboats with fuel and took on people from the smaller lifeboats, and then escorted them to Falkland Sound, where they transferred the passengers to Le Boreals sister ship, L'Austral. In January 2017, Clyde was dry docked in Simonstown, South Africa for maintenance; her patrol duties were temporarily transferred to survey ship . On 21 September 2017, Clyde celebrated ten years in the South Atlantic with her only time off station being the maintenance periods in South Africa. In November 2017, Clyde was ordered to return from a patrol of South Georgia to assist in the search for the missing Argentinian submarine . Future A parliamentary briefing paper released in October 2016 stated that Clyde would leave service in 2017; however on 24 April 2017, in a written answer to a question raised by Sir Nicholas Soames, Parliamentary Under- Secretary for Defence Harriet Baldwin stated Clyde would be decommissioned in 2019. Clyde was due to be replaced by the Batch 2 ship in 2018 however later than originally planned, Forth relieved Clyde in late 2019. Clyde made her entry into Portsmouth after 12 years away on 20 December 2019 and was decommissioned on the same day. Clyde was expected to be taken over by Brazil once the Royal Navy lease expires. However, this was denied by the Brazilian Navy, with BAE Systems taking back possession of the ship at the end of the Royal Navy's lease. Transfer to Bahrain On 7 August 2020 it was announced in a ceremony held at the HMNB Portsmouth Naval Base in the UK, that Clyde had been transferred to the Royal Bahrain Naval Force, with the ship renamed as RBNS Al-Zubara. The ceremony was held in the presence of the Bahraini Ambassador to the UK and representatives of BAE Systems.

The suction pressure, along with the suction temperature and the wet bulb temperature of the discharge air are used to determine the correct refrigerant charge in a system. If some solute is dissolved in water, its diffusion pressure decreases. The difference between diffusion pressure of pure water and solution is called diffusion pressure deficit (DPD). When a plant cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water enters into a cell by osmosis and as a result turgor pressure develops in the cell which is in solution . The cell membrane becomes stretched and the osmotic pressure of the cell decreases. As the cell absorbs more and more water its Turgor Pressure increases and Osmotic Pressure decreases. When a cell is fully turgid, its OP is equal to TP and DPD is zero. Turgid cells cannot absorb any more water. Thus, with reference to plant cells, the DPD can be described as the actual thirst of a cell for water and can be expressed as DPD=OP-TP. When DPD is zero, entry of water will stop. Thus it is DPD that tends to equate and represents the water-absorbing ability of a cell, it is also called suction force (SF) or suction pressure (SP). DPD is directly proportional to the height of the plant, tree or organism. DPD is governed by two factors i.e. turgor pressure and osmotic pressure. The formula is DPD = OP - TP. Turgor pressure can also be denoted as wall pressure in some cases. The term diffusion pressure deficit (DPD) was coined by B.S Meyer in 1938. Originally DPD was described as suction pressure by Renner (1915). It is a reduction in the diffusion pressure of water in solution or cell over its pure state due to the presence of solutes in it and forces opposing diffusion. Diffusion pressure deficit or Diffusion pressure of pure water is maximum and its theoretical value is 1245.69 atm at STP. For pure water DPD and Diffusion pressure are same. DPD of a solution is equal to its osmotic pressure i.e. DPD = OP(of solution). The DPD of a cell is influenced by both osmotic pressure and wall pressure (turgor pressure) which opposes the endosmotic entry of water, i.e. DPD = OP - wall pressure. DPD is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution. DPD decreases with dilution of the solution. The actual pressure with which a cell absorbs water is called \\"suction pressure\\".

It later became a residential school and is now private housing. Herbert Austin The early history of Lickey Grange is not known. Herbert Austin founded the Austin Motor Company, at Longbridge, in 1905 and he moved his family to Lickey Grange in 1910. His new home included of surrounding land; and a lodge. He had worked as an Engineer at the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Company in Australia and returned to England with his Australian wife in 1893 to become Manager of its manufacturing operations in Aston, Birmingham. He extended the range of the company but continued as manager of both parts. The new part became known in 1901 as the Wolseley Tool and Motor Company; and he had designed its first car. He left the Wolseley Tool and Motor company in 1905, bringing two former Wolseley designers with him to his new company at Longbridge, which was then in the countryside, in Worcestershire. However, he continued working for the Wolseley Sheep and Shearing Company; and was Chairman from 1911 to 1931. Between 1893 and 1910 Herbert Austin had lived in various parts of Birmingham. By 1910 the family, two daughters and a son, moved to Lickey Grange where he spent the rest of his life. The Austin 7 was designed at Lickey Grange between 1921 and 1922 in the billiards room (but not on the billiards table!). This was a 7 horsepower (hp) car. It had been designed in private, at Sir Herbert Austin's expense, at Lickey Grange because the other directors of the Austin Motor company preferred bigger 12 hp-engined cars and were against the idea of a \\"small\\" car. Herbert Austin patented some of the features and so gained a royalty for every Austin 7 sold by the company. Stanley Edge, the young design draughtsman who worked for Sir Herbert, lived at the Lodge but ate his meals in the adjoining library. Herbert Austin died in 1941 and was buried in the graveyard of Holy Trinity Church, Lickey. The Grange was later sold. Birmingham Royal Institution for the Blind The Birmingham Royal Institution for the Blind (BRIB), a charity, then took over Lickey Grange and the first pupils moved-in in March 1953. The BRIB's school had previously been at Carpenter Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, but this site was acquired by the BBC, (firstly Outside broadcasting in 1954, then the Regional HQ in 1955), forcing the move to Lickey Grange. The BRIB kept the house much the same as it had been, but the grounds were developed to meet the needs of a residential school. Individual houses were built for teachers, Hostel blocks were built for the pupils, plus an assembly hall, indoor swimming pool and class rooms. The school catered for a mixture of residential and day pupils. Until the 1980s there were more residential pupils than day pupils; however changes in the methods of education - integration - lead to a large drop in the numbers of children being sent to the school. Redevelopment The house is Victorian with the large rooms, such as a library and a billiards room. After the BRIB vacated the site it was redeveloped with teachers' houses nearest to the Old Birmingham Road sold off first. The rest of the site is now a gated community of up-market homes. =Access= Lickey Grange is accessed from the Old Birmingham Road (B4096). The B4096 appears to have once formed the route of the A38, but the A38 now bypasses Lickey. References * Sharratt, Barney, (2000).

In 2019 Dynamite launched a new volume of Chastity written by Leah Williams and drawn by Daniel Maine.  Fictional Character Biography  =Original Chaos! Comics= Chastity Marks was an average American teenager to begin with. She was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio by an abusive father. In 1976 Marks - now seventeen years of age - decides to run away from home. Her goal was to travel to London to train with the Royal Shakespeare Company and become an actress. She made it to New York City, and arrived in Manhattan on Halloween, broke and hungry. In order to make some money for food and further travel, she attempted to get a job as a nightclub dancer, but swiftly found the profession not to her liking. Leaving the club, she was witness to an argument between a black private investigator, Jackie Slade, and the club's manager, as Jackie endeavored to retrieve his young niece from the establishment. The manager attempted to kill Slade, and Chastity stopped him, though they were still far from safe. Slade got Chastity off the premises alive, and gave her all the money he had on him, before going back for his niece again. He died shortly afterwards in the ensuing gunfight. Finally reaching London, Chastity's dreams of making it as an actress were dashed when she was turned away at the Academy's door. So Chastity instead got involved in the newly emerging punk rock scene. Not too much later she was running a late night errand for a band called the Nobs when she was attacked by an obese vampire called Farley. She escaped by stabbing him in the eye with a drumstick... but she didn't get away with her life. Chastity awoke from the encounter to find that she was a guest of the Countess, a prominent member of the undead community. The Countess explained her new existence to her, and having discovered that she was uniquely undetectable to other vampires, trained her to be an assassin. She spent the next few years trying to stop her new peers from killing her mortal boyfriend, Billy Zone, lead man for the Nobs, and winning the grudging respect of the European Council of vampires. Chastity returned to America in 1980, again traveling to Manhattan, where she became part of the burgeoning Goth scene. That Halloween she was surprised to see Jackie Slade enter a club she was in and murder apparently innocent musicians. Afterwards she went to the New York Public Library to do some research, and discovered that ever since he died in 1976, his ghost was reported to return each Halloween to slaughter musicians. A bit more digging revealed that his targets, far from being innocent, were members of a group run by a mystery man called Danton, and calling itself the Church of the Immortal. Chastity disguised herself and tried to locate the cult, eventually being captured by some of them and taken to their leader. Danton revealed that he was a six-hundred-year-old demon who drained his victims' life forces to survive, and that he was planning to use his musicians to place subliminal messages in their work so that others would be ensnared by his Church, just as Jackie's niece had been. Chastity escaped, and feeling indebted to Slade for what he had done years before, she set out to eliminate Danton. Initially he eluded her, but she finally caught up with him during the Greenwich Village Costume Parade, where he was stealing the life forces of those in attendance. Unfortunately for her, he was too powerful, and far from ending his threat, he managed to drain her life too. This proved to be a mistake; now that he was contaminated with her vampirically tainted energies, Danton finally became vulnerable to Slade. The ghost made short work of the demon, freeing the spirits he had captured, including Chastity and his niece. His last communication with the vampiress was that she should live, for all of Danton's victims, advice she has taken to heart ever since. Following in Slade's footsteps, she tries to fight evil and protect the innocents, because she was one herself once. She'd love to live a normal life, but knows she can't. After Evil Ernie decimated the city in the early 1990s she gained a new goal, to see him eradicated once and for all. After a confrontation with Evil Ernie she suddenly developed a serious crush on him. Later on, she asked him if he wanted to join her in a \\"relaxing\\" murder spree in Graceland, but Ernie rejected her. =New Chaos! Comics= In 1976, teenager Chastity Marks was an American runaway living in London. Punk rock was all the rage, and Chastity was soon running errands for a local band. One night while on the job she was attacked by a vampire. She escaped, but not with her life: Chastity was now a vampire, but with a twist. To the rest of the vampire world, she was completely undetectable. Today, Chastity works freelance for the Cabal, a secret society of vampires, werewolves, and witches who rule over the monster underworld. As strong as ten men and a master martial artist, Chastity serves (on her terms) as the Cabal's most efficient and merciless assassin, all the while trying to live a normal life.

The Japanese arcade release was published by Konami. Home versions were published by Tengen. The graphical animations for the player character and opponents were created through a bluescreen process, where the various poses and moves were performed by real actors in front of a video camera. The game's on-screen character animation are replays of the actual footage, not a rotoscoped (redrawn) animation. Pit-Fighter is the second fighting game to use digitized sprites, after Home Data's Reikai D≈çshi: Chinese Exorcist. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to Taito's Violence Fight and SNK's Street Smart. The player must punch and kick their opponents until their energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at once, the character will perform a \\"super move\\". The player begins by choosing one of the three playable characters, who each have different moves, speed, and power. As many as three people can play at a time, but there will be extra opponents to fight during any of the game's 15 different matches. Every third fight is a bonus round known as a Grudge Match. In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of the fighter if playing alone, or against the other players in a multiplayer game. Getting knocked down three times eliminates a player from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last one standing. Losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player, but the winner gets bonus money. The final battle, the \\"Championship Match\\", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches periodically, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him. Sometimes during matches the player will encounter foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at a character in play. The player may also encounter a power-up known as the \\"power pill\\". If a character grabs this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits. At times even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man (Milt Loper) and Knife Woman (Dianne Bertucci), will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent. The audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area. = Characters= Pit-Fighter features 3 playable fighters: * Buzz (Bill Chase): A big and strong ex-professional wrestler. * Ty (Marc Williams): An agile kickboxing champion. * Kato (Glenn Fratticelli): A quick 3rd degree black belt. Pit-Fighter has 8 unplayable opponents.

Ports were also released in 1991 for personal computers: the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum. In February 1993, the Spectrum version was released as part of the Super Fighter compilation with Final Fight and WWF WrestleMania. MegaTech magazine said the graphics were \\"badly defined with rough animation\\". Mega placed the Mega Drive version at #27 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 The Super NES port lacks the interactive audience and weapons, and is missing three characters: Southside Jim, Heavy Metal, and Mad Miles. Handheld versions were released for the Atari Lynx and the Game Boy in 1992. Tiger Electronics released its own dedicated handheld version of the game. An emulated version of the arcade game is featured in the 2004's Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, as well as Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition (2006) for Microsoft Windows. This version runs at a faster speed than the arcade original. Pit-Fighter was also included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Pit-Fighter on their January 1, 1991 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Julian Rignall of Computer and Video Games gave the game 90%, calling it a \\"thoroughly enjoyable beat'em up which really packs a punch\\" and \\"one of the most enjoyable arcade fighting games in a long time.\\" Zzap!64 gave the game a more negative review, dubbing it an \\"anticlimactic beat'em up\\" and writing that the attract mode was the best part of the game. They criticized the limited frames of animation and compared it unfavorably to The Combatribes and Final Fight. Computer Gaming World approved of the Amiga version of Pit-Fighter, stating that it \\"is the arcade game teleported\\", and concluded that the game \\"offers the two-player option missing in many fighter games and enough roughhousing to suit the most violent gamer\\". Reviewing the Super Nintendo port, George and Rob reviewed the game in Nintendo Power. George commented that game was \\"extremely difficult to control\\" and that Rob commented on the graphics using digitized people, stating \\"it doesn't matter if it uses new technology or not. The question is \\"is the game fun?\\" and I think the answer in this case is \\"no\\".\\" Legacy Electronic Gaming Monthly had a two-page preview of the planned sequel, which the magazine claimed was more than 75% finished and would be released for Sega Genesis in the 4th quarter of 1993. Kato, Buzz, and Ty were returning along with three new selectable fighters: Connor (Karate Champion), Tanya (Roller Queen), and Chief (Ex-bodyguard) ‚Äî three of the playable characters that were ultimately featured in Atari's subsequent game, Guardians of the 'Hood. Pictures show two CPU fighters, Helga (level 1) and Jay-Jay (level 2).

Geographically it is situated by the shores of Lule River at 499 meter height. Porjus is known for having one of the oldest hydropower plants in Sweden (Porjus kraftverk - Porjus hydroelectric power station), built 1910‚Äì1915. The power plant was built to deliver electricity to the building of the railroad between Lule√• and Narvik, where the mining industry shipped iron ore. Today, Porjus is a living village and the old power plant is a popular tourist attraction among many others. Swedish power company Vattenfall is the biggest employer, but there are also a number of smaller companies such as the small aviation company Fiskflyg, which offered the first regular passenger flights in Sweden back in the days (the route: Porjus - Suorva). There is also a unique golf course (you play across the Lule river, next to a big dam), a small downhill skiing course, snowmobile routes, small shops, a 50 kilometer long walking trail from G√§llivare, used by the workers to carry building material 90 years ago, and a unique photo gallery which has aurora borealis as its specialty. Porjus was the home of the online artists Lagoona between the years 1996‚Äì2004. Singer Birgitta Svend√©n and the former MD of major Swedish technology company Ericsson, Carl-Henric Svanberg, now chairman of BP, are two other well-known persons who were born in Porjus.

The militarisation of space involves the placement and development of weaponry and military technology in outer space. The early exploration of space in the mid-20th century had, in part, a military motivation, as the United States and the Soviet Union used it as an opportunity to demonstrate ballistic-missile technology and other technologies having the potential for military application. Outer space has since been used as an operating location for military spacecraft such as imaging and communications satellites, and some ballistic missiles pass through outer space during their flight. , known deployments of weapons stationed in space include only the Almaz space-station armament and pistols such as the TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol (for post-landing, pre-recovery use). History =The Cold War= During the Cold War, the world's two great superpowers‚Äîthe Soviet Union and the United States of America‚Äîspent large proportions of their GDP on developing military technologies. The drive to place objects in orbit stimulated space research and started the Space Race. In 1957, the USSR launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. By the end of the 1960s, both countries regularly deployed satellites. Reconnaissance satellites were used by militaries to take accurate pictures of their rivals' military installations. As time passed the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the iron curtain. Both the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or destroy each other's satellites. Directed-energy weapons, kamikaze-style satellites, as well as orbital nuclear explosives were researched with varying levels of success. Spy satellites were, and continue to be, used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control treaties signed between the two superpowers. To use spy satellites in such a manner is often referred to in treaties as \\"national technical means of verification\\". The superpowers developed ballistic missiles to enable them to use nuclear weaponry across great distances. As rocket science developed, the range of missiles increased and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) were created, which could strike virtually any target on Earth in a timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days. To cover large distances ballistic missiles are usually launched into sub-orbital spaceflight. Test of the LG-118A Peacekeeper missile, each one of which could carry 10 independently targeted nuclear warheads along trajectories outside of the Earth's atmosphere. As soon as intercontinental missiles were developed, military planners began programmes and strategies to counter their effectiveness. United States Early American efforts included the Nike- Zeus Program, Project Defender, the Sentinel Program and the Safeguard Program. The late 1950s Nike-Zeus programme involved firing Nike nuclear missiles against oncoming ICBMs, thus exploding nuclear warheads over the North Pole. This idea was soon scrapped and work began on Project Defender in 1958. Project Defender attempted to destroy Soviet ICBMs at launch with satellite weapon systems, which orbited over Russia. This programme proved infeasible with the technology from that era. Work then began on the Sentinel Program which used anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) to shoot down incoming ICBMs. In the late 1950s United States Air Force considered detonating an atomic bomb on the Moon to display U.S. superiority to the Soviet Union and the rest of the world (Project A119). In 1959, a feasibility study of a possible military base on the Moon (Project Horizon) was conducted. In 1958, a plan for a 21-airman underground Air Force base on the Moon by 1968 was developed (Lunex Project). The Safeguard Program was deployed in the mid-1970s and was based on the Sentinel Program. Since the ABM treaty only allowed for construction of a single ABM facility to protect either the nation's capital city or an ICBM field, the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex was constructed near Nekoma, North Dakota to protect the Grand Forks ICBM facility. Though it was only operational as an ABM facility for less than a year, the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), one of Safeguard's components, was still operational as of 2005. One major problem with the Safeguard Program, and past ABM systems, was that the interceptor missiles, though state-of-the-art, required nuclear warheads to destroy incoming ICBMs. Future ABMs will likely be more accurate and use hit-to-kill or conventional warheads to knock down incoming warheads. The technology involved in such systems was shaky at best, and deployment was limited by the ABM treaty of 1972. In 1983, American president Ronald Reagan proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a space-based system to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear missiles. The plan was ridiculed by some as unrealistic and expensive, and Dr Carol Rosin nicknamed the policy \\"Star Wars\\", after the popular science-fiction movie franchise. Astronomer Carl Sagan pointed out that in order to defeat SDI, the Soviet Union had only to build more missiles, allowing them to overcome the defence by sheer force of numbers. Proponents of SDI said the strategy of technology would hasten the Soviet Union's downfall. According to this doctrine, Communist leaders were forced to either shift large portions of their GDP to counter SDI, or else watch as their expensive nuclear stockpiles were rendered obsolete. United States Space Command (USSPACECOM), a unified command of the United States military, was created in 1985 to help institutionalise the use of outer space by the United States Armed Forces. The Commander in Chief of U.S. Space Command (CINCUSSPACECOM), with headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado was also the Commander in Chief of the bi-national U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (CINCNORAD), and for the majority of time during USSPACECOM's existence also the Commander of the U.S. Air Force major command Air Force Space Command. Military space operations coordinated by USSPACECOM proved to be very valuable for the U.S.-led coalition in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The U.S. military has relied on communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning and weather satellite systems in areas of conflict since the early 1990s, including the Balkans, Southwest Asia and Afghanistan. Space systems are considered indispensable providers of tactical information to U.S. war- fighters. As part of the ongoing initiative to transform the U.S. military, on 26 June 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that U.S. Space Command would merge with USSTRATCOM. The UCP directed that Unified Combatant Commands be capped at ten, and with the formation of the new United States Northern Command, one would have to be deactivated in order to maintain that level. Thus the USSPACECOM merger into USSTRATCOM. USSR Polyus (1987). The Soviet Union was also researching innovative ways of gaining space supremacy. Two of their most notable efforts were the R-36ORB Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) and Polyus orbital weapons system. The R-36ORB was a Soviet ICBM in the 1960s that, once launched, would go into a low Earth orbit whereupon it would de-orbit for an attack. This system would approach North America over the South Pole, thereby striking targets from the opposite direction from that to which NORAD early warning systems are oriented. The missile was phased out in January 1983 in compliance with the SALT II treaty. The SALT II treaty (1979) prohibited the deployment of FOBS systems: : Each Party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy: :(...) :(c) systems for placing into Earth orbit nuclear weapons or any other kind of weapons of mass destruction, including fractional orbital missiles; On May 15, 1987, an Energia rocket flew for the first time. The payload was a prototype orbital weapons platform Polyus (also known as Polus, Skif-DM or 17F19DM), the final version of which according to some reports could be armed with nuclear space mines and defensive cannon. The Polyus weapons platform was designed to defend itself against anti-satellite weapons with recoilless cannon. It was also equipped with a sensor blinding laser to confuse approaching weapons and could launch test targets to validate the fire control system. The attempt to place the satellite into orbit failed. =Post-Cold War= A Lightweight Exo- Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP), which attaches to a modified SM-2 Block IV missile used by the U.S. Navy As the Cold War ended with the implosion of the Soviet Union the space race between the two superpowers ended. The United States of America was left as the only superpower on Earth with a large concentration of the world's wealth and technological advancement. Despite the United States' new status in the world, the monopoly of space militarisation is in no way certain. Countries such as China, Japan, and India have begun their own space programmes, while the European Union collectively works to create satellite systems to rival those of the United States. The USSR Space Forces were established as the Ministry of Defense Space Units in 1982. In 1991 the Soviet Union disintegrated. The Russian Armed Forces were established on 7 May 1992, enabling the creation of Russian Space Forces later that year on 10 August. In July 1997 the Space Force was dissolved as a separate service arm and incorporated to the Strategic Rocket Forces along with the Space Missile Defense Forces, which previously were part of the Troops of Air Defense. The Russian Space Forces were officially reborn on June 1, 2001 as an independent section of the Russian military. Post Cold War space militarisation seems to revolve around three types of applications. (The word \\"seems\\" is used because much of this subject matter is inconclusively verifiable, due to the high level of secrecy that exists among the great powers with regard to the details of space sensing systems.) The first application is the continuing development of \\"spy\\" or reconnaissance satellites which began in the Cold War era, but has progressed significantly since that time. Spy satellites perform a variety of missions such as high- resolution photography (IMINT) and communications eavesdropping (SIGINT). These tasks are performed on a regular basis both during peacetime and war operations. Satellites are also used by the nuclear states to provide early warning of missile launches, locate nuclear detonations, and detect preparations for otherwise clandestine or surprise nuclear tests (at least those tests or preparations carried out above-ground); this was the case when, in 1998, India and Pakistan both conducted a series of nuclear tests; in addition, a nuclear-detection satellite of the Vela type was also reported to have detected a nuclear detonation in the Indian Ocean in 1978 that was believed to be a South African nuclear test in what was famously called the Vela Incident. Early-warning satellites can also be used to detect tactical missile launches; this capability was used during Desert Storm, when America was able to provide advance warning to Israel of Iraqi SS-1 SCUD missile launches.

The second application of space militarisation currently in use is GPS or Global Positioning System. This satellite navigation system is used for determining one's precise location and providing a highly accurate time reference almost anywhere on Earth or in Earth orbit. It uses an intermediate circular orbit (ICO) satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites. The GPS system was designed by and is controlled by the United States Department of Defense and can be used by anyone, free of charge. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately US$400 million per year, including the replacement of ageing satellites. The first of 24 satellites that form the current GPS constellation (Block II) was placed into orbit on February 14, 1989. The 52nd GPS satellite since the beginning in 1978 was launched November 6, 2004 aboard a Delta II rocket. The primary military purposes are to allow improved command and control of forces through improved location awareness, and to facilitate accurate targeting of smart bombs, cruise missiles, or other munitions. The satellites also carry nuclear detonation detectors, which form a major portion of the United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System. European concern about the level of control over the GPS network and commercial issues has resulted in the planned Galileo positioning system. Russia already operates an independent system called GLONASS (global navigation system); the system operates with 24 satellites that are deployed in 3 orbital planes as opposed to the 4 in which GPS is deployed. The Chinese \\"Beidou\\" system provides China a similar regional (not global) navigation capability. Military communication systems The third current application of militarisation of space can be demonstrated by the emerging military doctrine of network-centric warfare. Network-centric warfare relies heavily on the use of high-speed communications, which allows all soldiers and branches of the military to view the battlefield in real-time. Real-time technology improves the situational awareness of all of the military's assets and commanders in a given theatre. For example, a soldier in the battle zone can access satellite imagery of enemy positions two blocks away, and if necessary e-mail the coordinates to a bomber or weapon platform hovering overhead while the commander, hundreds of miles away, watches as the events unfold on a monitor. This high-speed communication is facilitated by a separate internet created by the military for the military. Communication satellites hold this system together by creating an informational grid over the given theatre of operations. The Department of Defense is currently working to establish a Global Information Grid to connect all military units and branches into a computerised network in order to share information and create a more efficient military. Military spaceplanes It was revealed that Soviet officials were concerned that the US Space Shuttle program had such military objectives such as to make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow Garber, S.

Master's thesis, Virginia Tech. and these concerns were part of the motivation behind pursuing their own Buran programme. The NASA uncrewed spaceplane project X-37 was transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. It is unclear what its military mission would be. The X-37 is akin to a space version of Unmanned aerial vehicle. Weapons in space Triple-barreled TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol in Saint-Petersburg Artillery museum Space weapons are weapons used in space warfare. They include weapons that can attack space systems in orbit (i.e. anti-satellite weapons), attack targets on the earth from space or disable missiles travelling through space. In the course of the militarisation of space, such weapons were developed mainly by the contesting superpowers during the Cold War, and some remain under development today. Space weapons are also a central theme in military science fiction and sci-fi video games. =Terrestrial-type weapons in space= The Soviet space station Salyut 3 was fitted with a 23mm cannon, which was successfully test fired at target satellites, at ranges from .–®–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ –ê.–ë.

The intent of the weapon is to protect cosmonauts from wild animals in the event of an off-course wilderness landing. The specially designed gun is capable of firing bullets, shotgun shells, or flares. Space warfare A USAF F-15 Eagle launching an ASM-135 ASAT anti-satellite missile. Space warfare is combat that takes place in outer space, i.e. outside the atmosphere. Technically, as a distinct classification, it refers to battles where the targets themselves are in space. Space warfare therefore includes ground-to-space warfare, such as attacking satellites from the Earth, as well as space-to-space warfare, such as satellites attacking satellites. It does not include the use of satellites for espionage, surveillance, or military communications, however useful those activities might be. It does not technically include space-to-ground warfare, where orbital objects attack ground, sea or air targets directly, but the public and media frequently use the term to include any conflict which includes space as a theatre of operations, regardless of the intended target. For example, a rapid delivery system in which troops are deployed from orbit might be described as \\"space warfare,\\" even though the military uses the term as described above. A film was produced by the U.S. Military in the early 1960s called Space and National Security which depicted space warfare.PBS Nova Program ‚ÄúAstrospies‚Äù , Broadcast February 12, 2008. From 1985 to 2002 there was a United States Space Command, which in 2002 merged with the United States Strategic Command. There is a Russian Space Force, which was established on August 10, 1992, and which became an independent section of the Russian military on December 1, 2001. Only a few incidents of space warfare have occurred in world history, and all were training missions, as opposed to actions against real opposing forces. In the mid-1980s a USAF pilot in an F-15 successfully shot down the P78-1, a communications satellite in a orbit. In 2007 the People's Republic of China used a missile system to destroy one of its obsolete satellites (see 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test), in 2008 the United States similarly destroyed its malfunctioning satellite USA 193, and in 2019, India followed China and the U.S. by destroying a live satellite.Reuters World News , March 28, 2019Times of India India shoots into star wars club, Mar 28, 2019 To date, there have been no human casualties resulting from conflict in space, nor has any ground target been successfully neutralised from orbit. International treaties governing space limit or regulate conflicts in space and limit the installation of weapon systems, especially nuclear weapons. Space treaties Treaties are agreed to when all parties perceive a benefit from becoming a signatory participant in the treaty. As mutually assured destruction (MAD) became the deterrent strategy between the two superpowers in the Cold War, many countries worked together to avoid extending the threat of nuclear weapons to space based launchers. =Outer Space Treaty= The Outer Space Treaty was considered by the in 1966. Later that year, agreement was reached in the United Nations General Assembly. The treaty included the following principles: * the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind; * outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all States; * outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means; * States shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner; * the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; * Astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind; * States shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental activities; * States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and * States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies. In summary, the treaty initiated the banning of signatories' placing of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction in orbit of Earth, installing them on the moon or any other celestial body, or to otherwise station them in outer space. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union signed the treaty and it entered into effect on October 10, 1967. As of January 1, 2005, 98 States have ratified, and an additional 27 have signed the Outer Space Treaty. Note that this treaty does not ban the placement of weapons in space in general, only nuclear weapons and WMD. =Moon Treaty= The Moon Treaty (not ratified by any space capable state, though signed by some) bans any military use of celestial bodies, including weapon testing, nuclear weapons in orbit, or military bases. The use of military personnel for scientific research or for any other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited. (Article 3.4) =Other drafts= In February 2008, China and Russia together submitted a draft to the UN known as the Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT).DeFrieze, D. (2014). \\"Defining and regulating the weaponization of space\\". The International Relations and Security Network. The US opposed the draft treaty due to security concerns over its space assets despite the treaty explicitly affirming a State's inherent right of self-defence.Su, J. (2010). The ‚Äúpeaceful purposes‚Äù principle in outer space and the Russia‚ÄìChina PPWT Proposal. Space policy, 26(2), 81‚Äì90. On December 4, 2014, the General Assembly of the UN passed two resolutions on preventing an arms race in outer space: *The first resolution, Prevention of an arms race in outer space, \\"call[s] on all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the peaceful use of outer space, prevent an arms race there, and refrain from actions contrary to that objective.\\" There were 178 countries that voted in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (Israel, United States). *The second resolution, No first placement of weapons in outer space, emphasises the prevention of an arms race in space and states that \\"other measures could contribute to ensuring that weapons were not placed in outer space.\\" 126 countries voted in favour to 4 against (Georgia, Israel, Ukraine, United States), with 46 abstentions (EU member States abstained on the resolution). The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) is a committee subsidiary to the Conference on Disarmament. The PAROS Cttee, which meets at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, has been the forum for discussion of these issues since 1985. National Missile Defense (NMD) The logo of the Missile Defense Agency With the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War defence spending was reduced and space research was chiefly focused on peaceful research. American military research is focused on a more modest goal of preventing the United States from being subject to nuclear blackmail or nuclear terrorism by a rogue state. On 16 December 2002, US President George W. Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive which outlined a plan to begin deployment of operational ballistic missile defence systems by 2004. The following day, the US formally requested from the UK and Denmark use of facilities in RAF Fylingdales, England and Thule, Greenland, respectively, as a part of the NMD Program.Lennon, Alexander T.J. Contemporary Nuclear Debates, (Cambridge:MIT Press), 1999, pp. 101‚Äì109. The administration continued to push the programme, despite highly publicised but not unexpected trial-and-error technical failures during development and over the objections of some scientists who opposed it. The projected cost of the programme for the years 2004 to 2009 was 53 billion US dollars, making it the largest single line in The Pentagon's budget. Missile defence does not station weapons in space, but is designed to intercept incoming warheads at a very high altitude, which requires the interceptor to travel into space to achieve the intercept.

Personal life and career  Yurick was born on January 18, 1925 to a Russian Jewish immigrant father Sam, a miller, and his mother Flo, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant.New York Daily News: \\"Sol Yurick, author of novel that became cult classic flick 'The Warriors,' dies at 87\\" by Shane Dixon Kavanaugh January 7, 2013  Born to working class Jewish immigrants in the Bronx in 1925, he remained a lifelong Marxist and social activist Theirs was a Jewish working-class family and politically active, both for communism and in the labor movement as trade-union activists. Family life in his early years meant that \\"Marx and Lenin, strikes and demonstrations, were regular topics of dinner-table conversation\\", according to Eric Homberger of The Guardian, and that \\"his earliest political memory was, at the age of 14, the anguish he felt at the Stalin-Hitler pact.\\" The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was an agreement between Stalin and Hitler that was made in the last few weeks before the outbreak of war, leading Yurick to both fall out with his father, and to enlist during World War II - where he trained as an Army surgical technician. Yurick said, \\"My feelings as a Jew were more important than my feelings as a communist.\\" After the war he took a bachelor's degree at New York University, majoring in literature. He graduated and took a job with New York City's welfare department as a social investigator, a job he held until the early 1960s. It was here that he became familiar with children of welfare families, many of whom were \\"then called juvenile delinquents [...] Many of them belonged to fighting gangs...numbered in the hundreds; they were veritable armies.\\" He earned his master's in English from Brooklyn College soon after, and then took up writing full-time. Yurick was involved in Students for a Democratic Society and the anti-war movement at this time. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post In 1972, Yurick was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.  Works  Yurick's first novel, The Warriors, appeared in 1965. It combined a classical Greek story, Anabasis, with a fictional account of gang wars in New York City. It inspired the 1979 film of the same name. His other works include: Fertig (1966), The Bag (1968), Someone Just Like You (1972), An Island Death (1976), Richard A (1981), Behold Metatron, the Recording Angel (1985), Confession (1999). = \\"The King of Malaputa\\" = In 1984, Yurick published a quite prescient and imaginative short story that considered how the use of a virtual, entirely imaginary island nation combined with advanced computer networking might be used to suck tremendous wealth from, and wreak havoc on, the global banking system. Appearing in Datamation, a then-leading trade magazine focused on enterprise computing, \\"The King of Malaputa\\" (translation: bad whore) predates by at least 15 years Neal Stephenson's better-known novel, Cryptonomicon (1999) and its imaginary island nation, Kinakuta, which has been set up for use in anonymous, computer-based banking activities. Yurick's island \\"exists\\" only as bogus entries in various banking and geographic databases; when searched for in these databases, the island appears to exist in many dimensions, including map coordinates and convincing satellite photos, but it is entirely virtual ‚Äì a figment of digital imagination. Elsewhere, criminals use satellite dishes to hack into the global banking system and divert money to the imaginary island and then, into their own pockets. The story reflects Yurick's longstanding focus on banks and bankers as the source and agents of much power and trouble in the highly capitalized modern world. Death Yurick died of complications from lung cancer on January 5, 2013. His death occurred 13 days before his 88th birthday.

It chronicles the life and death of grizzly bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell. The film includes some of Treadwell's own footage of his interactions with grizzly bears before 2003, and of interviews with people who knew, or were involved with Treadwell, as well as professionals dealing with wild bears. Treadwell and his then girlfriend Amie Huguenard, who were both originally from New York state, lost their lives to a grizzly bear on October 6, 2003. Treadwell's footage was found after his death. The bear that killed Treadwell and Huguenard was later encountered and killed by the group retrieving the partially consumed remains of the victims. An audio recording of the attack was captured by Treadwell's camera, but has never been released. The final film was co-produced by Discovery Docs, the Discovery Channel's theatrical documentary unit, and Lions Gate Entertainment. The film's soundtrack is by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. Synopsis Herzog used sequences extracted from more than 100 hours of video footage shot by Treadwell during the last five years of his life. He also conducted and filmed interviews with Treadwell's family and friends, and bear and nature experts. Park rangers and bear experts commented on statements and actions by Treadwell, such as his repeated claims that he was defending the bears from poachers. Park rangers noted that there had never been a recorded incident of poaching at this national park. As another example, Treadwell claimed he had \\"gained the trust\\" of certain bears, sufficient to approach and pet them. Park rangers pointed out that bears are wild and potentially dangerous animals; given that, Treadwell was lucky to have survived as long as he had without being mauled. One park ranger suggested that the bears were so confused by Treadwell's direct, casual contact that they were not sure how to react to him. Other park rangers point out that the bears were not threatened by poachers, but Treadwell's actions put them at real risk of harm and death. By familiarizing them with human contact, he increased the likelihood that they would approach human habitation seeking food, and cause a confrontation in which humans would kill them. In 2003, Treadwell was camping in Katmai National Park with his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. Treadwell usually left the park at the end of summer but that year stayed into early October. This put him and Huguenard at greater risk, as in this period, bears are aggressive about searching for food to store up calories for hibernation during the winter. Herzog speculates that their staying later in the season ultimately resulted in the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard. In addition to presenting views from friends and professionals, Herzog narrates and offers his own interpretations of events. He concluded that Treadwell had a sentimental view of nature, thinking he could tame the wild bears. Herzog notes that nature is cold and harsh. Treadwell's view clouded his thinking and led him to underestimate danger, resulting in his death and that of Huguenard. Treadwell's video camera captured an audio record of the bear attack. Herzog refrained from making this a part of the film, but he is shown listening to it, clearly disturbed. The director advised Jewel Palovak (the owner of the tape) to destroy it rather than listen to it. He later repudiated his own advice, saying it was > Stupid ... silly advice born out of the immediate shock of hearing‚ÄîI mean, > it's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard in my life. Being shocked > like that, I told her, 'You should never listen to it, and you should rather > destroy it. It should not be sitting on your shelf in your living room all > the time.' [But] she slept over it and decided to do something much wiser. > She did not destroy it but separated herself from the tape, and she put it > in a bank vault. The coroner gave Palovak Treadwell's wristwatch, which had been retrieved from his left arm, one of the few remains found. Willy Fulton, the pilot who discovered the remains of Treadwell and Huguenard, had noted seeing the lone arm with the wristwatch and not being able to keep the image out of his mind. Production Treadwell spent thirteen summers in Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska. Over time, he believed the bears grew to trust him; they allowed him to approach them and he had even touched them. He gained some national notoriety for his work with the bears and founded Grizzly People with his friend Jewel Palovak. They worked to protect bears in national parks by raising awareness. Park officials repeatedly warned him that his interaction with the bears was unsafe to both him and to the bears. \\"At best, he's misguided,\\" Deb Liggett, superintendent at Katmai and Lake Clark national parks, told the Anchorage Daily News in 2001. \\"At worst, he's dangerous. If Timothy models unsafe behavior, that ultimately puts bears and other visitors at risk.\\" Treadwell filmed his exploits, and used the films to raise public awareness of the problems faced by bears in North America. In 2003, at the end of his thirteenth visit, he and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were attacked, killed, and partially eaten by a bear. The events that led to the attack are unknown. Jewel Palovak, co-founder of Grizzly People and a close friend of Treadwell's, had to give her approval for the film to be produced, as she controlled his video archives. The filmmakers had to deal with logistical as well as sentimental factors related to Treadwell's footage of his bear interactions. Grizzly People is a \\"grassroots organization\\" concerned with the treatment of bears in the United States. After her friend's death, Palovak was left with control of Grizzly People and Treadwell's 100 hours of archival footage. As his close friend, former girlfriend, and confidante, she had a large emotional stake in the production. She had known Treadwell since 1985 and felt a deep sense of responsibility to her late friend and his legacy. Palovak said that Treadwell had often discussed his video archives with her. \\"Timothy was very dramatic,\\" she once said. She quoted Treadwell as saying, \\"'If I die, if something happens to me, make that movie. You make it. You show 'em.' I thought that Werner Herzog could definitely do that.\\" Exhibition Grizzly Man premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and its limited US theatrical release began on August 12, 2005. It was later released on DVD in the United States on December 26, 2005. The Discovery Channel aired Grizzly Man on television on February 3, 2006; its three-hour presentation of the film included a 30-minute companion special that delved deeper into Treadwell's relationship with the bears and addressed controversies related to the film. The DVD release lacks an interview with Treadwell by David Letterman, which was shown in the original theatrical release. Letterman had joked that Treadwell would be eaten by a bear. The versions televised on the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet both retain this scene. Response =Box office= Grizzly Man opened on August 12, 2005 in 29 North America venues. It grossed US$269,131 ($9,280 per screen) in its opening weekend, ranking number 26 in the box office. At its widest point, it played at 105 theatres, and made US$3,178,403 in North America during its run, with $882,902 overseas for a worldwide total of $4,061,305. =Critical reception= Upon its North American theatrical release, Grizzly Man was acclaimed by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 92% \\"Certified Fresh\\" score based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Whatever opinion you come to have of the obsessive Treadwell, Herzog has once again found a fascinating subject.\\" Metacritic reports an 87 out of 100 rating based on 35 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". David Denby of The New Yorker said: > Narrating in his extraordinary German-accented English, Herzog is fair- > minded and properly respectful of Treadwell's manic self-invention. He even > praises Treadwell as a good filmmaker: as Treadwell stands talking in the > foreground of the frame, the bears play behind him or scoop up salmon in > sparkling water; in other shots, a couple of foxes leap across the grass in > the middle of a Treadwell monologue. The footage is full of stunning > incidental beauties. Film critic Roger Ebert, a longtime supporter of Herzog's work, awarded the film four out of four stars. > 'I will protect these bears with my last breath', Treadwell says. After he > and Amie become the first and only people to be killed by bears in the park, > the bear that is guilty is shot dead. Treadwell's watch, still ticking, is > found on his severed arm. I have a certain admiration for his courage, > recklessness, idealism, whatever you want to call it, but here is a man who > managed to get himself and his girlfriend eaten, and you know what? He > deserves Werner Herzog. Charlie Russell, a naturalist who studied bears for many years, lived near them and raised them for a decade in Kamchatka, corresponded with Treadwell and wrote about the film:Russell, Charlie (February 21, 2006).

They are electrically nonconductive, meaning that they are insulators, and ferrimagnetic, meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrites can be divided into two families based on their resistance to being demagnetized (magnetic coercivity). Hard ferrites have high coercivity, so are difficult to demagnetize. They are used to make permanent magnets for applications such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers, and small electric motors. Soft ferrites have low coercivity, so they easily change their magnetization and act as conductors of magnetic fields. They are used in the electronics industry to make efficient magnetic cores called ferrite cores for high-frequency inductors, transformers and antennas, and in various microwave components. Ferrite compounds are extremely low cost, being made of mostly rusted iron (iron oxide), and have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and can be made with both high and low coercive forces. Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei of the Tokyo Institute of Technology synthesized the first ferrite compounds in 1930. Composition, structure, and properties Ferrites are usually ferrimagnetic ceramic compounds derived from iron oxides. Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a famous example. Like most of the other ceramics, ferrites are hard, brittle, and poor conductors of electricity. Many ferrites adopt the spinel structure with the formula AB2O4, where A and B represent various metal cations, usually including iron (Fe). Spinel ferrites usually adopt a crystal motif consisting of cubic close-packed (fcc) oxides (O2‚àí) with A cations occupying one eighth of the tetrahedral holes and B cations occupying half of the octahedral holes, i.e., . Ferrite crystals do not adopt the ordinary spinel structure, but rather the inverse spinel structure: One eighth of the tetrahedral holes are occupied by B cations, one fourth of the octahedral sites are occupied by A cations. and the other one fourth by B cation. It is also possible to have mixed structure spinel ferrites with formula [M2+1‚àíŒ¥Fe3+Œ¥][M2+Œ¥Fe3+2‚àíŒ¥]O4 where Œ¥ is the degree of inversion. The magnetic material known as \\"ZnFe\\" has the formula ZnFe2O4, with Fe3+ occupying the octahedral sites and Zn2+ occupy the tetrahedral sites, it is an example of normal structure spinel ferrite. Some ferrites adopt hexagonal crystal structure, like barium and strontium ferrites BaFe12O19 (BaO:6Fe2O3) and SrFe12O19 (SrO:6Fe2O3). In terms of their magnetic properties, the different ferrites are often classified as \\"soft\\", \\"semi-hard\\" or \\"hard\\", which refers to their low or high magnetic coercivity, as follows. =Soft ferrites= Various ferrite cores used to make small transformers and inductors Ferrites that are used in transformer or electromagnetic cores contain nickel, zinc, and/or manganese compounds. They have a low coercivity and are called soft ferrites. The low coercivity means the material's magnetization can easily reverse direction without dissipating much energy (hysteresis losses), while the material's high resistivity prevents eddy currents in the core, another source of energy loss. Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of RF transformers and inductors in applications such as switched-mode power supplies and loopstick antennas used in AM radios. The most common soft ferrites are: * Manganese-zinc ferrite (MnZn, with the formula ). MnZn have higher permeability and saturation induction than NiZn. * Nickel-zinc ferrite (NiZn, with the formula ). NiZn ferrites exhibit higher resistivity than MnZn, and are therefore more suitable for frequencies above 1 MHz. For applications below 5 MHz, MnZn ferrites are used; above that, NiZn is the usual choice. The exception is with common mode inductors, where the threshold of choice is at 70 MHz. =Semi-hard ferrites= * Cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4 (CoO¬∑Fe2O3), is in between soft and hard magnetic material and is usually classified as a semi-hard material. It is mainly used for its magnetostrictive applications like sensors and actuators thanks to its high saturation magnetostriction (~200 ppm). CoFe2O4 has also the benefits to be rare-earth free, which makes it a good substitute for Terfenol-D. Moreover, its magnetostrictive properties can be tuned by inducing a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy. This can be done by magnetic annealing, magnetic field assisted compaction, or reaction under uniaxial pressure. This last solution has the advantage to be ultra fast (20 min) thanks to the use of spark plasma sintering. The induced magnetic anisotropy in cobalt ferrite is also beneficial to enhance the magnetoelectric effect in composite. =Hard ferrites= In contrast, permanent ferrite magnets are made of hard ferrites, which have a high coercivity and high remanence after magnetization. Iron oxide and barium or strontium carbonate are used in manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets. The high coercivity means the materials are very resistant to becoming demagnetized, an essential characteristic for a permanent magnet. They also have high magnetic permeability. These so-called ceramic magnets are cheap, and are widely used in household products such as refrigerator magnets. The maximum magnetic field B is about 0.35 tesla and the magnetic field strength H is about 30 to 160 kiloampere turns per meter (400 to 2000 oersteds). The density of ferrite magnets is about 5 g/cm3. The most common hard ferrites are: * Strontium ferrite, SrFe12O19 (SrO¬∑6Fe2O3), used in small electric motors, micro-wave devices, recording media, magneto-optic media, telecommunication and electronic industry. Strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) is well known for its high coercivity due to its magnetocrystalline anisotropy. It has been widely used in industrial applications as permanent magnets and, because they can be powdered and formed easily, they are finding their applications into micro and nano-types systems such as biomarkers, bio diagnostics and biosensors. * Barium ferrite, BaFe12O19 (BaO¬∑6Fe2O3), a common material for permanent magnet applications. Barium ferrites are robust ceramics that are generally stable to moisture and corrosion-resistant. They are used in e.g. loudspeaker magnets and as a medium for magnetic recording, e.g. on magnetic stripe cards. Production Ferrites are produced by heating a mixture of the oxides of the constituent metals at high temperatures, as shown in this idealized equation: :Fe2O3 \\\\+ ZnO ‚Üí ZnFe2O4 In some cases, the mixture of finely-powdered precursors is pressed into a mold. For barium and strontium ferrites, these metals are typically supplied as their carbonates, BaCO3 or SrCO3. During the heating process, these carbonates undergo calcination: :MCO3 ‚Üí MO + CO2 After this step, the two oxides combine to give the ferrite. The resulting mixture of oxides undergoes sintering. =Processing= Having obtained the ferrite, the cooled product is milled to particles smaller than 2 ¬µm, sufficiently small that each particle consists of a single magnetic domain. Next the powder is pressed into a shape, dried, and re-sintered. The shaping may be performed in an external magnetic field, in order to achieve a preferred orientation of the particles (anisotropy). Small and geometrically easy shapes may be produced with dry pressing. However, in such a process small particles may agglomerate and lead to poorer magnetic properties compared to the wet pressing process. Direct calcination and sintering without re-milling is possible as well but leads to poor magnetic properties. Electromagnets are pre-sintered as well (pre-reaction), milled and pressed. However, the sintering takes place in a specific atmosphere, for instance one with an oxygen shortage. The chemical composition and especially the structure vary strongly between the precursor and the sintered product. To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder separator sheets. These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are also available in fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading. Uses Ferrite cores are used in electronic inductors, transformers, and electromagnets where the high electrical resistance of the ferrite leads to very low eddy current losses. They are commonly seen as a lump in a computer cable, called a ferrite bead, which helps to prevent high frequency electrical noise (radio frequency interference) from exiting or entering the equipment. Early computer memories stored data in the residual magnetic fields of hard ferrite cores, which were assembled into arrays of core memory. Ferrite powders are used in the coatings of magnetic recording tapes. Ferrite particles are also used as a component of radar-absorbing materials or coatings used in stealth aircraft and in the absorption tiles lining the rooms used for electromagnetic compatibility measurements. Most common audio magnets, including those used in loudspeakers and electromagnetic instrument pickups, are ferrite magnets. Except for certain \\"vintage\\" products, ferrite magnets have largely displaced the more expensive Alnico magnets in these applications. In particular, for hard hexaferrites today the most common uses are still as permanent magnets in refrigerator seal gaskets, microphones and loud speakers, small motors for cordless appliances and in automobile applications. Ferrite nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetic properties. History Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei of the Tokyo Institute of Technology synthesized the first ferrite compounds in 1930. This led to the founding of TDK Corporation in 1935, to manufacture the material. Barium hexaferrite (BaO‚Ä¢6Fe2O3) was discovered in 1950 at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (Philips Physics Laboratory). The discovery was somewhat accidental‚Äîdue to a mistake by an assistant who was supposed to be preparing a sample of hexagonal lanthanum ferrite for a team investigating its use as a semiconductor material. On discovering that it was actually a magnetic material, and confirming its structure by X-ray crystallography, they passed it on to the magnetic research group.Marc de Vries, 80 Years of Research at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (1914-1994), p. 95, Amsterdam University Press, 2005 . Barium hexaferrite has both high coercivity (170 kA/m) and low raw material costs. It was developed as a product by Philips Industries (Netherlands) and from 1952 was marketed under the trade name Ferroxdure.Raul Valenzuela, Magnetic Ceramics, p. 76, Cambridge University Press, 2005 . The low price and good performance led to a rapid increase in the use of permanent magnets.R. Gerber, C.D. Wright, G. Asti, Applied Magnetism, p. 335, Springer, 2013 In the 1960s Philips developed strontium hexaferrite (SrO‚Ä¢6Fe2O3), with better properties than barium hexaferrite. Barium and strontium hexaferrite dominate the market due to their low costs. Other materials have been found with improved properties. BaO‚Ä¢2(FeO)‚Ä¢8(Fe2O3) came in 1980. and Ba2ZnFe18O23 came in 1991.Raul Valenzuela, Magnetic Ceramics, p. 76-77, Cambridge University Press, 2005 .

She is a built by Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton to serve as a fishery protection unit within the United Kingdom's waters along with her two sister ships and . All three were commissioned into service in 2003 to replace the five older s. Tyne was featured in the first episode of the BBC series Empire of the Seas, \\"How the Navy Forged the Modern World, Heart of Oak\\", presented by Dan Snow. Construction The first of her class, Tyne was built by Vosper Thornycroft at its Woolston, Southampton shipyard in 2001. Following construction, she was launched on 1 July 2002 with an expected handover to the Royal Navy's Fishery Protection Squadron by November. By January 2003, she had completed the first stage of her sea trials in the Solent. Tyne and her sister ships Severn and Mersey were the first ever privately-funded vessels received by the Royal Navy on charter. They were chartered for five years, after which the Ministry of Defence could either purchase them outright or return them to VT. Operational history Tyne made her first operational fishery protection patrol between January and February 2003. In January 2004, having been on fishery protection duties, she helped coordinate a search and rescue following the capsizing of French fishing trawler Bugaled Breizh off the coast of Cornwall. In September 2012, the Royal Navy purchased Tyne and her sister ships Severn and Mersey, having previously operated them on lease. They had a remaining service life of 11 years. Aside from her day-to-day fishery protection duties, Tyne has occasionally been called upon to undertake escort roles in the UK Area of Interest. Two such examples occurred in the autumn of 2016 when she was twice assigned to escort Russian warships through the English Channel. In March 2017, it was announced that Tyne would be manned by personnel usually assigned to s to allow her crew to transfer to the Batch 2 River-class in build in Glasgow. =Decommissioning and reactivation= In March 2018, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Guto Bebb revealed that ¬£12.7M had been allocated from the EU Exit Preparedness Fund to preserve Tyne and her two Batch 1 sister ships, should they be required to control and enforce UK waters and fisheries following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. In May 2018, the ship entered Portsmouth ahead of her pre- planned decommissioning, which was to take place on 24 May 2018. However, by July 2018, the ship was reportedly still flying the white ensign and therefore still in active service. The Royal Navy subsequently clarified that a formal decommissioning ceremony had not taken place, confirming the ship was still commissioned, due to delays in the delivery of the ship's planned successor, HMS Forth. On 22 November 2018, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson further clarified that Tyne and her two Batch 1 sister ships would be retained in service and forward-operated from their affiliated rivers. =Post- reactivation= Tyne off the coast of Norfolk, England in May 2020. Despite plans to station Tyne on her affiliated river, the ship remained base ported in Portsmouth as of February 2020. Between 1 January 2014 and 30 September 2019, she had spent a total of 1,081 days at sea. In December, she was tasked with shadowing Russian Navy Smolnyy-class training ship Perekop through the English Channel.

He was a favourite of Henry III, duke of Brabant, and he remained at court for some time after the death of his patron in 1261. Biography Adenet Le Roi (literally, 'Little Adam the King\\") was born in Brabant around 1240 and owed his education to the kindness of Henry III, duke of Brabant. In 1269 he entered the service of Guy de Dampierre, afterwards count of Flanders, probably as roi des m√©nestrels, and followed him in the next year on the abortive crusade in Tunis in which Louis IX lost his life. The expedition returned by way of Sicily and Italy, and Adenet has left in his poems some very exact descriptions of the places through which he passed. The purity of his French and the absence of provincialisms point to a long residence in France, and it has been suggested that Adenet may have followed Mary of Brabant there on her marriage with Philip III of France. He seems, however, to have remained in the service of Count Guy, although he made frequent visits to Paris to consult the annals preserved in the Abbey of St. Denis. Adenet probably died before the end of the 13th century.A document attests a gift to him in 1297 of a golden buckle from King Edward I, and that is the last information available about Adenet.Henry 1951, p. 47. Works There are four extant poems written by Adenet. # Enfances Ogier narrates the exploits of Ogier the Dane fighting the Saracens in Italy, and was an enfeebled version of the Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche written earlier by Raimbert de Paris. # Berte aus grans pi√©s tells the history of Bertha of the Big Foot the mother of Charlemagne, founded on well-known traditions which are also preserved in the anonymous Chronique de France, and in the Chronique rim√©e of Philippe Mousket. # Bueves de Comarchis belongs to the cycle of romance gathered round the history of Aimeri de Narbonne. # roman d'aventures, Cl√©omad√®s, is long and borrows from Spanish and Moorish traditions brought into France by Blanche, daughter of Louis IX, who after the death of her Spanish husband returned to the French court.

The series, about a group of rich friends who live in Beverly Hills, has ten books, with the first eponymous novel being released under the Little, Brown imprint Poppy. A spin-off series with new characters titled The A-List: Hollywood Royalty was released in January 2009.

Anna moves there to reinvent herself and to break free from her preppy Upper East Side life. She often refers to the 'This is How We Do Things Big Book, East Coast WASP Edition', not a real book, but a set of 'rules' that Anna grew up with (e.g. always answer that you're fine). Anna meets Ben Birnbaum on the airplane and instantly falls in love with him. The other main characters are Samantha 'Sam' Sharpe, Camilla 'Cammie' Sheppard, and Delia 'Dee' Young. Other relevant characters include, but are not limited to, Parker Pinnelli, Adam Flood, Susan Percy, Ben Birnbaum, Eduardo Mu√±oz, Jackson Sharpe, Poppy Sinclair, and Clark Sheppard.  Character descriptions  Anna Percy - Originally from the Upper East Side in Manhattan, she moves to Los Angeles with her father to finish her senior year and then apply for an internship while hoping to change her boring life. She is serious and intelligent, and frequently refers to the imaginary \\"This Is How We Do Things Big Book, East Coast WASP Edition\\" - a set of rules she grew up with in her patrician family. Her parents, Jane Cabot and Jonathan Percy are divorced and she has a somewhat strained relationship with her father that slowly begins to improve. She is a leggy, blonde, patrician beauty, who is often compared to Grace Kelly. She is often referred to as a \\"tight-ass\\" by other characters because of her tendency to play things safe and not take risks. Anna is usually very careful with her trust, but knows her way around people. Before moving to L.A., Anna planned to major in English at Yale but quickly found herself to have a talent for screenwriting. Anna is not particularly overwhelmed or impressed by the L.A. lifestyle, nor by the celebrities the characters encounter or talk about throughout the series. She and Sam become fast friends at Beverly Hills High although Anna intensely dislikes Sam's other friends, Dee Young and Cammie Sheppard. En route to L.A. in the first book, Anna meets the charming Ben Birnbaum on the plane and he invites her to be his date at Jackson Sharpe's wedding. Anna is enthralled by Ben and almost loses her virginity to him but Anna quickly believes Ben is only a player after he inexplicably abandons her after she told him she wanted to take things slow. Anna is still reluctant to trust Ben, especially when she finds about his romantic past, but she eventually forgives him after he explains the misunderstandings between them. Ben and Anna are often on and off throughout the series as Anna tries to decide what she really wants from her life. Samantha 'Sam' Sharpe - Daughter of Jackson Sharpe, aka \\"America's Most Beloved Action Star\\", she is often nicknamed \\"Sam\\" or \\"Sammy\\". A witty and clever brunette, Sam has many insecurities about her size 10 figure, which is not helped by the fact that all her friends are much tinier than her. Even though Sam's friends try to assure her she is beautiful, Sam never quite really believes it until she meets Eduardo Mu√±oz, who loves her just as she is. Sam's home life is strained as she craves attention from her ever-absent father and clashes with Poppy Sinclair, her new stepmother who is pregnant with Jackson's baby and only four years older than her. Even though Cammie and Dee are her best friends, Sam does not completely trust them and welcomes Anna to their group because she admires Anna's sophistication, poise, and down-to- earth attitude even though Sam originally had a crush on Ben. She eventually moves on from him and often helps reconcile Ben and Anna throughout the series. She and Anna become friends after doing a short film together for a school assignment, which led to Sam encouraging Anna to pursue screenwriting. Sam is interested in becoming a filmmaker in her own right and pulls the \\"Jackson Sharpe's daughter\\" card to entice people into being her films. Towards the end of the series, Sam is on the lookout for the script to make her feature directing debut with but decides to team up with Anna to make a film loosely based on their senior year instead. Camilla 'Cammie' Sheppard - Daughter of Clark Sheppard, Los Angeles' uber agent in the film industry, Camilla is always called Cammie. She is described as the most beautiful girl but also the bitchiest with her size 2 figure with impossibly long legs, long strawberry blond curls, bee stung lips, wide set honey colored eyes, perky 34D breasts, and a personality to match. Cammie has very little scruples and goes after what she wants, no matter the consequences. Cammie is Ben's ex- girlfriend and she was hoping to win him back at Jackson Sharpe's wedding and ended up tearing Anna's dress in a fit of jealousy instead. Cammie claims she got her ruthless attitude from her father but it may be a front to protect herself from getting hurt. Cammie's mother died in a freak boating accident and since then, Cammie made a rule to never wake up away from home lest her father die too. Cammie wishes to be loved as like Sam, her father is rarely home and she clashes with her stepmother Patrice, who makes it no secret that she hates Cammie too. Clark claims that Cammie has no ambition but Cammie surprises everyone when she takes a young model Champagne under her wing and helps Ben open up his own successful night club. Cammie tries to pursue Ben throughout the series but she falls in love with Adam Flood to her surprise. With Adam, Cammie lets her walls come down and slowly transforms into a slightly more kinder person. She and Anna detest each other but slowly reach peace when they serve community service together although Cammie tells Anna that if she and Ben break up, Cammie will be waiting. Delia 'Dee' Young - Daughter of a famous music producer Graham Young, she goes by Dee and is described as flaxen haired with big blue eyes and five feet tall with a size zero figure. Dee is very spiritual and is often into the next New Age fad, which often causes her friends to roll their eyes at her. Dee was once in love with Ben and slept with him when they were both drunk on her college tour with Princeton. Afterwards, Dee claimed to be pregnant with Ben's baby but is quickly found out to not be true. Dee loves to make other people happy and often reaches out to others but often weirds out other characters with her strange ways. Eventually, it is discovered that Dee is hearing voices and she goes to seek treatment at Ojai Mental Health Institute. Once released, Dee is much more clearheaded although her personality is mostly the same. Ben Birnbaum - Son of Dr. Dan Birnbaum, Hollywood's plastic surgeon to the stars, Ben is an attractive student who studies at Princeton and meets Anna on the plane to L.A. on his way to Jackson Sharpe's wedding. He invites her to be his date, not knowing that his three female friends (Cammie, Sam, and Dee) are all secretly in love with him and hoping to win him over. Anna originally believe Ben to be a player after he ditches her on his father's boat in the middle of the night after she refused to have sex with him, but he explains the reason for his absence: his father has an intense gambling problem and he was ready to commit suicide because he had too many debts. Anna eventually forgives him and when they first start their relationship, Ben is too controlling and jealous, which causes Anna to break up with him. When he returns to Princeton, they agree to go on a break but eventually get back together at the end of the series. Ben eventually decides to drop out of school to pursue nightclub management and is annoyed when he believes Anna isn't supportive which causes him to end up in Cammie's arms. However, Cammie is surprised that she cares as much about the club as she does about Ben. Adam Flood - Moved to LA with his parents from Michigan, Adam is an all-around nice guy with morals, unlike most people in LA. He has dark hair and blue star tattoo behind his left ear, which he scratches when he's nervous. He had a crush on Anna, and they briefly dated, but was broken-hearted when she dumped him to get back together with Ben. He begins dating Cammie, and eventually loses his virginity to her.

Crash Railmen Spoke Different Languages, BBC World News -Europe website, 30 March 2001. Retrieved 4 November 2010.BBC World News. Belgian Crash 'Was Avoidable', BBC World News -Europe website, 28 March 2001. . Retrieved 4 November 2010. The crash left 8 dead and 12 injured and was Belgium's worst rail disaster in a quarter of a century.  Timeline of events  * 08:41 ‚Äî In Wavre station, a signalman noticed an empty passenger train departing from Track No. 4 against a red signal, towards Leuven. * 08:42 ‚Äî The Wavre signalman contacted the Leuven signalman, to inform him about the train. However, the Wavre signalman spoke only French while the Leuven signalman spoke only Dutch, so the latter did not understand the message fully. * 08:43 ‚Äî The Wavre signalman tried to have the overhead wire current cut off on the erroneously departed train's track. Whenever the power on the overhead wire is cut for more than 20 seconds, the train driver is required by operational rules to recognise this as an emergency situation and start a procedure to bring his train to a halt as soon as possible. However, that could not be done from Wavre. The signalman had to contact the Electrical Current Controller in Brussels about the problem. * 08:46 ‚Äî The Brussels controller tried to contact the driver of the train, but was unable to reach him. The Brussels controller also tried to contact the driver of a passenger train that had just departed from Leuven towards Wavre, traveling on the same track as the other train, in the opposite direction. Again, the controller failed to reach the driver. The area where the accident happened is quite remote, with heavy vegetation and terrain further impacting train radio reception. * 08:47 ‚Äî The overhead wire current was cut off, which is a last resort measure to have all impacted train drivers stop their trains as per the operational rules, but unfortunately too late. * 08:50 ‚Äî The two trains collided head-on in the village of P√©crot. 8 people were killed, including both drivers, and 12 were injured.  Causes  The accident had two main causes. The first was the inexperience of the driver of the train which departed from Wavre. The train had stopped with the driver's cab past the signal, so the driver could not see that the signal was red when he departed. The other cause was the language barrier between the signalmen at the Wavre and Leuven cabins. Both French and Dutch are official languages in Belgium, and rail staff were only required to speak one. NMBS/SNCB, the Belgian national railway company, admitted that the accident was caused solely by human error. Judge Philippe Ridelle presided the trial and pronounced the sentence.

The mall is at the intersection of Loop 12 (Northwest Highway) and US 75 (North Central Expressway). Originally opened in 1965, the center now has over 235 stores and restaurants and annual sales of over $1 Billion. According to esri.com, Northpark Center is the 19th largest shopping mall in the country. Its anchors include Nordstrom, Macy's (formerly Foley's), Dillard's, Neiman Marcus, AMC Theatres, Eataly, Maggiano's, and Arhaus. History In the early 1960s, developer Raymond Nasher leased a cotton field on the edge of Dallas and hired E.G Hamilton of Harrell+Hamilton Architects. NorthPark Center opened in 1965, as then the largest climate-controlled retail establishment in the world, and is now owned, managed, operated and leased by husband and wife David J. Haemisegger and Nancy A. Nasher (Raymond's daughter). For its first 34 years, NorthPark stood on land leased from the Caruth family's foundation. David and Nancy Nasher purchased the property in 1999. In 2006, NorthPark opened to an expansion that more than doubled the size of the existing center, adding an 88,000 sq ft Barneys New York store as a new anchor. (Barneys was one of the Center's few failures in recent history; it closed in 2012.) For its expansion, NorthPark brought back the same architecture firm that designed the original section to ensure its aesthetic was respected and enhanced. The expansion also included a new collection of specialty retail shops and a third-floor 15-screen AMC theater. The two-story expansion provided for circulation around the Center by forming a continuous loop through the complex. The mall is anchored by Macy's, Dillard's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and AMC. The American Film Institute's Dallas International Film Festival was sponsored by NorthPark Center in 2009. The event was held in the AMC NorthPark 15 Theater, which also hosted screenings during the festival's first two years. Best known as an art museum inside a shopping center, in November 2007, NorthPark Center was named as one of the \\"seven retail wonders of the modern world\\" along with Neiman Marcus‚Äô store at Natick Collection in Massachusetts, Japan's Mikimoto store in Ginza, England's Bullring shopping center, Poland's Z≈Çote Tarasy in Warsaw, Apple's flagship store in New York City and Italy's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II . NorthPark is the home of Texas' first H&M;, a fashion label from Sweden. H&M; has since opened other locations in Texas. Northpark Mall welcomes international visitors with currency exchange at Travelex and tax free shopping with Texas sales tax refunds at TaxFree Shopping Ltd. Art in the mall Five Hammering Men by Jonathan Borofsky NorthPark Center was designed to include art as integral part of its interior landscape. NorthPark received the American Institute of Architects Award for \\"Design of the Decade - 1960s\\" as one of the first commercial centers in the United States to create space for the display of fine art. Architecture Nordstrom Dillard's NorthPark Center was designed by Omniplan in the early 1960s. For its recent expansion, NorthPark's owners returned to the architectural firm responsible for the 1960s design. The expansion turned NorthPark's original U-shape into a square design surrounding a landscaped garden known as \\"CenterPark.\\" Featuring a series of lawns, 41-year-old live oaks and red oaks, seasonal flowers, crushed granite walkways, and a small collection of art, CenterPark doubles as a park area for visitors and customers. NorthPark Center received both the Texas Society of Architects' annual Design Award and the 25-year Design Award in 2007 for the original design. After a major expansion, at , it is now the second-largest mall in Texas and the 21st-largest in the U.S. based on total square feet of retail space (gross leasable area) according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Public library NorthPark Center hosts Bookmarks, a Dallas Public Library for children 12 years and younger. Bookmarks is the first children's library in the United States to be in a shopping center. Location The Center is at the intersection of the Central Expressway and Loop 12/Northwest Highway, located to the east and south of the center respectively. NorthPark is also across the freeway from The Shops at Park Lane, a mixed-use development with which includes shopping. NorthPark Center is the most popular shopping center in North Texas, with over 27 million visitors a year. Television and film location NorthPark's interior has been a location for scenes in television and film productions. Dr. T and the Women, the Robert Altman film, has a scene where the character Kate (Farrah Fawcett) visits stores in the area of the Neiman Marcus court, then is seen around the Dillard's court fountain‚Äîwhich she eventually finds herself in, frolicking and splashing in the buff. True Stories, a 1986 movie co-starring David Byrne, with one scene of a fashion show held at a mall in Virgil, Texas (the movie's fictional setting) during a town celebration; the interior portion of the scene was filmed in a mid-court area between Neiman Marcus and Dillard's. Byrne and co-star John Goodman were also filmed walking down one of the mall's corridors. When the mall reopened in 2006, The Dallas Observer used the mall's ambiance as documented in the film as a source of comparison. \\"The place looks like a tricked-out spaceship compared to the stark, cold NorthPark in which True Stories was filmed exactly 20 years ago. It looks like the old NorthPark‚Äîdamned if you can tell difference between the old bricks and the new ones; this thing looks like it was built in a time machine‚Äîyet it's brighter too, a friendlier version of the same ol' place.\\" The exterior of Virgil's mall wasn't of NorthPark‚Äîthe producers used the outside of the former Big Town Mall in nearby Mesquite.

She is a bassist, pianist, and programmer. History Robin Moulder grew up with one sister Helen Moulder and two brothers Dave and Al Moulder. Moulder began studying music on trumpet and piano and initially didn't envision a musical career for herself. She received a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Her first job out of college took her to Florida. She began playing keyboard for a live band, and moved to bass to fill the void left by a departing bandmate. She quickly discovered an aptitude for the instrument, and began looking for other people who shared her outlook on music. She found them in Tenni Ah-Cha-Cha, Jessicka Fodera, and Michelle Inhell, and the four of them created Jack Off Jill. =Jack Off Jill= Moulder was with Jack Off Jill from its inception to its demise, having written or co-written most of the music for the band over its lifetime. She and Jessicka were the only two permanent members, watching over a revolving door of musicians throughout the band's history, including Scott Putesky, aka Daisy Berkowitz, the original guitarist from Marilyn Manson, and Chris Vrenna of Tweaker, formerly of Nine Inch Nails. Fodera and Moulder finally called it quits in 2000, with Moulder not involved in the 2015 reunion of Jack Off Jill, possibly over some feud between the two musicians which remains unclear. =TCR= After the breakup Moulder struck up a friendship with TC, formerly of the band Triggerpimp, and the two women agreed to collaborate on a project together, which would later be called TCR. When Moulder moved to Detroit to serve as the Chief Technology Officer for a startup company, she and TC stayed in contact and began crafting their release via phone, FedEx, and FTP along with guest musicians such as Chris Vrenna, Scott Putesky, and method from Godhead. Released in 2004, The Chrome Recordings was called the \\"best goth/industrial/whatever releases of the year\\" by some reviewers. TCR's music is self described as \\"A fusion of from metal, industrial, rock, and goth, with a dose of punk aggression\\". The Chrome Recordings was their only album. =Personal life= Moulder is married to game designer Colin McComb. They have two children. He moved to Detroit with her after she got offered a job, shortly after they met. Together with her husband, they have created 3Lbs, a company specialized in game design and development.

In addition to selling raw and smoked seafood, the company also sells a wide variety of meals and products prepared from seafood such as Fischbr√∂tchen (fish sandwiches), salads, and canned seafood. The company formerly supplied its own seafood but has since sold the fishery. History Nordsee restaurant in Makariou Avenue, Nicosia, Cyprus Nordsee was founded in 1896 as \\"German steam-fishery company Nordsee\\" () to supply seafood from the North Sea to the residents of Bremen. In 1964 the company opened restaurant type retail shops offering meals prepared from seafood in addition to raw seafood. This concept, known as Nordsee Quick, was a huge success as nearly 300 shops opened within 2 years. In 1998, the company sold the fishery division known as Deutsche See to allow for more focus towards seafood retailing. The new focus was demonstrated with the introduction of locations serving smaller, quicker takeout meals in the following year. In 2005 the company was sold to Kamps Food Retail Investments and Nomura International. The company underwent restructuring and experienced a growth in profits five times greater than expected in the first year. In response to a new emerging market, the company introduced sushi and a number of other higher quality food products the following year and has begun to move into other sectors of the food industry with success. In October 2018, Nordsee was sold to Swiss investment fund Kharis Capital. Operations Nordsee restaurants are usually located in populated areas such as city centers or near airports and train stations. The company focuses primarily on Germany and Austria but operates additional locations in the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Switzerland, Hungary, and more recently, Cyprus, Dubai, Egypt, Bulgaria, Turkey and Russia. The company also operates in Brussels, Belgium under the name ‚ÄúHappy Fish‚Äù. In 2016, Nordsee achieved a revenue of over 350 million euros. As of 2020, there are 370 Nordsee franchises operating in Europe and the Middle East.

Primary technologies used for capacity optimization are data deduplication and data compression. These are delivered as software or hardware, integrated with storage systems or delivered as standalone products. Deduplication algorithms look for redundancy in sequences of bytes across comparison windows. Typically using cryptographic hash functions as identifiers of unique sequences, sequences are compared to the history of other such sequences, and where possible, the first uniquely stored version of a sequence is referenced rather than stored again. Different methods for selecting data windows include 4KB blocks to full-file comparisons known as single-instance storage (SIS). Capacity optimization generally refers to the use of this kind of technology in a storage system. An example of this kind of system is the Venti file system Venti filesystem in the Plan9 open source OS. There are also implementations in networking (especially wide-area networking), where they are sometimes called bandwidth optimization or WAN optimization. F. Foukalas et. al, Capacity optimization through sensing threshold adaptation for cognitive radio networks Commercial implementations of capacity optimization are most often found in backup/recovery storage, where storage of iterating versions of backups day to day creates an opportunity for reduction in space using this approach. The term was first used widely in 2005. \\"Capacity optimization\\" defined by searchstorage.com  References  Capacity optimization through sensing threshold adaptation for cognitive radio networks (https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11590-011-0345-8) Category:Software optimization ","title":"Capacity optimization"},{"id":"2380982","text":"The Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre (MNC), is a joint centre of University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health in Australia.

It is a method by which the identity of the top card may be kept secret by lifting the top two cards as one, making it seem as if only the top card is picked up. Similar techniques may be applied to more than two cards to perform a triple or even quadruple lift. The term was coined by Theo Annemann. When the card is shown to the audience, the audience is tricked into believing that they are shown the top card in the deck where in fact they are shown the second card. When the cards are displayed, the maneuver is sometimes called the \\"double turnover\\". Some versions of the ambitious card routine rely almost entirely upon this sleight. In combination with a few other mechanics and good showmanship, entire acts can and have been made out of this single move. Origins The first recorded publishing of the double lift is in Richard Neve's book \\"The Merry Companion\\"Neve, Richard. The Merry Companion. London: Printed for H. Tracy, 1721. Print. in 1776. It can be seen on page 141, item XXV under \\"to seem to change the top card of the pack into another\\". The double lift was next seen in print in the 19th century in Jean Nicholas Ponsin's Nouvelle Magie Blanche D√©voil√©e.Ponsin, J. -N. Nouvelle Magie Blanche D√©voil√©e. Gen√®ve: Slatkine, 1980. Print. The earliest reference to the double lift in the 20th century is in John Northern Hilliard's book \\"Greater Magic\\".Hilliard, John Northern, Carl Waring Jones, Jean Hugard, and Harlan Tarbell. Greater Magic; A Practical Treatise on Modern Magic. Minneapolis: C.W. Jones, Priv. Print. for Professional & Amateur Magicians, 1938. N. pag. Print. Many confuse the creation of the double lift with the Dai Vernon double turnover, which is an extension of the double lift where two cards are flipped to hide the identity of the top card. Still, many magicians and magic historians debate that Vernon was the creator, though he never has claimed to be the creator. In an interview in the 1982 small-time film \\"The Wonder of Magic\\", Dai Vernon said that he \\"may be the creator\\" of the double turnover, but wasn't certain.
