On 12 March 2008 the AFL received unanimous support from the existing 16 clubs for two expansion teams to enter the league, one of which was to be based in western Sydney. The Western Sydney working party met on 22 July to discuss player rules and draft concessions. The Australian Football League Commission continued to delay their final decision on the new western Sydney franchise throughout 2008 before announcing a $100 million redevelopment of Sydney Showground Stadium on 15 November. Team GWS also announced former Essendon senior coach Kevin Sheedy was officially announced as Greater Western Sydney's inaugural head coach on 9 November 2009. Acceptance On 29 July 2010 AFL Chief Executive Andrew Demetriou announced that the Greater Western Sydney bid team had been granted a provisional license to enter the league in 2012 and would become the eighteenth team in the Australian Football League. 2010: TAC Cup Greater Western Sydney were permitted to use any player under the age of 18 from New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory to compete for the team in their TAC Cup year. The team played its first competitive game in the TAC Cup against the Northern Knights on 3 April. The Knights would belt GWS by 94 points at Blacktown Olympic Park. Rugby League international Israel Folau signed for GWS on 1 June 2010. On 1 June the club announced the signings of their first three players in the form of zone selections Curtly Hampton, Mark Whiley and Sam Schulz. On the same day, the club also announced the signing of professional rugby league footballer Israel Folau. Folau's three-year contract with GWS would begin in 2011 as they team entered the North East Australian Football League. On 16 November the club revealed their guernseys and their nickname of the \\"Giants\\". 2011: NEAFL The Greater Western Sydney Football Club were permitted access to a dozen 17-year-olds throughout Australia that would compete for the club in their NEAFL year. The list of the 12 selected players was revealed in December 2010, which included Tomas Bugg (Gippsland), Jeremy Cameron (North Ballarat), Sam Darley (North Hobart), Josh Growden (Woodville-West Torrens), Jarrod Harding (Woodville-West Torrens), Jack Hombsch (Sturt), Tim Golds (Oakleigh), Dylan Shiel (Dandenong), Adam Treloar (Dandenong), Simon Tunbridge (Perth), Gerald Ugle (Perth) and Nathan Wilson (Peel). The club also attempted to relocate Swan Districts 16-year-old Stephen Coniglio to join the club for their NEAFL season, as the Gold Coast did 12 months previous with David Swallow. The AFL did not allow the move as Coniglio had not finished his year 12 studies. 2012‚Äì2013: AFL Development Years =2012: Inaugural season= As a part of the concessions package on entry to the AFL, the Giants were permitted to sign up to sixteen off contract players at other clubs. Adelaide defender Phil Davis made history on 2 August 2011 when he became the first AFL contracted player to sign for the Giants. Further signings included Callan Ward (Western Bulldogs), Rhys Palmer (Fremantle Dockers), Tom Scully (Melbourne Demons) and Sam Reid (Western Bulldogs). Further concessions were given to the club during the 2011 AFL Draft when they received nine of the first fifteen picks. The picks were used to acquire Jonathan Patton (1), Stephen Coniglio (2), Dom Tyson (3), Will Hoskin-Elliott (4), Matt Buntine (5), Nick Haynes (7), Adam Tomlinson (9), Liam Sumner (10), Toby Greene (11), Taylor Adams (13) and Devon Smith (14). =2013: Emergence of Jeremy Cameron= In Round 6 the Giants looked to cause a major upset when they led the undefeated Essendon Bombers at half time by 23 points at Etihad Stadium. Giants forward Jeremy Cameron kicked a club record six goals in the game but a strong finish from Essendon prevented the Giants from securing their first win of the season. Cameron's goal kicking feats were so impressive that he found himself tied first in the Coleman Medal race with Jarryd Roughead and Josh Kennedy following a two-goal effort against Brisbane in Round 21. 2014‚Äìpresent: The Big Three The Giants entered the 2014 AFL season with three high-profile forwards after securing Tom Boyd with the number one pick in the 2013 AFL Draft.

Background Born in Singapore, Long worked as a financial broker before becoming an amateur DJ at Singapore's Avalon nightclub in 2009 and at Emboga in Madrid, Spain in 2011. She later returned to Avalon to become its resident DJ. She became the first to be featured in Playboy Thailand magazine in October 2013. She was also the first Singaporean DJ to be ranked among the world's top 100 DJs in DJ Mags Top 100 DJs poll in 2013, coming in at #87. She signed a deal with Universal Music in 2015; her first single \\"Traffic\\" was released in June of that year. Personal life During her time as a financial broker, Long was married and had a daughter who was born around 2007. She has since divorced and her daughter stays with her ex-husband. In February 2015, Long met the 42-year-old British expat Thorsten Nolte through a mutual friend. Prior to their first meeting, Nolte had divorced his wife Jamie Yeo that same month. In October 2015, upon their return to Singapore from the Amsterdam trip, Long and Nolte were arrested on suspicion of drug offenses; Long's luggage was searched and was found to have two \\"Psilocybe Atlantis Forbidden Fruit\\" containers holding about 41.81 grams of magic truffles, which contain psilocin, a controlled drug in Singapore. She also tested positive for benzoylecgonine, an indicator of cocaine, in a urine test, while Nolte was tested positive for cannabis. Their apartment at Robertson Quay was later raided and tablets of nimetazepam were found there. They were later released on bail; however, they left Singapore while their charges were still pending, resulting in their failure to report to the Central Narcotics Bureau, and both ended up becoming wanted people. When contacted by The New Paper through an email a year later on 1 April 2016, Long denied that they were in trouble with the law and stated that the allegations were made to \\"stir some gossip and slander\\" them. The news that they were on the run was first made known in the said newspaper the following day. Long returned to Singapore due to the expiration of her passport; she was arrested upon arrival at Changi Airport on 24 May 2018 and was held on remand, while her ex-boyfriend remained in Germany. On 26 March 2018 Long was found guilty in court and was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. She was released at the end of May 2019. Discography =Singles= * \\"B.O.P.

On 13 July 2017 it was revealed that Carter was playing for The Coffs Harbour Comets on The NSW Mid North Coast in The Group 2 division.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-bad-boy-paul-carter- to-take-on-exeels-star-danny-wicks-in-group-2/news- story/c14b839118d45add03424818a33cbfad In November 2017, it was announced that The Cessnock Goannas were attempting to sign Carter on a 2-year contract but were told by The CRL that Carter had his registration as a player cancelled. CRL Operations Manager Bert Lowrie said \\"Carter has been deregistered by the board ‚Äúbased on his history‚Äù and ‚Äúwill remain that way until he makes an application to be registered‚Äù. =Misconduct= Carter's career has been marred by alcohol abuse, which led to his contracts with the Gold Coast and South Sydney being torn up. In 2014 season (while contracted with the Gold Coast) Carter was twice charged with drink driving. His first charge was in June, the Court gave him a $14,000 fine and suspended him from driving for 12 months. In December (six months later) he was charged with high-range drink driving while driving unlicensed. Following the incident Coach Neil Henry commented that \\"Paul has had an opportunity... we've put measures in place to help him out with a few of the issues he has and he was making some progress but to go and transgress again, especially when the courts have said he's unlicensed, that's unacceptable\\". In July 2016 (while contracted with South Sydney) Carter was sacked because he failed to attend a training session following a weekend bender. This was not Carter's first breach of conduct with the club. A month earlier (June 2016) Carter and teammate Kirisome Auva'a were both stood down for turning up to training under the influence of alcohol. Following Carter's sacking by South Sydney, he checked into an alcohol rehabilitation centre in Thailand. On October 11, 2017, Carter again made headlines when it was alleged that he went to the house of former teammate Blake Ferguson. According to authorities, Carter and Ferguson were drinking until 3AM when Ferguson asked Carter to leave the house as he had young children asleep inside. It is then alleged that after Carter left Ferguson's property he made a phone call to the authorities saying that Ferguson had given his two young children drugs. The Police then knocked on Ferguson's door around 5:15AM to respond for a call to welfare of the two young children. After emergency services checked the children they found no wrongdoing from Ferguson nor any drugs in the house. On 29 November 2017, Carter failed to appear in court for sentencing relating to supply of cocaine. Carter was due to be sentenced for supplying a small quantity of cocaine to ex-teammate Shaun Kenny-Dowall at The Ivy nightclub in May 2017. It was revealed that Carter was overseas in a rehabilitation center. The magistrate said in relation to Carter failing to appear at court as being \\"Unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable\\". The magistrate ordered that sentencing be moved to January 10, 2018. On 13 December 2017, it was reported that Carter was involved in a fake jersey scam where he allegedly sold fake merchandise to a fan over eBay. Carter then admitted to the buyer that the jerseys were fake and he needed the money because he was struggling financially. The fan claimed that he sent Carter $2000 as he felt the troubled player needed help and that Carter would pay him back once he joined The Sydney Roosters. Carter was later sacked by The Roosters and the money was never paid back to the buyer. On 10 January 2018, Carter was handed a two-year good behaviour bond by the court and escaped a jail sentence. On 15 January 2019, it was revealed that Carter was accused of being at the center of a video leaking scandal regarding former teammate Dylan Napa. Carter had vehemently denied he was leaking the Dylan Napa sex tapes as part of a campaign to extort money from his former teammate. A senior staff member at the Sydney Roosters claimed that Carter was a past member of a WhatsApp player group and had access to \\"all the videos\\". It was claimed that Carter fell out with Napa 18 months ago and he wanted money in exchange for keeping the videos private. Carter responded to the claims saying \\"I heard the allegations from people close to me, who messaged me in disbelief asking, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äô I was in shock. \\"When I was at the Roosters, I had a great relationship with Dylan and still do to this day. He sent me a message confirming the exact same thing: that we have a good relationship and there‚Äôs no bad blood. I left the Roosters but there‚Äôs no bad blood with the club or any of the players, I haven‚Äôt read the message and probably won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got bigger and better things to worry about than people playing games and making up stories. It‚Äôs sad that they don‚Äôt have anything better to do with their lives\\".

The film had its world premiere on March 8, 2014 at South by Southwest and features Alexandra Essoe as a hopeful young starlet who finds that fame's price is not always easily paid. Funding for the movie was partially raised through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Plot Sarah Walker is an aspiring actress who is stuck waitressing at a fast-food restaurant. Her friends are generally unsupportive and selfish; Erin is constantly trying to steal Sarah's roles, while her roommate Tracy and aspiring director Danny are apathetic to Sarah's situation. Sarah's prospects at stardom look dim until she takes an audition for a film called The Silver Scream, held by the powerful production company Astraeus Pictures. Her audition is met with a lackluster response by the casting director and her assistant. Upset at being dismissed, Sarah goes to a nearby bathroom to scream and rip her hair out, a move that regains the interest of the casting director. She returns to the audition and reluctantly acquiesces to the casting director's demand that she rip her hair out again. Sarah is dismissed again, much to her confusion. Sarah quits her job to fully pursue this role, and gets a callback to a second audition shortly after. She is caught off guard when she is told to disrobe. Sarah again agrees to these demands, and after being told to open herself up to the potential to \\"transform\\", she experiences extreme euphoria and undergoes a trance state, during which she notices that the casting director is wearing a pentagram-like necklace. While in this state, she begins to show mild erratic behaviors. However, when she is commanded to have sex with the producer at the third audition, Sarah balks and runs home. Danny, who apparently shows a romantic interest in Sarah, asks her to be the lead role in his own film project, to which she accepts. At a pool party celebrating Danny's movie, Sarah is surprised when she sees him kissing Erin. Sarah angrily returns to the producer's house, where she promptly performs fellatio on him. During the following days, she shows increasingly erratic behavior even while her body begins to deteriorate. After a heated argument with Tracy, Sarah retreats to her room and sees the casting director, experiencing a vision of herself as a glamorous starlet. When she goes to the bathroom to vomit, she finds that her hair and nails have almost completely fallen out. Sarah, now wracked with pain, climbs into the bathtub and vomits masses of bloodied maggots. Sarah answers a call from the producer, who tells her that she can either die or embrace the transformation. Sarah chooses the latter and goes to Erin's house to confront her. They argue over exchanging sex for film parts until Erin turns on the kitchen lights and sees Sarah's disfigured face. Erin tries to persuade Sarah to go to the hospital, but she slices Erin's cheek with a knife. Sarah accepts what she has done and proceeds to repeatedly stab Erin before killing two others in the house. She realizes that Erin is attempting to escape, and suffocates her with a plastic bag. She then goes outside to Danny's van and kills him as well. Afterwards, the people behind Astraeus Pictures reveal that they are a secret cult worshipping a demon of the same name. They conduct a ritual whereby Sarah, surrounded by illuminated acolytes, is reborn from a bloodied membrane as they mark out a surrounding pentagram-shaped emblem with rods of phosphorescent light. Sarah emerges with a flawless, healthy and totally hairless body; a gift-wrapped box has been left for her. She returns to her apartment and kills Tracy before putting on the presents that Astraeus left her: a black gown, a long brunette wig, and a silver pentagram necklace. Sarah admires herself in the mirror as her eyes glow green.

Release  The film was released February 3, 2015 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Reception The film holds an approval rating of 73% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Starry Eyes pokes Hollywood's seedy underbelly to produce a refreshingly original horror story led by a breakout performance from Alex Essoe.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In their review Fangoria remarked that \\"Kolsch & Widmyer are clearly attuned to the pitch black nature that consumes Sarah but, like the alluring score, there‚Äôs something stirring in her eventual transformation of living through an actor‚Äôs worst cosmetic nightmare and still forcibly taking what she wants.\\" Shock Till You Drop and Bloody Disgusting also praised the film, with Bloody Disgusting commenting that although the film did have flaws \\"[those] same elements that provide its flaws also supply its strengths, which are far more prevalent.\\" Time magazine has called the film one of the ten best films of South by Southwest. =Awards= * Excellence in Poster Design at South by Southwest (2014, won) * Directors‚Äô Choice Award for Best Feature at the Boston Underground Film Festival (2014, won) * BloodGuts UK Horror Award (2014, won special recognition) * FANGORIA Chainsaw Award Best Actress (Alexandra Essoe) References External links * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:American body horror films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films about Hollywood Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Kickstarter-funded films Category:Self-harm in films ","title":"Starry Eyes"},{"id":"42161893","text":"Rehaliya is situated in Sheo tehsil and located in Barmer district of Rajasthan, India.

The semi-circular balconies are the building's hallmark. Tilkka Hospital (, ; often referred to simply as Tilkka) is a former military hospital in Helsinki, Finland. It is located at Mannerheimintie 164 in the Pikku Huopalahti district. Tilkka military hospital was founded in 1918 and moved to Pikku Huopalahti in 1936 when the new nine-storey Functionalist building designed by architect Olavi Sortta was completed. The building's distinctive mark are the semi-circular balconies, facing south around the main stairway. Patient rooms were concentrated on the top seven floors, providing patients with light, ventilation and a scenic view. Service rooms were located across the central corridor. Tilkka was expanded in the 1960s with a five- storey enlargement, an office wing and another low wing that housed for instance a military pharmacy. The expansion was also designed by Sortta and the enlargement followed the space division of the original 1930s building. The military hospital operated until 2005 when the Finnish Defence Forces vacated the building following an organizational transformation that outsourced the military's special health care. The State of Finland sold the building to pension insurance company Etera for 8.8 million euros in October 2006 after which it was renovated into an elderly nursing home. The nursing home is operated by nursing service provider Esperi Care and houses 150 residents. The National Board of Antiquities has listed Tilkka as a nationally significant built cultural heritage site and Docomomo has selected the building as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland. The building is protected by a 2002 zoning ordinance and cannot be torn down or altered in a way that damages its cultural historical value.

She became the first woman to summit Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen in 1988.Going Up is Easy goodreads.com She has gone on to summit the mountain five more times. Early life Lydia Bradey was born to Royce and John Bradey in Christchurch, New Zealand. Her father was absent for most of her childhood, and she and her mother struggled financially. Bradey took up mountain climbing as a teenager; she went on her first wilderness expedition at the age of 14, and by 17 she had climbed to the summits of Mount Cook and Mount Aspiring. During this time she regularly climbed with her friend Rob Hall, and later met his friend Gary Ball. When she was 19, Bradey left New Zealand for a four-year international climbing trip, which included an attempt on Mount McKinley in Alaska and ten ascents of Yosemite's big walls, seven of which were the first ascents by a female. Mountain climbing career In 1987, Bradey reached the summit of Gasherbrum II, thereby becoming the first Australasian woman to climb one of the world's fourteen 8,000 metre peaks. The climb proved controversial since Bradey was climbing on a permit for the adjacent Gasherbrum I (a peak she had abandoned in favour of Gasherbrum II due to bad weather), making her ascent illegal. In October 1988, Bradey successfully climbed Mount Everest, making her the first female to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen, as well as the first New Zealand female and the youngest New Zealander at the time. This ascent, like the previous year on Gasherbrum II, broke rules agreed with the Nepalese. Bradey did not have a permit for the route she climbed, and her teammates Rob Hall and Gary Ball said she had not reached the summit to avoid being banned from the mountain. When the Nepalese government threatened Bradey with a 10-year climbing ban, she too retracted her claim of a successful ascent, only to reassert her claim to the summit later. In 1994, Bradey graduated from the University of Auckland with a degree in physiotherapy. She completed a certificate of acupuncture in 1998 and became an International Mountain & Ski Guide (IFMGA) in 2000. Since then she has worked as an alpine guide based in Wanaka. Bradey made her second summit climb of Mount Everest in May 2008, twenty years after her first ascent. She climbed as a guide for a group of clients under the outfitter Adventure Consultants (AC). In 2013, 2016 and 2018 Bradey made her third to fifth ascents of Everest, again as an AC guide; in 2019 she guided Everest for the sixth time, from Tibet, China for an American company Alpenglow Expeditions. In the 2020 New Year Honours, Bradey was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mountaineering. Personal life Bradey lives in Lake HƒÅwea, Otago with her partner Dean Staples. Bradey was the subject of a biography, Lydia Bradey: Going Up is Easy, by Laurence Fearnley.

He lived in Geneva from 1803, and produced all illustrations for botanical memoirs published by Geneva botanists after 1820.Memoires, Volume 5 of \\"Soci√©t√© de physique et d'histoire naturelle de Gen√®ve\\" - Imprimerie A. L. Vignier, Rue de Rhone, Maison de la Poste, 1832 He also illustrated the work of Benjamin Delessert, Philip Barker-Webb, Giuseppe Giacinto Moris, Pierre Edmond Boissier and others.http://www.antiquariaatjunk.com/item.php?item=2152 Biography Baptised Jean-Christophe Kumpfler, he went to Geneva in his youth as an apprentice hairdresser to an uncle named Heyland, whose surname he subsequently adopted. He showed a keen interest in the graphic arts, and employed his leisure time in studying drawing and engraving. After spending a few years in London, where he was a designer of costumes for the theatre, he returned and settled in Geneva. Jos√© Mariano Moci√±o and Mart√≠n de Sess√© worked on a Flora Mexicana and after de Sess√©'s death in 1808, Moci√±o met de Candolle in 1816 in Montpellier and showed him the drawings they had produced for the planned work. De Candolle requested that the plates be copied by artists of the Geneva community.\\"Frontier Naturalist - Jean Louis Berlandier and the Exploration of Northern Mexico and Texas\\" - Russell M. Lawson Of these copied plates, the sixteen done by Heyland caught de Candolle's eye. Guided by de Candolle he became one of the leading botanical artists of the period, working for him for 24 years. One of his students was Jean-Louis Berlandier who also showed great aptitude in his botanical illustrations. Becoming a citizen of Geneva in 1819, Heyland was admitted to the Society of Arts and the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences. The Archduke Reynier, Viceroy of Lombardy, commissioned him in 1849 to work at the botanical garden in Monza. In 1859 he returned to Geneva, where he lived on the proceeds from the lessons he gave in drawing. From 1835 he worked as principal artist on Charles Antoine Lemaire's Jardin Fleuriste. He drew and engraved 5 full-page illustrations, including Impatiens parviflora for de Candolle's Quatrieme Notice sur Les Plantes Rares.http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/jean-louis-prevost/page-2/ Between 1839 and 1846 he produced the illustrations for volumes 4-5 of Icones selectae plantarum, another of de Candolle's projects in collaboration with Benjamin Delessert (1773-1847). He carried out several commissions for the Geneva Botanical Garden, and directed the engraving and printing in colour of the 180 plates used for 'Voyage botanique en Espagne'. In his old age he suffered from trembling hands and failing eyesight, but retained his good humour to the end. His final contribution to botanical art was the 122 plates he produced for Pierre Edmond Boissier's 1866 work, \\"Icones Euphorbiarum\\". Augustin Pyramus de Candolle created the genus Heylandia in 1825 in his honour, a genus which is now included in Crotalaria.\\"Crotalaria in Africa and Madagascar\\" - R. M. Polhill (1982) Heyland died on 29 August 1866 at a village near Genoa, during a trip in Italy.https://doc.rero.ch/record/11923/files/gf_584_1_partie2.pdfhttps://archive.org/stream/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2/SchweizerKuenstlerLexikonBd2_djvu.txt He had married Louise Fran√ßoise Jouvet and had two sons, Jeanne Marie (1826) and Jacques Fran√ßois, both born in Geneva. Jaques Fran√ßois Kumpfler (alias Francesco Heyland), born in Geneva on 26 August 1830, became a daguerreotypist and photographer active in Milan (Italy), initially with his father (\\"Heyland et fils\\" = \\"Heyland e figlio\\"), then in association with the French photographers Hippolyte and Victor Deroche (in the firm \\"Deroche & Heyland - Photographie Parisienne, al grand Mercurio\\"), and finally he worked on his own (\\"Francesco Heyland\\"). In 1877, Boissier & Reuter named an Iris after him Iris heylandiana in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society (J. Linn. Soc. Bot.) Vol.16 on page 142.

She was widely exhibited in Canadian art museums and galleries, and discussed in numerous articles and monographs from 1987 to the early 2000s.  Education  In 1984 she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts form Mount Allison University. In 1987 she received a Master of Fine Arts form the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.  Artistic periods  = Early work = Laurie Walker c. 1984. Photo: Paul Christopher Walker‚Äôs early installations combined botanical illustrations with industrial machinery. Utilizing diverse materials (such as: steel, copper, paraffin, watercolour on paper, book, pressed plant, glass, oak, Carrara marble, Belgian black marble, oak, beeswax and more...) Walker analyzed sculptural ciphers across knowledge domains. The theorist Daina Augaitis wrote (in a 1991 essay published by the Banff Centre for the Arts entitled ‚ÄòSeeing nature: and the works of Bill Viola and Laurie Walker‚Äô): \\"Each of these works draws on layers of reference which entwine historically constructed notions of knowledge, authority and beauty with contemporary understandings of natural environments.\\"\\"Eye of Nature (signed).\\" Catalogues/Monographs. 1991.

Retrieved from http://e-artexte.ca/19374/ The curator of ‚ÄòSeeing Blue‚Äô, Pierre Landry described how: \\"The strange seductive power of these works stems as much from the mastery they show in their use of techniques and material, both varied (wood, copper, marble, watercolor) and sometimes, uncommon (peat moss, bioluminescent bacteria‚Ä¶) as from the symbolic information‚Ä¶\\" ‚ÄòSeeing Blue‚Äô. Press Release. Mus√©e d art contemporain de Montr√©al, April 7, 1994 In 1994, the critic John Armstrong reiterated these assessments in a review of Walker‚Äôs work: \\"The natural, here as in her other works, is committed to representation's own symbiotic narratives.\\"Armstrong, John. \\"Laurie Walker: A Material Writing of Things\\". C Magazine 43, Fall 1994 = Mid-career (1995-2005) = In her mid career, Walker‚Äôs research interests expanded to include biomedical appendages, taxidermy, neurology, projection and EEG. Her eclectic use of materials explored combinations of the organic and synthetic: Kheper beetle, gold leaf, sheep manure, peat moss, overhead projectors, water, IV bags, glass, watercolours on enlarged EEG printouts. In many respects, Walker‚Äôs distinctive hybrid creation constituted a unique sculptural vocabulary. The Oboro catalog for Walker‚Äôs show ‚ÄòPortrait of the Artist as a Wave‚Äô (2001) analyzed her work as follows: \\"Since the late 1980s Laurie Walker has developed a singular body of work. The large sculptures and the drawings she has produced since that time have been nourished by interrogations concerning the forces of nature, spirituality and science.... The installation at OBORO takes us this time into the world of sleep, inviting us to consider some of its phenomena....In a concrete way A Portrait of the Artist as a Wave is an interaction of light and water waves with patterns of the artist‚Äôs brain waves.

Walker‚Äôs last decade of life was lived in seclusion in Montreal, looking for a cure for CFIDS.

The specific epithet ' is from the Latin meaning \\"parasitic\\", referring to the idea (now known to be incorrect) that the flowers are parasitic on another tree species. Taxonomy and naming Swedish naturalist Pehr Osbeck described this species as Melia parasitica in 1751, before it was transferred to the genus Dysoxylum by Indonesian botanist Andr√© Joseph Guillaume Henri Kostermans in 1966. Australian populations were known as Dysoxylum schiffneri. The Bajau people of Sabah know it as jarum- jarum, while it is commonly known as yellow mahogany in Queensland. Description Dysoxylum parasiticum trees grow up to tall with a trunk that has a diameter of up to and up to buttresses. The smooth bark is yellowish to grey-brown. The sweetly scented flowers are white or creamish-coloured. The red-brown fruits are roundish, and up to in diameter. Both flowers and fruits grow directly off the trunk (cauliflory) to near ground level, or off the large branches (ramiflory). Distribution and habitat Dysoxylum parasiticum trees grow naturally in Taiwan and throughout Malesia, to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Queensland. Their habitat is rainforest from sea-level to altitude. In Queensland they are found from sea level to , in such areas in the northeast as Mount Bellenden Ker. Uses Dysoxylum parasiticum has potential as a feature tree in parks or gardens in areas with subtropical or tropical climates. It prefers acid soils with good drainage and dappled sun or part-shade.

Janiak's feature film directorial debut, it stars Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway as a newly married couple whose honeymoon ends up being ruined by a series of strange events. The film had its world premiere on March 7, 2014, at South by Southwest, and was theatrically released by Magnolia Pictures on September 12, 2014. Plot Bea and Paul are newly married and are spending their honeymoon at a rustic cabin, which belongs to her family, in a secluded Canadian forest. They visit a small restaurant where they meet Will, the owner and Bea's childhood friend. Will's wife Annie interrupts, saying they need to get away. That night, Paul wakes up to find Bea missing. He finds her naked and disoriented in the woods and takes her back to the cabin, where she claims she was sleepwalking due to stress. Over subsequent days, Bea seemingly forgets how to do several basic tasks, but insists that she is fine. Paul observes her practicing future conversations, and she struggles to remember common words. One night, Paul is disturbed by bright lights shining through their bedroom window, but is unable to find its source. He returns to where he found Bea the night she vanished, discovering a gown she claimed to have packed. Despite her repeated denial, Paul concludes that Will is responsible and goes to confront him. He sees Annie outside the restaurant, who exhibits similar behavior to Bea and bears identical marks on her thighs. She claims that Will is hiding and again warns Paul to stay away before departing. Paul finds Will's bloody hat floating in the water. He enters their home and finds several pages of notes describing basic details about Annie, including her and Will's names, along with security camera footage of Annie following the bright lights into the woods. Paul discovers that Bea has taken similar notes, and accuses her of being someone else. She locks herself in the bathroom, and when Paul breaks in he finds her repeatedly stabbing herself in the genitals. Paul ties her to the bed, and interrogates her about details of their relationship, most of which she either misremembers or has forgotten. She puts Paul's hand into her vagina and has him remove out a large worm-like creature. Bea explains that the night she disappeared into the woods, she saw the same lights Paul had seen and walked to them. She encountered a group of silhouetted figures, who impregnated her with the creature. Bea claims that she is herself, but that the figures are taking away what is left of her. Paul scrambles to find their car keys, but she insists that they cannot leave. After a beam of light suddenly appears, she knocks Paul out and takes him into the middle of the lake on a boat, fastening an anchor to his legs. He awakens, with Bea explaining that she is protecting him from the figures by \\"hiding\\" him under the water. Paul tries to escape, but she throws him overboard. Bea is shown to be deteriorating, with her skin peeling off and her eyes discolored. After watching her and Paul's wedding video, she is met by a similarly-deteriorated Annie, and they walk into the lights together. Cast *Rose Leslie as Bea *Harry Treadaway as Paul *Ben Huber as Will *Hanna Brown as Annie Production Planning for Honeymoon began in 2010, after Janiak viewed Monsters and Tiny Furniture, and she and Phil Graziadei began writing the script in 2012. While writing the film's script Janiak was inspired by the idea that \\"Even small moments though can drive a wedge between people\\" and with her writing partner, wondered \\"how far we could push them until they started falling apart.\\" Janiak chose Rose Leslie to perform as Bea after viewing her performance on Game of Thrones. Principal photography began in spring 2013 and had a limited budget. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 74%, based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 5.75/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Smart, stylish, and nail-bitingly tense, Honeymoon packs more slow-building horror than many bigger-budget productions.\\" Shock Till You Drop gave Honeymoon a positive review, stating \\"Janiak demonstrates some wonderfully confident direction for a first-timer, utilizing space, sound design and two very good lead actors as her tools to slowly amplify the tension and mess with your head.\\" Twitch Film also praised the film and called it \\"a good story, excellently told, and very, very scary.\\" Meanwhile, Pop Insomniacs gave it a mixed review, saying that the film \\"isn‚Äôt going to blow your mind, or scare the crap out of you\\" but director Leigh Janiak \\"is clever enough to bank on these young stars and their explosive chemistry instead.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:2010s mystery films Category:2010s science fiction horror films Category:Alien abduction films Category:American mystery films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American films Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:English-language films Category:Films about marriage Category:Films about vacationing ","title":"Honeymoon (2014 film)"},{"id":"42162875","text":"The St Lawrence Lime in 2003 The St Lawrence Lime Tree was a at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, Kent, England. It was located within the boundary ropes of the cricket field which required special rules. In 2005, it was broken in two in high winds.  History  It is not known when the tree was planted, but it was fully grown by 1847, when the St Lawrence Ground was opened. The cricket ground was built around the tree, which was located within the boundary ropes. As a result of the St Lawrence Ground being the only first-class ground with a tree in the playing area, special laws were enacted regarding the tree. These laws may have been instigated pre-1910 where a Hampshire County Cricket Club batsman was claimed to be caught by a Kent County Cricket Club fielder off the tree. The laws stated that if the ball hit the tree, it was scored as a four even if it would have gone on to score six otherwise and no batsman could be caught out from a rebound off the tree. It was viewed as a challenge to hit a ball over the tree; only four batsmen, Arthur Watson, Learie Constantine, Jim Smith and Carl Hooper, managed it.Watson was missed from several reports which named only Constantine, Smith, and Hooper but his place on this list is specifically noted by Frank Keating in the following: Keating F (2005) Notes from the touchline, The Guardian, 2005-01-14. Retrieved 2016-01-26. =Death and replacement= The replacement St Lawrence Lime in 2017 In 1999, the St Lawrence Lime was diagnosed with heartwood fungus and given an expected lifespan of 10 years despite pollarding aimed to promote growth. In preparation, a replacement Tilia sapling was planted at the St Lawrence Ground by E. W. Swanton. Weakened by the fungus, the trunk of the tree was broken in two by high winds on 8 January 2005, leaving a stump. Kent initially planned to use the replacement to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime and had permission from the Marylebone Cricket Club to do so. However, because the replacement was still small and was deemed unable to take a cricket ball and being less visible to players, it was planted in the playing area outside the boundary ropes instead of inside to take the place of the St Lawrence Lime in a ceremony including former club captain Chris Cowdrey.

G. Wells, first published in 1895 in Unicorn. It was intended to be \\"the opening chapter of a sensational novel set in the Five Towns\\", later abandoned. The story is set at an ironworks in Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire. An artist is there to depict the industrial landscape; the manager of the ironworks discovers his affair with his wife, and takes him on a tour of the factory, where there are dangerous features. Summary Raut, an artist, is visiting Horrocks, manager of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, in order to study the industrial sights. An affair has developed between Raut and Horrocks's wife; Horrocks, unexpectedly entering the room where they are talking on a midsummer evening, seems to suspect it. Horrocks takes Raut to show him around. > A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery. > Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by the > rare golden dots of the street lamps.... Here and there a pallid patch and > ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank, or a > wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery where > they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at hand was the broad > stretch of railway, and half invisible trains shunted... And to the left, > between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the > whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, > stood the great cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces... They stood > heavy and threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething > molten iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the > steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and > thither. They walk towards Horrocks's ironworks. \\"'You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,' said Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast, and tightening the grip of his elbow the while. 'Little green lights and red and white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It's a fine effect.'\\" The route takes them near the railway line, and Raut wonders if Horrocks, guiding him roughly by the arm, is trying to push him into danger. In the factory, Horrocks shows him the cone over the \\"throat\\" of a furnace, which is held from above by a chain; the cone shuts off the heat from the furnace to save energy, and is regularly lowered by the chain so that fuel can be added. Finally Horrocks seizes Raut by the arm; Raut loses his balance and he falls, saving himself by clutching the chain of the cone. \\"Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and shouting, 'Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women!...' Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.\\" The cone drops and hot gas escapes from the furnace; Raut's end is described in macabre detail.

Nothing is known about Pankratios' origin or early career prior to his appointment as metropolitan. The see had been vacant since the capture of Trebizond and the incorporation of the Empire of Trebizond to the Ottoman Empire in 1461, as the bulk of the Trapezuntine upper classes, including the secular nobility and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, were transferred to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople. It was not until ca. 1472 that the vacancy was addressed. This was partly the result of the appointment of the Trapezuntine Symeon I as Patriarch of Constantinople, but owed more to political considerations on the part of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II: the Christians of the Pontus region around Trebizond had been restive against Ottoman rule, and were encouraged by the neighbouring Aq Qoyunlu sultan Uzun Hassan. The latter was linked through family ties with the former imperial house of Trebizond, and lent his support to a scion of that house, Alexios Komnenos. In order to counteract the threat of a rebellion, the Sultan elevated Symeon to the patriarchal throne, and he immediately appointed Pankratios to the metropolitan throne of Trebizond. It appears, however, that the latter was unable to satisfy the Sultan's expectations about calming the province, and already after a few months Mehmed II demanded his replacement. Pankratios was succeeded by Dorotheos II, and nothing further is known of him thereafter.

Early life Morgan was born at Nantygwenith, Merthyr Tydfil, the third son of William Morgan. His parents kept a public house known as the Full Moon at Nantygwenith, and this accounts for the pseudonym Dai o'r Nant. p. 496 His father was a local musician of some note and there is evidence that his son inherited some of his talents. In the late 1850s the family moved to Mountain Ash where Morgan found work at the Deep Navigation Colliery. Industrial Disputes of the 1870s It is not certain when David Morgan first emerged as a trade union activist but David Pretty suggests that he addressed a meeting at the celebrated 'rocking stone' on Pontypridd Common in 1868. There is firm evidence that he actively participated in a mass meeting of miners on Aberaman in early 1870 to urge the miners of the Aberdare Valley to join with those in Monmouthshire to demand an advance in wages. The early 1870s was a time that saw frequent industrial disputes in South Wales and there is evidence that Morgan was actively involved in these events. One of the earliest examples is of a large public meeting held at Aberaman in early 1870 attended by around 3000 miners. At this meeting, he supported a proposal that the miners of the Aberdare Valley join forces with those of the Rhondda and Monmouthshire to achieve their aims. Early in the following year, Morgan was again present at a delegate meeting of miners at Pontypridd. His involvement in these meetings demonstrate that he was already gaining stature as a representative, During the 1870s Morgan became increasingly involved with the Amalgamated Association of Miners. In 1872, Alexander Macdonald and Thomas Halliday, the national leaders of the AAM had visited Aberdare and addressed a meeting at the Temperance Hall. Within the month, Morgan was addressing a meeting at Mountain Ash, reminding his fellow miners, 'in a temperate and telling speech', that as trade unionists they had a responsibilities to discuss their grievances with the owners before embarking on strike action. Even at this early stage, Morgan was setting out his stall as an advocate of moderation, a stance he retained for most of his career. By May 1873 he was a member of the union executive and had attended a meeting in Manchester. In 1874 the miners' were defeated in a further coalfield-wide dispute which led to a reduction in wages. The AAM, as an umbrella organisation, went into terminal decline, although the various district unions struggled on, including that in the Aberdare Valley. Morgan sought election as miners' agent in 1875 but was defeated by Samuel Davies, Aberaman. Shortly afterwards, he withdrew from public life. David Morgan and Mabon Morgan first came to prominence in the 1870s but was often at odds with his contemporary, William Abraham (Mabon). The contrast between the tall and imposing figure of Morgan and the corpulent Mabon was striking. They did, however, share many features, including a background in nonconformist values and fine tenor voices, which they used to effect at meetings. As the years progressed their rivalry became more personal, with Morgan often outpolling Mabon in union ballots. Despite their personal animosity, however, and their frequent disputes on specific issues, the two men had more in common than their fiery relationship would suggest. In the 1870s, for example, both Morgan and Mabon opposed the hardline stance of Thomas Halliday and accepted that the miners would have to return to work on the owners' terms. As a result of the 1875 settlement, wages rates would be governed by a sliding scale regulated by the selling price of coal. In 1882, Morgan was elected miners' agent for the Aberdare, Merthyr and Dowlais Miners' Association and soon found himself at odds with Mabon over, for example, proposals to restrict coal production to maintain the selling price of coal. Soon after, he became embroiled in a bitter dispute at Mountain Ash having supported his preferred candidate for the post of physician at the Deep Duffryn and Navigation collieries. The majority of the miners at the two collieries supported another candidate and the outcome was that they withdrew support from Morgan as miners' agent and aligned themselves with Mabon's Cambrian Miners' Association. He pointedly refused to support Mabon when he successfully stood as Lib-Lab candidate for the Rhondda in 1885. Religious Affiliations Morgan was an active Baptist and served as a deacons both at the Gadlys Baptist Church and subsequently at Calfaria, Aberdare. Public life David Morgan was involved in Liberal politics from the time of the 1868 General Election, when Henry Richard was elected as MP for Merthyr Boroughs. At the 1874 election the constituency was contested by Thomas Halliday as a Labour candidate but Morgan retained his support for Richard. In 1880 he again supported the two Liberal candidates, Richard and C.H. James. From the 1880s, Morgan became actively involved in local government and was elected to the Aberdare School Board and, in 1892, to Glamorgan County Council where he was later made an alderman. He failed, however, in his attempt to gain a seat on the Aberdare Urban District Council in 1894. Later Trade Union career In early 1888, David Morgan and Mabon set aside their differences to establish the South Wales and Monmouthshire Colliery Workmen's Federation. David Morgan and Mabon were forced to collaborate more closely when the Miners Federation of Great Britain, which was fiercely opposed to the sliding scale mechanism for regulating miners' wages, became increasingly active in south Wales. The authority of the district unions was undermined by events such as the Hauliers Strike of 1893. In his later years, Morgan became more militant and opposed Mabon during the 1898 South Wales coal dispute. He was later imprisoned as a result of alleged intimidation at Abernant Colliery. Fellow members at Calfaria passed unanimously passed a resolution expressing \\"deep sympathy with our dear brother David Morgan, a worthy deacon of this church, and with his wife and family, in their deep distress.\\" Although he was soon released on appeal the episode was said to have affected his health and he died two years later, aged 60.

It was opened in 1879 by the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway (MB&M;) ‚Äì a joint line constructed and operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&L;) and North Staffordshire Railways (NSR). The station owed its existence to the desire to create an interchange between the MB&M; and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) route between and . Without the interchange, people wishing to travel between Macclesfield and Buxton had to travel to Stockport to change trains and then travel back on themselves to get to Buxton. The board of the MB&M; proposed to the LNWR that both companies should open a station where the two lines crossed at Middlewood, to allow passengers to save a considerable distance and time in their travel; the LNWR agreed and both the MB&M; station, known simply as Middlewood, and the LNWR's Middleton for Norbury station opened on 1 April 1879. They were connected by a flight of steps. While this allowed for passenger interchange, the layout did not allow for good interchange and, in 1882, discussion started on connecting the two lines by a rail link. The NSR and the LNWR agreed terms, but the MS&L; could not agree running powers with the LNWR, so the NSR and LNWR agreed to proceed on their own. The resulting section of line known as the Middlewood curve opened on 20 May 1885. Most train services on the MB&M; were run using MS&L; engines and rolling stock but, because of the running power agreement, services between Macclesfield and Buxton were provided by the NSR. The station buildings, including the platforms, were all of timber construction and was built on an embankment. This made is susceptible to subsidence and landslips. In 1955, part of the down (towards Manchester) platform and the waiting shelter were lost when the embankment collapsed. As the usage of the station was not high, replacing the lost section was considered uneconomic and reconstruction was not carried out; however, there are some remains of the support pillars for both sides of the station. As the station served a sparsely populated area, and there were two other stations ( and ) close by, the number of people using the Middlewood Higher (as it been renamed in 1951) was not high and, in 1960, after consultation, the station closed. When all of the MB&M; closed in 1970, the track was lifted, although the bridge across the Buxton line remains. The trackbed now forms part of the Middlewood Way, a recreational path between Macclesfield and Marple.

He was placed under investigation for corruption by the Communist Party's internal anti- corruption agency in February 2014, and dismissed from his positions. Biography Zhu was born in Xiayi County, Henan in January 1955. He graduated from Northwest University in Xi'an, majoring in economics. He returned to his home county in 1973 to become a middle school teacher at Liulou School Between 1976 and 1977 he performed manual labour at a commune in Chang'an County, Shaanxi. He spent the next year at a factory in Xi'an. He received his masters political economics degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University and graduated in 1982. Zhu joined the Communist Party of China in July 1986. After the Chinese economic reform, Zhu worked as an officer in Shaanxi Economic and Trade Commission. Zhu worked as Deputy Secretary General of the Shaanxi government between December 2002 to February 2006; by June 2005 he was made a full department-level official. In February 2006, Zhu was promoted to become the Vice-Chairman of Shaanxi Development and Reform Commission; he rose further through the ranks to become director of the Shaanxi Development and Reform Commission, a department with power to approve a wide range of capital projects in the province, in March 2008. In January 2013, Zhu was transferred to become Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; while this was technically a promotion, given that the provincial Development and Reform Commission played an outsize role in the provincial economy, this was in reality a transfer away from the center of power. On February 19, 2014, it was announced that Zhu was undergoing investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China for \\"serious violations of laws and regulations\\". On August 6, 2014, the CCDI announced Zhu's expulsion from the Communist Party. He was accused of taking bribes personally and through his son, and his case moved to judicial proceedings. The Langfang Intermediate People's Court in Hebei province took on Zhu's case in July 2015. Zhu was convicted of taking bribes worth approximately 8.55 million yuan (~$1.38 million), including accepting a gift of a Honda CR-V from a corporate executive, as well as accepting a $10 million Hong Kong dollar cash gift in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing in exchange for supporting the promotion of an associate. On November 19, 2015, Zhu was sentenced 11 years in jail for taking bribes.

His tenure began in 1472. The origin of Dorotheos is unclear, nor is anything about his early life known except that prior to his appointment to the see of Trebizond in 1472, he was Metropolitan of Athens as mentioned in his act of election to Trebizond. His activity in Athens is equally unknown, however, nor is he mentioned by any historians of the region. Dorotheos was appointed to Trebizond in succession to Pankratios, who had only months before been appointed metropolitan after a vacancy dating back to the capture of Trebizond by the Ottomans in 1461. Dorotheos was sent to Trebizond after the forced resignation of his predecessor. Pankratios had been appointed, after such a long interregnum, to calm the anti-Ottoman agitation among the Christians of the Pontus region around Trebizond. This agitation was particularly dangerous as it was encouraged by the neighbouring Aq Qoyunlu sultan Uzun Hassan, who was linked through family ties with the former imperial house of Trebizond and backed the designs of a scion of that house, Alexios Komnenos. In order to counteract the threat of a rebellion, the Ottoman Sultan elevated the Trapezuntine Symeon I to Patriarch of Constantinople, and the latter immediately appointed Pankratios to the metropolitan throne of Trebizond. It appears, however, that Pankratios was unable to calm the situation, or that he may have himself been actively involved in stirring up discontent, and after a few months the Sultan demanded his resignation. Dorotheos, who followed, seems to have been more successful, although no details are known about his tenure or his later life, except that he went on to become metropolitan of Caesarea. He may have been the immediate predecessor of the next known metropolitan of Trebizond, Gennadios I, attested in 1501, but this can not be verified.

This series is also formerly known as Pocket Heroes and Palm Heroes. The gameplay is reminiscent of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. Being started as a Pocket PC clone of Heroes of Might and Magic II, Palm Kingdoms became an independent project with its own graphics and gameplay.  Titles  The original version was developed by Robert Tarasov and Anton Stuk. The first public alpha was debuted for Windows Mobile under the title \\"Pocket Heroes\\" in 2006. In 2007, the name changed to \\"Palm Heroes\\", because the original name was interloping with another trademark registered by a toy company. Finally, in 2012, the project was rebranded to its current name \\"Palm Kingdoms\\".  Gameplay  The series' gameplay, starting from Pocket Heroes, had been copied from Heroes of Might and Magic II. The player controls a number of \\"heroes\\" which explore the map. The heroes also incorporate some role-playing game elements; they possess a set of statistics that confer bonuses to an army, artifacts that enhance their powers, and knowledge of magical spells that can be used to attack enemies or produce strategic benefits. Also, heroes gain experience levels from battle, and more experienced heroes are much more powerful than inexperienced ones. During the journey heroes can visit different buildings, collect treasures, conquer mines, etc.  Development  Palm Kingdoms 3  Reception  The series had been received well by critics. They praised the quality of remaking Heroes of Might and Magic II gameplay as well as graphics, on the other hand, the lack of campaign mode had been criticized. In the review of Pocket Heroes for Pocket PC TamsPPC commented that the variety of terrain types and buildings looks very good and called it \\"one of the best games\\" the reviewer had ever seen on the mobile computer. In their review of Palm Heroes TouchMyApps described it as \\"the famous Heroes of Might & Magic in the palm of your hand (hence the name)\\" and noted that the game could be difficult to master for the casual gamer, but \\"anyone who invests the time to understand its mechanics will be rewarded by literally hundreds of hours of gameplay\\", but there were complains about the absent campaign mode and help section, also, the tutorial map had been found to be too difficult to notice. My Today Screen described the game as \\"absolutely tremendous\\", but expressed expectation on upgrading the map navigation and economic aspect of the game. Touch Arcade awarded Palm Heroes 2 4/5 score and stated that \\"the only complaint I have is the lack of a cohesive campaign mode\\". The reviewer commended the hot-seat multiplayer (through he was disappointed with the lack of online multiplayer), controls, and called it \\"one of the better strategy titles on the App Store\\". He also recommended to download the Deluxe version of this game. Palm Kingdoms, like Palm Heroes, had been enjoyed by TouchMyApps reviewer. The praise was offered to the redesigned interface, which had become \\"much much more intuitive\\", through \\"the interface is still not completely there in some respects\\". The iPhone App Review gave Palm Heroes 2 Deluxe 5 stars of 5, noting that the game offers \\"a phenomenal amount of depth for an iPad app\\".

He acted as clerk of the works to John Carr the architect who was restoring York Minster, and repaired some of its old decoration. Halfpenny was twice married, and was survived by two daughters, Margaret and Charlotte.

Biography Ganesar Chanmugam was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) on 24 October 1939. He received his early education first in high school at the Royal College in Colombo, then at the University of Ceylon (Colombo), where he was awarded a BSc with honors in mathematics in 1961. He then moved to England where he received a BA in mathematics with honors from Downing College, Cambridge in 1963. He was an instructor in physics at the University of Massachusetts from 1963‚Äì1964, when he left to complete his graduate training at Brandeis University, receiving a PhD in physics in 1970. His work focused on the equation of state of nuclear matter in neutron stars. The asteroid 16107 Chanmugam is named for him. Professor Chanmugam was a research fellow at the Institut d'Astrophysique in Li√®ge, Belgium from 1969‚Äì1971. Thereafter, with the exception of summer and sabbatical leaves at MIT, the Space Telescope Science Institute, NASA Goddard Space Fight Center, the Max- Planck-Institut fur Astrophysik (Garching) and over a dozen other major research institutions throughout the world, he taught and carried on his research in astrophysics at Louisiana State University for the next 25 years. His extraordinary contributions to LSU were honored by a new Chanmugam Memorial Fund to support research and education activities in physics and astronomy at LSU. Author of over 110 scientific papers, presenter of dozens of papers at national and international scientific meetings, Professor Chanmugam was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the Royal Astronomical Society (London) as well as the International Astronomical Union and American Astronomical Society. During his life of research, He established an international reputation as one of the world's leading experts on the physics of white dwarfs and of neutron stars. His earliest scientific work focused on the properties of nuclear three-body forces and the equations of state in neutron star matter. He then turned his attention to a wide variety of neutron star problems concerning their electromagnetic properties, their dynamical stability, superfluid effects on their structure and properties of low density neutron stars. Throughout his career he conducted outstanding studies of the magnetic properties of neutron stars and white dwarfs. His penetrating physical insight and use of sophisticated mathematical analysis resulted in some of the deepest insights to date into the magnetic properties of degenerate matter. Some of this work focused on the origin of neutron star and white dwarf magnetic fields. Other studies focused on the effects these magnetic fields have on collapsed star radiation properties, including: cyclotron emission; gamma-ray emission from neutron stars and pulsars; magnetic models of gamma-ray bursts; effects of accretion on the magnetic fields of degenerate stars.

Innovation on the Front End is where exciting breakthroughs are created through a process that allows for creativity and value creation in a systematic manner different from the formal development process. In the Front End, idea genesis, opportunity validation, and concept development are dynamic and consists of adaptive interactions between involved participants with varied skills. They create, evaluate, analyze and iterate many alternatives and external technologies into potential breakthrough opportunities. The final result is a product concept including potential external technology partners, conceptual business model, preliminary product specifications, and the formation of a corporate sponsor team, a startup action plan, and Go/No Go milestones for insertion in to the formal development process. Although less expensive than the later product development phases, Front End Innovation is vital; this is the point where decisions to invest resources are fundamentally made.  Fuzzy Front End  The Front End of Innovation Stage is also sometimes described as the ‚ÄúFuzzy Front End‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhase 0‚Äù, ‚ÄúStage 0‚Äù or ‚ÄúPre- Project Activities‚Äù. It is the starting point where opportunities are identified and concepts are developed prior to entering the formal product development process. The Front End Innovation Process is really not ‚ÄúFuzzy‚Äù, it‚Äôs not a standard linear process as in formal development which is directed towards making a concept into reality. Front End Innovation has five specific categorically distinct efforts which are enacted in a non-Sequential iterative process allowing for discovery, creativity and concept validation. Non sequential due to the nature of discovery and inspiration that comes from new input being injected into the analysis process that triggers reevaluation of prior assumptions. The analysis must run its course as all assumptions are tested and modified until the participants are jointly satisfied that they have an optimum result that is ready to move forward conceptually or the concept is rejected and no further  Five Generic Steps  There are five generic steps of Front End Innovation that describe the variety of tasks that encompass the process. In general, they are: # Preliminary analysis - includes high-level market, technology, and industry assessments. Preliminary analysis is not market research as the latter includes more focused investigation of market size and market segments. # Demand refinement - includes customer discovery, voice of the customer, and other related research. # Translational research \\\\- includes building prototypes and performing continued research in related domains, designed to demonstrate a key aspect of an otherwise early- stage technology. # Technology discovery and development - includes locating early-stage technologies, external or internal and testing potential minimum viable product concepts. This step can be achieved via early customer feedback, individually, or from focus groups. Early product trials as well as process concept testing can be completed through test runs on current equipment or equipment owned by others. # Portfolio analysis and triage - includes an examination of each potential innovation with criteria that differ substantially from the numerical analysis required by the Formal Process. The main goal of the portfolio analysis is to prioritize potential innovations and ask questions designed to increase understanding of the concept. The steps are often not done in absolute order and often vary in sequence depending on iteration and discovery in other steps that drive a re-evaluation check along the way.  Front End versus Back End  Front end innovation has been defined into two broad main efforts, the ‚Äúidea generation effort‚Äù which starts the process and ‚Äúsince ideas must be executed in order to generate value, a ‚Äúback- end‚Äù of innovation or ‚ÄúBEI‚Äù is required to test and refine the ideas and make them a reality‚Äù validation stage. This critical technology discovery and development stage includes locating early-stage technologies, external or internal and testing potential minimum viable product concepts. This step can be achieved via early customer feedback, individually, or from focus groups. Early product trials as well as process concept testing can be completed through test runs on current equipment or equipment owned by others. Based on feedback the effort may be terminated, cleared for insertion into the formal development process, or run through another non sequential innovation cycle. A minimum viable product has just those features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more. The product is typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. It is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want, that seeks to maximize the information learned about the customer per dollar spent.

The Foundation bears the name of the architect Joseph Poelaert.  Objectives  It aims to ensure respect for the Brussels Palace of Justice. The group aims to concentrate all major judicial functions in Brussels, upon and around the Place Poelaert. This will allow all persons seeking justice or working within the judicial system to find all aspects of that system in one central place. The Foundation proposed a modern infrastructure for Justice on the Poelaert Campus. This includes a functional renovation of the Palace of Justice and the transfer of all judicial services, currently located elsewhere in Brussels, to the Poelaert Campus.  History  The Foundation came as a reaction to a Minister of Justice who was thinking of moving the courts from the Palace of Justice altogether and to a Secretary of State, who proposed to reserve 45.000 m¬≤ in the building for commercial, recreational and cultural purposes. The Foundation was created on 26 September 2011 by the Dutch and the French speaking Bar Associations of Brussels. The Board of Directors is composed of representatives of these associations, of magistrates and of other personalities from Brussels. The first Board of Directors included Jean-Pierre De Bandt, Jos Chabert, Michel Didisheim, Diane Hennebert, Ernest Krings, Christine Matray, Fran√ßois Schuiten, Hugo Weckx and presidents of the Bar Council Jean-Pierre Buyle and Dirk Van Gerven.

It was prepared by architect Jos Vandenbreeden, in collaboration with lawyer Jean-Pierre De Bandt and architect Francis Metzger. The document was handed over to the government, represented by Justice Minister Annemie Turtelboom and Secretary of State . In 2013 the Foundation published a proposal for an integrated management structure for Campus Poelaert, with incorporation of all courthouses to be entrusted to a public company with a professional board of directors. This company should, together with private partners, plan for the renovation of the Palace of Justice, in accordance with the policy principles put forward in 2012.

A supporter of women's issues, she wrote widely-read books and newspaper articles. Early years Ida Cornelia Ernestina Ed was born in Bergedorf in 1852 to a supportive family who encouraged her to write. Her father had started his own newspaper business. Her creation of short novels and other literary works was deterred when she married Carl Johann Boy at the age of seventeen. Career Ida Boy-Ed, 1912 Over her husband's objections in 1878, she moved out of the house she shared with his family. She took her eldest son, Karl, with her to Berlin where she intended to make her living by writing. Despite already being a published author of serialised novels and having experience in newspaper writing, she did not find success with the pieces she wrote at this time. She did, however, use her money to assist other artists. In 1880, she was obliged to move back to L√ºbeck at her husband's insistence as their divorce was not finalized.Ida Boy-Ed, Sophie.byu.ed, retrieved 11 March 2014 Boy-Ed spent much of her spare time writing while raising her children, but did not become successful until the age of 30. A book of her novellas about the Hanseatic middle classes was the first of about 70 that she published. Boy-Ed studied and wrote about leading German women like Charlotte von Stein, Charlotte von Kalb and the French writer Germaine de Sta√´l. Like them, she tried to support women's issues in her writings although her principal reason for writing was to make money. She achieved a wide readership for her books, as well as the hundreds of newspaper articles that she wrote. Boy-Ed invested in an impressive apartment and was a patron of the arts. In September 1914, at the outset of the First World War, Boy-Ed's son Walther was killed in France. Undeterred, Boy-Ed wrote of the need for a mother's sacrifice. She published her ideas in 1915 under the title Soldiers' Mothers in which she makes it clear, \\"A mother is only dust on the road to victory\\". Boy-Ed's son, Karl, was the naval attach√© of the German Embassy at Washington. His younger brother Emil was also a naval officer. Karl recalled that Thomas Mann was amongst the many literary and musical people who visited his mother's home. Boy-Ed died in 1928 in Travem√ºnde and was buried in L√ºbeck.

It operated from 1807 until 1981, when it was on the verge of bank failure and was acquired by Girard Bank. At that time, the bank had 28 branches. For most of its existence, the bank was 49% owned by the state government, although it was privately managed. History On February 4, 1807, the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation allowing the Farmers' Bank to incorporate and issue $500,000 of capital, via 10,000 shares at $50 each. The bank was incorporated by Henry M. Ridgely in Dover, with branches in New Castle and Georgetown. Established to provide banking and credit services to farmers in Kent and Sussex Counties, the bank also ended the 12 years of monopoly enjoyed by the National Bank of Delaware in banking services in the state. A supplementary charter on January 22, 1813, added a fourth branch in Wilmington. In 1816, the Second Bank of the United States selected the bank as a local depository for federal revenues. In 1837, the bank was selected as the depository for the federal surplus. In 1899, the branch in New Castle was closed after the city went into decline. In February 1976, the bank held merger talks with Girard Bank. In 1976, the state of Delaware increased its ownership from 49% to 80% after the bank lost $20.8 million in 1975 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) noted that it would cost more to liquidate the bank than to inject capital. As part of the deal between Governor Sherman W. Tribbitt and the FDIC, the state of Delaware agreed to keep all its deposits in the bank. On December 20, 1981, when the bank was on the verge bank failure, it was acquired by Girard Bank for $38.6 million, which required the passage of a special statute that allowed the Pennsylvania- based Girard Bank to acquire a Delaware bank. Girard Bank was acquired by Mellon Bank in 1984 and was sold in 2001 to Citizens Financial Group. =Management history= Among the presidents of the bank were: * Henry M.

On November 22, 2013, the submersible dove to a depth of 7,800 meters in the Japan Trench and captured images of deep-sea fish using a 3D full hi-vision video camera. The Edokko-1 Project Committee consists of five small- and medium-sized firms based in Tokyo and Chiba prefectures. The submersible was developed jointly by the Committee and a consortium of support organizations (including universities, research labs, private firms and volunteers). Development The concept of Edokko Ichigo originates from Yukio Sugino, the president of Sugino Rubber Chemical, Ltd., who was eager to start a new project in Tokyo to develop a device that can ‚Äúreach deep-sea.‚Äù He was inspired by the successful launch of the ‚ÄúMaido Ichigo‚Äù satellite by East Osaka Craftsmen Astro-Technology SOHLA in Osaka. Although he initially planned to develop a probe that could dive to 11,000 meters, the plan turned out to be unfeasible. JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) advised, at the request of President Sugino, that he could develop a probe using commercially available glass balls which free-falls to a depth of about 8,000 meters and returns to the surface by jettisoning a ballast weight. This advice constituted the basis for the Edokko Ichigo submersible. After the basic concept was formulated, the member firms of the Project Committee launched the development of constituent components. The members of the consortium, including the professors and students of universities and private companies, also contributed significantly to the development of control computers and telecommunication components. The Tokyo Higashi Shinkin Bank served as the secretariat for the project. Milestones * May 2009 ‚Äì Yukio Sugino, the president of Sugino Rubber Chemical, drew up the first proposal and brought it to The Tokyo Higashi Shinkin Bank for consultation * February 2010 ‚Äì JAMSTEC advised Sugino that he could develop ‚Äúfree-fall submersible glass balls equipped with a video camera‚Äù * January 2011 ‚Äì The project officially launched * April 2011 ‚Äì Edokko-1 Project Committee organized (4 core firms and 4 support organizations) * August 2011 ‚Äì Engineers from Sony Corporation volunteered to participate in the project * September 2011 ‚Äì Selected as one of the projects for JAMSTEC‚Äôs Special Program to Enhance the Utilization of Projects by Start-up Ventures * January 2012 ‚Äì A joint research agreement signed * March 2012 ‚Äì High-pressure / underwater operation test at JAMSTEC * June 2012 ‚Äì Video recording / operation test at Enoshima Aquarium * October 2012 ‚Äì Dive test completed successfully in Sagami Bay (to a depth of 50 meters) * February 2013 ‚Äì okamoto glass co., Ltd. joined the Project Committee * June 2013 ‚Äì Deepwater images captured successfully with a 3D full hi-vision video camera during the dive test in Sagami Bay * July 2013 ‚Äì A submersible and a control module of new specifications built for an upcoming dive test in the Japan Trench * August 2013 ‚Äì Dive test completed successfully in Sagami Bay (to a depth of 500 meters) * November 2013 ‚Äì Ultra-deepwater dive test completed successfully in the Japan Trench (to a depth of 7,800 meters) Features * Small-sized (easy to operate) * Low-cost * Fully autonomous (without cable) * Wireless communication between glass balls using rubber * Video recording using 3D full hi-vision cameras Structure Edokko Ichigo consists of four glass balls, a frame, a fish bait bar and a ballast weight. The glass balls consist of a communication ball, a transponder ball, a lighting ball and a video recording ball, which are connected vertically in a descending order. Each ball, housed in a protective plastic enclosure, can withstand deep-sea pressures. Among the four glass balls, only the communication ball is connected to the frame via a rope. The other balls are fixed on the 1.5-meter-long metal frame. The fish bait bar and the ballast weight are fixed on the bottom of the frame. Equipped devices A GPS receiver, a satellite phone, a transponder, an LED module, a commercially available 3D Handycam (Sony), a controlling computer, a range of sensors, batteries, a weight-release device and a ballast weight. Missions * Dive 1 meter per second by its own weight and the ballast weight after being released from a mother vessel * Reach the depth of 7,800 meters in about 2 hours * On the seafloor, the fish bait bar automatically unfolds diagonally downward beside the frame * Lighting and 3D video recording are turned on/off by timer * The submersible returns to the surface by jettisoning its ballast weight upon receiving an acoustic command signal from the mother vessel * After surfacing, the submersible measures its location with GPS and signals the location to the mother vessel via the satellite phone (Iridium) Video recording functions The submersible is equipped with a commercially available full high-vision 3D handycam (Sony HDR-TD20V) that is capable of continuous recording for up to nearly 10 hours using an external battery.

A total of three submersibles were released; two were dropped to 7,800 meters and one was dropped to about 4,000 meters. Each of them was raised successfully after 3D full hi-vision recording of deep-sea fish for 5 to 30 hours. Gammaridean and Pseudoliparis belyaevi were filmed at the depth of 7,800 meters, while Macrouridae and Spectrunculus grandis were filmed at the depth of 4,000 meters. This is the first time in history that the images of deep-sea fish at these depths were captured using a 3D video camera.

While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions.

Along with his two brothers, Jack and Joe, he founded the Premier Automotive Supply Company in 1940, which later became one of the world's leading industrial parts and electronic components distributors. His philanthropic activities in Cleveland, and in Jewish and Israeli institutions, were via the Mandel Foundation. Mandel received a bachelor's degree and eleven honorary doctorates. Biography Morton Mandel was born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio. His mother, Rose, along with his older siblings, Meriam Ellen (died June 10, 2010 age 100, nine days before age 101)Meriam Ellen Cole obituary, Jack N. (died May 12, 2011 age 99), and Joseph C.

Morton's father, Simon, had already immigrated from Nowy Sancz, Poland (near Krakow) to the United States in 1913, planning to bring his family once he became established in Ohio. Morton was born 15 months after his mother's immigration, in Cleveland, where his parents ran a dry goods shop. The family then moved several times because they could not afford to pay their monthly rent. Growing up, Mandel shared a room with his two brothers, wore hand-me-downs, and had few financial means. However, despite their economic difficulties, Mandel's mother often gave the little she had to charity. His family continued its Jewish tradition, sending young Mandel to an afternoon Hebrew school.Michael E.

Eventually he became bedridden and his wife became the sole provider for the family, selling clothing out of suitcases on the streets of Cleveland. After graduating from high school, Mandel attended the chemistry program at Adelbert College, but dropped out in his second year to join the automotive parts shop that he and his brothers had purchased from their uncle, Jacob Mandel.PERSISTENCE PAYS, Think - The Magazine of Case Western Reserve University In February 1949, Mandel met Barbara (n√©e Abrams)Philanthropist Morton L.

The book was also published in China and Israel. On May 19, 2013, Mandel received his bachelor's degree from Case Western Reserve University, after completing the academic studies started during his first enrollment, in 1939. He was an active member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Mandel died on October 16, 2019 at his home in Florida. Military service In 1943, Mandel was recruited by the U.S. Army to fight in World War II.Morton L Mandel : Enlistment Record from WW2 A few months after he enlisted, the Army sent him and thousands of others back to school, due to fear of a wartime shortage of engineers. Mandel spent two years as a student for the Army, first at Pomona College in Claremont, California, and later at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1946, once the war was over, Mandel, now a 2nd Lieutenant, was sent back home to Cleveland. During his service in World War II, Mandel was put in charge of transporting fifteen wounded American soldiers from an army hospital in Memphis to another hospital further south. Along the way, the group stopped for lunch. The African American soldiers in the group were refused admission to the restaurant, one in which German prisoners of war were being served. Outraged by this act of racism, Mandel took the group away from the restaurant, where they would have been able to pay with meal vouchers, and bought them sandwiches from a street vendor. Business career In the spring of 1940, Mandel's uncle, Jacob Mandel, decided to leave Cleveland for Chicago, and offered to sell his auto repair shop to Mandel's brother, Jack. Jack gathered his two brothers, Joe, who sold soap, and Morton, who worked in the shop after school, and opened their first business. They spent their $900 savings to buy it and also received a $3,000 loan for inventory from their uncle, Conrad Mandel. On August 1, 1940, they opened Premier Automotive Supply Company, which sold car parts. =Premier Industrial Corporation= In 1945, upon Mandel's return from service, he returned to his family's business with Joe, who had also returned from a job in a war plant, and Jack, who had kept the business running during his brothers' service. Following his return, Mandel acted as general manager of the company and handled the business's management. Originally an auto-parts distributor, Premier Automotive was incorporated as Premier Autoware in 1946. Shortly after, the brothers realized that their parts were also being sold by many other distributors, and that their resulting profit margin was barely enough to live on. After a few months of asking their customers what parts they needed, they formed a list of \\"hard to get\\" parts, and found sources to buy them. They then sold those \\"hard to get\\" parts, and as a result, their sales increased with a large demand and their business began to grow. The brothers also founded their business around the principles of customer service, using such slogans as \\"Killing Yourself for Your Customer\\", \\"Always Trying to Raise the Bar\\", and \\"A Focus on Our People\\".Mandel, pg. xxvi In fulfillment of this goal, they hired an engineer who was responsible for assisting and understanding their customers' needs. Later, they built a customer service department that operated 24-hours, including holidays and weekends, answering and handling clients' needs. An example of this service is when a ride at Walt Disney World broke down on a Saturday and the company had the necessary part shipped within hours that same day.Jon Ostrowsky Mandel continues work to invest in humanities and Jewish education, January 18, 2013, The Brandies Hoot They later acquired an electronic supply division, which led the company to expand its scope and business. In 1955, Mandel hired Bob Warren, who helped transform the company, and in 1972 became its President. In May 1960 the company changed its name to the Premier Industrial Corporation, and Mandel launched its initial public offering, with his brothers retaining 70% of the ownership. Four years later, the company was listed on the NYSE. This allowed the company to acquire more than a dozen industrial and electronic parts companies. The purchase of Newark Electronics, in 1968, significantly expanded the company's reach into the electronic components business. In addition to specializing in the distribution of electronics equipment, maintenance products, and firefighting equipment, Premier Industrial Corporation also marketed a wide range of products including lubricants, welding supplies, and fasteners to its over 100,000 customers around the world. In the late 1960s, Mandel began working in the Cleveland business community, serving as a Director of the Central National Bank of Cleveland and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. until 1979, when he left them to focus on philanthropic activities. As Premier Industrial Corporation grew, Mandel met on a monthly basis with Peter Drucker, who consulted on various matters regarding the company. In the 1970s, the Premier Industrial Corporation began operation in Europe, and by 1977, the firm had opened a corporate research and development center, where the company tailored its products to customers' needs. By 1984, the company had 18 divisions, with electronics constituting half of $465 million in sales, and the company making a net profit of $48 million. It later became one of the largest U.S. distributors of auto parts and electronic components. During his stay at the Palm Beach Country Club, Mandel met Bernard Madoff, and although most of his advisors favored investing in Madoff's fund, Mandel declined because of Madoff's lack of transparency.[ ]New York Social Diary Premier Industrial Corporation earned numerous business awards, including being one of fifty top companies profiled in the 1995 book, Making It in America. In 1996, when Premier Industrial Corporation had 16 different divisions and was worth nearly $3 billion, it merged with the British company Farnell Electronics PLC to form Premier Farnell PLC, one of largest industrial and electronic components supplier in the world. Mandel served as the Deputy Chairman of Premier Farnell until 2002.Hoovers a D&B; company, Premier Farnell plc During Mandel's 36 years as the Chairman of the Premier Industrial Corporation, the company had 34 years which ended in profit growth and in 30 of those years, its net profit after taxes, was more than 10% of its business operations. =Business ventures in Israel= Mandel's first business involvement in Israel occurred in 2003, when Parkwood Corporation, the Mandel Brothers' private investment company, established Israel Equity Limited (IEL). Mandel served as Chairman of this company. IEL is an investment company which aims at contributing to Israel's industrial sector by buying industrial companies and improving their management and business results. IEL has acquired and invested in Tadbik Group, Bikur Rofe, and Phoenicia Glass Works Ltd. These investments in total employ more than 800 workers. Mandel invested in the hi-tech sector. His first such investment was in Medivent, the second hi-tech company in Israel. In 2011, Mandel was one of Pontifax's first investors, which focuses on investing in life science companies. Philanthropy In 1953, the three Mandel brothers founded the Mandel Foundation, which supports many charitable causes. The foundation headquarters are located in Cleveland. In the late 1970s Mandel started devoting more time toward philanthropy in the Cleveland area, serving as: *Case Western Reserve University, Trustee *Cleveland Museum of Art, Trustee *Musical Arts Association (The Cleveland Orchestra), Trustee *Cleveland Tomorrow, Co-Founder and Vice Chairman *Jewish Community Center of Cleveland, President, 1952‚Äì1957 *Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, President, 1974‚Äì1977 *United Way Services, Chairman of the Board, 1979‚Äì1981; President, 1977‚Äì1979 *City of Cleveland Project MOVE (formerly Mayor's Committee on Volunteerism), Founder, 1981 *Park Works (formerly Clean-Land, Ohio), Co-founder and Trustee, 1981‚Äì1997 *MidTown Cleveland, Co-Founder and Chairman, 1982‚Äì1985; Trustee, 1982 *Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations, CWRU, Co-Founder, 1984 In 1973, Mandel co-founded Cleveland's Ten Plus Club, which recruited business leaders who agreed to increase their contribution to $10,000. Mandel and his two brothers also donated more than $1 million to the human services campaign of Cleveland's United Way. In 1988, at a ceremony on the White House lawn, President Ronald Reagan awarded Premier Industrial Corporation the President Award for social initiatives in the private sector. That same year, the Mandel Foundation made a naming gift for what was then the School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. In 2013, the school's social work program which had ranked 9th in the country at the time, was awarded an additional $8 million from the Mandel Foundation. In 1988, the Mandel Foundation, the Cleveland Foundation, the George Gund Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and other local private, public, and philanthropic interests founded Cleveland Neighborhood Progress Inc. Mandel chaired this project. In the early 1990s, Mandel became the financial supporter of the initiatives reflected in the Commission on Jewish Education in North America's 1990 report \\"A Time to Act,\\" which called for strengthening the Jewish education profession and mobilizing community support for Jewish learning. In 1992, Mandel founded the Mandel Leadership Institute in Jerusalem, which trains potential social leaders in various programs, including its Educational Leadership School and the Israel Defense Forces Education Development Program. By 2014, the program had over 400 graduates. In 2002, following on \\"A Time to Act,\\" Mandel founded the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Center for Studies in Jewish Education at Brandeis University, a research center dedicated to improving Jewish education. In 2004, the Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev was established, which works closely with local authorities, non-profits, and social activists to develop local leadership in the region and improve the quality of life for Negev residents. The center also works to create better relationships between the region's Jewish and Bedouin communities. At the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the Mandel Foundation offers a MBA program in social leadership to foster a new group of Israeli leaders who combine a business approach with a commitment to social values. In 2007, Mandel Foundation contributed $22.5 million to establish the Mandel Center for the Humanities at Brandeis University, which focuses on the fields of literature, language, and philosophy. Since 2010, several institutions and buildings have been established by the Mandel Foundation, including the Mandel Building of the Jewish Federation of Cleveland; the Mandel Jewish Community Centers in Cleveland and in Palm Beach Gardens, and the Mandel School for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, adjacent to the university's existing Mandel Institute of Jewish Studies. In 2010, the Mandel Foundation donated $5 million to build the new Jewish Community Center at the Palm Beach Gardens and $12 million to the new Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. In early 2012, the Mandel Foundation donated $5 million to public library of West Palm Beach. Later that year the foundation also gave an $18 million grant to build the new Mandel School for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as well as its annual $2.5 million contribution to support programs there. In 2013, the Mandel Foundation contributed $25 million to build the new Jerusalem campus for the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, in addition to the support it gave to Bezalel's annual exhibition. In June 2013, the Temple-Tifereth Israel received a matching commitment of $16 million from Mandel Foundation for a major expansion and renovation of its Beachwood campus in Ohio. In November 2013, Mandel Foundation announced a $5 million endowment to establish the Be'er- Sheva Children's World Museum and a $1 million grant to the Cleveland Institute of Art for campus modernization and unification. The foundation awarded a $5.25 million gift to Brandeis University to fund a newly endowed faculty chair and to better the curriculum of the Mandel Center for Studies in Jewish Education. In 2014, the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City received a $10 million gift from the Morton and Barbara Mandel Family Foundation. In February 2014, the Mandel Foundation awarded a $13 million grant to establish a new building and new programs for the Mandel Institute for Social Leadership, which be housed on the campus of Ben-Gurion University. In total, Mandel, his wife, and two brothers donated about $1 billion for charitable and cultural causes, of which one third went to Israeli institutions. The Mandel Foundation has been responsible for publishing more than 30 books and monographs.

First announced on 10 March 2014 and introduced in the second quarter of 2015, the discs are intended to be able to withstand changes in temperature and humidity, in addition to dust and water, ensuring that the disc is readable for at least 50 years. The agreement between Sony and Panasonic to jointly develop the next generation optical media standard was first announced on 29 July 2013.  Specifications  The discs are designed to hold 300 gigabytes of data in their first release, then a second version of the discs will hold up to 500 gigabytes, and eventually a third version of the discs will be able to store up to one terabyte of data, based on the roadmap plans of both companies. The Archival Disc standard jointly developed by Sony and Panasonic will utilise signal processing technologies such as narrow track pitch crosstalk cancellation, high linear density inter- symbol interference cancellation and multi-level recording. The disc structure will feature dual sides, with three layers on each side, and a land and groove format. The track pitch is 0.225 Œºm, the data bit length is 79.5 nm, and the standard will utilise the method of Reed-Solomon Code error correction.  Roadmap  Sony has released a roadmap plan to increase Archival Disc capacity from 300GB to 1TB per disc. The 300GB disc was scheduled for release in the summer of 2015, release timescales of the larger discs are currently unknown.  Use  Sony expects the new standard to see usage in the film industry (such as storage of 4K resolution audiovisual data), archival services, and cloud data centres handling big data. The disc format is not intended as a consumer storage medium as of 2014, but is intended by the two companies as a solution for professional-level data archival. In order to reach a larger capacity whilst ensuring higher playback signal quality, the standard will employ crosstalk cancellation and partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) signal processing. Both companies will market the optical format under their respective brands. Sony will be using Archival Disc in within the Optical Disc Archive professional archival product range. Sony's aim is to create at least a 6TB storage medium. Sony (as of 2020) sells 5.5TB Optical Disc Archive Cartridges. An emerging use case for Archival Disc has been projected for cold data storage within the datacenter.

Etymology The name refers to the many islands of the Fergus estuary, such as Canon Island, Deer Island, Inishloe, Feenish and Trummer: the Anglo-Normans approaching from Limerick along these waters perceived the County Clare region as an archipelago and named it \\"the cantred of the isles of Thomond\\", a name still preserved in that of the barony. Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t√∫ath which had submitted to the Crown. Location The barony is bounded by the barony of Inchiquin (to the north), by Bunratty Upper (to the east), by Clonderalaw (to the south) and by Ibrickane (to the west).

Its exterior is mainly Gothic with a Baroque tower while the interior is characterised by its rich Baroque decoration. It holds paintings by Antwerp's leading artists Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens as well as abundant sculpture and church furniture crafted by leading Antwerp sculptors such as Artus Quellinus the Elder, Pieter Verbrugghen I, Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder, Jan Claudius de Cock and Andries Colyns de Nole. Of particular note is the Calvary outside the Church which is made up of 63 life-size statues and nine reliefs executed in a popular and theatrical style.Rudi Mannaerts, Saint Paul's, the Antwerp Dominican church, a revelation, Toerismepastoraal Antwerpen History The St. Paul's Church is located in the old city center of Antwerp, just a few steps from the Scheldt river, in a district where formerly sailors used to live. A small church was built here by the Dominican Order and consecrated in 1276 by Albertus Magnus. The church is named after the patron saint of the Dominicans, St. Paul. As the church had become exposed to flooding as a result of a change in course of the Scheldt river, the Dominican Prior A. van Leent decided to build a new church on a larger and higher-lying piece of land next to the existing church. The construction designs were probably made by Domien de Waghemakere, a co-designer of the Antwerp Cathedral. After his death in 1542 Rombout de Dryvere is known to have continued as the architect and master builder. The church was taken into partial use in 1548 and the following year the old church was demolished. The new church was completed and dedicated in 1571. In the same year, the Our Lady of the Rosary fraternity was founded in the church to celebrate the Battle of Lepanto in which the Spanish fleet defeated the Turks. Work on the new monastery probably also started around this time.De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed, Sint-Pauluskerk en dominicanenklooster (ID: 4648) Interior of the St. Paul‚Äôs Church When the Calvinists came to power in Antwerp in 1578, the Dominicans were expelled, the church and monastery were cleared and the nave of the church was transformed into a Calvinist oratory. The transepts and chancel were partially demolished and part of the monastery was used as a cannon foundry of the army. When in 1584 Farnese laid siege to Antwerp to reclaim it for the Spanish throne, he had a bridge built over the Scheldt to block supply to the city. The defenders of the city tried to send fire ships to ignite the bridge. They used materials from the transepts and choir of St. Paul‚Äôs Church as ballast in these ships. After the fall of Antwerp in 1585, the Dominican Fathers returned and began to rebuild and refurbish the church and the monastery. Detail of a confessional The initial phase of the rebuilding of the monastery was undertaken between 1605 and 1616 and reconstruction was completed in 1662. In 1618 the first stone was laid of a new and enlarged choir and transept. In 1639 the new choir was consecrated by the Bishop of Antwerp. During the following decades, the interior of the church was fitted out with Baroque furniture and decoration. The Antwerp sculptor Pieter Verbrugghen I and his workshop made the oak confessionals between 1658 and 1660.De biechtstoelen van de Sint Pauluskerk Antwerpen on Lukas Art in Flanders The same artist made the oak organ case in the church in 1654 and together with his son Pieter Verbrugghen II he executed the designs for the high altar in 1670.Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Verbrugghen.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 1 March 2014 The high altar was dedicated in 1670 by Mgr. Capello of Antwerp. In 1679 a major fire destroyed part of the vaults of the nave and the upper part of the western facade. The damage was repaired in 1680-81 and at the same time the top of the tower was finished in a Baroque style after a design by Nicolaes Millich. In 1692 the Venerable Chapel was completed. The Calvary was constructed against the south side of the nave between 1697 and 1747. In 1796 all Dominicans monasteries in the Southern Netherlands were closed down on the order of the French occupiers. At this time all the old church records, containing information about the Dominican Order, the church and the convent, were lost. The church was sold publicly and bought by Dominican Prior Peltiers. He was thus able to save the rich contents of the church. In 1802 the church, the Calvary and part of the monastery were taken over by the city council. The church was consecrated the following year as a parish church, replacing the old, dilapidated St. Walburga Church, which was demolished in 1817. During the Ten Days' Campaign undertaken by the Dutch in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, a Dutch garrison bombarded Antwerp. The church was damaged and all the 17th century stained glass windows, made after designs by Abraham van Diepenbeeck, were destroyed. In 1833 the interior of the church was changed: the rood screen dating from 1654, which had been executed by Pieter Verbruggen II and his workshop was dismantled to allow an unobstructed view through the nave to the choir. A new rood screen had previously been built on the western side of the nave. In April 1968 a fire destroyed the entire roof of the church, damaged the vaults and the interior, completely burned down the top of the Baroque tower and reduced three-quarters of the monastery to ruins. The restoration works have taken a long time to complete. The exterior Tympanum sculpture of Our Lady of the Rosary by Jan Claudius de Cock The exterior is mainly executed in the Brabantine Gothic style and is characterized by the austere architecture with little exterior decoration, which is common in churches of mendicant orders. For the interior walls brick was used, while the outer vestments and structural components are in Ledian sandstone. The tower was rebuilt in the late 17th century with a Baroque top. The baroque portal on the angled corner of Veemarkt and Zwartzustersstraat dates from 1734. In the arch above the gate is a tympanum sculpture by Jan Claudius de Cock of 1734 depicting Our Lady of the Rosary giving the rosary to Saint Dominic and Catherine of Siena, the reformer of the Dominican Order. The interior The columns in St. Paul's Church are cylindrical and are topped by a capital with cabbage leaf motif. The interior decoration is a good example of the Flemish Baroque style in painting as well as church furniture. Among the many works of art in the church are works by major artists such as the Antwerp painters Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Cornelis de Vos, Gaspar de Crayer, Frans Francken II, Abraham van Diepenbeeck, Theodoor Boeyermans, Artus de Bruyn, Arnout Vinckenborch and Matthys Voet. =Main altar= Pieter Verbrugghen I and his son Pieter Verbrugghen II created a Baroque marble main altar that was constructed around Rubens‚Äô painting The vision of St. Dominic. The Dominicans ordered in 1670 a new painting on the Martyrdom of St. Paul from Theodoor Boeyermans. This painting and Rubens‚Äô painting were installed in the new main altar and could be shown alternately through a rotating mechanism with hinges. Both paintings were robbed by the French occupiers in 1794 and sent to Paris. In 1811 Napoleon donated the paintings to two regional museums: Rubens' St. Dominic to the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts in Lyon, and Boeyermans‚Äô St. Paul to that of Aix-en- Provence. Despite the agreements of the Congress of Vienna of 1815 neither altarpiece was ever returned by France on the pretext that Napoleon had given them to regional museums. The painting The Descent from the Cross completed by Cornelis Cels in 1807 is now placed in the space occupied by the stolen altarpieces. Saint Paul‚Äôs, the Antwerp Dominican church, a revelation. No convent church without a choir Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, altar by Pieter Verbrugghen I and The Disputation of the Holy Sacrament by Rubens =Sculpture= The St. Paul's Church holds the most impressive array of Baroque confessionals in Belgium. The 10 confessionals, executed around 1659 by Pieter Verbrugghen I with the assistance of his workshop and other sculptors, are divided in groups of five on the side of both aisles. Each confessional is flanked by two statues on either side. The confessionals are not conceived as separate pieces of furniture but are connected by a wooden paneling. The entire wall of each aisle is thus turned into a single united piece of furniture, the iconography of which strives to achieve the same unity and synthesis as the whole structure.Helena Bussers, De baroksculptuur en het barok at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen The sculptors Artus Quellinus the Elder, Pieter Verbrugghen I, Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder and Andries Colyns de Nole created 8 life-size white stone sculptures of Dominican saints between the years 1631 and 1700 which are placed between the windows of the choir. On the south side is the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament and of the Sweet Name Jezus which has an altar sculpted by Pieter Verbrugghen I and an altar piece by Rubens on The Disputation of the Holy Sacrament. This chapel also holds a Baroque confessional by Willem Kerricx that was originally placed on the north side of the main entrance. On the north side is the Maria Chapel with a Baroque altar which was commenced by Huybrecht Van den Eynde, continued by his pupil Sebastiaan de Neve and completed by Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder in 1728. A typical rubensian motif are the dozens of miniature putti and cherubs on the ascending branches of vegetal, Marian symbols on the twisted marble columns. The painting Adoration of the shepherds by Rubens forms the altar piece. The Maria Chapel also contains a white marble sculpture of Our Lady of Sorrows by Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder. The church holds elaborate tomb monuments attributed to Johannes van Mildert, Pieter Verbrugghen II and Andries Colyns de Nole. St. Rosa of Lima, by Artus Quellinus the Younger The 17th century organ is regarded as one of the most important organs of Belgium. The monumental organ case was sculpted by Pieter Verbrugghen I after a design by Erasmus Quellinus II. =The stolen Caravaggio= In 1623, the painting Madonna of the Rosary by Caravaggio arrived in Antwerp probably via the Dutch market. On the initiative of some artists, among whom Peter Paul Rubens, Hendrick van Balen and Jan Brueghel the Elder, the painting was donated as altarpiece to the St. Paul‚Äôs Church. Rubens organized the leading Antwerp painters to make a series of 15 paintings on the theme of the \\"Mystery of the Rosary Cycle\\" to flank the Caravaggio painting.Sirjacobs, Raymond. Antwerpen Sint-Pauluskerk Rubens en de mysteries van de rozenkrans. Antwerp: Sint-Paulusvrienden, 2004 In 1786, Emperor Joseph II of Austria, after ordering the closing of all ‚Äòuseless‚Äô monastic orders, claimed the painting of Caravaggio for his art collection. It can now be admired in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The St. Paul‚Äôs Church replaced the original a few years later with a copy made by Andreas Bernardus de Quertenmont, a director of the Antwerp Academy. Caravaggio 's work, which was a princely gift of Antwerp‚Äôs leading artists and an expression of their deep religious devotion had become the object of looting by the Austrian rulers.Caravaggio en de St.Paulus The Calvary On the outside of the church is a group of statues referred to as the Calvary. It was created on the location of an ancient Dominican cemetery by the brothers van Ketwigh who were Dominican friars. Its design dates from 1697. In 1734 construction of the Calvary was completed but further statues were added up to 1747. It is built as a courtyard and leans on one side against the south aisle of the church and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament. The Calvary, view along the angel path The structure includes 63 life-size statues and nine reliefs executed in a popular and theatrical style. Most statues are of white stone with some made of wood. Some statues are dated or signed. The principal sculptors were Michiel van der Voort the Elder, Alexander van Papenhoven and Jan Claudius de Cock with some statues by the hand of Willem Kerricx and his son Willem Ignatius Kerricx, Jan Pieter van Baurscheit de Elder and anonymous collaborators. The statues are arranged into four groups: the angel path, which ascends to the Holy Sepulchre, the garden of the prophets on the left, the garden of the evangelists on the right and the Calvary itself, which consists of an elevated artificial rock, divided into three terraces, on which statues are placed with Christ on the cross at the top.

The hymn in three stanzas was first published in 1524. For centuries the chorale has been the prominent hymn (Hauptlied) for Pentecost in German-speaking Lutheranism. Johann Sebastian Bach used it in several chorale preludes, cantatas and his motet Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226. The hymn inspired composers from the Renaissance to contemporary to write chorale preludes and vocal compositions. It has been translated, for example by Catherine Winkworth as \\"Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord\\" in 1855, and has appeared in hymnals of various denominations. The artist Hans Holbein the Younger featured the hymn in the painting The Ambassadors.  Text  The first stanza is an anonymous translation of the Latin antiphon for Pentecost \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\" (Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful) from the 11th century. The German version appeared with the current tune in Ebersberg in . The stanza has nine lines, with the irregular meter 7.8.8.8.8.8.8.10.8. It opens with requesting the Holy Spirit to come. An acclamation \\"O Herr\\" (O Lord) begins the central fifth line, and the thoughts culminate in a double Hallelujah in the last line. The Spirit is asked: \\"fill with the goodness of your grace / the heart, spirit and mind of your believers, / kindle in them your ardent love!\\" Martin Luther added two more stanzas. He kept not only the meter and the tune, but also the structure, with acclamations at the beginning of lines 1 and 5, and the final Halleluja. In his stanzas, the group of \\"deiner Gl√§ubigen\\" (your believers) is speaking directly, pronouncing \\"wir\\" and \\"uns\\" (\\"we\\" and \\"us\\"). Luther alludes to several of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to : wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge, fortitude, piety, and fear of the Lord. He also drew on (\\"because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts\\"), (\\"for one is your Master\\"), and (\\"the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities\\"). Martin Luther by , 1521In the second stanza, Luther uses the attributes \\"heiliges Licht, edler Hort\\" (holy light, precious refuge) and words the request \\"protect us from strange doctrines / so that we may never look for any teacher / except Jesus in true belief\\". In the last stanza, the Spirit's \\"ardent love\\" and \\"sweet consolation\\" are named, asking for help \\"always to remain joyful and comforted / in your service\\" and \\"so that we may bravely struggle / through life and death to reach you!\\" The hymn appeared first in 1524 in , (booklet of spiritual song), collected by Johann Walter. The same year it appeared also in Eyn Enchiridion in Erfurt, titled \\"Der gesank Veni sancte spiritus\\". For centuries the chorale has been the prominent hymn (Hauptlied) for Pentecost in German-speaking Lutheranism, the number in the current hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch (EG) is 125. The hymn was translated to Swedish first in 1567, \\"Kom Helge Ande Herre Gudh\\", and has appeared in a 1983 version by Britt G. Hallqvist in ' (The Swedish 1986 hymnal). The song was translated to English by Catherine Winkworth as \\"Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord!\\", published in the first series of Lyra Germanica in 1855, among others. It has been used in different translations, appearing in hymnals of various denominations.  Tune and musical settings  autograph of BWV 651 The anonymous melody, Zahn No. 7445a, is similar to the tune of the hymn \\"Adesto, sancte spiritus\\" by Marchetto di Padua (c. 1270). Early settings were by Heinrich Faber, for five voices, and by Johann Walter, for four voices. The tune, which also exists in a slightly different form from the 1530s (Zahn No. 7445b), was set for several parts by Arnold von Bruck and Samuel Scheidt. Johann Eccard composed a five-part motet. Dieterich Buxtehude wrote a chorale prelude, BuxWV 199. Chorale preludes were also written by Heinrich Scheidemann, , Andreas Nicolaus Vetter, Georg Friedrich Kauffmann, Johann Gottfried Walther and Johann Ludwig Krebs. Johann Sebastian Bach composed two chorale preludes which he made part of his collection Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, Fantasia super Komm, Heiliger Geist, canto fermo in Pedale, BWV 651, and Komm, Heiliger Geist, alio modo a 2 Clav. e Pedale, BWV 652. Bach quoted the tune instrumentally as the cantus firmus in a duet of his first cantata for Pentecost Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172 (1714). He used the first stanza as movement 3 in his cantata for Pentecost Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten, BWV 59 (1723 or 1724), and the third stanza as the closing chorale of his funeral motet addressing the Holy Spirit, Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226 (1729). Other vocal compositions have included two masses on the tune by Georg Philipp Telemann for four parts and basso continuo, and motets by Moritz Hauptmann, , Arnold Mendelssohn (1921), Hans Humpert (1932) and Rudolf Petzold (1957). Max Reger quotes the tune in the Pentecost section of his organ pieces Sieben St√ºcke, Op. 145.

According to Quirk's 2011 book, Re-imagining government: public leadership in challenging times,Quirk, B. 2011, 'Re-imagining government: public leadership in challenging times', published by Palgrave MacMillan, there are three key purposes of government: the necessity of solving community problems, securing welfare and having the legitimacy to determine common good. He argues that this legitimacy comes from discussion between leaders and communities, based on five core ethical principles. These can be paraphrased as treating people according to their own wants and intentions, letting them choose for themselves, empathising with them, helping them if it is possible to do so without wasting that effort, and encouraging them to help each other through reciprocal arrangementsThis summary of Barry Quirk's approach is taken from this assessment of 'Barry Quirk's Compass \\\\- a set of ethical principles he attributes to philosopher Iain King.On page 222 of Quirk, B. 2011, 'Re-imagining government: public leadership in challenging times', published by Palgrave MacMillan, , Barry Quirk explains that his five principles are taken from Iain King's book How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time - see this link to a google books snippet, accessed 2014-03-10.

Consisting of school boys and led by Jacques Lusseyran, the group's activities consisted initially of propaganda; it published a bulletin that agitated against the Nazi occupation and the regime of Vichy France. After the Service du travail obligatoire, the Compulsory Work Service, was installed by the Nazis in February 1943 the group's size increased and it dispersed, in part due to ideological differences, many members joining the larger, militant D√©fense de la France to engage in armed combat. Others continued under the Volontaires name and aided other resistance organizations by sheltering downed Allied pilots. History The group consisted of school boys (from the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand and the Lyc√©e Henri-IV) and university students from Paris. Its main founder was the blind student Jacques Lusseyran, and by the end of May 1941 the group had formed a central committee of eight students: Jean Besni√©e, Jean-Louis Bruch, Pierre Cochery, Jean-Claude Comert, Georges Guillemin, Jacques Lusseyran, Jacques Oudin and Jean Sennelier. Initially the group focused on ideology more than on armed combat, and published its first bulletin in October 1941. Between October 1941 and 1943, the bulletin was published 55 times, in circulations of between 50 and 1000 copies. The bulletin contained news and theoretical articles, with essays on Nazism, democracy, and Marxism; its goal was in the words of Lusseyran, \\"to understand events and explain them.\\" Initially isolated, by 1942 the group had made contact with other resistance groups, and with the help of Maurice Lacroix, a teacher at Louis-le-Grand. It aided in the distribution of the R√©sistance, the clandestine paper edited by Marcel Renet, but the group experienced internal dissent after that paper published a pro-Franco article. Lusseyran was aiming for higher circulation, but others wished to stay true to the group's original anti-P√©tain direction. A compromise was found in the publication of a second paper, Le Tigre, dedicated to Georges Clemenceau, which appeared seven times (between 500 and 2000 copies) until October 1942. =Organizational split= When the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), the Compulsory Work Service, was installed by the Nazis in February 1943 the group's size increased and dispersed, many members joining the larger, militant D√©fense de la France to engage in armed combat. In the meantime Lusseyran had formed an alliance with Philippe Viannay, leader of the D√©fense de la France. This alliance came to a head in February 1943 when he decided the Volontaires should join the larger group while maintaining organizational independence; he soon found the desire for autonomy counterproductive and incorporated the entire group under the D√©fense. Especially Pierre Cochery was dissatisfied and the Volontaires split, with a smaller group led by Cochery focusing on clandestine operations like sabotaging the STO through falsifying census data and sheltering deserters. The Volontaires were now led by Cochery, Jean-Louis Bruch, Andr√© Darrouzet (arrested in August 1943), and Pierre Bigand (replacing Darrouzet), Jean- Claude Comert, and Yves Allain. They published a single issue of another bulletin, Le Quatri√®me R√©publique. The group worked with Lib√©ration-Nord starting in mid-1943, and afterward with Franc-Tireur, and aided the efforts of the Bourgogne group, for example through sheltering allied pilots. Members were arrested and deported, with casualties including Jean Besni√©e, Jean Sennelier, Pierre Bizos and Jacques Oudin (http://jacques-oudin-resistant.fr). Other members included L√©on Delarbre.

The mosque was built by the eponymous Mehmet Bey in 1492/93. Mehmet was a son-in- law of Sultan Bayezid II, having married the princess Seldjuk Hatun. The couple lived in the city in the late 15th century and endowed it with several other buildings, none of which survive. The mosque is built of carefully carved yellow limestone ashlar masonry, except for the domed parts, which are built of brick. It consists of a spacious square central prayer hall, topped by a single dome with a diameter of 14.58 m. Four smaller rooms covered by half-domes are arranged two each on the east and west sides of the central space, while the southern face features a pentagonal portico containing the mihrab. The main entrance is located on the northern wall, topped by the founder's dedicatory inscription and fronted by a portico comprising five arches supported by columns of white marble with exquisitely carved capitals. The central arch is topped by a semi-spherical dome, while the arches on either side are topped by funnel domes. Originally, all the domes of the mosque were roofed in lead, and the interior walls plastered, while travellers report that a beautiful garden surrounded the building. The mosque was famed for its architecture and the beauty of its garden. The Ottoman chronicler Evliya √áelebi noted that: Despite being the oldest and largest of the city's surviving mosques, today the building is derelict and unused. It had ceased to function as a mosque sometime in the late 19th century, when it suffered extensive damage from the flooding of the nearby Agioi Anargyroi stream.

Located north of Concord's central business district near Horseshoe Pond, the complex consists of four brick buildings built between 1892 and 1906 for one of the city's major businesses. The mill complex, now converted to residential and other uses, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Page Belting Company Mills is a complex of four brick connected brick buildings, set on the southern bank of Horseshoe Pond, an oxbow lake of the Merrimack River. The complex is located between the pond and United States Route 202, and just east of Concord's historic early center. The two largest buildings are the belt shop and curry shop, which are respectively three and four stories in height. The belt shop has a four-story tower near the center of its long facade, which acts as the complex's focal point and was originally its main entrance. The other two buildings are a 1-1/2 story office building, and a single-story boiler house. The Page Belting Company was established in 1877, and continues to be a major local business even after moving from these premises in 1994. It produced leather strapping for use in the transmission of power within factories through line shafts. At its height, the company complex was the largest in the city. The construction of these surviving buildings was the result of a project to replace all of the company's earlier wood frame buildings.

Plot In Nazi Germany during World War II, David March (Robert Goulet) is an American traitor who has been given wide access to travel as he wishes within Germany. Unbeknownst to the Germans, March is actually an American spy, the last remaining from a spy ring, known as Blue Light. As time goes on, he has been able to work his way higher and higher within the Nazi intelligence apparatus, however he is suspected by a Nazi Gestapo officer, Captain Elm (Werner Peters). Along the way, he meets Susanne Duchard (Christine Car√®re), a French agent, who he has a romantic interlude with, and persuades her to help him. Elm fosters a plan to expose March by taking him to Spain to meet with a British scientist, Guy Spauling (Donald Harron), who wants to defect to Germany. Elm knows that Spauling is a British agent. Spauling asks March to kill him, in order to validate March's standing with the Gestapo, but March instead uses the opportunity to frame Elm as the Blue Light agent, and kills him. March's goal becomes the destruction of secret Nazi weapons factory, which produces missiles for U-boats. He has romantic interludes with a German scientist, Gretchen Hoffmann (Eva Pflug), working at the missile factory, convincing her to assist in his plans to blow up the facility.

Her 2014 book Toxic Communities has been hailed as a \\"standard-bearer\\" for environmental justice scholarship. Her book, The Rise of the American Conservation Movement is a \\"sweeping social history\\" that challenges narrative of environmental history and inspires readers to \\"reconsider nearly everything\\". Early life and education Taylor was born and raised in rural Jamaica. She earned a bachelor's of arts in Geography and Biology (with honors) from Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago in 1983. She obtained a master's of forest science from Yale University in 1985. She followed with a master's of art and a master's of philosophy in 1987. She received a combined doctoral degree in sociology and forestry & environmental studies at Yale University in 1991. She was the first African American woman to earn a doctoral degree from F&ES.; Academic career Taylor received a National Science Foundation Minority Post-doctoral Fellowship in 1991 to study ethnic minority environmental activism in Britain. She affiliated with the University College of London's Department of Geography while she conducted her research. In 1992 she obtained a Ford Foundation/Rockefeller Foundation Poverty and the Underclass Post-doctoral Fellowship at the University of Michigan. The appointment was jointly held between the Ford School of Public Policy and the School of Social Work. In 2010, she won the Allan Schnaiberg Outstanding Publication Award for the book, Environment and the People in American Cities, 1600s-1900s: Disorder, Inequality, and Social Change (Duke University Press, 2009). Taylor was the chair of the Environment and Technology Section of the American Sociological Association from 2012-2013. In 2012 Taylor became the principal investigator of a five-year United States Department of Agriculture grant to study racial and class disparities in food access in the state of Michigan. In 2014, she was celebrated by the city of San Francisco as one of 29 black environmentalists who have made ‚Äúreal and lasting change‚Äù. In 2015, Taylor became the James E. Crowfoot Collegiate Professor of Environmental Justice and the Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). In 2018, she was celebrated by a wide range of the world's most prominent environmental organizations. She was awarded the Women in Conservation Rachel Carson Award from the National Audubon Society, the Freudenburg Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association of Environmental Science and Studies, the National Science Foundation's Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics & Engineering, Mentoring (PAESMEM), the University of Michigan Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, and the President's Award from the Detroit Audubon Society.  Work on diversity in environmental organizations  Taylor's work on racial exclusion in the environmental movement began in 1989, with her article \\"Blacks and the Environment: Toward an Explanation of the Concern and Action Gap between Blacks and Whites\\", and she authored numerous articles on the subject in the early 1990s. In 2014, Taylor authored a groundbreaking report on diversity in environmental organizations. The report's findings, that environmental organizations were failing to represent the diverse American population in their leadership, aroused a firestorm of controversy. The report was commissioned by the Green 2.0 diversity initiative, which continues to track diversity data for the 40 largest environmental organization. To expand on this work, in 2018, Taylor published an updated report that examined the status of diversity in over 2,000 American environmental nonprofits and the extent to which they report their demographic characteristics and diversity activities on the GuideStar reporting system. In the Fall of 2019, Taylor will publish new research on the lack of diversity reporting in environmental organizations, as discussed in a preview of the report released this summer. = Minority Environmental Leadership Development Initiative (MELDI) = With funding from the Joyce Foundation, Taylor founded the Multicultural Environmental Leadership Development Initiative (MELDI) in 2003. In 2005 she organized a national conference and in 2007 an international one for the purpose of assessing the status of diversity in the environmental field and to plan for enhancing diversity in the future. Several papers presented at the 2007 conference were published in the book, Environment and Social Justice: An International Perspective. Taylor also conducted four studies of diversity, funded by the Joyce Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the National Science Foundation, and published in BioScience, Journal of Environmental Education, Research in Social Problems and Public Policy, and Environmental Practice. = Environmental Fellows Program (EFP) = In 2015, Taylor launched the Environmental Fellows Program (EFP) in partnership with the Environmental Grantmakers Association. The Environmental Fellows Program (EFP) is a national program that seeks to diversify the environmental and conservation philanthropic field through 12-week paid summer internships for graduate students at partner foundations and nonprofit organizations. Funders of the program include C.S. Mott, Island Foundation, New York Community Trust, Pisces Foundation, and more. The program aims to reduce barriers to entry for mid-level and senior-level jobs in environmental organizations and foundations for professionals from underrepresented backgrounds by connecting them to mentors and giving them experience in the field. = Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program (DDCSP UM) = Also in 2015, Taylor began the University of Michigan branch of the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program (DDCSP), funded by the Doris Duke Foundation. This program is a 2-summer internship aimed at diversifying the conservation sector by giving opportunities to students from underrepresented backgrounds in the field and those committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through this experience, approximately 20 undergraduates gain experience each summer through one summer of lab research at the University of Michigan and an additional summer of an internship with environmental groups. = Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Conferences = In 2018, the New Horizons in Conservation Conference #NewHorizons19 - spearheaded by Taylor - took place in Washington, DC. More than 200 students, faculty, Environmental Program and Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program alumni, and conservation professionals‚Äîthe majority of them people of color‚Äîgathered to \\"celebrate and assess\\" diversity, equity, and inclusion in the environmental sector, marking a milestone in conservation history. \\"The students and young professionals who attended this conference represent the future of conservation,\\" Taylor said of the conference, \\"They are multicultural, multi- faceted, and talented, and they are poised to take on leadership roles in this sector. Diversity benefits us all, and there is strength in it.\\" Programming included an extensive speaker series, community building, and career and academic development for program alumni. The New Horizons in Conservation Conference is now an annual gathering for people who are from underrepresented backgrounds in the conservation field and those who are committed to the principals diversity, equity, and inclusion. The event draws attendees from across the nation, in varying professions and career stages, including but not limited to undergraduate and graduate students, academics, environmental professionals, policy advocates, and elected officials. New Horizons also works to bolster the critical pipelines built by diversity pathway programs across the nation by providing spaces for participants to connect with peers, network, engage in hands-on professional development workshops and training, attend local field trips, and hear from a diverse range of leaders and visionaries in the field. The second annual New Horizons in Conservation Conference to took place in Chicago, Illinois in April 2019 and the third annual conference is planned to take place in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in April 2020.  Work on environmental justice  Taylor's award-winning book, The Environment and the People in American Cities (Duke University Press, 2009), focused on the environmental challenges American cities faced in the 17th through 20th centuries. She documented the race, class, and gender dynamics that arose as urban dwellers tried to deal with environmental problems. The book also demonstrated that from the outset environmental inequalities arose in American cities and were perpetuated in deliberate and unintentional ways. An \\"ambitious\\" and 'impressive\\" work covering 500 years of history, The Environment and the People in American Cities is the first of three books, while the second of the series, The Rise of the American Conservation Movement (Duke University Press), was released in 2016. In it, she examines the emergence and rise of the American conservation movement from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, demonstrating how race, class, and gender influenced every aspect of the movement from the establishment of parks to outdoor recreation and forest conservation; and the movement's links to nineteenth century ideologies. \\"Far-ranging,\\" \\"nuanced,\\" and \\"comprehensive,\\" one scholar suggested that The Rise of the American Conservation Movement documents the movement in ways that will inspire readers to reconsider what they have been previously taught about environmental history. Taylor's second book and third piece of her series, Toxic Communities: Environmental Racism, Industrial Pollution, and Residential Mobility (New York University Press, 2014) chronicles the contamination of minority and low income communities in the U.S. It examines seven different theories that have been used to explain why racial minorities and the poor are often found living adjacent to toxic facilities or undesirable land uses, and particularly challenges the assumption that minority communities have the requisite mobility to move away from such facilities. Grounded in practical examples, the book documents how the history of racially discriminatory housing policies has effectively forced minorities into proximity with polluting industries. The book incorporates insights from sociology and the study of urban development that had previously been ignored in environmental justice scholarship. One scholar suggested that, in view of Taylor's comprehensive treatment of the early history of the American environmental justice movement, her book should be \\"the last\\" to review that history in such detail, as future writers could simply refer parenthetically to her work.  Work on food insecurity  In a project running from 2012 to 2018, Taylor collaborated with researchers from Grand Valley State University, Michigan State University, University of Michigan- Flint, Lake Superior State University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to work on a project that examines food insecurity in Michigan. A website known as Food Access in Michigan or FAIM, launched in August 2018. The study examines the relationship between demographic characteristics and the distribution of food outlets in 18 small and medium-sized cities in the state. It also examines effective nutrition and behavioral interventions, and mechanisms for enhancing access to food and participation in local food initiatives. These issues are being studied in Sault Ste. Marie, Brimley/ Bay Mills, and St. Ignace - towns in the Upper Peninsula; Holland, Muskegon, Benton Harbor, and Grand Rapids in the west; Flint, Saginaw, Lansing, and Kalamazoo in the central part; and Ypsilanti, Taylor, Southfield, Warren, Pontiac, Inkster, and Dearborn in the southeast. These cities have large populations of one or more of the following racial and ethnic groups: Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and Arabs.

Built in 1860, it is an early example of Renaissance Revival mill architecture, and was a major force in the growth of Suncook as an economic center. The mill building, now converted to residences, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Pembroke Mill is located near the center of the village of Suncook, on a parcel bounded by Main Street, Front Street, and the Suncook River. It is a large rectangular brick building, four stories in height. The most prominent feature of the building is its tower, a five-story campanile with narrow arched windows and wider arched doors on the lower levels, above which is an elaborate corbel table and a slate skirt. These are topped by the fifth level, which has single arched windows on each face, above which are a series of recessed arches in a flared corbelling that support the pyramidal slate roof. The building's many windows are set in segmented-arch openings with soldier brick headers. The site where the mill was built has an industrial history beginning in the 18th century, when saw- and gristmills were established on the falls of the Suncook River. The Suncook Manufacturing Company was organized in 1860, buying up land and water rights on both sides of the river. The Pembroke Mill was its first building, completed the same year. The company also built mills upstream (the Webster Mill, since demolished), and downstream (the China Mill on the other side of the river, still standing). The population of Suncook tripled in the decade following construction of the mill, and the architecture of the village's downtown is reflective of the mill's.

His work ranges from small, organic objects to large-scale interactive light installations. Early life Girardoni grew up in a village just outside Vienna and migrated with his family to California in 1982 at the age of fourteen. Between 1985 and 1989 he earned a BA majoring in both History and Art at Bowdoin College in the Maine. During his training at Bowdoin, Girardoni was also a guest artist at the MIT Media Lab. Work =Exhibitions= Light Reactive Organic Sculpture Girardoni began working in two dimensions, eventually moving into the third dimension. His works are an inspiration from hot wax painting previously practiced by Brice Marden and Jasper Johns. He uses a system of formal oppositions. His inaugural exhibition was held in New York in 1991 after his work was noticed by art curator Friedhelm Mennekes, In 2005, he participated in the Personal Structures at Ludwig Museum, Germany. He also exhibited at the Origins exhibition sponsored by the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, New York. Refrequenced sculpture In 2009, Girardoni presented 7 Minutes 20 Seconds, an installation at the Austrian Cultural Forum‚Äô New York exhibition Creative Migration. In 2011, he participated at the 54th Venice Biennale featuring The (Dis)appearance of Everything, an interactive multi- media installation that converts light to sound. The 2013 exhibition titled Off and On at Nye & Brown in Los Angeles, CA, Girardoni featured two interactive installations that transformed light and sound through sensors and Spectro-Sonic refrequencing sound devices that coordinated by an algorithm that converted light waves into sound waves, thereby making light audible. Girardoni‚Äôs 2018 survey exhibition at Levy Gorvy London, titled Sensing Singularity features his work called Metaspace V3, a software-driven installation that evolved with the participants movements. Inside the pod, visitors experienced a borderless space filled with colour, that cycled through the spectrum at different speeds, converting light into ambient sound through sensors in the ceiling; outside the pod a pixelated surveillance video projected the synced colour changes onto the gallery wall. =Other notable work= The Infinite Room is a large-scale, site specific sculpture in Washington State. Spectral Bridge is an in-situ sculpture integral to the architecture of Spectral Bridge House in Venice, CA. A book on his work entitled Johannes Girardoni was released in 2007 while his work has also been feature in the 2005 book Personal Structures. In 2011, he exhibited his minimal work and photographs of billboards, overlaid with obscuring shapes, at the PDX Contemporary Art in Portland, Oregon. In his exhibits, he used a tension between concave and convex angles to create optical illusions, as well as other directional tips to trigger the peripheral vision of the viewer. He has also exhibited at the Tomlinson Kong Contemporary in New York City. =Collections= Collections that include pieces by Girardoni are in Fogg Museum at Harvard University, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, and the Progressive Art Collection in Cleveland, Ohio. Awards In 2019, he received the Francis J. Greenburger Award for artists whom the art world knows to be of extraordinary merit but who have not been fully recognized by the public. Reception According to Klara Stima of Art Magazine, \\"his early impressions were influenced by the Hungarian landscape\\". In a 2011 interview, Professor of Art A. LeRoy Greason at Bowdoin spoke of the arc of Girardoni's career that, \\"it has grown from sculptural wall objects ... to multi-media installations that incorporate sound and light, painting over large-format photos.\\" In 2004, Tracey Hummer of Art in America magazine noted that Girardoni's work has created of \\"straightforward contrast of materials: the fabricated and the found\\". In 2006 Lodermeyer described Girardoni's work as \\"virtually the opposite of minimalism\\". Grace Glueck of the New York Times described a 2003 exhibition of his as \\"Minimalist slabs of smooth wax in rich monochromes, contrastingly placed in settings of no-color weathered wood or raw metal\\". The billboard side of the exhibit was described by Lisa Radon of Art Ltd Magazine as images \\"layered with digitally created double exposures ... overlaid with screened-back blocks of color and painted forms that echo those of the billboard's outlines, transforming oddball roadside photos into architectural studies in form.\\" References External links * Artist's Homepage Category:Living people Category:Austrian sculptors Category:Austrian male sculptors Category:Bowdoin College alumni Category:Austrian emigrants to the United States Category:1967 births ","title":"Johannes Girardoni"},{"id":"42165441","text":"Springville is an unincorporated community in Pontotoc County, Mississippi.

Built in 1852, it was a significant local example of Second Empire architecture, and was one of two surviving Concord homes of President Franklin Pierce at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Both Pierce and his wife Jane died in this house. It was destroyed by fire on September 17, 1981. Description and history The Franklin Pierce House stood south of downtown Concord, on the west side of South Main Street between Concord and Thorndike Streets, in a row of similar Italianate/Second Empire houses. It was three stories in height, its third floor under a mansard roof. It was built of brick, but its exterior had been stuccoed and scored to give the appearance of brownstone. The steep slope of the mansard roof had dormers with segmented- arch tops and pilastered sides. The main facade was three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a portico with fluted square posts and a bracketed eave. The building was constructed in 1852, and was originally built with Italianate styling and a flat roof. It was restyled later in the 19th century in the Second Empire style, adding the mansard roof. The house was most notable, however, for its association with United States President Franklin Pierce, who lived here with his family (as boarders of the owner, Willard Williams) intermittently after his departure from the White House. Writer Nathaniel Hawthorne visited the Pierces here in 1864, shortly before his death, and both Pierce and his wife Jane died in this house.

Publisher:Ordnance Survey; B2 edition (17 Mar 2008). The station has been based in Yarmouth's harbour since 1924. Previously the station had been in Totland Bay, west of Yarmouth, until it was decided that the station need a motor lifeboat. The current Severn-class lifeboat is moored afloat and shore facilities are on the quayside in Yarmouth. The station covers the western Solent with its all-weather lifeboat Eric and Susan Hiscock (Wanderer) (ON-1249) which has been on service at Yarmouth since 2001.  Eric and Susan Hiscock (Wanderer)  Eric and Susan Hiscock (Wanderer) has a top speed of and a range of . She is operated by a crew of six and is fitted with the latest in navigation, location and communication equipment including electronic chart plotter, VHF radio with direction finder, radar and global positioning systems (GPS). The lifeboat has a displacement of and carries a daughter Y-class which is launched and recovered by crane. Having the Y-class enables the crew to make rescues close to shore.  Station history  = Totland Bay = The first established station to cover the western Solent dates from 1879 and was located west of Yarmouth in Totland Bay. To fund this service money was raised by the local Isle of Wight Sunday Schools Committee. The first lifeboat was Dove, manned by local volunteers. In the first five years of the service the lifeboat and her crew proved to be a great success and over that period the lives of 36 people were saved when they were brought ashore. The record of this first lifeboat convinced the RNLI of the need and viability of formalising a service on this part of the Isle of Wight. In 1884 funds were made available to build a lifeboat house and a new lifeboat was sent to the station. This lifeboat was called Charles Luckombe and she was a self-righting pulling lifeboat powered by 12 oars. She was in length and beam. She began service at Totland bay in 1885For Those in Peril ‚Äì The Lifeboat Service of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Station by Station. Author: Leach, Nicholas. Publisher: Silver Link Publishing Ltd, First Issue 1999. Work:Part 2, South Coast of England ‚Äì Eastbourne to Weston-super-Mare, Page 79, Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. Charles Luckombe was replaced in 1903 by Robert Fleming, funded in part by a memorial bequest of ¬£1,000 made to the RNLI. The lifeboat was launched by Emily Seely, wife of John Edward Bernard Seely, the local Member of Parliament. = Relocation to Yarmouth = In 1924 the RNLI decided that lifeboat cover for the western end of the Solent would be better served by a motor lifeboat. The Totland boathouse was closed and the station was moved to Yarmouth harbour, with service buildings onshore and the boats kept in the harbour. = Motor Lifeboat = The first motor lifeboat at the new Yarmouth location was the Watson-class B.A.S.P. (ON-687). The lifeboat, built by J. Samuel White, was also equipped with sails in case of engine failure. The lifeboat was named by His Royal Highness Edward the Prince of Wales. She was named B.A.S.P. after the donors, Blackburn, Armstrong, Smart and Price. During her ten years of service at the station, B.A.S.P. undertook 42 operations which saved 30 lives. After service at several other stations and in the Relief Fleet, she was sold in 1955. B.A.S.P. is now on display at as part of the Historic Lifeboat Collection at the maritime museum in Chatham. B.A.S.P. is entered in the National Historic Ships register and has the Certificate No: 1687. = Inshore Lifeboat = In July 1964 the station established an inshore lifeboat service but this was permanently withdrawn in October 1978. = Improvements = In 1988 the Institute made improvements to the onshore facilities for the station. They provided a kitchen, toilets and washrooms within the existing boatstore. In 1994 the RNLI purchased the Yarmouth Customs House on the quayside in Quay Street and began alterations to the building. This work included creating crew changing rooms, workshop, toilet and showers, and an RNLI souvenir and retail outlet on the ground floor. An office, training room, and crew facilities were built on the first floor. In 2000 work was carried out in the harbour to improve the lifeboat berth.  Notable rescues  = Al Kwather 1 = On 28 October 1989 the Arun- class Margaret Russell Fraser (ON-1108) relief lifeboat was launched to service from Yarmouth with Coxswain David Kennett at the helm. The weather in the Solent was poor with a south westerly severe gale force 9 blowing. The RoRo cargo vessel Al Kwather 1 was reported to be in difficulties three and a half miles east of Peveril Point near Swanage. Some of the ship's cargo of cars had broken loose on the deck. The Swanage Rother-class lifeboat Horace Clarkson (ON-1047) had been on the scene since 11.30 am and in hurricane force winds was standing by the vessel. at 3.10 pm the Margaret Russell Fraser arrived on the scene and took up a position astern of the Al Kwather 1 whilst the Swanage lifeboat returned to its station. The Al Kwather 1 appeared to be in no danger and so after an hour the Yarmouth boat also made for Swanage to allow the crew to get some rest and do initiate some minor repairs to the boat. Just after midnight the captain of the Al Kwather 1 reported that his vessel had problems with its engines and requested help. Both lifeboats left Swanage with the Margaret Russell Fraser arriving first to find the ship in complete darkness and listing to port and rolling violently, broadside to the seas. The lifeboat used her searchlights approached the ship from the stern and with great skill, and a great deal of danger, manoeuvred alongside the ship and rescued two of the crew who were hanging on to a cargo net they had clambered down. This proved to be very dangerous and one of the crew men rescued had fallen from the net. His foot had caught in the net and hanging below the deck of the lifeboat, the crew had managed to haul him to safety. News arrived that a helicopter was en route and it was used to rescue the remaining crewman from the ship. The lifeboats then returned to their stations.

It is also one of the city's largest office buildings, and a fine example of Romanesque Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The former Maine Central Railroad General Office Building is located on the west side of the Portland peninsula, below the Western Promenade between Saint John Street to the east and the railroad tracks to the west. It was located adjacent to Portland's Union Station, which was demolished in 1961. The office building is a large E-shaped three story masonry building, presenting the legs of the E toward Saint John Street and its spine to the railroad tracks. Due to the sloping lot, the track side of the building presents four stories. The street- facing front ends of the building are essentially the same, each with round- arched entrances at the center, flanked by projecting round bays that are two stories in height. A modillioned granite belt course separates the second and third floors, with the third floor having eight sash windows grouped 3-2-3. The building is capped by a hip roof, with dormers at the ends of the E legs as well as along the street-facing sides of the connecting sections, which are seven bays in width. Southern end of the building, 2018 The Maine Central Railroad Company was chartered in 1856 and began operations in 1862, combining the operations of several smaller railroads, Over the next half-century the company grew significantly, through expansion and acquisition. This building was its second headquarters. The oldest portion, the lower two stories of one of the E's legs, was built in 1889 to a design by the Boston architectural firm Bradlee, Winslow & Wetherill. The same firm had also recently designed Union Station, and was retained for each of the building's enlargements. In 1892 it was extended to the rear, and in 1898 the third floor was added. In 1906 a connector and second leg were built, giving the building a U shape, and it achieved its present form in 1916 with the addition of the third leg.

The sequel to Costume Quest (2010), Costume Quest 2 allows players to assume the identity of one of the two twin siblings, Wren or Reynold. Together with their friends, the group travels through the various in-game environments collecting candy and various costumes, in an attempt to thwart the plans of Dr. Orel White, who wishes to see Halloween banished forever. The game has an improved battle system and a time travel-based plotline. The downloadable-only title has been released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U. Gameplay Costume Quest 2 is a role-playing video game in which the player assumes the role of one of two twin siblings: Wren and Reynold. The game follows the player character, their sibling, and certain ally party members found along their travels as they journey through time in an effort to stop a dentist named Dr. Orel White from destroying Halloween. The player can access both the past and the future, where the past is before the foundation of the children's hometown, and the future takes place in a dental dystopia. As in Costume Quest, the gameplay mostly involves exploring the environment, completing quests, trick-or-treating, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat as gigantic versions of their costumed selves. The game introduces many new combat mechanics not found in the original Costume Quest, such as counters and double attacks. Plot Costume Quest 2 picks up where the DLC expansion of Costume Quest, \\"Grubbins on Ice\\", left off; Everett, Lucy, Wren, and Reynold are trapped inside a nexus of portals with no clear way out. They decide to jump into one of the portals, which prompts the player to choose which of the two siblings, Wren and Reynold, they wish to play as. After jumping in the portal, the kids return to Halloween night. There, they find their dentist, Dr. Orel White, speaking with a time wizard, who opens a portal to the past that Orel jumps into. As the wizard disappears, Wren and Reynold are confronted by a man hiding in a bush who opens another portal which leads to a future where Halloween has been outlawed and Orel rules a dental dystopia. The man, who reveals himself to be an older Everett, along with his wife Lucy, task the kids with travelling to the past to reclaim a talisman with the ability to open a gateway to the monster world before Orel himself can steal it. In the past, they encounter a younger Orel White who stalls their progress, however they eventually locate the talisman, but are unable to prevent future Orel from stealing it. They return the future having failed their mission, where they are captured and sent to a school, where they find Everett and Lucy's daughter Hailey and must break out and confront Orel directly. While in the future, the kids eventually encounter a retinal scanner which requires Orel to access. Travelling back to the past, the kids gain Orel as an ally, who, in the final battle against future Orel, denounces the actions of his future self and takes part in defeating him. Having changed the heart of younger Orel, the kids return to their present where Dr. White is now no longer evil. Reception Costume Quest 2 received positive scores from reviewers, who stated that the game's new methods and abilities added more charm to the game than the original. In their review, IGN stated, \\"Costume Quest 2's combat and story are both surprisingly good for an RPG that concludes in roughly a half-dozen hours. Navigation is iffy, and the healing system is a bit broken even after a major revision, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty.\\" In 2014, Nintendo contacted Double Fine Productions, and were able to get the game released on the Nintendo Wii U. They are now working together once again to try to get the game released through the Nintendo eShop, so consumers who own a 3DS will have a chance to play the game as well.

Violence against women in Pakistan is part of an issue that faces the entire region the country is situated in. Women in Pakistan mainly encounter violence by being forced into marriage, through workplace sexual harassment, domestic violence and by honour killings. A survey carried out by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked Pakistan as the sixth most dangerous country in the world for women.The world's most dangerous countries for women (2018). Thompson Reuters Foundation. Retrieved March 14th, 2020  History  According to Dr. Rukhsana Iftikhar and Dr. Maqbool Ahmad Awan in the Journal of Political Studies, \\"Pakistan is an agrarian state where the concept of personal ownership is very much common\\", with the two writing \\"Women are also considered personal properties in Pakistan\\". The two state that such violence persists due to religious and cultural norms within the country. Pakistani women are expected to maintain modesty while men are expected to project masculinity to keep honour among their families. Traditional views in Pakistan believe that if dishonour is not corrected, it may spread beyond singular incident and into the community.  Acts of violence  = Domestic violence = In a 2008 survey, 70% of women respondents reported that they experienced domestic violence. According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch report, 70-90% of Pakistani women suffered with some kind of domestic violence. About 5,000 women are killed annually from domestic violence in Pakistan, with thousands of other women maimed or disabled. Law enforcement authorities do not view domestic violence as a crime and usually refuse to register any cases brought to them. In the 2012-2013 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, 3,867 married or previously married women were questioned. Of the respondents, 47% of these women believed that physical violence was just if a wife had argued with her husband. The survey found that such beliefs on domestic violence were often passed down to future generations of children. Marital rape is also a common form of spousal abuse as it is not considered to be a crime under the Zina laws. A study by the United Nations found that 50% of married Pakistani women have experienced sexual violence and 90% have been psychologically abused. =Forced conversion of minority girls= In Pakistan, Hindu and Christian girls are kidnapped, raped, forcibly converted to Islam and forced to marry Muslim men. About 1,000 non-muslim girls are forcibly converted to Islam in Pakistan every year.

As of 2019, thousands of honour killings occurred annually in Pakistan. = Rape and sexual violence = The topic of sex is a taboo subject in Pakistan, therefore women often refrain from reporting their experiences with rape. According to a study carried out by Human Rights Watch there is a rape once every two hours and a gang rape every hour. Women's Studies professor Shahla Haeri stated that rape in Pakistan is \\"often institutionalized and has the tacit and at times the explicit approval of the state\\". According to lawyer Asma Jahangir, who was a co-founder of the women's rights group Women's Action Forum, up to seventy-two percent of women in custody in Pakistan are physically or sexually abused. = Transgender women = In 2020, a transgender woman named Gul Panra was shot dead in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. This is the latest case of attacked on the LGBT community in the county. Along with her, a friend of Gul's were also injured, but escaped death. Gul was a Pashto singer in her professional life. Since 2015, it is reported that 68 transgendered people were murdered in Pakistan. However, a total of 479 transgendered people were attacked since 2018 in the Pakistani provence of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa alone. But, these figures may not include the actual figure, as recording of anti-trans violence is poor.https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/712365-transgender-woman-gul-panra- shot-dead-friend-wounded-in-peshawar Law The majority of women who are victims of violence have no legal recourse within Pakistan. = Existing laws = Article 25 of the 1973 Pakistani constitution states: \\"All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex.

The framework provides recommendations, guidelines, tools, and trainings to protect emergency responders during each phase of an emergency response, including pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment phases. ERHMS was designed to function within the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) National Incident Management System (NIMS), a systematic approach to emergency management. The ERHMS trainings satisfy Public Health Emergency Preparedness capability 14, \\"Responder Safety and Health.\\" The guidelines and recommendations address the medical screening, training, rostering, surveillance and health monitoring of emergency responders. The framework includes different backgrounds such as emergency management, fire service, law enforcement, emergency medical services, public health, mental health, disaster relief, and volunteer organizations, as well as construction and other skilled support who may be participating in a broad range of activities including assessment, search and rescue, investigation, recovery, cleanup and restoration. This framework is designed for different types of events, independently of its magnitude, some events may include terrorist attacks, chemical spills, and natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.  Background and purpose  After the health effects among emergency responders to the September 11, 2001 attacks at the World Trade Center became apparent, public health and government officials began to call for improved emergency worker health monitoring and surveillance in the event of future disasters. A 2004 joint report from RAND Corporation and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) entitled ‚ÄúProtecting Emergency Responders, Volume 3‚Äù called for enhanced protection of emergency workers in future emergency events and described several areas of improvement. Testimony from RAND in 2007 declared that there had been insufficient protection of 9/11 recovery workers and that future disasters should have an incident safety management structure in place that can make safety decisions and has the equipment, capabilities, and authority needed to implement and enforce them effectively. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report entitled, ‚ÄúSeptember 11: HHS Needs to Develop a Plan That Incorporates Lessons from the Responder Health Programs.‚Äù This report called for a ‚Äúplan for responder screening and monitoring services that defines the roles of HHS components and incorporates the lessons from the WTC health programs.‚Äù The report named five lessons learned, including registering all responders, implementing robust physical and mental health screening and monitoring, providing treatment referral services, and ensuring that all responders, regardless of employment status or location, could access the same screening and monitoring programs and services. In 2008, NIOSH coordinated a multi-agency effort to begin drafting the ERHMS framework. = Influence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response = See also: Deepwater Horizon oil spill response In 2010, while the ERHMS framework was still in development, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill took place. NIOSH and the Unified Area Command (UAC), implemented some of the initial ERHMS guidelines, including deployment- phase rostering, injury and illness surveillance, assessment of and protection from chemical and environmental exposures, as well as prompt and accessible communication with workers and their communities. Difficulties encountered in the spill response led NIOSH researchers to make recommendations that were then implemented in the evolving ERHMS framework. These recommendations included improving the rostering process both in the pre-deployment and deployment phases to ensure registration of all workers involved and better communication and transmission of guidance about environmental risks. Additional recommendations for the deployment phase included increased personal protective equipment (PPE) use, better management of heat stress, and improved reporting of exposures, illnesses, and injuries. NIOSH also recommended the creation of a decision matrix to determine the need for biological monitoring of workers. These recommendations were addressed in the finalized ERHMS documents.  Brief summary of guidelines  ERHMS framework phases = Pre-deployment phase = On the pre-deployment phase the ERHMS framework makes an emphasis on preparedness and establishes the foundations for monitoring and surveillance of responders. Pre-deployment focuses on key activities including rostering and credentialing of emergency response and recovery workers, health screening and immunizations, health and safety training and data managing and information security. = Deployment phase = During deployment, ERHMS guidelines recommend additional as-needed on-site rostering and on-site safety training. The deployment phase focuses on key activities such as on-site responder in-processing, health monitoring and surveillance, exposure assessment activities and controls, and communication of exposure and health data. Further, ERHMS recommends the implementation of a Health and Safety Plan (HASP), which monitors and documents worker activities and use of personal protective equipment, assesses any potential exposures, and surveys responder illness and injury, both physical and mental, throughout the duration of the response. In addition, the guidelines provide recommendations on how to conduct all of these activities and also how to communicate environmental exposures to workers in real time. = Post- deployment phase = ERHMS post-deployment guidelines focus on out-processing assessment, determination of need for health tracking and after action reporting. The guidelines recommend conducting exit interviews or surveys to capture and analyze exposures in order to determine the need for long-term monitoring of emergency responder health, or to identify subsets of responders who would benefit from future health monitoring. In addition, the guidelines recommend long-term follow-up in instances in which delayed or long-term adverse effects of deployment are possible. Finally, ERHMS provides for the creation of an after-action report, in which the management of the emergency response during all phases would be evaluated in order to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.  Publications  = Technical documents and online training = The ERHMS working group released the documents for public comment in 2011. Among the groups that provided comments were the New York City Office of Emergency Management, the Collaborative for People with Disabilities, the National Clearinghouse for Worker Safety and Health Training, the National Association of State EMS Officials, the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The finalized framework, titled in full the ‚ÄúEmergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance (ERHMS) NRT Technical Assistance Document (TAD)‚Äù was published on January 20, 2012, and a companion document, ‚ÄúEmergency Responder Health Monitoring and Surveillance: A Guide for Key Decision Makers,‚Äù was published on February 6, 2012. The ERHMS framework is explained in two trainings; an online course consisting of four one-hour modules for all responders, and a one-hour leadership training module. = Software = NIOSH developed a free software platform named ERHMS Info Manager designed to track and monitor emergency response and recovery workers during a response. The software supports organizations efforts to implement the ERHMS framework, facilitating data collection, assessment, analysis and reporting.

This conspiracy theory combines several unrelated stories into one narrative. A photo taken during the STS-88 mission claimed by some to show the Black Knight satellite is catalogued by NASA as a photo of space debris, and space journalist James Oberg considers it as probable debris of a thermal blanket confirmed as lost during the mission.  History  According to some UFO conspiracists, the Black Knight is an artificial satellite of extraterrestrial origin that has orbited Earth for approximately 13,000 years; the \\"satellite\\" story is most likely a conflation of several disconnected stories about various objects and their interpretations, all of them well documented independently and none using the term \\"Black Knight\\" upon their first publication. According to senior education support officer Martina Redpath of Armagh Planetarium in Northern Ireland: The origin of the Black Knight legend is often \\"retrospectively dated\\" back to natural extraterrestrial repeating sources supposedly heard during the 1899 radio experiments of Nikola Tesla and long delayed echoes first heard by amateur radio operator J√∏rgen Hals in Oslo, Norway, in 1928. Brian Dunning of the Skeptoid podcast attributes Tesla's 1899 radio signals to pulsars, which were not identified until 1968. In 1954, UFO researcher Donald Keyhoe told newspapers that the United States Air Force had reported that two satellites orbiting Earth had been detected. At that time, no country had the technology to launch a satellite. Skeptics have noted that Keyhoe had been promoting a UFO book at the time, and the news stories were likely written \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" and not intended to be taken seriously. A British rocket called the Black Knight rocket was used in conjunction with the Blue Streak missile program between 1958 and 1965, to test re-entry vehicles. A \\"Black Knight satellite launcher\\" project announced in 1964 was considered a priority by the Ministry of Aviation. The program never put anything into orbit, and it is unrelated to the Black Knight satellite legend. In February 1960, TIME reported that the U.S. Navy had detected a dark object thought to be a Soviet spy satellite in orbit. A follow-up article confirmed that the object was \\"the remains of an Air Force Discoverer VIII satellite that had gone astray.\\" In 1963, astronaut Gordon Cooper supposedly reported a UFO sighting during his 15th orbit in Mercury 9 that was confirmed by tracking stations, but there is no evidence that this happened. Neither NASA's mission transcripts nor Cooper's personal copies show any such report being made during the orbit. In 1973, Scottish author Duncan Lunan analyzed the long delayed radio echoes received by Hals and others and speculated that they could possibly originate from a 13,000 year old alien probe located in an orbit around the Earth's Moon. He suggested that the probe may have originated from a planet located in the solar system of star Epsilon Bo√∂tis. Lunan later retracted his conclusions, saying that he had made \\"outright errors\\" and that his methods had been \\"unscientific\\". Space debris photographed in 1998 during the STS-88 mission has been widely claimed to be the Black Knight satellite. Space journalist James Oberg considers it probable that the photographs are of a thermal blanket that was confirmed as lost during an EVA by Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman.

He invented the modern commercial ultrasonic nozzle, which in its application has brought many benefits to the fields of research, combustion and manufacturing. Berger founded Sono-Tek Corporation based on this technology and while working at the company he made contributions to the fields of combustion, semiconductor manufacturing, electronic printed circuit board manufacturing, drug eluting stents and spray drying. Berger died in August 2007 after a struggle with liver cancer. He was survived by his wife Donna and by his three children, Michael, Robyn and Barbara. Early life and education Harvey Berger was born on August 30, 1938 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Regina Landow and Bernard Berger, a local pharmacist. His family later moved into the Hudson Valley region in mid-state New York. Berger earned a degree in Nuclear physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1960. During the 1960s he did work for General Electric while developing his doctoral thesis entitled \\"Effects of Recoilless Emission on Gamma-Gamma Angular Correlation in Sn-199\\" for which was awarded his PhD in Physics from RPI in June 1969. Career While working at GE on various projects related to his doctoral thesis and the M√∂ssbauer effect, Berger also did research on polymer chemistry and Cherenkov radiation. He later worked at Espey Manufacturing and Electronics Corporation where he began to work deeply in the field airflow, thermal dynamics, and combustion. =Ultrasonic Atomization= Berger based his work on ultrasonic atomization first from the work of John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh and his capillary waves in liquid as they relate to the frequency of vibration, imposed and on that of Robert J. Lang whose published experiments involved atomizing melted wax and cooling and collecting the resultant small beads which he could measure. Lang's work showed a direct correlation between the sizes and the frequency of the vibrations that produced them. In 1973 and 1974 Berger was working to counter the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, believing that the advantages of ultrasonic spray would make heating a building more efficient; an idea for which he later file and received one of his many US Patents on a design of an ultrasonic nozzle. By the time Berger and his team had worked out a viable commercial design, the woes of oil crisis had passed and he set out to find the right applications for his new technology. In addition to the many patents Berger was granted for his work , , et al., he was published and cited in many technical journals such as his introduction of the technology to The International Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems Berger \\"wrote the book\\" on the subject matter and published Ultrasonic Liquid Atomization, Theory and Application in 1998. Being the father of the application of the technology, Harvey Berger was frequently called to speak on the matter and write publications regarding its benefits in certain applications, such as medical applications and more specifically the coating of drug-eluting stents.

He is a member of Bharatiya Janata Party, which he joined on 10 March 2014 in New Delhi. He was a member of Asom Gana Parishad until 16 February 2013, when he resigned from the party membership \\"expressing his frustration at the failure of the party leadership to bring in new blood to revive the regional force\\". However, he made it clear that he has nothing against the aims and objectives of the regional force and he would always continue his anti- Congress stand. Early life and education Hitendra Nath Goswami is the sixth among eight sibling of Late Shrinath Deva Goswami and Late Smt. Rambha Goswami, who was the Satradhikar of Madhu-Mishra Satra and a prominent citizen of Jorhat. His father was a Gold Medalist of University of Calcutta and founder of three educational Institutions namely ‚Äìi) Deepling Higher Secondary School, Sibsagar District ii) Dhekial Higher Secondary School, Golaghat District and iii) Borbheta Primary and High School at Jorhat District, eventually retired from the Agricultural Department in 1965 as Sugarcane Inspector. Born on 1 January 1959, Hiten Goswami started his schooling at the school established by his father at Borbheta and shifted to Jorhat Govt. Boys' H.S and M.P. School for high school level. He excelled in H.S.S.L.C from J.B.College, Jorhat in 1976 and joined St. Edmunds College, Shillong for graduation. During the same time he started North East Region Student Union (which later on became North East Region Students's Union, NESO) as the founder convener for the cause of N.E.India. He played an active role in the Assam Movement and due to his agitational activities against the illegal immigration and atrocities of the Indian Army on the local populace he was arrested and was sent to Silchar Jail and Tihar Jail under N.S.A. He lost a few academic years but with immense grit and determination received his Bachelors and master's degree(1985) in Chemistry with 1st Class from Gauhati University. Having seen the excesses of law (use of arbitrary arrest, illegal detention and torture of the protesters) during the Assam Movement and feeling the need to defend the powerless he pursued LLB degree from Guwahati University, graduated in 1987 and started working in the Gauhati High Court. In a short period of time he gained a lot of respect as a lawyer. He is married to Malabika Goswami and he has a daughter who is currently pursuing her Bachelors in Miranda House (Delhi University). The spirit of commitment to the society with honesty, integrity and humanity was a family tradition with all his siblings excelling in each of their field of activity. 1\\\\.

(Asom Gana Parishad) candidate. Though he did not have any political background, he left his successful career and decided to join active politics to fight for the aspirations of the Assamese society. He contested in the 1991 Assam Legislative Assembly election, defeating runner-up Indian National Congress (Congress) candidate Dina Nath Rajkhowa by a margin of 4.73 percent votes. He went on to win the 1996 and 2001 Assam legislative assembly election. Out of his 3 terms in the assembly, two terms were spent as an Opposition member. In a recent TV debate, he said due to the severe financial crisis during his terms in Jorhat, he couldn't complete large scale initiatives for the people.

Construction of spurs at Neemati for protection of Jorhat from the erosion by the Brahmaputra River. 2\\\\. Preparing of Master Plan for solving the drinking water problem of Jorhat town by bringing water from Brahmaputra river. Due to non-availability of funds during his tenure this plan couldn't be executed and it is in the back burner since the last decade since he left office.

The episode was written by Scott Buck and Tim Schlattmann, and was directed by Marcos Siega. Plot Dexter contemplates admitting to the Bay Harbor Butcher killings. Doakes escapes from his cell but is captured by two drug smugglers. They force him to go back to the cabin and carry the cocaine to their boat. Dexter shows up while they are at the boat and discovers that Doakes has escaped, but then hears voices coming up the path. He sees Doakes with the drug dealers and manages to kill them both with the help of Doakes. He then puts Doakes back into the cage and decides that he is going to turn himself in, but needs one last day to sort his affairs, so he leaves Doakes in the cage with some fruit and water. The FBI is displeased with the lack of progress in the Bay Harbor Butcher case and assigns a deputy director to take over Lundy's role in the investigation. Angel is arrested for the sexual assault of Lila, who offers to drop the charges if Dexter will resume their relationship. Debra investigates Lila's past with Lundy and discovers she is using an alias, eventually discovering that she is an illegal immigrant by fingerprinting Angel's microwave. Meanwhile, using Dexter's GPS navigation which she stole from the van while Dexter was taking Rita and the kids out for one last day of freedom, Lila discovers the cabin in the swamp, where Doakes is being held. La Guerta is in Haiti and finds out that Doakes was there to get slides analyzed. She calls Lundy and he is interested in getting the details. Dexter changes his mind on turning himself in after having steaks with his sister who tells him he just needs to accept who he is and move on. Production Filming locations for the episode included Palos Verdes Estates, Long Beach, Marina del Rey, and Los Angeles, California. Reception The episode was positively received. IGN's Eric Goldman gave the episode a rating of 9 out of 10, and commented that \\"[y]ou know a show is doing a great job when it has you thinking that maybe they should end it now, simply because it seems so impossible to top what is currently happening. Such is the case with Dexter, where the penultimate episode of the season truly felt like the penultimate episode of the entire series.\\" The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias gave the episode a B+ grade and stated that \\"[a]fter the major character revelations last week, \\"Left Turn Ahead\\" does a lot of table-setting for next week's big finale, but the plotting is mostly strong (as it‚Äôs been all season, really) and not entirely at the expense of character, either.\\" References External links  \\"Left Turn Ahead\\" at Showtime's website Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Dexter (TV series) episodes ","title":"Left Turn Ahead"},{"id":"42166155","text":"John Theodore Heins (c.1697-1756) was a painter and engraver, probably of German birth, but active in Great Britain. He settled in Norwich and by 1720 was working on a series of portraits of members of prominent local families. Life Heins was working in Norwich from around 1720. He is recorded as living in Hog Hill in the city in 1729 when he held a raffle, with three of his pictures as prizes. Some of his early works are signed \\"D. Heins\\"; the \\"D\\" is thought to stand for \\"Dietrich\\", the German form of \\"Theodore\\". In 1732 he was commissioned to execute the first of a number of portraits of Norwich civic dignitaries which can now be seen at Saint Andrew's Hall in the city. He monopolised civic portraiture in Norwich until 1746, when Thomas Bardwell was commissioned by the city's artillery company to paint a portrait of William Crowe, who became mayor the following year.General History of Norfolk 1829, p.1131 Heins painted two portraits of the Hanoverian composer and emigre to England, Handel. Some of his finest works were commissioned by the Astley family of Melton Constable, including one of a Musical Party, and a double portrait of Edward and Blanche Astley, the children of Sir Jacob Astley, 3rd Bt. (1692 ‚Äì 1760). Heins also depicted allegorical and historical subjects and candle-light scenes, and painted genre pieces, including two Scenes from the Life of Thomas Guy.http://www.answers.com/topic/john-hein In October 1745, the Gentleman's Magazine published a poem called \\"Lines on seeing some portraits of the celebrated Mr. Heyns of Norwich\\". It includes the lines: \\"In Fame's high temple shall forever live,/ Blessed in the immortality you give./ Had Homer never sung, long since had died, His country's bulwark, happiness, and pride,/ The god-like Hector; nor had Helen's charms/ Shone now, as when she fir'd the world to arms./ Had Heyns! thy pencil never canvas stain'd/Norwich, thy boasts had but a moment reign'd\\". Heins' Allegory of Trade (Yale Center for British Art) Prints Joseph Strutt, in his Biographical Dictionary of Engravers (1786), notes that Heins reproduced some of his portraits in mezzotint in what he calls \\"a very stiff tasteless style\\", and that he was also said to have etched a few plates. The one print by Heins that Strutt mentions specifically is a half-length portrait of Thomas Gooch, Bishop of Norwich, signed Heins Pinx et fecit, 1741. John Theodore Heins junior Strutt says that Heins's son, whom he names only as \\"J. Heins\\" was originally apprenticed to a cloth manufacturer, but then, against his parents' wishes, became an artist, painting both oil paintings and miniatures.

The Zulu king Dingane was challenged for the throne by his brother Mpande, in alliance with Boer settlers led by Andries Pretorius. Mpande and his supporters were victorious. Shortly thereafter Dingane was murdered and Mpande became king of the Zulus. Background The Boer settlers under Pretorius had inflicted a crushing defeat on Dingane in 1838 at the Battle of Blood River, allowing them to carve out territory and create the Natalia Republic. As a result, the king's authority had been severely weakened. His attempt to reassert his leadership by expanding his territory to the north led to another defeat at the hands of the Swazi in 1839. Fearing that Dingane intended to kill him, to rid himself of a possible rival for the throne, Mpande had fled across the Thuleka river with 17,000 of his followers. Mpande made a deal with Boers that he would grant them substantial land and cattle in St. Lucia Bay if they helped to install him as king. The Boers readily agreed to Mpande's proposal[1] as they yearned for a feasible sea- harbour that was not under control of the British, such as Port Natal; a yearning that was again manifest two years later by their ill fated attempt to seize Port Natal at the Battle of Congella.John Laband, Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 148. On 14 January 1840, Mpande's general Nongalaza KaNondela crossed into Zululand with a force of around 5,000 impi, advancing along the coast towards Dingane's encampment. Mpande and the Boers under Pretorius advanced separately across the Ncome River. The Boers had a force of 308 armed men and another 500 servants in 50 wagons. Dingane attempted to negotiate, but Mpande and Nongalaza refused to listen. Dingane's envoy Dambusa was summarily executed when he arrived at the Boer camp. Dingane then withdrew into the Maguda mountain region. Dingane's general, Ndlela kaSompisi took up a position on a group of hillocks known as the Maqongqo hills. Nongazala's army soon caught up with them, but Pretorius' force was still a hundred miles away.John Laband, Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 148. Rather than wait for the Boers, Nongalaza decided to attack immediately. Both armies were around 5,000 strong. Both adopted the traditional Zulu Chest and Horns formation. The battle was fiercely contested for a while, but Dingane's demoralised men began to desert to the enemy. It is said that Nongalaza deceived Dingane's men by creating the impression that the Boers had arrived and were about to take to the field.C. T. Binns, The Last Zulu King: The Life and Death of Cetshwayo, Longmans, 1963, p. 20. When it looked as though his army might desert en masse, Ndlela ordered the withdrawal of his remaining forces. Wounded survivors were massacred by the triumphant Nongalaza, as were the wives of Dingane. Dingane was furious, and had Ndlela strangled to death on the spot.Laband, Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars, 2009, p. 189. However, this did not stop most of Dingane's remaining men dispersing back to their homes, leaving him with no effective force. Aftermath The Boers arrived on 6 February, having taken the opportunity to grab as much cattle in booty as they could. They proclaimed Mpande king, and returned to Natalia with 36,000 head of cattle. Dingane escaped with a few followers into Swaziland, but was murdered shortly afterwards by a patrol of Swazis and Nyawos. On 14 February 1840 Pretorius issued a proclamation stating that a large stretch of land extending from St. Lucia Bay was now the border between the Zulu kingdom and the Republic of Natalia.Shamase, Maxwell Zakhel, \\"The reign of King Mpande and his relations with the Republic of Natalia and its successor,the British Colony of Natal\\" , University of Zululand Institutional Repository.

The couple, inspired by the birth of their third child, funded the start-up with $1.5 million of their personal savings. Initially, the company operated on a purely mail-order catalog business model before launching its first website in 1996. BirthdayExpress.com was responsible for a third of the company's orders by 1999. After a five-year period that saw a nearly five-fold increase in number of orders (from 44,000 in 1995 to 200,000 in 1998), Birthday Express received over $13 million in new investment capital from Arch Venture Partners, Advanced Technology Ventures, and Sigma Partners in 1999.

These preparations were abandoned in August of that year, following the poor performance of public competitors' stocks. CelebrateExpress.com opted to raise funds from other sources, raising $14 million by August 2001. CelebrateExpress.com continued to expand its family of brands by purchasing Storybook Heirlooms in 2001 from Storybook, Inc., a clothing-retailer aimed at pre-teen girls, and by creating Costume Express in 2003.

It was first broadcast on 5 March 2014 on BBC Two. The episode was written by and starred Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and guest- starred Lyndsey Marshal, Julia Davis, Rosie Cavaliero, Roger Sloman, Di Botcher, Richard Cordery, Bruce Mackinnon and Jo Stone-Fewings. Pemberton plays actor Tony, who is starring as Macbeth in a West End production of Shakespeare's Macbeth, and Shearsmith plays Jim, Tony's understudy. The plot of \\"The Understudy\\" partially mirrors the story of Macbeth, exploring the theme of power and the lives of actors. The episode took longer to write than any other in the first series of Inside No. 9, and was redrafted several times owing to the writers' uncertainty as to whether the characters should be amateurs or professionals. It is presented in five separate acts, mirroring theatrical norms. Critics responded positively to \\"The Understudy\\", praising it as an improvement upon the previous week's episode \\"Last Gasp\\". They stressed the links between \\"The Understudy\\" and Macbeth, but said that viewers would not need to be familiar with Shakespeare's work in order to enjoy the episode. On its first showing, \\"The Understudy\\" was watched by 720,000 viewers (4.1% of the market); this was the lowest viewership of the series so far. Production Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had previously worked together on The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from \\"David and Maureen\\", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville. This episode, in turn, was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. \\"David and Maureen\\" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a \\"reaction\\" to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that \\"We'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week.\\" As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff. The episode was written and is presented in a five-act structure to mirror theatrical norms. This allowed for jumps in time within the episode, as well as marking it out from others in the series. The plot is essentially based on Macbeth, leading Pemberton to suggest that the episode might be used \\"on an O Level syllabus\\" in the future. Unlike other episodes in the series, \\"The Understudy\\" did not take place in a family home, and for this reason, the writers were keen not to alienate viewers. After the initial idea of a group of characters backstage at a production of Macbeth, the writers re- scripted several times, unsure of whether the characters should be amateurs, members of a touring company or professionals. This meant that the script- writing took longer for \\"The Understudy\\" than for any other episode of the first series of Inside No. 9. The script eventually settled on actors at a West End theatre. For Shearsmith, it mattered that the actors had a \\"real chance\\" and that there were high stakes. The episode, he suggested, reflected happenings in a real theatre, rather than a television version. Pemberton said that the West End setting allowed for the \\"agonising\\" scene of a post- performance visit from audience members. Plot The plot revolves around, and partially mirrors, William Shakespeare's Macbeth. ;Act I Tony Warner is starring in the lead role of Macbeth at the Duke of Cambridge Theatre. Coming back to his dressing room after a performance, he is visited by his understudy Jim. When invited to attend the understudy rehearsal, Tony makes an excuse about having a voiceover job at that time; and the pair are joined by Tony's neighbours Jean and Bill, who have just watched Tony's performance. Tony leaves with them, and Jim puts on Tony's prop crown, imagining himself in the leading role. ;Act II Before the understudy rehearsal, Jim's fianc√©e Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) helps him learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them for using the room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which would allow them to save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone. ;Act III During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as he comes backstage during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages him to take the chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage, and the stage manager calls for a medic. ;Act IV Jim has taken over the role of Macbeth. It is mentioned that Tony fell off the battlements on stage, and is in hospital. Felicity has been sacked after she was accused of sexual harassment. Laura arrives to congratulate Jim, and he thanks her for encouraging him. He is distant, eventually asking her to leave him to prepare alone. As he puts on his crown in front of the mirror, he hears the sound of whispering, and sees blood pouring from both his eyes and the mirror. ;Act V Nineteen months later, Jim is a famous actor playing the title role in Richard III at the theatre, using the same, now redecorated, dressing room. A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him and talks about how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She has watched Jim's performance every day of the week, and says she knew that he just needed \\"a little push\\" to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not know about this, because he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him \\"in the wings ... like an understudy\\". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death. Reception The performance of Shearsmith (pictured in 2003) as the eponymous understudy was praised. Critics responded very positively to \\"The Understudy\\", with several drawing attention to the improvement over \\"Last Gasp\\", the previous week's episode. Bruce Dessau called it a \\"striking return to form\\" on his website, and Gerard Gilbert, writing in The Independent, called it \\"a return to form\\" after the previous week's \\"misfire\\". Writers in The Sunday Times called the episode \\"[a]nother exquisite short story\\", Ben Lawrence, writing in the Daily Telegraph, called it a \\"gloriously OTT tale\\", and John Robinson, writing for The Guardian, described it as an \\"excellent instalment\\" of the series. He identified the themes of the episode by calling it \\"a spooky and highly satirical take on actors, Shakespeare and power\\". Critics stressed that a knowledge of Macbeth was not necessary to enjoy the episode. \\"Knowing the text\\", suggested Jack Seale of Radio Times, \\"will take you only halfway and, in any case, the clever plot is really just a vehicle for characters sketched fully in only a few lines, and a torrent of fruity luvvie gags about jealousy, superstition and stage-hogging hams.\\" Dessau agreed, saying that \\"[y]ou don't need to be a literary scholar to get the gags\\". Critic Jane Simon, writing in the Daily Mirror, suggested that \\"even a hazy knowledge of the Scottish play will tip you the wink what might lie ahead\\". David Chater in The Times and an anonymous reviewer in the Sunday Herald both praised the plot's divergence from Shakespeare, with the latter saying that \\"the script cleverly offers parallels with The Scottish Play, just to whip them away again\\". Dessau felt that the complex plot meant that the guest stars did \\"not get quite as much screen time as they deserve\\", but that this was no complaint, as it was \\"very much Pemberton and Shearsmith's instalment and they are both brilliant\\".

According to an interview with his widow, Eya Donald Greenland Kotulsky, he was born in a Nazi slave labour camp, during World War II. Kotulsky had a distinguished career as a photographer, producing portraits of high-profile individuals, like Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Kotulsky also documented the lives of street people, and that collection of photos has been donated to the City of Toronto archives, which organized a gallery show, to celebrate their acquisition, and subsequently made them available for download. Kotulsky was born to Maria and Mykyta Kotulsky while his family was interned in a Nazi slave labour camp near Cologne, or K√∂ln, Germany, in the final months of World War II, during an Allied bombing raid. In 1949, after having lived for four years as refugees in a Displaced Persons' camp, his family immigrated to Canada, sponsored by a blacksmith in Smoky Lake, Alberta. By 1951, his family had relocated to Toronto's Cabbagetown, near the Don Valley ravine, which provided a slice of nature in downtown Toronto for Ivaan to explore. Kotulsky would later credit his exposure to the kindly blacksmith as having kindled his own interest in metalworking which found its outlet in jewellery making, at the age of 25. Kotulsky was said to have been able to see beauty in things people ordinarily overlook, explaining the quality of the intimate images he took of street people. The engagement ring with which he proposed to his wife featured a very large green stone‚Äîwhich was originally a discarded piece of Seven Up bottle. Never in robust health, Ivaan suffered two heart attacks in the early 1990s. In 1995, Kotulsky opened a retail store on Queen Street West. That year, he and Eya Donald Greenland were married. They had first met in 1969; she was 16 and working after school at the Harbord Bakery, which he frequented. In 2000, Kotulsky experienced the first of a series of strokes that eventually led to his paralysis and affected his ability to create new works of art. In 2005, after his third stroke, when he lacked the strength and dexterity to continue working independently, Eya started to assist him in his studio, often working with his original moulds, using the lost wax casting technique. She told Nicole Baute, writing in the Toronto Star, that she never intended to continue making pieces from those moulds after he died, beyond filling the outstanding orders, but customers continued to request pieces. The Art Gallery of Ontario, which had commissioned Kotulsky in 1979 to create a collection of jewellery and metal art inspired by King Tutankhamun, hosted a long-running exhibition of King Tutankhamun artefacts in 2009, and requested she produce additional reproductions of his work for display in the AGO Shop. Ivaan's wife, Eya, continued to operate his studio, ATELIER IVAAN, to showcase and preserve his artistic legacy until December, 2018. Baute reported that Kotulsky became the \\"first Canadian to undergo a pioneering neurosurgical procedure\\", to close off the damaged artery that had led to his four strokes. She reported that the surgery closed off the artery, but that during surgery, Kotulsky suffered a fifth stroke that left him in a coma from which he never regained consciousness. Ivaan Kotulsky died on December 6, 2008. In 2017, the City of Toronto named one of its many laneways IVAAN KOTULSKY LANE, in his honour.

After modest but happy beginnings in life, Beldie played a small but essential part in the promotion of literary modernism, building bridges between the mainstream and the avant-garde. He became a pioneer of cultural journalism at Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, before moving on to Ideea EuropeanƒÉ and ultimately Cuv√¢ntul, befriending (and secretly resenting) philosopher-journalist Nae Ionescu. Like Ionescu, he promoted a vitalistic perspective on society and culture, veering into antiintellectualism after 1918. While working in the field of journalism and cultural criticism, Beldie advanced through the ranks of the bureaucracy, and held several important assignments between 1919 and 1935. He was the lover of female journalist Cora Irineu, and was possibly responsible for her suicide in 1924. This was only one of his many philandering affairs, some of them discussed in Beldie's own recollections of the period. These politically charged manuscripts were published, with a noted delay, in 2000. Biography =Early years= Born in Bucharest, Adrian Majuru, \\"Constantin Beldie, Memorii. Caleidoscopul unei jumƒÉtƒÉ»õi de veac √Æn Bucure»ôti (1900-1950)\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 132, September 2002 Beldie grew up in the mahala of Gorgani, just south of Ci»ômigiu Gardens. Zigu Ornea, \\"DezvƒÉluirile lui Constantin Beldie\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 46/2000 He was a second- generation Bucharester, with his paternal family stemming from the western province of Oltenia. On that side, he descended from an old line of pandur rebels, called Beldie, BƒÉldan, or Pietraru. His great-grandfather Nicolae, Beldie recalled, participated in the 1821 uprising, only to betray the revolutionary cause, and then settled with other renegade pandurs on the V√¢lsan River floodplain.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Pandurii lui Tudor\\", p.21-25 His grandfather, Ghi»õƒÉ Beldie, resided in Stroe»ôtii Arge»ôului, but traded in »õuicƒÉ all over the Arge»ô River valley.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Pandurii lui Tudor\\", p.23-25 Beldie's father, Dumitru, left the impoverished countryside for a life in the city; his father and brothers, however, were committed to the a peasant life, and benefited from the land reforms.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Pandurii lui Tudor\\", p.23, 25 Dumitru, a restaurant owner, was a sympathizer of socialism, acquainted with a number of prominent contemporary Romanians. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Memoriile unui hedonist\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 41/2000 Young Beldie received a progressive education, which even included enrollment in pre- kindergarten. He was later given private lessons in French, German and English, in addition to attending school, and took classes in dance and bicycling. However, Beldie grew up mainly on the streets, describing life in the half-rural Bucharest of his youth as \\"patriarchal, lazy, prosperous and good-to-all\\". His summers were spent in the countryside, traveling with Ghi»õƒÉ Beldie on the trade route between V√¢lsan region and Bucharest.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Pandurii lui Tudor\\", p.23, 24 He observed Westernization and urbanization as a bohemian outsider, commenting sarcastically on the universal spread of petty corruption and lassitude. Beldie went to the Saint Sava National College, followed by the Gheorghe »òincai Gymnasium. Al. SƒÉndulescu, \\"Constantin Beldie (fragment)\\", in Ateneu, Nr. 6-7/2009, p.23 His time in school was an annoyance, and he twice failed to get his remove, passing his finishing exams in private. He would later complain of the corporal punishments he received in class, and that Saint Sava \\"did not teach us anything, did not urge us to accomplish anything\\". Beldie took a break from schooling, and worked various odd jobs, notably as a clerk in a medical laboratory, a choir singer for the Metropolitan Church, and a village teacher. One of Constantin RƒÉdulescu- Motru's closest collaborators, in 1908 he became a secretary at the latter's magazine Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, remaining there until 1916. This period introduced Beldie to the Europeanist ideology of RƒÉdulescu-Motru and Ion Trivale, who criticized the nationalist stances of schools such as Poporanism and SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul; RƒÉdulescu-Motru struck Beldie as \\"wise\\" and \\"kind\\", but too pedantic when it came to assessing art. He also quickly learned the editing and typographical trades, as well as the administrative tasks involved in preparing a magazine. =Debut in cultural journalism= Soon, Beldie became a close observer of the day's literary and scientific milieu, reviewing the correspondence exchanged between Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. As a literary chronicler and LTTE recipient, he helped discover writers such as Tudor Arghezi, George Bacovia, and Felix Aderca. He personally intervened to have Aderca's poems published in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (1913), Anca Marina RƒÉdulescu, \\"Felix Aderca. Contribu»õii biografice: etapa craioveanƒÉ\\", in the University of Craiova Anale. Seria »òtiin»õe Filologice, Nr. 1-2/2010, p.61 but was much annoyed by Aderca's \\"contentious and categorical\\" nature. Allegedly, Beldie also met the literary innovator and prankster Urmuz. Beldie also worked on and off as a translator of French literature for Alcaly Publishers, whose Jewish Romanian owner, he recalled, was utterly illiterate. He became passionate about J. Barbey d'Aurevilly, Charles Baudelaire, Anatole France, Remy de Gourmont, Jean Mor√©as, Jean Richepin, and Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. In 1915, he translated and prefaced Villiers' Le secret de l'√©chafaud.Neonila Onofrei, Lucre»õia Anghelu»õƒÉ, Liana Miclescu, Cornelia Gilorteanu, Tamara Teodorescu, Bibliografia rom√¢neascƒÉ modernƒÉ (1831‚Äì1918). Vol. I: A-C, Editura »ôtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi enciclopedicƒÉ, Bucharest, 1984, p.328 With such professional credentials, Beldie was asked to contribute on other publishing projects, and became close to the burgeoning Symbolist movement. He met and befriended, or quarreled with, a host of Symbolists and post- Symbolists, leaving characterological notes on Adrian Maniu, N. Davidescu, Emil Isac, and Mihail Sorbul. Together with I. Dragoslav, he was one of the non-Symbolists involved with Ion Minulescu's Symbolist tribune, Insula.Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2007, p.27. Like the younger Symbolists, Beldie also took a keen interest in avant-garde aesthetics. He claimed to have played a personal part in bringing Expressionism to Romania, but was perplexed by Cubism, and declared himself unconvinced by Marinetti's Futurism. He not only disliked Futurism, but contended that its promoters at Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, including Ramiro Ortiz, were Italian proto-fascist nationalists and agents of influence. Paul Cernat, \\"Note despre receptarea futurismului italian √Æn Rom√¢nia antebelicƒÉ\\", in Ex Ponto, Nr. 6/2005, p.122 Another one of his new friends was Nae Ionescu, with whom he would quarrel and reunite several times before 1940. According to Beldie's own testimony, they were both intrepid womanizers and self-seekers. Ionescu, Beldie claims, was \\"not taken seriously\\" as an author, mainly because \\"he wouldn't take himself seriously\\". The \\"Gypsy- like knave\\" Ionescu was, according to Beldie, \\"a loser before it was his time to lose\\". Joining their circle were Aderca and Maniu. Both of them, Beldie claims, squandered their talent on artistically irrelevant, lucrative, work. Beldie himself was notorious for his hedonism, later confessing: \\"I have been a philanderer by nature all my life, but I was not a jealous one.\\" He also admitted having been a confidant of women, \\"their comrade and blood-brother\\", and of thus receiving their sexual favors, but also claimed to have participated in at least one public sex orgy. He was a long-haired dandy with \\"languid eyes\\", taking special care in his appearance, which included such fashionable items as a Panama or a bowler hat, celluloid collar, a frock coat, nacre buttons, and a walking cane. »òtefan Agopian, \\"Scrisori bƒÉnƒÉ»õene (o poveste de dragoste)\\", in Dilemateca, October 2006, p.55 Despite his libertine outlook, on July 29, 1910 Beldie married the actress Eugenia Gh. Ionescu, with whom he lived on Schitul Maicilor Street, Bucharest.LeonƒÉchescu \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (I), p.42-43 On August 29, 1912, Eugenia gave birth to a son, Alexandru \\"Puiu\\" Beldie.LeonƒÉchescu \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (I), p.43, 47 This did not prevent Beldie from pursuing other women. Enrolling at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Philosophy and Literature, he met Cora Irineu, who became passionately in love with him, and whom Beldie helped introduce to literary life. Eventually graduating in 1912, Beldie was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces during the Second Balkan War. He was a teacher from 1913 to 1947 in the fields of Romanian language, professional education and project management. =Essayist and civil servant= Letterhead announcing the Ideea EuropeanƒÉ Conference of November 1921. From the invitation addressed by Beldie to poet Emil Isac Beldie was again drafted into the Land Forces for the World War I Romanian campaign (1916-1918). During this time, his dislike of formalism had matured into vitalism and antiintellectualism. As Beldie later put it, the Romanian intellectual class had the artistic tastes of \\"prostitutes\\", being virtually incapable of producing \\"an original idea of its own\\". The youth, given to the \\"drunkenness twinned with whoring\\", would only read the football pages of Gazeta Sporturilor. Its \\"intellectual and moral crisis\\", Beldie claimed, had to do with \\"organic weakness\\", \\"exotic\\" intellectual habits, but also with \\"an insufficient training or an all-too- early lassitude\\". The ideological stance fueled Beldie's 1918 essay Glossa spiritului cƒÉrturƒÉresc (\\"Gloss on the Bookish Spirit\\") as well as, attributively, Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Posteritatea unui memorialist\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 7/2006 the aphorisms published as Ce vrem? Catechism pentru suflete nehotƒÉr√Æte (\\"What Is It We Want? A Catechism for Indecisive Souls\\"). Both were came out with Yellow Books (CƒÉr»õi Galbene), an imprint of Editura Minerva, and were seen by reviewers of the day as illustrating \\"a heroic concept of life\\".\\"CƒÉr»õi rom√¢ne»ôti\\", p.528 According to critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, Beldie should be regarded as an immediate but \\"modest\\" precursor for Ionescu's own brand of philosophic vitalism, or TrƒÉirism. To contemporary readers, he appeared more like an inconsistent follower of pragmatism, in the vein of William James. \\"Mi»ôcarea filosoficƒÉ\\", in Aspecte din filosofia contimporanƒÉ. I-a serie, Editura Studii Filosofice, Bucharest, 1919, p.192 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Instead of intellectualism, Beldie proposed a new brand of elitism and, historian Adrian Majuru notes, saw his as \\"a solitary life among the idiots\\". In Catechism, Beldie declared that: \\"There is no greater misfortune than when the strongest people on earth are not also the most obeyed by mankind. Because then all things are false, monstrous, and everything runs backwards.\\" He advised youth not to be ashamed of \\"their weaknesses, their tics, and their passions\\", suggesting that \\"they provide one's life with color, freshness, and the picturesque.\\"\\"CƒÉr»õi rom√¢ne»ôti\\", p.529 In 1919, Beldie became editorial secretary at another of RƒÉdulescu-Motru's magazines, Ideea EuropeanƒÉ, which took over the old offices of Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ. Ionel Necula, \\"CealaltƒÉ Idee EuropeanƒÉ\\" , in Contemporanul, Nr. 2/2010, p.14 This allowed him to organize a series of conferences held in various cities by, among others, Nae Ionescu, Ortiz, Irineu, Octav Onicescu, Mircea Florian, Virgil BƒÉrbat, and Emanoil Bucu»õa. At the time, he became close friends with another Ideea EuropeanƒÉ contributor, the Jewish essayist Henric Sanielevici. Beldie was not especially visible in this company of intellectuals, but contributed a rather popular satirical column, Aplauze »ôi fluierƒÉturi (\\"Applause and Heckling\\"), and put to bed each printed issue. He soon began his affair with Irineu, leaving with her on official assignments to Transylvania. To the irritation of his Ideea EuropeanƒÉ friends, these trips turned into sexual escapades, with both Beldie and Irineu neglecting their real tasks. In 1922, Irineu left alone for an extended trip in Banat area, while Beldie stated behind in Bucharest. The letters he received from her convinced him that she was an outstanding reporter, and, on this basis, he pruned their content and published them as a separate column in Ideea EuropeanƒÉ. From around 1919, Beldie was also working as a teacher at the Superior School for Arts and Crafts, in Bucharest. Having served as department head for the Social Reform Society (1919-1924), under sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, he was at the time a commercial director at Centrala CƒÉr»õii publishing house and director of Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ (1924-1928). As Beldie later recounted, this assignment pitied him against Nae Ionescu: according to Beldie, Ionescu was responsible for a major fraud, which he tried to pin down on Centrala CƒÉr»õii. While at Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, he arranged Irineu's letters for publishing as a volume. =Final decades= On February 11, 1924, Irineu committed suicide by revolver. This was due either to Beldie's philandering (which probably caused some of his other lovers to kill themselves) or, as he asserts in his memoirs, a family illness that also claimed several of her siblings. Another version has it that she was driven to despair when Beldie intervened between her and her other admirer, Bucu»õa. Beldie arranged for her burial at Bellu cemetery, and put out a final version of her letters and essays. With RƒÉdulescu-Motru, Beldie frequented the salon of Alexandrina Cantacuzino. They joined her Union of Intellectuals club in 1926, Carmen BrƒÉgaru, \\"Ion Pillat »ôi Liga Na»õiunilor\\", in Ex Ponto, Nr. 3/2012, p.99 but Beldie left sarcastic notes about the intellectual abilities of its other members. Ideea EuropeanƒÉ ceased publication in 1928. That year, Beldie became director of Cuv√¢ntul daily, headed by Ionescu‚Äîwho, in 1930, joined the camarilla surrounding the authoritarian King, Carol II. Beldie himself became head of Imprimeria Na»õionalƒÉ (1930-1932), before becoming assistant director and then director for the census (1930-1932), in which capacity he was well paid. He was eventually head of Loteria de Stat (1932-1935). In 1933, Ionescu defected to the Iron Guard, a fascist movement opposed to Carol II. As documented by Beldie, his wealth grew over the coming years, as he became the representative of Nazi-linked IG Farben in Romania, and included villas in BƒÉneasa and Balcic and a Mercedes-Benz car with a chauffeur paid by the firm. Beldie, instead, retired from public life. He was embittered by Ionescu's politics, describing him as a \\"ham actor\\" on the far right and religious scene, a figure of \\"turpitude, cynicism, amorality\\".George Voicu, \\"Mitul Nae Ionescu (V)\\", in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 69/1999, p.56 During World War II and the early years of the Romanian communist regime, Beldie lived in relative obscurity. From his retirement at age sixty until his death, he had financial difficulties and had to work as a proofreader for various publishers, eventually being forced to sell his personal book collection. During the early 1950s, Beldie began compiling and reviewing his scattered memoirs, in samizdat form. He only gave private readings, and was hailed by critic Vladimir Streinu, who attended such events, as Romania's answer to Saint-Simon. To minimize the risk of communist arrest and imprisonment, Beldie only dealt with the more distant past, with the notable exception of his chapter on Arghezi. This portion, which was not read in front of Arghezi, claimed that Arghezi was a compulsive liar, and discussed in detail the issue of his uncertain family origins. Beldie was supported morally and financially by old literary friends, including Arghezi and literary critic Tudor Vianu, who greatly enjoyed reading fragments from the work. He visited the house of another literary promoter, »òerban Cioculescu, his portrait picture prominently displayed in the lobby. Working clandestinely and under Securitate surveillance, Cioculescu collected memoirs of the previous regime; he organized reunions at which Beldie met other such late debutants, including politician Petre Ghia»õƒÉ and former counterespionage operative George \\"GeacƒÉ\\" Borneanu. Beldie was survived by his son Alexandru, whom he had educated in accordance with Glossa spiritului cƒÉrturƒÉresc, encouraging him to take up mountaineering.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (I), p.47-48 Beldie Jr became a distinguished dendrologist, forestry engineer, and environmentalist. Like his father before him, he was also a bohemian. He fought on the Eastern Front and spent 1944-1945 as a prisoner of war in Oranki,LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (I), p.43; (II), p.47 before returning to teach in Romania. He was married three times, but had no children.LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (II), p.42 Legacy Beldie looked forward to the promise of liberalization, believing that his bitter memoirs would eventually be given imprimatur by the communist authorities. He was worried that they would never be published in full, so he asked his literary friends, including Arghezi, Vianu, Cioculescu, and Perpessicius, to make sure no part of them went missing. Alexandru Beldie, underpromoted in his field of work because of his anticommunism and structural nonconformity, then forcefully retired,LeonƒÉchescu, \\"Un secol de la na»ôterea...\\" (II), p.41, 42-43, 47-48 took up the task of raising awareness of his father's samizdat work. He preserved the manuscripts and, in the 1970s, presented them to Zigu Ornea, director of Editura Minerva. Although Ornea gave his approval, the memoirs were blocked from publication by communist censors, due to a chapter on Nae Ionescu. Despite the chapter's sharply critical tone, the regime's policy was not to publish any mention of Ionescu. After the 1989 Revolution, Ornea and Nicolae Manolescu arranged for the Ionescu chapter to be published in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ. The work only appeared in 2000, with Editura Albatros. As critics note, they were only printed in an altered form‚Äîwith the Ionescu chapter conspicuously absent, probably cut out from the manuscript entirely.

The rule requires certain farmers to develop an oil spill prevention plan that is certified by a professional engineer and may require them to make infrastructure changes. According to supporters, this bill would \\"ease the burden placed on farmers and ranchers\\" by making it easier for smaller farms to self-certify and raising the level of storage capacity under which farms are exempted. These rules apply to any storage units that contain oil, whether petroleum products or animal fats. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act or the FUELS Act would require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in implementing the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule with respect to any farm, to require certification of compliance with such rule by: (1) a professional engineer for a farm with an individual tank with an aboveground storage capacity greater than 10,000 gallons, an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of at least 42,000 gallons, or a history that includes a spill, as determined by the Administrator; or (2) the owner or operator of the farm (via self-certification) for a farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity greater than 10,000 gallons but less than 42,000 gallons and no history of spills. The bill would direct the Administrator to exempt from all requirements of such rule any farm with an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of 10,000 gallons or less and no history of spills. The bill would exclude from the aggregate storage capacity of a farm all containers on separate parcels that have a capacity that is less than 1,320 gallons. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on October 29, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 311 would have no significant net impact on the federal budget, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates. The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modify the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule, which regulates oil discharges into navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. A portion of the SPCC rule, effective as of September 23, 2013, requires certain farmers to develop an oil spill prevention plan that is certified by a professional engineer. Those plans could involve certain infrastructure changes to reduce the possibility of oil spills. Such plans apply to farms that store more than 1,320 gallons of oil products in aboveground containers or more than 42,000 gallons of oil products in buried containers that could reasonably be expected to discharge oil into waters of the United States. Enacting H.R. 311 would ease some compliance requirements for farmers, depending on the capacity of oil product containers located on a farm and whether a farm has previously experienced any spills. Specifically, under the bill, certification of compliance with the EPA rule by a professional engineer would only be required if the farm has an individual tank with a storage capacity greater than 10,000 gallons, has an aggregate storage capacity greater than or equal to 42,000 gallons, or has previously experienced a spill. However, an owner or operator of a farm could provide self-certification with the SPCC rule if the farm has an aggregate storage capacity greater than 10,000 gallons, but less than 42,000 gallons, and has no history of spills. Farms with an aggregate capacity of less than or equal to 10,000 gallons and no history of a spill would be exempt from all requirements of the SPCC rule. Based on information from EPA, CBO estimates that implementing and enforcing the SPCC rule as it pertains to farmers under current law will cost $2 million over the next five years. Enacting this bill would exempt the majority of farms from complying with the rule and also would require EPA to amend the SPCC rule for farms and develop guidance and outreach material to educate affected stakeholders. CBO expects that the resources necessary to support the existing rule over the next five years would instead be used to implement H.R. 311. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to H.R. 311 because enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 311 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 18, 2013 by Rep. Eric A. \\"Rick\\" Crawford (R, AR-1). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. The committee unanimous passed the bill. It was reported by the committee alongside House Report 113-375 on March 6, 2014. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 311 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 11, 2014. Debate and discussion The National Cattlemen's Beef Association supported the bill. The organization's president said that they were \\"pleased\\" that the \\"bill will keep many of our producers from having to undertake excess costs as a result of the EPA's overregulation.\\" Some Senators supported altering the SPCC rule's application to farmers, noting that rule was originally meant to regulate energy production not farms. They noted that \\"Congress has clearly established its intent to limit the impact of the SPCC rule on the agricultural sector, and to ultimately exempt the majority of it from having to comply.\\" The Senate has already passed legislation that would change this rule.

The book focuses on Sen's relationship with his daughter beginning when she was eight years old. Raising a Father is widely regarded as inspirational writing that helps other fathers understand the needs of their children and how to have a strong relationship with them.  Plot  Sen's story starts the day after September 11 and the destruction of the World Trade Center. Forced to take the next day off work, Sen takes advantage of the free time to ask his daughter what she thinks of their relationship and she says, \\"not good.\\" Challenged, Sen asks her to explain, and she says that he does not really know her. She gives him a three-question quiz: \\"Who is my best friend?\\" \\"What is my favorite restaurant?\\" \\"What is the best thing you and I have ever done?\\" Sen got all three answers wrong. The results of that conversation launched him on a journey of befriending his daughter and becoming a more thoughtful, better parent. He quit his job as Vice President of Marketing and started a home- based business that would allow him to invest more time and attention in his daughter. Sen notes that he did not want to become one of those parents who get two duty telephone calls a year. The memoir devotes some space to reminiscing about Sen's own childhood in India and the lessons he learned from his paternal grandmother. His grandmother's strict discipline and commitment to his education inspire him in his raising of his own daughter. One day, Sen who was born into the Hindu faith, finds himself wondering about religion. To his surprise, his grandmother does not forcefully advocate for Hinduism. She describes it as a \\"way of life\\" rather than a religion. Everyone must find the religion and way of life that suits him, she says.Raising a Father 8. In reviewing his performance as a father, Sen refers back to his own childhood and the example set to him by his own grandmother. The memoir moves on to Sen's immigration to the United States. He arrived in 1988 with US $320. Fifteen years later, he was widely regarded as an important voice in the world of restaurant marketing. From here, the book comes back around to Sen's moment of awareness that he did not know his daughter well enough.  Composition and Publication  Sen originally wrote the book for his daughter Raka as a present for her birthday. Later, when he decided to publish, he reviewed the stories with her and together they chose which ones would go into the printed book. Sen says that it was a collaborative project, to a great extent. In a radio interview, Sen said that he and Raka meant to inspire one parent at a time with their experiences. Subsequent to the publication of the book, Sen began giving lectures and interviews, based on the observations he made in Raising a Father. Sen also followed up on the book with an online blog that expands on some of the themes of the book such as how to stay in touch with Raka when she goes to college.  Themes  \\"Raising A Father\\" deals with the struggles to balance work and successful parenting and the specific struggles of being a single father. Though some media coverage sees a Christian message in the book, Sen says that \\"Raising a Father\\" is non-sectarian and written for everyone. Sen emphasizes the need to really know one's children, not just make assumptions about them. In describing his book, Sen said on TV Asia that he had a moment of discovery when, in looking through his daughter's closet, he found a cache of photographs that pictured her mother. His regret that she was hiding part of her identity from him informed many of his parenting decisions from that moment. Sen describes moments like these as \\"wake up calls\\" to which parents need to be attentive. The book also calls for parents to establish some way to objectively measure the quality of their relationship with their children‚Äîmuch as they would measure the success of a business or an employee. Sen describes himself as a former \\"addict\\" to work and he sees work addiction as one of the worst things that can interfere with good parenting.  Reception  Raising a Father received considerable media coverage in the United States and in Asia. In a two-part \\"Face to Face\\" series on TV Asia, interviewer Vikas Nangia featured Sen on Father's Day. Nangia described \\"Raising a Father\\" as \\"doing exceptionally well all across the United States-- matter of fact throughout North America.\\" During his interview, Sen explains the title of the book. When he was around halfway through writing it, he discovered \\"It wasn't the daughter that needed to be raised; it was the goofball dad.\\" Nangia notes that the book is not just about Sen, but that it captures universal experiences of parenthood: \\"This could be the story of your house.\\"  References  Category:American memoirs Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books ","title":"Raising a Father"},{"id":"42166578","text":"Limestone Run looking upstream in Union County, in or near Lewisburg Limestone Run (also known as Bull Run) is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Union County, Pennsylvania. It is in length. The stream flows through East Buffalo Township, Buffalo Township, and Lewisburg. Ludwig Derr once constructed a mill on the stream. Limestone Run has one named tributary: Miller Run. Course The headwaters of Limestone Run are underground. The stream begins on the western border of East Buffalo Township and the eastern border of Buffalo Township, near the community of Lochiel. The stream flows northeast for a short distance, crossing Pennsylvania Route 45, and then turns west, following Pennsylvania Route 45. After several miles, it turns briefly southeast and crosses Pennsylvania Route 45 before turning northeast and crossing the state route again. It then enters Lewisburg and turns southeast, crossing U.S. Route 15 and Pennsylvania Route 45. The stream enters the West Branch Susquehanna River in southeastern Lewisburg, near Bucknell University. =Tributaries= Limestone Run has six tributaries. Only one of them, Miller Run, is officially named. Hydrology The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the streams of the Limestone Run watershed ranges from 5.31 to 12.7 milligrams per liter. The pH ranges from 7.17 to 7.88. In 2003, the water temperature of Limestone Run and several of its tributaries was measured. The temperatures ranged from to . The alkalinity concentration in the Limestone Run watershed averages at 191 milligrams per liter. The conductivity of Limestone Run and its tributaries ranges from 0.403 milli-siemens per centimeter on the tributary Miller Run to 0.598 milli-siemens per centimeter at a point on Limestone Run on Pennsylvania Route 45. The turbidity of the waters in the watershed, as measured in nephelometric turbidity units, ranges from 4.2 in the upper reaches of Limestone Run and 6.2 on a tributary in the middle reaches of the watershed to 12.6 in Lewisburg to 25.3 in the middle reaches of Limestone Run. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the watershed of Limestone Run is approximately 0.289 to 0.29 milligrams per liter near its headwaters. In the middle reaches of the stream, the total dissolved solid concentration is approximately 0.38 to 0.388 milligrams per liter. Slightly upstream of Lewisburg, the concentration is about 0.37 or 0.38 milligrams per liter. The concentration of total dissolved solids in Lewisburg is also 0.37 or 0.38 milligrams per liter. Near the mouth, the concentration is 0.364 milligrams per liter. The total dissolved solids concentration on Limestone Run's tributaries ranges from 0.262 to 0.378 milligrams per liter. The concentration of nitrates near the source of Limestone Run was 1.2 and 5.0 milligrams per liter on September 20 and October 18, 2003, respectively. In the middle of the stream, the concentration of nitrates was 6.2 and 7.6 milligrams per liter on those dates and was 4.4 and 5.4 milligrams per liter slightly upstream of Lewisburg. The nitrate concentration in Lewisburg was 3.9 on September 20 and 5.0 on October 18 and was 3.9 and 4.9 at the mouth on those dates, respectively. These nitrate concentrations are relatively high due to the fact that Limestone Run flows through large amounts of agricultural land. There are no phosphates in the waters of Limestone Run and its tributaries, except for the headwaters, which had a phosphate concentration of 0.3 and 0.1 milligrams per liter on September 20, 2003 and October 18, 2003, respectively. The concentration of chlorides in the waters of Limestone Run and its tributaries ranged from 8.2 to 21.5 milligrams per liter on September 20, 2003. The concentration was 8.2 milligrams per liter near the stream's headwaters, 19.5 milligrams per liter in the middle reaches of the stream, 20.0 milligrams per liter slightly upstream of Lewisburg, 21.4 milligrams per liter in Lewisburg, and 21.5 milligrams per liter slightly upstream of the mouth. The chloride concentration on several of Limestone Run's tributaries ranged from 11.3 to 17.5 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sulfates in the Limestone Run watershed ranged from 25.5 to 42.1 milligrams per liter on October 18, 2003. The concentration was 25.5 milligrams per liter near the headwaters, 37.7 milligrams per liter in the middle of the stream, 40.7 milligrams per liter just upstream of Lewisburg, 42.1 milligrams per liter in Lewisburg, and 41.8 milligrams per liter near the mouth. The concentration on the stream's tributaries ranged from 29.3 to 36.2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sodium in Limestone Run ranges from 3.47 milligrams per liter near the source to 7.93 milligrams per liter near the mouth. The magnesium concentration ranges from 19.2 milligrams per liter near the stream's source to 26.5 milligrams per liter in the middle reaches of the stream. The minimum concentration of aluminum is 8 milligrams per liter upstream of Lewisburg and the maximum concentration is 15 milligrams per liter near the source. The potassium concentration ranges from 1.43 milligrams per liter upstream of Lewisburg to 2.5 milligrams per liter near the source. The concentration of calcium in the stream's waters ranges from 48.40 to 69.90 milligrams per liter near the source and the mouth, respectively. The concentration of manganese in Limestone Run ranges from 24.9 to 71.2 milligrams per liter at the stream's mouth and source, respectively. The iron concentration ranges from 103 to 135 milligrams per liter in the central reaches of the stream and near its source, respectively. The concentration of copper in the stream ranges from 0.4 to 1.6 milligrams per liter above Lewisburg and at the mouth, respectively. The zinc concentration ranges from 0.5 milligrams per liter in the middle reaches of the stream to 5.6 near the mouth. The concentration of cadmium in Limestone Run is so low as to be undetectable in some locations, but is as high as 0.06 milligrams per liter in Lewisburg. The lead concentration is so low as to be undetectable in some locations, but is as high as 0.04 milligrams per liter near the source. Parts of Limestone Run are considered to be impaired by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Geology Much of the southern part of the Limestone Run watershed is in the Wills Creek formation, which comes from the Silurian period and consists mainly of calcareous shale. The part of the watershed is composed of rocks from the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown formations, which mainly consist of shale. It is found in a small area in the southeastern part of the watershed. The Keyser and Tonoloway formations, which mainly consist of limestone and are from the Devonian and Silurian periods, are found in the northern, central, and extreme southern parts of the watershed. The Buffalo Valley is in the Limestone Run watershed. Watershed Much of the western part of the Limestone Run watershed is agricultural land. Large portions of the central and southeastern reaches of the watershed are forested land. Most of the eastern part of the watershed is on a hard surface. The communities of Lewisburg and Linntown are both in the watershed. Limestone Run drains about two thirds of the area of Lewisburg. History Limestone Run has been known in the past as Spring Run, Wilson Run, and Bull Run. Ludwig Derr built a mill on the stream in the 1700s. It was still standing in 1860. Marcus Huling once gained a tract of land on Limestone Run. David Kenedy purchased 200 acres of land on Limestone Run in 1785. In the early 1900s, some residents of Lewisburg discharged sewage into Limestone Run. Limestone Run flooded five times between 1997 and 2012. In 2012, workers overseen by the Union County Conservation District did work to stabilize the banks of Limestone Run and altered the channel of the stream. Biology The concentration of E. coli in the waters of Limestone Run and its tributaries ranges from 90 to 1150 colonies per 100 milliliters. The areas with the highest concentration of E. coli also have high concentrations of algae. Livestock have access to Limestone Run in its upper and middle reaches. Canada geese and wood ducks are found on the stream upstream of Lewisburg.

In 2005, he gained fame for his drawings for :Machi (hip hop group) CD sleeve design and the band's music videos. He won several Taiwanese Music awards including MTV's CD cover Design of the Year. With the boom in the Taiwanese music industry, Loh set up Invasion Studios with Jeff ÈªÉÁ´ãÊàê and his brother Stanley Huang to design album covers and music videos. With the advancement of MP3 and music downloads, the industry declined and Loh turned the direction of Invasion Studios towards art and animation. His work both as a commercial and fine artist marked a new approach to art practices in Taiwan. In 2006, he exhibited his work in a joint show titled \\"COLLISION\\"http://niceproduce.com/events/collision%3A+a+jahan+x+crash+exhibition/ with John Matos at Singapore's art centre, Esplanade ‚Äì Theatres on the Bay.Wong, Don. \\"When art and graffiti collide\\", The Straits Times, Singapore, 18 May 2006. This was the first graffiti art show held in a formal art institution in Singapore. In 2007, Loh signed with MINGART Gallery and held his first Taipei solo pop art exhibition in 2008. The controversial exhibition \\"CHERRY POP II\\" depicted suggestive nude paintings and sculptures, which gained him a lot of attention from the media. Taiwanese critics acknowledged Loh as one of the key artist which has made Singapore POP art international. In 2008, Loh was selected for 8Q-RATE, the inaugural exhibitionhttp://news.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20080814-82296.html of 8Q SAM in Singapore. Loh took a year's sabbatical after this show. He returned to his art and held his solo show in Beijing's 798 Art Zone, which was sponsored by VANS in 2009. His exhibition \\"THE GREAT WALL\\" http://www.kidulty.com/blog/detail/4811 was the nation's first street art exhibition.http://www.kickerclub.com/2009/10/vans-%E2%80%9Coff-the- wall%E2%80%9D-x-jahan-loh-%E2%80%9Cthe-great-wall%E2%80%9D/ From 2010, Loh created paintings of iconic pop objects as a collective with Jakuan Melendez and Edison Chen who went by the moniker \\"Etelier Des Chene\\". The trio named themselves Treacherous Treis and showcased their work at the Museum of Art & Design, Singapore. After spending 9 years in Taiwan, he returned to Singapore and created a series of work named RECONSTITUTED PHILOSOPHIES.http://www.esplanade.com.sg/whats_on/programme_info/cherry_poke/index.jsp Loh began to paint contemporary still lifes of luncheon meat and syrup cans, using the common everyday objects to express his cultural diaspora. This collection of works, which included an installation titled \\"Cherry Poke\\", exhibited at his second show at the Esplanade in 2011. In the same year, some of those works were selected by the Andy Warhol foundation to be showcased in Andy Warhol's exhibition, 15 Minutes Eternal, at ArtScience Museum Marina Bay Sands.http://www.thepeakmagazine.com/sg/pursuit/may2012 In 2012, Loh's art was once again featured in a private showcase by SAATCHI & SAATCHI. In 2013, Loh recontextualized iconography and pop cultural in a solo show \\"WORKING CLASS HEROES\\"http://www.zaobao.com.sg/culture/arts/story20130622-219201 at CHAN HAMPE Galleries at Raffles Hotel. His paintings paid tribute to the everyday unseen heroes and had pop and religious references that explored a contemporary examination of Singapore and the world. A brass sculpture was the highlight of the show, the result of frequent trips Loh made to a foundry in Thailand where he created 3-dimensional relief sculptures of Jesus using the lost-wax casting technique. In the months during production, the foundry met with fire mishap which burnt down the entire factory. Loh's 6 brass sculptures came out unharmed. In August that year, Loh held a joint art exhibition with skate legend, Steve Caballero, in Hong Kong. Titled Double Dragons, the show featured illustrations that revolved around that theme.

Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption if they went on to later use healthcare. The affidavit would be filed with their tax returns. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background There was a previous version of the bill in the 112th United States Congress that also had bipartisan support. Currently, the Amish and Old Order Mennonites are exempt from the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. This bill would extend that exemption to Christian Scientists. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Equitable Access to Care and Health Act or the EACH Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage. The bill would define \\"medical health care\\" to mean voluntary health treatment by or supervised by a medical doctor that would be covered under minimum essential coverage that: (1) includes voluntary acute care treatment at hospital emergency rooms, walk- in clinics, or similar facilities; and (2) excludes treatment not administered or supervised by a medical doctor, physical examinations or treatment required by law or third parties, and vaccinations. Procedural history The Equitable Access to Care and Health Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 26, 2013 by Rep. Aaron Schock (R, IL-18). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 1814 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 11, 2014. By that time, the bill had received 216 co-sponsors, 78 of which were Democrats. Debate and discussion Rep. Schock and Rep. William R. Keating (D-MA), who co- sponsored the bill at its introduction, wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, \\"we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse.\\" According to Grace- Marie Turner of the National Review, that bill would not \\"fix\\" Obamacare, but would make \\"an important statement about bipartisan support for religious liberty.\\" The American Humanist Association opposed the bill and urged its members to contact their representatives and tell them to oppose the bill as well. According to the American Humanist Association, \\"religious freedom is being misrepresented by those who support this bill, and it‚Äôs time for those who really care about our First Amendment rights and the health of children to step up and be heard.\\" Actor Val Kilmer traveled to Washington, D.C., reportedly to lobby in favor of the bill. Kilmer is a Christian Scientist, one of the religious groups expected to receive an exemption to the individual mandate under this legislation.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1997 until November 2003 he won fourteen of his twenty-six races. He had his greatest success in the 1998/1999 National Hunt season when he dominated the novice hurdle division in Britain, winning all seven of his races including the Classic Novices' Hurdle, Winter Novices' Hurdle, River Don Novices' Hurdle, Royal & SunAlliance Novices' Hurdle and Mersey Novices' Hurdle. After missing the next season he returned to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle and the Aintree Hurdle, easily defeating Best Mate in the latter race. When switched to steeplechasing he won the Dipper Novices' Chase and the Mildmay Novices' Chase but was never as effective as he had been over hurdles. Background Barton was a light-coated chestnut horse with a white blaze bred in Somerset by the Conkwell Grange Stud. During his racing career he stood over seventeen hands high making him an unusually large Thoroughbred: he was described as having a \\"narrow frame\\" and a long neck. He was probably the best horse sired by the French-bred stallion Port Etienne. His dam was a French mare named Peanuts, which made Barton one of the few notable racehorses produced by Thoroughbred family 42. Despite her heritage, Peanuts and her descendants were not technically Thoroughbreds as she was a great-granddaughter of Calibres, a mare whose pedigree included desert-bred Arabian stallions Telmese and Kahil El Adjouz. As a yearling colt in November 1994, Barton was sent to the Doncaster sales but was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of 3,300 guineas. He was acquired privately by the businessman Stanley Clarke (who lived in the village of Barton-under-Needwood) and sent into training with Charlie Brooks at Lambourn in Berkshire. Racing career =1997/1998 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races= Barton made his debut in a National Hunt Flat race at Huntingdon Racecourse on 10 October 1997. He showed a good deal of temperament, whipping round at the start and then fighting the attempts of Gerry Brace his inexperienced jockey to restrain him in the early stages. He appeared to win the race easily at odds of 4/1 but was disqualified for briefly running off the course just after half way. On his only other appearance that season he finished second when 8/11 favourite for a similar event at Bangor-on-Dee. Before the start of the next season, Brooks retired from training and Barton was sent to Yorkshire to be trained by Tim Easterby. Brooks said of the horse \\"physically he was forward, but mentally he was backward\\". Easterby said that on his arrival Barton was \\"a big, awkward jumper. We just kept jumping him twice a week down our row of eight small logs\\". =1998/1999 National Hunt season: Novice hurdle races= In the 1998/1999 National Hunt season, Barton competed in novice hurdle races and was partnered in all seven of his starts by the Irish jockey Lorcan Wyer. He made his debut over obstacles at Wetherby Racecourse on 14 October and won by two lengths from Freelander at odds of 4/5. Eleven days later at the same course he was moved up in distance for a race over two miles seven furlongs and won \\"very easily\\" by six lengths despite some jumping errors. In the following month, Barton was moved up in class for the Grade II Classic Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles at Uttoxeter Racecourse. He took the lead three hurdle from the finish and went clear of his five opponents to win by six lengths in \\"impressive\\" style. In December, Barton started 8/11 favourite in a field of seven for the Winter Novices Hurdle at Sandown Park Racecourse. He took the lead at the second last and quickly went four lengths clear. He appeared to idle on the run-in and had to be \\"shaken up\\" by Wyer to hold off the late challenge of King's Road by half a length. King's Road went on to record Grade I victories in the Challow Novices' Hurdle and the Sefton Novices' Hurdle before the end of the season. On 30 January, Barton prepared for the Cheltenham Festival with a run in the River Don Novices' Hurdle at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead at the third last hurdle, accelerated clear and survived a bad mistake at the last to win by fifteen lengths from Major Sponsor. At Cheltenham on 17 March, Barton started 2/1 favourite for the Grade I Royal & SunAlliance Novices' Hurdle against seventeen opponents including King's Road, Behrajan (Tolworth Hurdle) and the undefeated Irish challenger Alexander Banquet. In the build-up to the race, Easterby, who had been considering the Stayers' Hurdle as an alternative target, described the horse as being \\"as good a horse as we've had in a long time... [he has] got class and he's got speed. He also gets the trip and jumps well. He's got everything really, although he still needs luck and a good run through the race, which you can never count on at Cheltenham\\". Wyer positioned Barton just behind the leaders before moving up to take the lead at the second last, where the horse made a slight mistake. He quickened away from the field approaching the last and won by nine lengths from the Jenny Pitman-trained outsider Artadoin Lad. Recalling the race on his retirement a year later, Wyer was critical of his own riding, saying \\"my five-year-old daughter could have done a more accomplished job\\" before adding that \\"the walk back to the winner's enclosure on Barton was pure magic\\". Barton's final appearance of the season came in the Mersey Novices' Hurdle at the Grand National meeting at Aintree Racecourse in April. He was made the 2/5 favourite with only the Rossington Main Novices' Hurdle winner Tonoco seriously backed against him. The race turned into a contest between Barton and the German-bred five-year- old Auetaler, with the favourite taking the advantage after the last hurdle and winning by two lengths from his rival, to whom he was conceding eight pounds. After the race, Barton was found to have tendon injuries in both forelegs and missed the whole of the next season. Easterby said \\"It's no use messing about and thinking we could give him a bit of time bring him back after Christmas. He wants the season off. It's obviously very disappointing but these things happen and there's nothing you can do about it\\". =2000/2001 National Hunt season= By the time Barton returned to racing, Lorcan Wyer had retired and Tony Dobbin took over as his regular jockey. He made his comeback at Newcastle Racecourse on 25 November 2000 in the Grade II Fighting Fifth Hurdle. Despite his nineteen-month absence and the fact that he was racing over the minimum distance of two miles for the first time over hurdles he was made the 8/13 favourite against five opponents. He took the lead three hurdles from the finish and won his eighth consecutive race by seven lengths from The French Furze. After the race, Dobbin said \\"his jumping was awesome. He gave me a good feel all the way. I was very impressed with him\\" while Easterby commented \\"we have to work him on his own at home because he breaks the hearts of the others. Nothing can get near him\\". In December he started 5/2-second favourite for the Bula Hurdle at Cheltenham but sustained his first defeat in over three years as he was beaten six lengths by the Nicky Henderson-trained five-year-old Geos. Barton was moved back up in distance for the Grade I Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham in January and started 2/1 joint-favourite, but tired in the closing stages and finished fifth, more than fifty lengths behind the winner Lady Rebecca. The 2001 Cheltenham Festival was postponed and then cancelled owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Barton returned at Aintree on 7 April when he started at odds of 9/1 for the Grade I Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles in which he was opposed by seven rivals including Best Mate and Landing Light. Racing on heavy ground, he tracked the leaders before taking the lead after the second last and drew away to win by fourteen lengths from Best Mate despite being eased down by Dobbin in the closing stages. Best Mate went on to win the next three runnings of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. At the end of April Sandown Park Racecourse staged a series of races intended as substitutes for the major races lost as a result Cheltenham's cancellation including the Grade I Championship Hurdle, a substitute for the Champion Hurdle. Barton started alongside Geos on 11/2, with the French mare Bilboa being made the 7/4 favourite. He raced just behind the leaders, but after a mistake at the second last he appeared to be outpaced and finished fourth behind Landing Light, Geos and Valiramix. =2001/2002 National Hunt season: Novice chases= In the following season Barton competed in novice steeplechases. On his first appearance over larger obstacles he started odds-on favourite at Wetherby on 2 November but after taking the lead he was overtaken at the last fence and beaten by the Mary Reveley-trained seven-year-old October Mist. Two weeks later at Newcastle he recorded his first steeplechase win, beating eight opponents \\"very easily\\" by twenty lengths. He added two victories against modest opposition in December, winning by twelve lengths at Newcastle and by twenty-one lengths at Wetherby. The gelding was moved up in class on 12 January when he contested the Grade II Dipper Novices' Chase over two and a half miles at Newcastle. He survived a serious jumping error at the sixth fence (where his main betting rival Hussard Collonges fell) before taking the lead four out and winning by thirty lengths from Errand Boy. Barton returned from the race with a bad cut on his left forefoot after losing a shoe, but the injury was not serious. When it was suggested that Barton's opposition over fences had been poor, Easterby responded \\"there's nowt good enough to take him on\\" and added \\"he's one in a million this 'oss, he gallops, he jumps, goes on any ground\\". At the 2002 Cheltenham Festival, Easterby opted to run Barton in the Arkle Challenge Trophy over two miles rather than the three-mile Royal & SunAlliance Chase (which was won by Hussard Collonges). Starting the 9/2 third favourite, he never looked likely to win and weakened in the closing stages to finish seventh behind the Irish-trained Moscow Flyer, beaten more than thirty length by the winner. At Aintree a month later, Barton started 3/1 favourite for the Grade II Mildmay Novices' Chase over three miles and one furlong and won by ten lengths from Southern Star having taken the lead three fences from the finish. =2002/2003 National Hunt season= Barton remained in training but failed to recapture his best form. At the start of the 2002/2003 National Hunt season he was considered a serious contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup but was well beaten in all of his four races. In November 2003 he showed signs of a return when he finished second by a neck to his stable companion Turgeonev when carrying top weight of 165 pounds in a handicap chase at Wetherby, but he never ran again. Barton was euthanised in June 2004 in the same week as fellow Cheltenham Festival winner La Landiere.

This would have the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. This change is seen by supporters as a way to incentivize small businesses to hire more veterans. Rodney L. Davis of Illinois' 13th congressional district introduced the bill into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress, on November 13, 2013. The bill passed into the House on March 11, 2014. The United States Senate began working on the bill in May 2014, when it decided to amend the bill so that it could serve as the legislative vehicle for the EXPIRE Act. The EXPIRE Act would extend a variety of tax credits that expired at the end of 2013. Background Roughly 8 million veterans received health coverage through the Veterans Administration in 2013. Over 50 different tax breaks, in addition to the Research & Experimentation Tax Credit, expired at the end of 2013. Provisions of the bill =Provisions of the Hire More Heroes Act of 2013= This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit an employer, for purposes of determining whether such employer is an applicable large employer and thus required to provide health care coverage to its employees under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to exclude employees who have coverage under a health care program administered by the United States Department of Defense (DOD), including TRICARE, or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). =Provisions of the EXPIRE Act= The EXPIRE Act would cost $85 billion. It would extend a variety of tax credits and tax relief measures, including the research and development tax credit. It also includes provisions providing incentives for the wind industry. Procedural history The Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 13, 2013 by Rep. Rodney Davis (R, IL-13). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3474 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 11, 2014. The House voted on March 11, 2014 to pass the bill in Roll Call Vote 115 by a vote of 406-1. On May 13, 2014, the United States Senate voted in Recorded Vote 143 to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3474, passing the motion 96-3. This meant that the Senate agreed to move on to considering H.R. 3474 as their next action, which they were expected to consider for a week. Instead of addressing the question of excluding veterans from the count of employees under the Affordable Care Act, the Senate was expected to amend the bill so that it could serve as the legislative vehicle for the EXPIRE Act. The EXPIRE Act would be easier for the House to pass if the Senate sends it to that chamber as an amendment to a House-passed bill instead of a newly arrived Senate bill. Debate and discussion =Debate over the Hire More Heroes Act of 2013= One of the bill's co-sponsors, Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL), wrote in favor of the bill saying that the employer health insurance mandate \\"is just another costly burden that discourages employers from expanding their workforce, and our economy cannot afford it. Lifting this burden on small businesses is a win for our veterans and our economy.\\" Rep. Davis, who introduced the bill said that the bill \\"gives our small businesses another incentive to hire veterans, which helps to address the increasing number of unemployed veterans, while providing them with some relief from ObamaCare.\\" =Debate about the EXPIRE Act= The Club for Growth, a conservative group, objected to the legislation and called it a \\"special-interest orgy.\\" Wind energy related tax provisions in the Senate bill would cost almost $13 billion and are opposed by some Republicans. On May 9, 2014, the House passed the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress), a bill that would make permanent the Research & Experimentation Tax Credit, a business tax credit for companies pursuing research and development projects in the United States. The credit was created in 1981, has been renewed multiple times, and recently expired.Encyclopedia of Taxation and Tax Policy, By Joseph J. Cordes, Robert D. Ebel, Jane Gravelle, Urban Institute, pages 330-332 Since the Senate's EXPIRE Act has a similar provision to extend this tax credit, there is some hope that the two parties will be able to compromise about it. However, the major difference between the two is that the House is making some tax extenders permanent, while the Senate is still pushing for a variety of shorter extensions, as has been traditionally done. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said that the bill \\"will help countless Americans\\" and \\"bring American families and the economy a fair shot.\\" Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), the Senate Finance Committee chairman, said that his \\"first choice\\" would be to pass tax reform immediately, but that \\"the reality is that tax reform is not happening tomorrow. Reaching a bipartisan, comprehensive plan is going to take time and work.\\" Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) argued that \\"rather than blindly extending these provisions, what we ought to do is eliminate these wasteful extenders which are really just subsidies\\" such as the production tax credit. According to Flake, due to the United States' debt of $17.5 trillion, subsidies need to be eliminated.

This would mean that there is no requirement that volunteer emergency responders be offered health care by the organization they volunteer with. The bill was proposed in the 113th United States Congress as , and passed, but the text of the bill was modified, ultimately turning the bill into a defense authorization. In the United States Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid chose to use the bill as a legislative vehicle to pass an extension of federal long-term unemployment insurance benefits. When the bill reached the senate, Reid added substantial provisions on unemployment, renaming the bill the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014. The bill passed the Senate with the new unemployment language. The bill was passed into law as Carl Levin and Howard P. \\"Buck\\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. () The language of the original bill was passed in the 114th congress. Background The employer mandate is a penalty that will be incurred by employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. This provision was included as a disincentive for employers considering dropping their current insurance plans once the insurance exchanges began operating as an alternative source of insurance. Proponents of the reform law wanted to address the parts of the healthcare system they believed to not be working well, while causing minimal disruption to those happy with the coverage they have. Provisions of the bill =The Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act= The Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a bona fide volunteer providing firefighting and prevention services, emergency medical services, or ambulance services to a state or local government or a tax-exempt organization shall not be counted in determining the number of full-time employees of an employer for purposes of the employer mandate to provide health care coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. =Unemployment insurance= H.R. 3979, as amended by the Senate, would extend the federal unemployment insurance program for another five months. One of the provisions, planned by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Dean Heller (R-NV), would provide the people whose unemployment benefits ended on December 28, 2013 with retroactive benefits. This would affect more than 2 million people. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on February 4, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3979 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude volunteer hours of volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel from counting towards the calculation of the number of a firm‚Äôs full-time employees for purposes of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Those provisions require certain employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to either offer health care coverage of a certain standard or be subject to penalties. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that H.R. 3979 would have no significant budgetary effect because the U.S. Treasury Department has issued final regulations that, by CBO‚Äôs and JCT‚Äôs assessment, provide the same treatment for those groups as H.R. 3979. Enacting H.R. 3979 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 31, 2014 by Rep. Lou Barletta (R, PA-11). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On February 4, 2014, the bill was ordered reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-360. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3979 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 11, 2014. At the time, the bill had 106 co-sponsors, 15 of which were Democrats. The House passed the bill in Roll Call Vote 116 410-0 on March 11, 2014. In the United States Senate, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to use the bill as a legislative vehicle for passing another extension of federal unemployment for people who have been unemployed a long time. The new bill still contains the original material about volunteer responders, but now focuses on extending unemployment insurance. Reid used the volunteer responders bill as a vehicle \\"as a way to more easily send the UI extension bill back to the House.\\" Debate and discussion =The Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act= Rep. Barletta, who sponsored the bill, argued that it is necessary because the Internal Revenue Service had initially said that it would be requiring organizations to provide these volunteers with insurance, something that would be prohibitively expensive for some of them. The Department of the Treasury, which the IRS is part of, announced on January 10 that these volunteers would not be required to be provided with insurance, but supporters still wanted to make that \\"crystal clear in statute\\" instead of relying on a mere rule. The bill had the supporter of the National Volunteer Fire Council, which said it \\"appreciates the bi-partisan support that we've received on this issue.\\" =Unemployment insurance= The House was considered unlikely to take up the Senate's revised bill, since Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) said the House would not be considering the bill since it lacked any measures to improve job creation. Senator Reid argued that the bill should be passed because \\"unemployment benefits stimulate the economy quicker and faster than any other thing.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Health insurance mandate *Unemployment in the United States *Unemployment benefits Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3979 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3979 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3979 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3979 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3979 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 3979 Category:Acts of the 114th United States Congress Category:Legislation attempting to reform or repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ","title":"Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act"},{"id":"42167059","title":"Field hockey at the 2014 South American Games"},{"id":"42167069","text":"Trawny in 2015 Peter Trawny (born December 17, 1964 in Gelsenkirchen) is a German philosopher and professor at the University of Wuppertal. Life Peter Trawny studied philosophy, musicology and art history at the Ruhr University Bochum, where he, after a guest stay at the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg in Breisgau and at the University of Basel, the Magisterium graduated in 1992. In 1995, he received his doctorate at Klaus Held with a dissertation on Martin Heidegger's phenomenology of the world. With a doctoral scholarship from the Study Foundation of the German people, he was promoted and awarded in 1997 with the Second Prize of all faculties of the University of Wuppertal. This was followed by a two-month stay at the University of Kyoto in Japan with a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Starting in 1997, Trawny was a research assistant at the University of Wuppertal in Klaus Held's department of phenomenology. In 2000 he completed his habilitation at the University of Wuppertal about the time of the Trinity. Studies on the Trinity in Hegel and Schelling. Sponsored by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, after his habilitation he worked from 2001 to 2003 at the philosophy department of the Freiburg Albert Ludwigs University. In 2005, the German Literature Archive in Marbach on Neckar granted Trawny a full scholarship and honored him in 2006 with the Ernst J√ºnger grant from the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the same year he was appointed associate professor of philosophy at the University of Wuppertal. 2009 brought Trawny a W3 professorship at the University of Wuppertal for aesthetics and philosophy of culture. In 2011 he assumed a deputy professor at the S√∂dert√∂rns H√∂gskola in Stockholm at the Center for Baltic and East European Studies. In 2012 Trawny founded the Martin Heidegger Institut in German at the Bergische Universit√§t in Wuppertal, for whose support he would win, among others, the legacy of Heidegger.http://www.philosophie.uni-wuppertal.de/home/forschung/institute- und-zentren.html#c10940 (Stand: 24.

Scientific work Trawnys approach to philosophical problems uses a phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The focus of his work are questions of political philosophy, ethics, art and media philosophy, as well as questions of art and literature. In his most recent works, Trawny dedicated to the elaboration of a philosophical understanding of globalization and cosmopolitanism, which in itself Adyton suggests, and especially in medium and Revolution clearly differentiated. Trawny tries to interpret the globalization of their strained relationship with the media and thus comes to a determination of the medium as \\"the immaterial unity of technology and capital\\". On the basis of Heidegger's event thinking tries Trawny the Marxist revolution discourse in the historical-contextual conditions of the 21st Century to translate, thus intertwined with those of its designation of the medium, the questions of political philosophy and media art philosophy. In addition to his research and teaching, Trawny is consistently involved in the scholarly edition of Martin Heidegger's collected works.

The policy is most often seen in United Nations style diplomatic meetings where a particular group of countries wishes to take action or make a joint statement but is unable to do so without the consensus of all parties involved. Gift basket diplomacy fundamentally is collective action agreed by smaller groups of participants that goes beyond the lowest common denominator consensus that larger groups often reach in large multilateral fora. The United States first introduced Gift basket diplomacy in 2011 during the Nuclear Security Summit preparation process and more than 30 countries participated in fourteen Gift basket diplomacy statements at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul.U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, , ‚ÄúNuclear Security: Seoul, The Netherlands, and Beyond‚Äù, 2013  Introduction  Gift basket diplomacy is an attempt to solve the \\"lowest common denominator\\" problem of multilateral diplomacy. In United Nations style fora when countries issue a communiqu√©, or statement about their activities, a common process is for all countries to agree in consensus to the precise wording of a document or some output that characterizes their discussion. For issues with large numbers of countries, it becomes difficult to build complete consensus on a document without most countries having to give up much of the language they had proposed. This process leads to a series of scaled-back drafts where countries adjust their language to ever weaker positions in order to negotiate consensus. It is not uncommon for countries to be disappointed in a final communiqu√© because they had to discard much of their language in order to appease other countries with significantly opposing views. The result often is a communiqu√© document with heavily caveated with hedged language that provides ample wiggle room so that participants can justify not following through on commitments. Gift basket diplomacy attempts to circumvent the need for consensus by seeking out like-minded parties who support similar language in a document and agreeing among these smaller groups to particular language or negotiating position.The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, , ‚ÄúFact Sheet: 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit‚Äù, retrieved 10 March 2014 These smaller groups often more quickly finalize negotiations amongst themselves and issue a joint statement on their own without the consensus or agreement of the larger group. The result usually is much stronger language or pledges for more concrete action with fewer caveats.  First use of \\"Gift basket diplomacy\\"  The United States first implemented Gift basket diplomacy in the Nuclear Security Summit process between the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.Belfer Center at Harvard University, , ‚ÄúPast Nuclear Security Summits‚Äù, Retrieved 10 March 2014 National Security Council (NSC) Director for Nuclear Threat Reduction Shawn Gallagher is credited with conceiving and first proposing Gift basket diplomacy while NSC Senior Director for WMD Terrorism and Threat Reduction Laura Holgate and White House WMD Czar Gary Samore are credited with first implementing the policy.White House Press Briefing, , ‚ÄúPress Briefing with Jay Carney, Ben Rhodes, and Shawn Gallagher‚Äù, 27 March 2012 To overcome the continued watering down of the draft Communiqu√© in negotiations between the 58 participants in the Seoul Summit, the United States adopted a negotiating strategy of working in smaller groups to agree on concrete actions that countries felt their leaders could pledge to take together at the Seoul Summit. The United States proposed that smaller groups agree to collective action at preparatory Sherpa Meetings in 2011 and 2012 with the aim of these groups issuing Gift basket diplomacy statements at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul.Department of State , ‚ÄúAmbassador Bonnie D. Jenkins Coordinator for Threat Reduction Programs, Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation‚Äù, 10 April 2012  Origin of the term ‚ÄúGift basket\\"  The origin of the ‚ÄúGift basket‚Äù terminology is rooted in the use of ‚ÄúHouse Gifts‚Äù in the 2010 Washington Nuclear Security Summit. During preparatory meetings for the 2010 Summit, countries pledged a series of actions they intended to take to improve nuclear security. These actions became collegially known as ‚ÄúHouse Gifts‚Äù that each head of state would give to the world as they gathered to discuss nuclear security. Gift baskets are an extension of house gifts in the sense that they are groupings of similar commitments presented as collective action.European Leadership Network, , ‚ÄúImproving Nuclear Security Governance through the Nuclear Security Summits‚Äù, 4 September 2013  Subsequent use of term  After the United States‚Äô proposals for these collective action Gift baskets, several other countries initiated Gift basket diplomacy processes.

Although the theory is for smaller groups of countries to agree to a certain text and then offer the language to the entire set of participating countries for consideration; in practice that has worked in some but not all instances. Countries have criticized this diplomatic tactic as a way to exclude them from signing up to a statement they otherwise might have agreed to. When the document is not made available to all countries for possible participation, some countries may be seen in a negative light for not having signed the document. These countries argue that they never were given the opportunity. A second criticism is that issuing Gift basket diplomacy statements breaks the consensus building process and ultimately devalues the efficacy of a truly united and complete set of countries. Some argue that this process undermines the value of a consensus communiqu√© because more focus is given to separate Gift basket diplomacy statements given their often stronger language with fewer caveats.

It builds upon the integrative approach of mechatronics, but not with the aim of only improving the functionality of a machine. Mechatronics is the multidisciplinary field of science and engineering that merges mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science to improve and optimize product design and manufacturing. In ecomechatronics, additionally, functionality should go hand in hand with an efficient use and limited impact on resources. Machine improvements are targeted in 3 key areas: energy efficiency, performance and user comfort (noise & vibrations). Machine as a system requiring energy and consumables to transform an input into an output, thereby generating emissions (heat, noise, ...) Schematic of a mechatronical system consisting of a controller, amplifier, drive, mechanical structure and sensors  Description  Among policy makers and manufacturing industries there is a growing awareness of the scarcity of resources and the need for sustainable development. This results in new regulations with respect to the design of machines (e.g. European Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC) and to a paradigm shift in the global machines market: \\"instead of maximum profit from minimum capital, maximum added value must be generated from minimal resources\\". Manufacturing industries increasingly require high performance machines that use resources (energy, consumables) economically in a human-centered production. Machine building companies and original equipment manufacturers are thus urged to respond to this market demand with a new generation of high performance machines with higher energy efficiency and user comfort. Evolution of crude oil price. Data source: Statistical Review of World Energy 2013, BP A reduction of the energy consumption lowers energy costs and reduces environmental impact. Typically more than 80% of the total-life-cycle impact of a machine is attributed to its energy consumption during the use phase. Therefore, improving a machine's energy efficiency is the most effective way of reducing its environmental impact. Performance quantifies how well a machine executes its function and is typically related to productivity, precision and availability. User comfort is related to the exposure of operators and the environment to noise & vibrations due to machine operation. Since energy efficiency, performance and noise & vibrations are coupled in a machine they need to be addressed in an integrated way in the design phase. Example of the interrelation between the 3 key areas: with increasing machine speed typically the machine‚Äôs productivity increases, but energy consumption will increase as well and machine vibrations may grow such that machine accuracy (e.g. positioning accuracy) and availability (due to downtime and maintenance) decrease. Ecomechatronical design deals with the trade-off between these key areas.  Approach  Ecomechatronics impacts the way mechatronical systems and machines are being designed and implemented. Therefore, the transformation to a new generation of machines concerns knowledge institutes, original equipment manufacturers, CAE software suppliers, machine builders and industrial machine owners. The fact that about 80% of the environmental impact of a machine is determined by its design puts emphasis on making the right technological design choices. A model-based, multidisciplinary design approach is required in order to address the energy efficiency, performance and user comfort of a machine in an integrated way. The key enabling technologies can be categorized in machine components, machine design methods & tools, and machine control. A few examples are listed below per category. Machine components * Energy efficient electrical motors: cf. energy efficiency classes of electric motors, ecodesign requirements for electric motors * Variable frequency drives: variable motor speed enables energy reduction with respect to fixed speed applications * Variable hydraulic pumps: energy reduction by adapting to required pressure and flow (e.g. variable displacement pump, load sensing pump) * Energy storage technologies: electrical (battery, capacitor, supercapacitor), hydraulical (accumulator), kinetic energy (flywheel), pneumatic, magnetic (superconducting magnetic energy storage) Design methods & tools * Energetic simulations: using energetic machine models and empirical data (e.g. energy efficiency maps) to estimate the machine's energy consumption in the design phase * Energy demand optimization: e.g. load leveling in order to avoid peaks in power demand * Hybridization: applying at least one other, intermediate energy form in order to reduce primary power source consumption e.g. in vehicles with internal combustion engines (see hybrid vehicle drivetrain) * Vibro-acoustic analysis: study of the noise & vibrations signature of a machine in order to localize and differentiate between their root causes * Multibody modeling: simulation of the interaction forces and displacements of coupled rigid bodies, e.g. to assess the effect of vibration dampers on a mechanical structure * Active vibration damping: e.g. use of piezoelectric bearings for active control of machine vibrations * Rapid control prototyping: provides a fast and inexpensive way for control and signal processing engineers to verify designs early and evaluate design tradeoffs Machine control * Energy consumption minimization: control signals are optimized for minimum energy consumption * Energy management of energy storage systems: controlling the power flows and state-of-charge of an energy storage system with the aim of achieving maximum energy benefit and maximum system lifespan * Model-based control: taking advantage of system models to improve the outcome (accuracy, reaction time, ...) of the controlled system * (Self-)learning control: control self-adapting to the system and its changing environment, reducing the need for control parameter tuning and adaptation by the control engineer * Optimal machine control: the control of the system is regarded as an optimization problem to which the control rules are considered the optimal solution (see Optimal control)  Applications  Some examples of ecomechatronical system applications are: * Komatsu PC200-8 Hybrid: the world's first hybrid excavator has an energy storage system based on supercapacitors. The energy recuperation in the hydraulic drive line during braking results in a significant improvement of fuel economy. * Hybrid bus: different hybrid bus types have been commercialized (e.g. ExquiCity bus by Van Hool), using fuel cells or a diesel engine as a primary energy source and batteries and/or supercapacitors as energy storage systems. * Hybrid tram vehicle: hybridization in tram vehicles enables energy recuperation as well as mobility without overhead lines, as applied in e.g. some of the Combino Supra tram vehicles by Siemens Transportation Systems. The system uses a combination of traction batteries and supercapacitors.

It premiered on March 9, 2014, simultaneously on various Fox television networks, including National Geographic Channel, FX, Fox Life, and others. The episode is presented by the series host astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, directed by Brannon Braga, produced by Livia Hanich and Steven Holtzman, and written by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter. The series represents a follow-up of the 1980s television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage by Carl Sagan, now hosted by Tyson, and explores astronomy, space and time, astrophysics, biology, and other diverse areas of science. In this episode, Tyson takes a tour of the Solar System and the Milky Way galaxy, explores the life of Renaissance philosopher Giordano Bruno and his vision of the cosmos, goes through a Cosmic Calendar from the beginning of the universe until the present, and ends with a tribute to Carl Sagan. The episode was first presented with a brief introduction by the President of the United States Barack Obama. The episode received positive reviews by critics, but was criticized on issues like the historical accuracy in the presentation of Giordano Bruno's life. It was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series at the 66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, an award it won.  Episode summary  The astronomical theories of Giordano Bruno (1548‚Äì1600) and their reception by the Catholic Church were featured in the episode's narrative sequence. The episode begins with Tyson setting off on the \\"Ship of the Imagination\\" to discover Earth‚Äôs cosmic address within the Virgo Supercluster and its place in space and time. As the viewer floats along with him past the planets of our Solar System, he skims over Venus; he shows this planet's intense greenhouse effect, as well as its extremely high temperatures. Then he explores Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth, and provides the first comparison showing how Earth's size diminishes when contrasted with the Spot's expanding view. He passes Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object from Earth, and explains the Voyager Golden Record and its purpose. Tyson explains how human sight is limited in the cosmos and, as an example, shows us how extremely dark rogue planets are \\"seen\\" with infrared sensors. He then examines the bubble theory, and how our observable universe might be just a bubble in a \\"never-ending\\" set of bubbles, analogous to drops of a waterfall. In an animated segment of this episode, Tyson discusses the life and vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane)Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey ‚Äî The Voyage Continues, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Blu-ray Cat. # 2293207 as the person who championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. (Tyson subsequently dismisses Bruno's visionary experiences as unscientific, but is sympathetic to the persecution he suffered.) Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.  Production  Carl Sagan's widow Ann Druyan co-wrote the episode. Ann Druyan, Steven Soter, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson were planning on producing a new, updated sequel to Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage and continued pitching the idea to various television stations even after Sagan's death. In 2008 producer Seth MacFarlane met with Tyson at the Science & Entertainment Exchange, where Tyson told him about rebooting the Cosmos series. MacFarlane took interest in the idea and presented it to the Fox Broadcasting Company television network. \\"Standing Up in the Milky Way\\" was directed by Brannon Braga, and written by Druyan and Soter. The narrative sequence of the episode introduced the life of philosopher Giordano Bruno voiced by the series' executive producer Seth MacFarlane, and other additional characters voiced by MacFarlane and actor Paul Telfer. The special effects for the episode were done by the DIVE VFX studio from New York City including \\"dimensionalization of star clusters, galaxies and nebula\\" for the show. The episode also introduces a new \\"Ship of the Imagination\\" redesigned by concept artist Ryan Church, which was described by The Verge as \\"J.J. Abrams‚Äô Enterprise.\\" The animated sequences of the episode were produced by Kara Vallow.  Reception  The episode premiered with a 2.1/5 in the 18-49 rating/share and 5.77 million Americans watching it live on Fox. However, Nielsen estimated that a total of \\"8.5 million watched Sunday on the total of 10 Fox-owned networks, including Fox broadcast, National Geographic and FX.\\" Series executive producer Seth MacFarlane posted on the online social networking website Twitter that 12 million overall viewers watched the Cosmos premiere live in the US alone and 17.5 million with DVR. \\"Standing Up in the Milky Way\\" was critically well accepted. John Teti from The A.V. Club gave the episode a mark of \\"B\\". He stated \\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is both ambitious and quaint. It attempts to convey humanity‚Äôs most expansive ideas in the space of a weekly 44-minute TV series. That‚Äôs ambitious,\\" giving a positive review on the show's creation. He did criticize the show for its \\"sloppy scripting that crops up more often later in the episode.\\" Max Nicholson from IGN gave the episode a grade of 8.5 (\\"Great\\"), concluding \\"the docu-series is unapologetic in its somewhat controversial depiction of organized religion, but it extends an olive branch for creative thinking and plays with concepts of faith in its whimsical view of the macrocosm.\\" A positive review was also given by Slate journalist Phil Plait, who said that he sees the episode \\"as making the more interesting and bigger point about suppression of thought and the grandeur of freedom of exploration of ideas.\\" Other reviews have criticized the historical accuracy of the segment on Giordano Bruno and question why the show did not portray more important astronomers of the time period, such as Copernicus or Galileo, or earlier medieval natural philosophers, such as Nicole Oresme and Nicholas of Cusa, who presented the possibility of a plurality of worlds centuries earlier than Bruno. Reviewers also complained that the segment was historically inaccurate in its portrayal of Bruno's troubles as stemming almost entirely from his belief in many worlds. During the premier broadcast of the episode on March 9, 2014, on Oklahoma City Fox affiliate KOKH-TV, the episode was interrupted for 15 seconds. The brief interruption of the episode by an advertisement for FOX 25 Primetime News at Nine coincided with a monologue by Tyson in which he describes human evolution. KOKH issued a statement of apology for the event, which also rejected accusations that the incident was intentional, but \\"the result of operator error.\\"  References   External links   \\"Standing Up in the Milky Way\\" at National Geographic Channel Category:Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Giordano Bruno Category:Television programs directed by Brannon Braga ","title":"Standing Up in the Milky Way"},{"id":"42167298","text":"The cost of public education in Montana ranks 24th in the United States in the 2011-2012 school year on cost per pupil (K-12).

The product of an elite musical education, Wayland was known for his dedication to performing for the broadest possible audience. During a professional musical career that began in 1963, Wayland appeared as a conductor with symphony orchestras across the United States. His programming drew from a background that included Symphonic, Operatic, Chamber Music, Jazz and Musical Comedy. Wayland's symphonic arrangements were performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and recorded with the Boston Pops. In 1978, Wayland was one of a select handful of people in consideration to succeed the longtime Boston Pops Conductor, Arthur Fieldler. Wayland had a long association with WGBH/PBS television as a musical director and composer for television programs. He composed the ‚ÄúCome on and Zoom‚Äù theme song for the Emmy-award winning children's show, Zoom.  Biography  Newton Hart Wayland was born to physicians, Helen Hart and L.C. Newton Wayland, in Santa Barbara, CA. He trained as a pianist and, when he was a teenager, formed a jazz combo and chamber group. After graduating from Santa Barbara High School, Wayland attended Harvard University. While at Harvard, he started a jazz band and soon transferred to the New England Conservatory of Music, earning a Bachelor of Music degree in Arranging (1964) and a Masters in Chamber Music (1966). He earned the Chadwick Award for contributions to the Conservatory.  Conducting  Encouraged to try ‚Äúpops‚Äù by Gideon Toeplitz, Wayland found his musical and philosophical niche with popular music orchestras, preferring to perform popular music instead of opera or symphonies because through the popular tunes, he could reach a wider audience. Arthur Fieldler provided a model for Wayland's own conducting career. ‚ÄúI think his major genius, if you will, was in programming. It's a very delicate line, pops programming, because you're basically dealing with a symphony orchestra, and a symphony orchestra in the Western tradition is a rather elitist institution which prides itself . . . on the high-class status of its operation . . . So Fiedler's genius was to program material which was acceptable for that symphony orchestra, and yet which drew in a large, general public.‚Äù In 1980, at age 36, Wayland was one of the conductors in the running to replace Fiedler. Others included Mitch Miller, Henry Mancini, Franz Allers, John Williams, Frederick Fennell, Michael Sasson, John Mauceri, John Lanchbery and Norman Lyden. John Williams was ultimately selected. By 1984, Wayland was guest-conducting up to 20 symphony concerts per year. During this period, he had these requirements for his shows: first, that the concert be audience- oriented; second, to program a variety of somewhat different or unusual works, along with familiar ones; third, the concert had to be challenging for the orchestra. Wayland also wanted to challenge himself. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to rest on my laurels and do the same old stuff I know works.‚Äù He said ‚Äúlive performance can be visual and exciting ‚Äì an event; a festive occasion, in a variety of ways: improvised now happenings, audience clap-alongs and sing-alongs.‚Äù The Boston Herald dubbed Wayland ‚Äúa musician who refuses to be tied down to a single category.‚Äù His adventurous nature was exhibited throughout his conducting career, such as when he used garden hoses as instruments in his concert tribute to Arthur Fieldler.

It was first detected in Broward County, Florida in 2003, and initially identified as Euglossa viridissima, but further study revealed that E. viridissima as previously defined consisted of two cryptic species, and the one present in Florida was new to science. Taxonomy Euglossa viridissima is a species of green orchid bee from Central America in which the males have two teeth on their mandibles. The very similar bee that was first observed in Florida in 2003 was found to have three such teeth. Sequencing data from a mitochondrial gene was unable to separate E. viridissima and E. dilemma, indicating they are closely related and form a clade within Euglossa. However, microsatellite allele frequencies varied between the two groups. Males of these bees store aromatic compounds extracted from various environmental sources in pouches on their hind legs. Certain characteristic compounds present as main ingredients in these perfumes in E. dilemma were found to be absent in E. viridissima. Electroantennography found differences between the groups in olfactory sensitivity to isomers of HNDB (2-hydroxy-6-nona-1,3-dienyl-benzaldehyde). It was therefore concluded that E. dilemma is a cryptic sister species of E. viridissima. Description Green orchid bees are varying shades of glossy metallic green and can grow to a length of about . The membranous wings are dark-coloured and translucent and the female has pollen baskets on her hind legs. The male has an enlarged joint on his hind leg where there is a pit for storing substances he gathers from plants. The female but not the male possesses a sting which can be used on more than one occasion but which is not as painful to humans as a honeybee's sting. This bee is very agile in the air, hovering for lengthy periods and darting between flowers. It might be confused with sweat bees in the Halictidae family, but orchid bees have very much longer proboscises in order to gather nectar from flowers with long corolla tubes. Distribution and habitat Green orchid bee gathering nectar The native range of Euglossa dilemma is in Central America where it extends from Costa Rica to Mexico. In Florida it is thought to have originated from Mexico and arrived in the state by accident, perhaps being transported in a nest in a wooden structure such as a pallet. It was first detected in Broward County in 2003 and has since become established in Palm Beach County, Brevard County, and is expected to extend its range to most of the southern half of Florida. In its native Mexico it is found in hot dry habitats including degraded forests, pastures, parks and gardens. It is less dependent on primary forests than most Euglossine bees. Biology Male orchid bees are specialised to visit particular species of neotropical orchid. This is a mutualistic arrangement in which the male bee benefits from gathering the fragrance ingredients supplied by the flower which he stores in his hollow hind legs, and the orchid benefits by being pollinated. The male uses the fragrances during courtship. The species of orchid with which Euglossa dilemma is associated in its Central American home range is unknown, but in its new Florida habitat, it breeds successfully without the presence of any orchid, the male visiting other species of plants to gather the ingredients for his perfume. One of these plants is basil (Ocimum basilicum) and another Stemmadenia littoralis. Rotten timber and wood oozing resin is another source of fragrances. In Florida, the female bee gathers much of the pollen she collects from Senna mexicana but also visits other plants, and nectar is collected by both sexes, predominantly from Ruellia brittoniana and Tecoma stans. This bee has also been seen feeding on Hamelia patens, Cheilocostus, Tradescantia pallida and Datura. A female Euglossa dilemma kneading pollen (slow motion). There may be unexpected consequences of the naturalization of these bees in the United States. For example, in a similar situation in Florida, two fig species Ficus altissima and Ficus macrophylla have been introduced but did not spread because there was no suitable pollinator. With the arrival of the non-native wasps (Eupristina sp.), the figs acquired pollinating insects and became invasive. The male bee attracts a female by releasing his fragrance and fanning his wings to disperse it. The female builds a solitary nest out of propolis, an exudate from plants. The nest may contain up to twenty cells, in each of which she lays an egg. The female brings pollen and nectar to the nest to feed the developing larvae. Several bees may build their nests side by side but do not share the task of feeding the young.  Notes  :The males of E. viridissima almost always have two teeth; a third may be present, but it is in a different position from the third tooth of male E. dilemma.

She was one of the pioneers of the art movement across the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, which began in 2000. Since then, her paintings have gained much success. Her work is held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Queensland Art Gallery, and the National Gallery of Australia. Brown was born roughly some time during the 1930s. She was born at Purpurna, a waterhole that is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro-Australian society. In the 1950s, her family was moved out of the bush to live at Warburton, with many other Aboriginal families. Warburton was a Christian mission at the time, and Brown was taught at school here by missionaries. When she was older, Brown moved to Irrunytju and married Nyakul Dawson. Brown began work as an artist in 2000. The women of Irrunytju had opened an art centre as a community-owned economic program. Anmanari and other senior women in the community began painting for Irrunytju Arts on linen canvases. Their first exhibition was held in 2001, in Perth. The art mixed modern painting techniques with ancient designs and cultural law. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Tjayanka Woods. When Brown's husband died in 2007, she and Woods left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they paint for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne. Brown mostly paints the (Seven Sisters Dreaming). Her connection to this Dreaming comes from her mother, whose homeland is Kuru Ala, a sacred place for women. The paintings in her solo show depicted stories from this Dreaming. Brown's paintings are not figurative. She does not explicitly depict figures or features of the landscape, but she does use iconographic symbols to represent them. She uses patterned lines to represent tracks in a journey, or seven small shapes or lines to represent the sisters. She also sometimes uses colour symbolically. While Brown mainly paints directly on canvas, several of her works are made from screen-printing methods.

The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations. Although the FCC would be allowed to decide on its own transparency guidelines, it would have to report annually on how well it was meeting those guidelines. The FCC would also have to provide notice about rules it was writing and allow for comment. The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives with a voice vote during the 113th United States Congress. Background A similar bill was considered and passed by the House during the 112th United States Congress, but failed in the Senate and had little support from the Democrats. At the time, Democrats feared the bill would hurt the FCC's power to help consumers. In order to get Democratic support for this newer version, Rep. Walden, chairman of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, removed the controversial provisions that the Democrats had opposed. Changes included the removal of provisions that limited the FCC's ability to place conditions on mergers and the lack of a requirement for newly proposed FCC rules to receive a cost-benefit analysis before imposition. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complete a rulemaking proceeding to adopt rules establishing: :*minimum comment and reply periods for rulemakings; :*policies to ensure that the public has notice and an opportunity to respond to comments, ex parte communications, or materials submitted toward the end of, or after, the comment period; :*procedures for publishing the status of open rulemakings and items circulated for Commissioners' review; :*deadlines for public notice, and guidelines for disposition, of certain petitions; and :*procedures to include the specific language of proposed rules or amendments in proposed rulemaking notices. The bill would require performance measures to be included in notices of proposed rulemakings or orders that would create or substantially change a program activity. Defines \\"program activity\\" as a specific activity or project as listed in the program and financing schedules of the U.S. annual budget, including any annual collection or distribution or related series of collections or distributions by the FCC of $100 million or more. The bill would direct the FCC to seek public comment regarding whether the FCC should: (1) establish procedures for allowing a bipartisan majority of Commissioners to place items on an open meeting agenda and for publishing in advance of such meetings the text of agenda items on which the FCC will vote; (2) establish deadlines for the disposition of certain license applications; and (3) publish orders, decisions, reports, and actions within 30 days after adoption. The bill would require the FCC to initiate a new rulemaking proceeding every five years to continue its consideration of procedural rule changes. The bill would allow a bipartisan majority of Commissioners to hold a nonpublic meeting, including a meeting to collaborate with joint boards or conferences, if: (1) no votes or actions are taken, and (2) an attorney from the FCC's Office of General Counsel is present. Requires such a closed meeting to be disclosed within two business days after the meeting, along with a list of persons in attendance and a summary of discussed matters, provided that such matters are not classified or otherwise exempt from disclosure. The bill would direct the FCC to provide on its website: (1) information regarding the FCC's budget, appropriations, and total number of full-time equivalent employees; (2) the FCC's annual performance plan; and (3) information about consumer complaints in a publicly available, searchable database. The bill would direct the FCC to complete actions necessary for the required publication of documents in the Federal Register within specified time frames. The bill would require the FCC to inform the public about its performance and efficiency in meeting disclosure and other requirements under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), including by: (1) publishing on the FCC website its logs for managing FOIA requests and associated fees, (2) releasing decisions to grant or deny requests, and (3) presenting information about the number of FOIA requests received and granted or denied by the FCC in its annual budget estimates and annual performance and financial reports. The bill would direct the FCC, by January 15 of each year, to publish on its website and in other required formats an anticipated release schedule for all statistical reports and reports to Congress. The bill would require annual reports to Congress on the FCC's performance in conducting its proceedings and meeting the deadlines and guidelines established by this Act. The bill would prohibit the FCC, in compiling its quarterly report with respect to informal consumer inquiries and complaints, from categorizing an inquiry or complaint under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (places restrictions on telephone solicitations and automatic dialing systems) as a wireline or wireless inquiry or complaint unless a wireline or wireless carrier was the subject of the inquiry or complaint. The bill would exempt permanently from the Antideficiency Act (prohibits expenditures or obligations of federal funds exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund) the collection of Universal Service Fund contributions and the use of such contributions for universal service support programs. (Currently, universal service funds are collected and distributed under a temporary waiver provided in the Universal Service Antideficiency Temporary Suspension Act.) Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on December 10, 2013. THis is a public domain source. H.R. 3675 would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes. The bill also would require the FCC to create a public database of information about complaints made by consumers of telecommunications services. Finally, the bill would permanently exempt the Universal Service Fund (USF) from provisions of the Antideficiency Act. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 3675 would increase direct spending by $197 million over the 2014-2023 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting H.R. 3675 would not affect revenues. Further, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 3675 to amend the FCC's operating procedures would cost $15 million over the next five years, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts; however, the FCC is authorized to collect fees sufficient to offset the cost of its regulatory activities each year. Therefore, CBO estimates that the net cost to implement those provisions of H.R. 3675 would not be significant, assuming annual appropriation actions consistent with the agency's authorities. H.R. 3675 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. To the extent that the FCC would increase annual fee collections to offset the costs of implementing its additional regulatory activities, the bill would impose a private-sector mandate on some commercial entities regulated by the FCC. Based on information from the FCC, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would be small, and fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2013 by Rep. Greg Walden (R, OR-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On January 31, 2014, it was reported (amended) by the committee alongside House Report 113-338. On March 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 311 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on March 11, 2014. Debate and discussion The bill's sponsor, Rep. Greg Walden, indicated that the bill was written in response, among other things, to a proposed FCC study on the decisions made by newspaper editorial boards.

Description The Old Church often hosts 45th Parallel performances. 45th Parallel is a nonprofit organization and chamber music performance group based in Portland, Oregon. The group was founded in 2009 by Gregory Ewer, a violinist for the Oregon Symphony, out of a love for chamber music and his desire to collaborate with Pacific Northwest musicians. Ewer continues to serve as artistic director of 45th Parallel. The group often performs at The Old Church, which Ewer described as \\"Portland's musical living room/recital hall\\", ideal for intimate concerts. Concerts are often accompanied with receptions that allow interaction between performers and audience members. According to Ewer, \\"This was a priority of [his] from the start. It's part of what distinguishes 45th Parallel. We are not superheroes. We are the folks that our audience members shop with, have a beer with and meet on the street. That's the atmosphere that 45th Parallel is trying to create.\\" Performances The 2011‚Äì2012 season opening concert included Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's String Quintet No. 3 (Opus 97) and Felix Mendelssohn's B-flat Quintet (Opus 87). Guests included Nancy Ives and Justin Kagan on cello, Hillary Schoap on viola, and Ron Blessinger and Ines Voglar. The January performance, which Ewer said could have been called \\"Music Among Friends\\", included guests Hamilton Cheifetz, Janet Coleman and Angela Niederloh. The April concert served as a tribute to violinist Sergiu Luca, the founder of Chamber Music Northwest who was also one of Ewer's teachers and mentors. The program included William Bolcom's \\"Graceful Ghost Rag\\" and a composition by Christian Sinding, among other \\"favorites\\" of Luca's. The second half of the concert featured jazz violinist James Mason and members of the band Swing Papillon as guest artists, performing a tribute to Joe Venuti.

Background The bout featured a matchup of two of the top ranked pound-for-pound fighters in boxing. 33-year-old Pernell Whitaker had been the WBC welterweight champion for four years, captured world titles in four different divisions and had been among the top pound-for-pound fighters in the sport since 1989, with The Ring magazine listing him number one in their annual pound-for-pound rankings for three consecutive years from 1993 to 1995. The 24‚Äìyear old Oscar De La Hoya was a perfect 23‚Äì0, had already become a three-division world champion and was reigning WBC super lightweight champion, which he had won the previous year after defeating Mexican legend Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez. At the time of their fight, De La Hoya and Whitaker were the number two and three ranked pound-for-pound fighters, with only the then- WBC light heavyweight champion Roy Jones, Jr. ahead of them. Plans for the mega-fight had been discussed since De La Hoya's victory over Ch√°vez. The bout was all but set in early 1997, though both De La Hoya and Whitaker would first have to get past their mandatory challengers.

The method was invented by John Platt in the context of support vector machines, replacing an earlier method by Vapnik, but can be applied to other classification models. Platt scaling works by fitting a logistic regression model to a classifier's scores. Description Consider the problem of binary classification: for inputs , we want to determine whether they belong to one of two classes, arbitrarily labeled and . We assume that the classification problem will be solved by a real-valued function , by predicting a class label . For many problems, it is convenient to get a probability , i.e. a classification that not only gives an answer, but also a degree of certainty about the answer. Some classification models do not provide such a probability, or give poor probability estimates. Platt scaling is an algorithm to solve the aforementioned problem. It produces probability estimates :\\\\mathrm{P}(y=1  x) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\exp(Af(x) + B)}, i.e., a logistic transformation of the classifier scores , where and are two scalar parameters that are learned by the algorithm. Note that predictions can now be made according to iff ; if , the probability estimates contain a correction compared to the old decision function . The parameters and are estimated using a maximum likelihood method that optimizes on the same training set as that for the original classifier . To avoid overfitting to this set, a held-out calibration set or cross-validation can be used, but Platt additionally suggests transforming the labels to target probabilities :t_{+} = \\\\frac{N_{+} + 1}{N_{+} + 2} for positive samples (), and :t_{-} = \\\\frac{1}{N_{-} + 2} for negative samples, . Here, and are the number of positive and negative samples, respectively. This transformation follows by applying Bayes' rule to a model of out-of-sample data that has a uniform prior over the labels. The constants 1 and 2, on the numerator and denominator respectively, are derived from the application of Laplace Smoothing. Platt himself suggested using the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm to optimize the parameters, but a Newton algorithm was later proposed that should be more numerically stable. Analysis Platt scaling has been shown to be effective for SVMs as well as other types of classification models, including boosted models and even naive Bayes classifiers, which produce distorted probability distributions. It is particularly effective for max-margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees, which show sigmoidal distortions in their predicted probabilities, but has less of an effect with well-calibrated models such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, and random forests. An alternative approach to probability calibration is to fit an isotonic regression model to an ill- calibrated probability model. This has been shown to work better than Platt scaling, in particular when enough training data is available.

In 2002, Clarke was appointed to the position by Republican Governor Scott McCallum and later elected that same year to his first four- year term. He was reelected in November 2006, 2010 and 2014. Although Clarke declared himself as Democrat after his appointment as sheriff and ran as a Democrat in a heavily Democratic county, many of Clarke's political views align with those of conservative Republicans; he refused to join the Wisconsin Democratic Party, instead promoting conservative views, and allying himself with Republican officials. As sheriff, Clarke frequently clashed with other Milwaukee County officials over the budget and other matters, and came under scrutiny for deaths and alleged mistreatment of jail inmates. One man died of thirst in what a coroner ruled was a homicide, and pregnant women were handcuffed and shackled while undergoing labor. Clarke frequently appeared as a guest on Fox News through February 2018 and was a speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention. He resigned as sheriff in August 2017. A vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, Clarke garnered attention for controversial and sometimes inflammatory social-media posts, and was considered for a role in the Trump administration. After resigning as sheriff, Clarke joined the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor; he left the group in 2019.  Early life, education, and early career  Clarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and David Clarke Sr.Kurt Chandler, The New Black Power, Milwaukee Magazine (July 25, 2003). His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company. Clarke Jr. attended Marquette University High School where he played for the varsity basketball team. After finishing high school, Clarke took classes at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee but dropped out during his first year when he got a job driving beer trucks. His career in law enforcement began in 1978 at the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). He \\"rose through the ranks at a slow but steady pace in his 24 years with the department.\\" Clarke was a patrol officer for eleven years and then a homicide detective; he was promoted to lieutenant of detectives in 1993 and captain in 1999. Clarke's career was not without controversy; in 1994, the mother of a 15-year-old boy filed a complaint alleging that Clarke used excessive force when arresting her son. According to public documents, Clarke was returning from a vacation when he spotted five teenagers heaving rocks at passing cars. Clarke chased down the teens, drew his service revolver and ordered them to lie on the ground. He admitted to using his foot to turn one boy over as he searched for weapons. The boy's mother claimed Clarke put a gun to her son's head and kicked him in the side, causing bruised ribs that required medical attention. However, the Fire and Police Commission ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge Clarke and dismissed the case. In 1999, Clarke received a B.A. in Management of Criminal Justice from Concordia University Wisconsin's School of Adult and Continuing Education.Milwaukee Sheriff, CU Alum Receives Award (press release), Concordia University Wisconsin (April 1, 2016). In January 2002, Milwaukee County Sheriff Leverett F. (Lev) Baldwin resigned midway through his term to take a pension payout. Clarke was one of ten applicants for the position, and Governor Scott McCallum appointed him on March 19, 2002. He was elected to a full term later in 2002, and was reelected in 2006, 2010, and 2014. =Master's thesis plagiarism= In 2013, Clarke received a master's degree in security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). In May 2017, CNN reported that Clarke had plagiarized portions of the thesis he completed as part of the requirements for this degree, stating that in the thesis, \\"Clarke failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times.\\" The thesis (\\"Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible\\") was found to have lifted material verbatim from several sources without proper citation, including reports by the American Civil Liberties Union, The 9/11 Commission Report, and George W. Bush's memoir Decision Points. Clarke provided footnotes to sources that he used, but did not properly place quotations around verbatim words of his sources, which is an act of plagiarism according to the NPS. Following the report, the NPS removed the thesis from its online archive.John Fauber, Report: Sheriff David Clarke plagiarized parts of homeland security thesis, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (May 21, 2017): \\"the Naval Postgraduate School removed Clarke's thesis from its website and replaced it with the following note: 'This item was removed from view at the discretion of the Naval Postgraduate School.'\\" In response to the report, Clarke called journalist Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the story, a \\"sleaze bag\\" and denied that he had plagiarized. In a July 2017 letter to Clarke, NPS dean of students, Commander Paul Rasmussen, wrote that he concurred with the Honor Code Board that Clarke's thesis was \\"in violation\\" of the school's honor code but that the \\"violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts.\\" Rasmussen instructed Clarke to submit a revised thesis within 100 days or NPS would \\"initiate degree revocation.\\"Chris Massie & Andrew Kaczynski, Former Sheriff David Clarke must revise thesis or risk losing degree, docs reveal, CNN (September 15, 2017).

Clarke denies that police officers are more willing to shoot black suspects than white suspects, has labeled BLM activists \\"subhuman creeps\\", and has called for the targeted eradication of the movement \\"from American society.\\" He has also claimed that Black Lives Matter would eventually join forces with ISIS in order to destroy American society.David Clarke, Before long, Black Lies Matter will join forces with ISIS to being down our legal constituted republic. You heard it first here., Twitter (October 27, 2015). He has urged the Southern Poverty Law Center to include BLM among the hate groups it monitors. Clarke has blamed \\"liberal policies\\" for rioting and other issues in American cities. Clarke's stance on the movement has been criticized by the Milwaukee chapter of the NAACP and other activists. Clarke has harshly criticized various black critics of police abuses. He has called former Attorney General Eric Holder an \\"a[ss]hole\\" and accused him in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee of \\"outright hostility\\" toward police, referred to Al Sharpton as a \\"charlatan\\" and criticized Beyonc√© for her reference to the Black Panthers in her halftime- show performance at the 2016 Super Bowl. =Gun control = In January 2013, Clarke was featured on a series of public radio ads that said citizens could no longer rely on the police for timely protection and should arm themselves. Later that month, Clarke appeared on the CNN program Piers Morgan Live, with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who \\"said it was irresponsible of Clarke to 'basically imply' that it won't help citizens to call 911 when they need help.\\" In 2015, Clarke traveled to Moscow on a $40,000 trip, with all expenses paid by the NRA, Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and \\"The Right to Bear Arms,\\" a Russian pro-firearms organization, founded by Maria Butina, a Russian national, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to being an unregistered Russian agent.Prosecutors seek 18-month sentence for Maria Butina in Russian plot to forge ties to U.S. conservative groups, Washington Post (April 19, 2019): \\"Capitalizing on her novelty as a Siberian-born gun activist in restrictive Russia, Butina and Torshin invited NRA leaders to Moscow in December 2015, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and David Keene, a former NRA president and past head of the powerful American Conservative Union.\\" During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Russian official Aleksander Torshin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, spoke. In 2018, Clarke attracted attention for using Twitter to promote a conspiracy theory about the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; Clarke tweeted that \\"The well ORGANIZED effort by Florida school students demanding gun control has GEORGE SOROS' FINGERPRINTS all over it\\", suggesting that the students from Parkland were being manipulated by Soros to organize for gun control.Daniel Bice, Former Sheriff David Clarke files for divorce in Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (February 23, 2018). =Suspension of habeas corpus in the United States= Clarke has called for the suspension of habeas corpus in the United States in a December 2015 appearance on his radio program, where he asserted that there were \\"hundreds of thousands\\" or \\"maybe a million\\" people who \\"have pledged allegiance or are supporting ISIS, giving aid and comfort,\\" and stated that \\"our commander in chief ought to utilize Article I, Section 9\\" to imprison them at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp \\"and hold them indefinitely under a suspension of habeas corpus.\\"Jeremy Stahl, Potential Homeland Security Pick Wanted to Suspend Habeas Corpus, Jail One Million, Slate (November 29, 2016).Pema Levy, Potential Trump Pick for Homeland Security Wants to Send up to 1 Million People to Gitmo, Mother Jones (November 28, 2016). =Ideology and relationships with Republican and Democratic parties= Clarke holding up a copy of the United States Constitution After his appointment to the sheriff's post by McCallum, Clarke declared himself as Democrat, but refused to join the Wisconsin Democratic Party, instead promoting conservative views, and allying himself with Republican officials. Clarke ran for sheriff as a Democrat, which is advantageous in heavily Democratic Milwaukee County. However, Clarke is almost universally regarded as a staunch right-wing conservative.Daniel Bice, Does anyone still think Sheriff David Clarke is a Democrat? Apparently, one, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (July 27, 2014).Gun fight? National political donors spend hundreds of thousands on local Milwaukee sheriff's race, Fox News (August 12, 2014). Clarke frequently criticizes Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and other Democrats; often speaks at Republican events, and is allies with the National Rifle Association, which has raised funds for his re-election campaigns. Clarke has in turn been criticized by the local Democratic Party. On his website in 2014, Clarke stated that he questioned \\"why the Office of Sheriff is a partisan election\\" and wrote: \\"I have never asked a person to vote for me because I run as a Democrat. I ask them to vote for me based on my 35-year commitment to keeping citizens safe. Most voters get it when it comes to public safety. There is no Democrat or Republican way to be a sheriff. The enemy is not the opposing party; the enemy is the criminal.\\" In 2016, Maurice Chammah of The Marshall Project characterized Clarke as an \\"iconoclastic sheriff,\\" one of \\"a long line of controversy-courting lawmen\\" that includes Richard Mack and Joe Arpaio in Arizona.Maurice Chammah, America's Loudest Sheriffs: A Reading Guide: Milwaukee's David Clarke is the latest in a long line of controversy-courting lawmen, The Marshall Project (May 6, 2016). Clarke attracted attention for \\"dalliances with the far right\\" over time including his acceptance in 2013 of the \\"Sheriff of the Year Award\\" from the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, a group of sheriffs founded by Mack that has been criticized by the Southern Poverty Law Center for espousing radical-right views.Daniel Bice, David A. Clarke's sheriff of the year honor isn't your typical award: Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association known for anti-government views, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (May 15, 2013). Earlier the same year, Clarke appeared for an interview on the syndicated show of Alex Jones. Sheriff of Milwaukee = Budget and clashes with the Government of Milwaukee County= Clarke has often clashed with the county government over the sheriff's office budget, engaging \\"in a long-running, high-profile tiff\\" over the issue with Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, \\"with Clarke providing the more incendiary rhetoric.\\" Abele's proposed budget for 2014 would cut $12 million from the Sheriff's Office budget, eliminating 69 jobs and \\"shifting park patrols, emergency management, 911 communications and training divisions\\" to other entities, such as the Milwaukee Police Department, suburban police departments, and the county Department of Emergency Preparedness. Abele described the budget as a way to refocus the sheriff's office on \\"core, mandated services.\\" Clarke issued a statement calling Abele a \\"vindictive little man\\" and saying that \\"Abele should be drug-tested. He has to be on heroin or hallucinating with that statement.\\" Abele responded by saying that it was \\"unfortunate the sheriff, instead of engaging in thoughtful civil discourse, is making personal attacks and making light of a serious problem in our community and state.\\" On another occasion, Clarke said that Abele had \\"penis envy.\\" In 2015, Clarke clashed with Abele again after Clarke filed a lawsuit against the county over the sheriff's budget, seeking $25 million in funds to hire 75 deputies, 43 House of Corrections officers and 17 supervisors. Clarke argued that his office is underfunded by the county, while Abele noted that the sheriff's office had received the largest increase of any county department and criticized Clarke for having what he termed \\"a very heavy command staff,\\" \\"a lot of unnecessary overtime,\\" and redundancies in courthouse security.Clarke, Abele at odds over sheriff's budget lawsuit, WDJT-TV (February 4, 2015). Clarke sued Abele, alleging that he had violated Clarke's right to free speech through the budget process; a federal judge dismissed Clarke's suit in April 2016.Milwaukee County pays high price for sheriff's lawsuits, Associated Press (April 23, 2016). A county audit released in 2012 showed that the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office used asset forfeiture funds to buy exercise equipment for Clarke's command staff, for a Disney training, and for a mounted patrol unit. The audit reported that the spending violated county procurement rules, although not federal rules on the use of seized money. Clarke was criticized for the amount of money spent on the mounted patrol by County Supervisor Patricia Jursik; Clarke defended the office's use of the funds.Steve Schultze, Clarke spent asset forfeitures on workout equipment, horse patrol, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (September 28, 2012). According to an Associated Press tally, from 2012 to April 2016, Clarke had incurred more than $310,000 in legal fees for his private attorney, who represented him in litigation against Milwaukee County. Milwaukee County taxpayers paid the legal fees. The county spent an additional $83,000 defending itself against Clarke's lawsuits. In 2012, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's office under Clarke spent $75,000 on an order of 565 new Glock handguns with \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" sights, \\"enough to outfit each of the department's 275 deputies with two of the popular guns and still have some left over.\\"Steve Schultze, Sheriff's office orders Glocks in bulk: Critics say 565-gun purchase seems excessive; department disagrees, says it got a great deal, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (July 15, 2012). The order was criticized as excessive by critics, including county Supervisor John Weishan Jr. (who said there \\"was absolutely no reason to justify\\" the purchase) and the Milwaukee County Deputy Sheriffs Association president (who said that he would have preferred the sheriff's department to use funds to re-hire laid-off deputies rather than to replace weapons). Clarke declined to comment, but a department official defended the purchase. =House of Correction and detainee abuse controversies= In January 2008, a National Institute of Corrections audit of the Milwaukee County House of Correction in Franklin identified 44 areas of concern, calling the House of Correction \\"dysfunctional\\" and determining that it suffered from \\"serious security, staff morale and management flaws.\\" The House of Corrections was at the time a separate Milwaukee County department overseen by a superintendent who reported to then Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker. Walker and the County Board transferred control over the House to the Sheriff's Department under Clarke on January 1, 2009. Clarke was repeatedly accused of abusing detainees at the county jail.Jason Silverstein, Dozens of Milwaukee County Jail inmates had been forced to give birth while shackled, lawsuit alleges, New York Daily News (March 19, 2017). Following the deaths of four inmates at the jail in six months, the United States Department of Justice launched an investigation of the jail. Milwaukee County chief medical examiner Brian Peterson accused Clarke of verbally harassing and threatening him in an October 2016 telephone conversation after Peterson's office made the mysterious deaths of two inmates at the jail earlier that year public.Daniel Bice, Medical examiner 'threatened' by Clarke over jail deaths, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (December 2, 2016). According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Clarke also attracted attention for temper-related incidents: \\"He once berated a 911 dispatcher for not being professional, threatened to arrest the new House of Correction chief and called a sergeant a 'terrorist' and 'cancer' in a two-hour, expletive- filled rant\\". Death of Terrill Thomas The Milwaukee County Jail turned the water off to inmate Terrill Thomas's cell, resulting in his death by dehydration on April 24, 2016. According to inmates, the water was turned off for six days and the staff refused to provide water to Thomas. On September 15, 2016, the Milwaukee medical examiner ruled Thomas's death a homicide. Later that day Clarke's office sent out a press release which stated it would be \\"withholding employee internal investigations and will not be commenting on this matter until the completion of all investigative and review processes, and any resultant civil litigation.\\"\\"An Inmate Died Of Thirst In A Jail Run By A Loudly Pro-Trump Sheriff\\". The Huffington Post. September 19, 2016. Clarke did not comment publicly on his agency's handling of Thomas's incarceration, but has highlighted Thomas's poor physical health and criminal history. In May 2017, after hearing six days of testimony at an inquest, a Milwaukee County jury found probable cause that seven jail employees (two supervisors, five officers) had committed a crime--specifically, abuse of a resident of a penal facility--and recommended that charges be brought.Terrill Thomas Case: Milwaukee Jury Wants Charges Because Inmate Died After Week Without Water, Associated Press (May 2, 2017). In February 2018, three Milwaukee jail officers were charged with a felony in connection with Thomas's death. Clarke was not charged. District Attorney John T. Chisholm said \\"he believed his office had charged the people who were most culpable.\\" In May 2019, Milwaukee County and the health care company Armor Correctional Health Services Inc. settled the lawsuit for $6.75 million, which is one of the largest settlements related to the death of an inmate in an American prison.

In 2014, a woman who was handcuffed and shackled for 21 hours while in labor sued the county. In 2017, a second lawsuit was filed by another woman who was shackled while giving birth, and while hospitalized for prenatal care and postpartum treatment. The suit contends that the jail has a blanket policy of shackling all hospitalized inmates, \\"regardless of their criminal or medical history,\\" and that at least 40 women were shackled in this manner. In June 2017, a federal jury awarded $6.7 million in a lawsuit by a woman who accused a Milwaukee County Jail guard of raping her on at least five occasions when she was 19 years old and pregnant. Criminal charges of sexual assault had been dropped against the guard after he pled no contest to lesser charges in 2014. In July 2016, a pregnant inmate at the jail with serious mental illness went into labor and the newborn baby died. The mother filed a federal lawsuit against the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office, stating that she was denied medical attention before her pregnancy, had medical appointments canceled, received prenatal vitamins only once, and was \\"laughed at\\" by guards after going into labor.Katie DeLong, Federal lawsuit filed after newborn baby died at Milwaukee County Jail; 1 of 4 deaths in 6 months, WITI (December 27, 2016). This death and others at the jail prompted calls for Clarke's resignation from a county supervisor and several Democratic state legislators. =Proselytism lawsuit= In 2006, Clarke invited members of an Evangelical Christian organization, the Fellowship of Christian Centurions, to speak at several mandatory employee meetings, at which the group members proselytized. Several deputies complained about the Centurions' proselytizing, but Clarke refused to stop the presentations. The sheriff deputies' union and two individual sheriff's deputies (a Catholic and a Muslim) successfully sued Clarke in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Clarke appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which upheld the lower court's ruling in 2009. The sheriff did not seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court.Milwaukee Deputy Sheriffs Ass'n v. Clarke, 588 F.3d 523 (7th Cir. 2009), aff'g 513 F.Supp.2d 1014 (E.D. Wis. 2007). =Airport harassment and abuse-of- power investigation and lawsuit= In February 2017, a Detroit-area man, Dan Black, filed a harassment lawsuit against Clarke after Milwaukee deputies detained the man at the Milwaukee airport in January. The man had asked Clarke about his football team preference and shook his head at Clarke.Daniel Bice, Auditors want to sue Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke for blocking probe, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel (April 6, 2017): \\"Clarke later taunted and threatened Black in posts on his county Facebook page and on Twitter.\\" On the tarmac, Clarke sent text messages to one of his captains, Mark Witek, directing sheriffs' deputies to detain Black. Clarke wrote: \\"Question for him is why he said anything to me. Why didn't he just keep his mouth shut? Follow him to baggage and out the door. You can escort me to carousel after I point him out.\\"Daniel Bice, Sheriff Clarke directed staff to hassle plane passenger after brief exchange, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (May 25, 2017). After arriving at the airport, Black was \\"met by a group of six uniformed deputies and two dogs, all of whom were accompanied by the sheriff\\" who questioned him before releasing him. Airport surveillance video showed Black telling deputies: \\"He [Clarke] thinks because I asked who he is, he can exert that kind of power over me.\\"Terry Sater, Sheriff's text to deputies about passenger on plane: Follow him out of airport, WISN (May 25, 2017). Local media reported that \\"at least one of the deputies who was ordered to confront Black didn't believe he had been disruptive.\\" After Black filed a complaint with the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office, Clarke responded by taunting and threatening Black via Facebook. Black's counsel states that Clarke engaged in a \\"gross and arbitrary abuse of power\\" and ordered an unlawful stop and detention. An ensuing civil lawsuit by Black resulted in 2018 in a verdict in Clarke's favor; the jury found that Clarke's Facebook posts did not chill Black's exercise of his First Amendment rights.Bruce Vielmetti, Jury rules for former Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. in Facebook post case, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (January 23, 2018). The incident drew national attention, prompting federal investigations to examine Clarke's conduct. In a May 2017 letter, the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to prosecute Clarke for federal civil-rights offenses, writing: \\"Our decision is not meant to affirm the wisdom or propriety of what occurred. It reflects only our belief that it would be difficult or impossible to prove a violation of the only federal statute available to us ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Milwaukee County auditors launched an investigation into whether Clarke abused taxpayer resources during the airport incident. Clarke refused to cooperate with the investigation, and blocked auditors from interviewing Milwaukee County sheriff's deputies. Clarke's refusal to cooperate in the investigation prompted the Milwaukee County Board to authorize legal action against Clarke on the issue. An affidavit filed by the FBI in March 2017 (and made public in December 2017) indicated that \\"investigators for the Audit Services Division of the Milwaukee County controller's office determined as part of its own investigation that Clarke had 'used his official position as sheriff of Milwaukee County in excess of his lawful authority to direct his deputies to stop and question Black without legal justification.'\\"Mary Papenfuss, FBI Affidavit Details Ex- Sheriff David Clarke's Intimidation of Fellow Passenger, Huffington Post (December 30, 2017). =Approval ratings= In a January 2017 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling, which surveyed Milwaukee County voters, 31% approved of the job Clarke was doing, compared to 62% who disapproved. In the same poll, 65% said they believed Clarke had a negative impact on the image of Milwaukee County, and among registered Democrats, 13% said they would vote for Clarke in a hypothetical Democratic primary, compared to 82% who would prefer another candidate. = Donald Trump support and possible role in Trump administration= Clarke at the 2016 Republican National Convention Clarke at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference Clarke is a strong supporter of Republican Donald Trump, saying during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign that he would \\"do everything I can\\" to help Trump win the presidency. Clarke spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.Sheriff Clarke, Rep. Duffy added to GOP convention speakers list, WISN-TV (July 14, 2016). In October 2016, Clarke tweeted, \\"It's incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ, and big media are corrupt & all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\\" with an attached photo of an angry mob holding pitchforks and torches. Clarke met with Trump, when Trump was president-elect, about a possible position in his administration. In May 2017, Clarke said in a radio interview that he would take the post of Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Partnership and Engagement in the Trump administration. The White House declined to comment, and the Department of Homeland Security stated that no appointment had been officially made. The position does not require Senate confirmation. The DHS did not say whether the appointment was actually offered to Clarke.David Shortell, Milwaukee County Sheriff Clarke says he's accepted DHS job -- but was it offered?, CNN (May 18, 2017). Following a CNN report on plagiarism in his master's thesis, Clarke said that he was unsure if the Trump administration would hire him.Nathan McDermott & Andrew Kaczynski, Sheriff David Clarke says he's unsure if Trump administration will still hire him after plagiarism report, CNN (May 23, 2017). The prospective appointment of Clarke was criticized by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele; former Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem; and California Senator Kamala Harris, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Harris wrote that \\"Clarke's unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve\\" and that the \\"appointment is a disgrace.\\" On June 17, Clarke rescinded his acceptance of the post.Abby Phillip, Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke rescinds acceptance of Homeland Security post, CNN (June 17, 2017). John F. Kelly, who had been the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, told Clarke that he would not be given a position at the DHS in part due to scandal surrounding the treatment of inmates in Clarke's jail and the ensuing negative media attention. =Conservative media commentary and absences from Milwaukee County= Clarke \\"has become a fixture of conservative media\\" and in 2015 began hosting a podcast talk show, David Clarke: The People's Sheriff, on Glenn Beck's TheBlaze Radio Network,Maurice Chammah, American Sheriff: David Clarke, the Trump-loving, pro-mass-incarceration, Fox News favorite, is challenging criminal-justice reform‚Äîand stereotypes, The Atlantic (May 5, 2016). where he has expressed support for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Clarke also frequently appeared as a guest on Fox News, and on one occasion in September 2015 guest-hosted The Sean Hannity Show. However, in March 2019, The Daily Beast reported that Clarke had essentially been banned from Fox News and that he had not appeared on Fox News since February 2018. He also appeared on CNN, Fox News, and other major news outlets to discuss ongoing police controversies. Clarke's higher profile coincided with an increase in his speaking fees and time spent outside Milwaukee County on outside activities.Daniel Bice, As Sheriff Clarke's profile soars, gifts roll in, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (September 17, 2016). In 2015 financial disclosure documents, Clarke reported receiving $150,000 in speaking fees, travel reimbursements, gifts and other items; in 2016, he received $220,000 worth of such items.Theo Keith, Documents show Sheriff Clarke brought in $220K in speaking fees, gifts, travel reimbursements in 2016, WITI-TV (February 1, 2017). Also in 2016, Clarke spent about 60 days traveling or attending events, 59 of them outside Wisconsin. Clarke's absences from the county, as well as redactions in his official schedule as provided to journalists who made public-records requests, led to \\"increasing scrutiny over his job performance\\" from local media outlets and criticism from the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council.Theo Keith, Sheriff David Clarke flies the country, avoids questions, redacts records in his official schedule, WITI-TV (May 25, 2017). Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has repeatedly criticized Clarke's absences from the county.Video: Milwaukee County exec says Sheriff David Clarke not 'an active manager', WisconsinEye (July 13, 2017). =Resignation as sheriff= On August 31, 2017, Clarke resigned his position.Daniel Bice, David A.

Clarke Jr. resigns as Milwaukee County Sheriff, Washington Post (August 31, 2017). Career as media commentator after resignation A few days after his resignation as sheriff, it was announced that Clarke had joined pro-Donald Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor, where his role was to make regular appearances in the media, particularly on Fox News.Maxwell Tani & Asawin Suebsaeng, Fox News Quietly Ditched Trump-Loving Sheriff David Clarke, Daily Beast (March 5, 2019). However, by March 2019, Clarke was reportedly banned from Fox News (his last appearance on a Fox channel occurring in February 2018); Clarke repeatedly criticized Fox and praised the right-wing One America News Network. The cause of Clarke's break with Fox News was unclear, although Clarke's inflammatory Twitter posts and attacks on the high- school students victimized in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida may have played a role. By early 2019, Clarke had also left his position with the Trump's America First Action super PAC; a Clarke staffer said that he had joined Brian Kolfage's and Steve Bannon's \\"We Build The Wall\\" group instead. In 2017, Clarke published a book titled Cop Under Fire: Moving Beyond Hashtags of Race, Crime and Politics for a Better America. The book was promoted by Trump on Twitter. In January 2018, Clarke was temporarily suspended by Twitter after posting three messages appearing to encourage violence against the media, including a tweet reading \\"Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.\\" Clarke was unblocked by Twitter after deleting the posts.Former Sheriff David Clarke temporarily blocked from tweeting due to his caustic threats, Wisconsin Gazette (January 5, 2018).Jake Tapper, Sheriff David Clarke temporarily blocked on Twitter after violating terms of service, CNN (January 2, 2018). In March 2020, Twitter deleted three of Clarke's posts for promoting disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. One of his tweets proclaimed that COVID-19 was \\"just the damn flu\\" while another called measures to prevent the spread of the virus \\"an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism.\\" Clarke responded by labeling Twitter administrators \\"totalitarian bigots\\" and saying that he would join Parler instead. In August of 2020, a report in Urban Milwaukee itemized Clarke's role since 2019 in Steve Bannon and Brian Kolfage's We Build the Wall scam, as an active member and a central figure in many of its fundraising efforts.Murphy, Bruce. \\"Murphy's Law: David Clarke a Key Part of Bannon Scam; Ex-sheriff not indicted but was key fundraiser for We Build the Wall group accused of fraud\\" Urban Milwaukee August 26, 2020 Persona Clarke on horseback at the 2008 Milwaukee St. Patrick's Day parade Clarke frequently appears at public events on horseback wearing a cowboy hat. He often wore 20 or more pins and badges on his uniform when in public, many not of official meaning or purpose, leading to accusations of \\"stolen valor\\" (i.e., trying to create the image of heroic accomplishments). Potential mayoral run In January 2014, Clarke announced he was considering a run for mayor of Milwaukee in 2016, but ultimately decided not to run, instead endorsing Republican Alderman Bob Donovan's unsuccessful bid to unseat Mayor Tom Barrett. Electoral history  Personal life  Clarke married his wife Julie in 1996; she was a court clerk and later a real estate agent. They lived on the northwest side of Milwaukee. In 2018, Clarke filed for divorce from his wife.

After three further top-flight campaigns with Athletic Bilbao, he closed out his career at the age of 33 with Osasuna, now competing in Tercera Divisi√≥n. After taking over from Ivica Brziƒá 11 rounds into 1986‚Äì87, Zabalza went on to coach his last club over a full six seasons in the top tier. He resigned in December 1993 as they rank third from bottom in the table, eventually being relegated as last. Zabalza began 1995‚Äì96 at the helm of Rayo Vallecano, but after seven matches and six losses he was sacked. In the following campaign he was one of four managers in charge of Osasuna (the others being Rafael Ben√≠tez, Miguel √Ångel Sola and Enrique Mart√≠n), who was the first team above the division two relegation zone. International career Zabalza earned seven caps for Spain, during eight months. His first occurred on 17 October 1968, in a 3‚Äì1 friendly win in France.

She was one of the pioneers of the art movement across the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands, which began in 2000. She is best known for her paintings, but also a craftswoman who makes baskets and other woven artworks. Her paintings are held in the Art Gallery of Western Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the National Gallery of Australia. Woods was born about 1935. She was born close to Ka·∏ªayapi·πØi, a rock hole in the Great Victoria Desert of South Australia. She grew up living a traditional, nomadic way of life in the bush with her family, before any contact with Euro- Australian society. They often camped at Ka·∏ªayapi·πØi, and Woods and the other girls would gather bushfood together. She learned to carve basic tools and decorative objects, and to burn traditional patterns into the wood (this is called '. She also learned to spin hair string on a hand-spun spindle and weave head rings and ceremonial belts from hair and feathers. Woods began painting in 2000, after moving to Irrunytju. The women there opened an art centre as a community-owned economic project, called Irrunytju Arts. From the beginning of her career, Brown often painted with her friend Anmanari Brown. When Brown's husband died in 2007, the two women left Irrunytju and went to live at Papulankutja, on Ngaanyatjarra lands. Here, they painted for Papulankutja Artists. In April 2010, the two women held their first solo exhibition together at the Vivien Anderson Gallery in Melbourne.

Woods' paintings are mostly about the (Two Sisters Dreaming), which is her personal Dreaming. They are structured like maps drawn in the sand, tracing the journey of the two sisters around the edge of the canvas. She paints in earthy colours, and uses solid and dotted lines in concentric circles to depict the journeys and activities of figures in the story.

Biography =Early life and education= Ardagh was the second son of William Johnson Ardagh (1798-1872), vicar of Rossmire, County Waterford, and Sarah Cobbold, of Ipswich. After attending school at Waterford, in 1857 Ardagh entered Trinity College, Dublin, intending to follow his father into the church. He won a prize in Hebrew and honours in mathematics, but eventually decided on a military career, taking first place in the examinations to enter the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1858, and receiving his commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, dated 1 April 1859. =Military engineer= After training at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, Ardagh supervised the construction of Fort Popton, one of the new defensive works at Milford Haven, built under the terms of the Defence Act of 1860. Early in the American Civil War, when tensions between Britain and the United States where raised as a result of the Trent Affair of November 1861, Ardagh was sent to the colony of New Brunswick to construct a military telegraph line to the St. Lawrence river. He embarked on the transport ship Victoria at Queenstown on 26 December 1861, but the ship was driven back to the port by storms. She sailed again on 13 February 1862, but was only saved from foundering by the exertions of Ardagh and his troops, which enabled her to reach Plymouth on 12 March. Ardagh's conduct was highly commended by the Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Ardagh was then placed in charge of the construction of Newhaven Fort. Rather than levelling the ground, Ardagh blended the fort into the contours of the land; it was also the first British fort built largely of concrete. Ardagh also designed an \\"Equilibrium Bridge\\" which was raised and lowered a drawbridge by means of counterweights. After further employment on other defence works, in April 1868 he was appointed secretary of Sir Frederick Grey's committee to report on the fortifications under construction, and in September 1869 he accompanied Sir William Jervois on a tour of inspection of the defence works at Halifax and Bermuda. In February 1871, Ardagh witnessed German troops entering Paris following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Ardagh made a study of the defences of Paris, and later of Belfort and Strasbourg. He then spent three months in Malta, and a year at Chatham, before being promoted to captain on 3 August 1872. He attended the Staff College from February 1873, passing his final examinations in December 1874. =Military intelligence= In April 1875 he was attached to the intelligence branch of the War Office, and was in the Netherlands on intelligence duty in January and February 1876, and became a deputy assistant quartermaster-general for intelligence on 13 July. In August 1876 Ardagh was sent on special service to the headquarters of the Turkish army during the war against Serbia. In October he was summoned to Constantinople to report on the defence of the city. In fifteen days he prepared sketch-surveys of nearly 150 square miles, and proved himself an expert in strategic geography. These surveys included the position of Buyuk-Chekmedje-Dere, with projects for the defence of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, the Bulair lines and Rodosto. The actual works were subsequently constructed by the Turks. Ardagh also reported to the Foreign Office on the Turkish operations during the conflicts in Herzegovina and Montenegro, and in December 1876 went to Tirnovo in Bulgaria to report on the state of the country. After recovering from an attack of fever, he resumed his duties at the War Office in April 1877, when he completed a report and survey begun in the previous year on the sea defences of the Lewes and Laughton Levels. From December 1877 to March 1878 Ardagh was in Italy on special service for the Foreign Office, and then attended the Congress of Berlin as a technical military advisor to General Sir Lintorn Simmons. Ardagh's knowledge of the Turkish provinces proved of value, and in July he was made a Companion of the Bath (civil). Between September 1878 and September 1879 he was employed on the international commission to delineate the frontiers of Bulgaria. On 30 November 1878 he was gazetted a brevet major, and was finally promoted to major on 22 September 1880. On 3 June 1881 he was appointed British commissioner for the delimitation of the frontier between Turkey and Greece. In spite of obstacles the work was completed by the end of October. Egyptian war In February 1882 Ardagh was appointed instructor in military history, law, and tactics at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, but on 5 July he was sent to Egypt, where he was occupied almost continuously for the next four years. His first duty was to place Alexandria in a state of defence after its bombardment by the British fleet and to take charge of the intelligence department there. Ardagh was employed in the railway administration at Ismailia, and was present at the actions at Kassassin and Tel-el-Mahuta, and at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir in September 1882. On 17 November 1882 he was appointed Deputy Assistant-Adjutant and Quartermaster-General, and was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 18 November 1882. He was mentioned in Lord Wolseley's despatch at the end of the campaign, and also received the British war medal with clasp for Tel-el-Kebir, the Khedive's bronze star, and the fourth class of the order of the Osmanieh. Ardagh remained in Egypt with the British army of occupation, and was largely employed in making surveys. In July 1883 he returned home on leave, but returned to Egypt almost immediately after an out-break of cholera, and laboured untiringly during the epidemic. In February 1884 Ardagh, as Commanding Royal Engineer and chief of the intelligence department, accompanied the British force under Sir Gerald Graham, which was sent from Cairo to the Eastern Sudan. He was present at the battle of El Teb on 29 February, and at the relief of Tokar on 1 March, he arranged the removal of 700 Egyptian inhabitants. By 8 March the change of base from Trinkitat to Suakin had been made, and on the 12th Ardagh reconnoitred with the mounted infantry the ground towards the hills. After the battle of Tamai on 13 March, the road was open to Berber, and Ardagh shared his general's opinion that an advance should then have been made to Berber to reach to General Gordon at Khartoum. He afterwards wrote : \\"Berber was then in the hands of an Egyptian garrison, and had we gone across, the subsequent operations for the attempted relief of General Gordon at Khartoum would not have been necessary.\\" Graham's force returned to Cairo in April, leaving a battalion to garrison Suakin. Ardagh was mentioned in despatches and was made a Companion of the Bath (military) in May 1884. In October 1884, when an expedition to relieve Khartoum was organised, Ardagh favoured an approach overland via Suakin and Berber, but the commander Lord Wolseley resolved to travel by boat up the Nile. Ardagh was appointed commandant at Cairo, with the grade of assistant adjutant-general. His energy, devotion, and quiet cheerfulness helped to expedite the fatal enterprise, and at the end of the disastrous campaign he was promoted to brevet colonel (25 August 1885), receiving the Order of the Medjidieh (3rd class). On 30 December, as chief staff officer of a combined British and Egyptian force, he took part in the battle of Ginnis, when a large army of the Khalifa, endeavouring to invade Egyptian territory, was defeated with great loss. For his services Ardagh was mentioned in despatches. On 17 December 1886 he was promoted to a regimental lieutenant-colonel, and on 26 January 1887 he was gazetted a colonel on the staff. =India= In November 1887 Ardagh returned to London as assistant adjutant-general for defence and mobilisation at the war office, and inaugurated schemes of mobilisation for over-seas service, and for local home defence. From April 1888 to 1893 he was aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. In October 1888 he became, with the permission of the War Office, private secretary to the Viceroy of India, the Marquis of Lansdowne. Apart for a period of absence through illness in 1892, he remained with Lord Lansdowne through his term of office. He returned to England in May 1894, after serving briefly under Lansdowne's successor, Lord Elgin. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1892, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1894. =South African War= Ardagh served as commandant of the School of Military Engineering at Chatham from April 1895 until April 1896, when he returned to the War Office to serve as Director of Military Intelligence. He was promoted to major-general on 14 March 1898. On the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899, Ardagh's department was criticized for providing poor intelligence on the military strength and preparations the Boers had made for war. In response, Ardagh, in spite of a limited staff and inadequate funds, compiled a full statement of the numbers and military resources of the Boer forces, estimating that the defence of the British colonies would require 40,000 men, while to carry the war into the enemy's country would require 200,000. Copies of this report were eventually laid before both houses of parliament at Ardagh's request. Meanwhile a copy of Military Notes on the Dutch Republic, a study prepared in secret by Ardagh's intelligence branch, fell into the hands of the Boers after the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October 1899, and was later published. These documents, which were corroborated by evidence laid before the royal commission after the war, absolved Ardagh of all blame. =Later career and death= In addition to his ordinary duties Ardagh was also a member of a committee on submarine telegraph cables, and in 1899 served as military technical adviser to the British delegates, Sir Julian Pauncefote and Sir Henry Howard, to the First Hague Conference. There he took a leading part in drawing up the Rules respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land. After leaving the War Office in March 1901 he served as British agent before a commission to investigate the claims of foreign powers on account of the deportation to Europe of subjects of theirs domiciled in South Africa during the war. From October 1901 he was a member of the British tribunal to arbitrate the Chile-Argentina boundary dispute and helped to draft the final settlement. From December 1901 to May 1902 he was in South Africa settling miscellaneous claims in connection with the war, which was still going on. He returned to South Africa later in the year with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general as member of the royal commission for the revision of martial law sentences. On 9 August 1902, at the age of 62, Ardagh was placed on half-pay and retired from active military service, but was still employed by the Foreign Office. He succeeded Lord Pauncefote on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, and was appointed by the British government as a director of the Suez Canal Company. In December 1902 he was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). Ardagh also served as a member of council of the British Red Cross Society from 1905, representing the British Army, and in June 1906 was one of four delegates of the British government, at the conference held by the Swiss government for the revision of the Geneva Convention of 1864. His last public duty was to act as a delegate of the central committee of the society at the Eighth International Conference in London in June 1907, after which he received the Red Cross Commemoration Medal for his services during the Russo-Japanese War from the Empress Marie Feodorovna of Russia. Ardagh died on 30 September 1907 at Glynllivon Park, Carnarvon, and is buried at the Church of St Mary & All Saints, Broomfield, near Taunton, Somerset. Personal life On 18 February 1896 Ardagh married Susan, the widow of the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury and the daughter of John Hamilton of Fyne Court, Somerset. In addition to his military activities Ardagh served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society, was an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and was a member of the Royal Society's Geodetic Arc Committee in 1900. He was made an honorary Legum Doctor by Trinity College, Dublin, in 1897. In October 1894 he published an article on British rule in Egypt in the Quarterly Review, and contributed occasionally to other periodicals. He was also a skilled artist, and 140 of his water-colour drawings were presented by his wife to the Royal Engineers Institute at Chatham. A biography, also written by his wife, was published in 1909.

Biography Sergius was born at Tella, and was a friend of Jacob Baradaeus. He became a monk at the monastery of Hala, and was ordained a priest by the bishop John of Anazarbus. As a monk, Sergius accepted the doctrine of tritheism, and accompanied Jacob Baradaeus to Constantinople in 527. At Constantinople, Sergius tutored Empress Theodora's grandson Athanasius, and became a friend of John Philoponus, who wrote a non-Chalcedonian treatise named \\"A Treatise Concerning the Whole and the Parts\\" at Sergius' request. Jacob Baradaeus, who had become Bishop of Edessa, consecrated Sergius as patriarch of Antioch at Constantinople, thus cementing the schism in the church of Antioch into the non-Chalcedonian Syriac Orthodox Church and Chalcedonian Imperial Church. Sources disagree on the date of Sergius' consecration as patriarch. According to the Zuqnin Chronicle, he was consecrated in 544, whereas John of Ephesus in his Ecclesiastical History dates the consecration to 557. Sergius resided at Constantinople for the duration of his term as patriarch, for which he was later erroneously termed patriarch of Constantinople by the 14th-century historian Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos in his Ecclesiastical History. He died a natural death, either in 547 as per the Zuqnin Chronicle, or in 560 as per John of Ephesus.

It is based in Hertfordshire, and provides financial, educational, legal, and emotional support enabling people to find new communities and support networks after Haredi Judaism. Mission According to the Mavar's website, the organisation offers information, one-to-one support, online resources, and referrals to appropriate agencies and organisations, including lawyers or therapists. Mavar also assigns a personal mentor to guide through the issues such as education, employment, welfare, housing, and legal rights. Mavar is described as a \\"confidential service that helps people from the Haredi community explore new paths in life\\", which includes LGBT support. Mavar does not campaign or proselytize, and exists to support personal choice. Structure Mavar is based in Hertfordshire, and is based around a model established by the New York charity Footsteps. Mavar's director, a non-practising Jew, prefers to remain anonymous in the press, and its services are run by volunteers. It is free of charge, relying on private donations, and is strictly confidential. Mavar translates from Hebrew as \\"crossings\\", and to maintain discretion, it meets people asking for help in quiet, but public, places away from the Haredi community such as a library or theatre foyer. Typically, Mavar begins by helping to access English lessons, as many leaving the community cannot write or speak English. Mavar will also help access housing and benefits, according to individual need. Mavar may also be able to link to a host family in some circumstances.

History Hugh Fraser was born in Inverness, Scotland, a son of John Fraser (died 20 October 1882), emigrated to South Australia with four brothers in 1863, and went to work at the slate mines in Mintaro. He later started his own slate quarry, then moved to Adelaide to act as manager for the Delabole Slate Company, which he took over when it got into financial difficulties. He reversed the company's fortunes and later ran a marble masonry business on the corner of Franklin and Bentham Streets. Politics Fraser won the seat of West Adelaide in 1878 as a Protectionist, with W. K. Simms as his junior colleague. He was successful again in 1881, with C. C. Kingston as his running mate. This partnership again went to the polls in 1887, but Fraser was defeated by A. A. Fox, his stronger showing being overcome by a splitting of votes. He subsequently stood for the seat of Stanley, but failed; attributable said some, to the enmity the Press felt when the \\" wily, obstinate, pertinacious, rugged, blunt, eloquent Scotchman\\" spoke in favour of removing postage privileges that newspapers then enjoyed. :\\"Hugh Fraser's parliamentary monument was the imposition of postage upon newspapers; it brought the State a revenue of ¬£8,000 a year straightaway; and it proved a veritable parliamentary tombstone to the author, for he never recovered from the unpopularity it won for him. and his public career was thenceforward dead\\" Other interests Fraser had a deep love for Scottish culture.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and is an example of 19th century vernacular architecture of Texas.  Saltbox house  Max Aue was born in Anhalt-K√∂then, Germany in 1826 and immigrated to Texas in 1852. He purchased a tract of land from John O. Meusebach, on which in 1855 he built a story saltbox limestone rubble house with exterior steps leading to a cellar. Inside the structure was a staircase leading to the upper loft that Aue used as his residence. The lower 2-room level functioned as a mercantile store. The house was a stop on the San Antonio-Boerne Stage Road. During the 1970s the saltbox house was given structural upgrades and expansions to convert it into a restaurant.  Dog trot house  When he married Emma Topperwin in February 1857, he built a 1-story stuccoed dog trot double-pen cedar log cabin as their new home. As the family grew, extensions were made to the cabin. The dog trot house was added to the San Antonio project of the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1968. The survey noted that the 2-chimneyed dirt floor house measured , and that the diameters of the individual logs measured .  Greek revival hotel  A 2-story Greek Revival style structure was added to the complex in 1878, to function as a hotel for travelers along the stage route. In a reverse of how the original saltbox house functioned, the new 2-story house provided for family living quarters on the bottom floor. Guest quarters were on the second floor. The 2-story veranda was done in the Victorian style of architecture. When the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway connected San Antonio with a direct route to the Texas gulf coast in 1886, the railroad spur was from the Aue Hotel. The dog trot cabin was later incorporated into the hotel on the ground level through the south rooms and an interconnected shed.

Proposals Gate area inside the North Terminal, showing flight information screens Several options to expand Gatwick have been considered, including a third terminal and a second runway to the south of the existing runway. This would allow Gatwick to handle more passengers than Heathrow does today. If a second, wide-spaced (as opposed to close parallel) runway is approved, a new terminal could be sited between the two runways. This could either complement or replace the current South Terminal, depending on expected future traffic developments. =Second runway= In 1979, an agreement was reached with West Sussex County Council not to build a second runway before 2019. In its original consultation document published on 23 July 2002 the Government decided to expand Stansted and Heathrow, but not Gatwick. However, Medway Council, Kent County Council and Essex County Council sought a judicial review of this decision. The judge reviewing the lawfulness of the Government's decision ruled that excluding Gatwick from the original consultation was irrational and/or unfair. Following the judge's ruling and the Secretary of State for Transport's decision not to appeal, BAA published new consultation documents. These included an option of a possible second runway at Gatwick to the south of the existing airport boundary, leaving the villages Charlwood and Hookwood to the north of the airport intact. This led to protests about increased noise and pollution, demolition of houses and destruction of villages. On 2 December 2009, the House of Commons Transport Select Committee published a report entitled The future of aviation. With regard to Gatwick, it calls on the Government to reconsider its decision to build a second runway at Stansted, in the light of growing evidence that the business case is unconvincing and that Gatwick is a better location. Speaking at the first Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee (Gatcom) meeting since GIP's takeover of the airport (held on 28 January 2010 at Crawley's Arora Hotel), Gatwick's chairman Sir David Rowlands ruled out building a second runway for the foreseeable future, citing the high cost of the associated planning application ‚Äì estimated to be between ¬£100 million and ¬£200 million ‚Äì as the main reason for the new owners' lack of interest. At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the current limit on the permitted number of take-offs and landings.Dixon, A., Second runway plans to remain grounded, Skyport, Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 26 February 2010, pp. 1, 3 However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing airport capacity shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12 million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of transfer traffic by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).entitled PaxIS and AirportIS data products This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airportsHeathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, City and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by transfer traffic at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.Heathrow: 24 million transfer passengers (35%) of 69 million passengers in 2011; Gatwick: 2.4 million transfer passengers (7%) of 34 million passengers in 2011; Stansted: insignificant number of transfer passengers (0%) of 18 million passengers in 2011; Luton: insignificant number of transfer passengers (0%) of 9.5 million passengers in 2011; City: 0.06 million transfer passengers (2%) of 3 million passengers in 2011 On 23 July 2013, Gatwick unveiled its proposals for a second runway to the south of the existing runway and airport boundary. If approved, the new runway could open by 2025 and cost between ¬£5 billion and ¬£9 billion, depending on the option chosen ‚Äì i.e., a new runway south of the existing runway, a new runway less than but more than south of the existing runway or a new runway less than south of the existing runway. The first option would allow both runways to be simultaneously used for takeoffs and landings and increase total runway capacity by more than 80% to up to 100 aircraft movements per hour. It would also increase the airport's annual maximum passenger capacity from the present 45 to 87 million. The second option would allow both runways to be used simultaneously as well, with one handling takeoffs and the other landings. This would increase total runway capacity by ca. 36% to about 75 aircraft movements per hour and result in an increase in annual maximum passenger capacity to 82 million. The third option would allow only one runway to be used at a time but would still increase total runway capacity by over 20% to at least 67 aircraft movements per hour and annual maximum passenger capacity to 66 million. Regardless of the option chosen, the total projected cost includes the cost of a third terminal next to the existing railway line. On 17 December 2013, the Airports Commission chaired by Sir Howard Davies published its shortlist of which Southeast airports should be considered for additional runways. In addition to two alternatives at Heathrow, it recommended an option for an additional wide-spaced, runway at Gatwick as first proposed by Gatwick Airport Limited on 23 July 2013 for further examination ahead of publishing its final report by summer 2015. The commission estimates the cost to be around ¬£9.3 billion; ¬£2 billion higher than Gatwick's own estimate. On 2 June 2016, Birmingham Airport declared support for a second runway at Gatwick rather than Heathrow. Birmingham Airport CEO Paul Kehoe said that a second runway at Gatwick would allow Birmingham to continue to prosper, and that Heathrow expansion could inhibit the growth of other airports, including Birmingham. In May 2020, following approval by the CAA of plans to increase flights by 50,000 per year, Gatwick confirmed plans to bring its Northern runway into routine use. =Terminal extension= A less ambitious alternative would extend the North Terminal further south, with another passenger bridge to an area currently occupied by aircraft stands without jet bridges (Pier 7). However, figure A.12 in Gatwick's new draft master plan released for consultation on 13 October 2011 seems to discard the earlier-mooted Pier 7 option in favour of a mid-field satellite adjacent to the control tower that would be linked to the North Terminal if built as part of an expanded single-runway, two-terminal airport scenario around 2030.Draft Gatwick Master Plan (A single runway airport ‚Äì 2030: 10.2.14 Aprons and piers and Figure A.12, p. 93 and Appendix A ‚Äì Drawings), Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, 13 October 2011 There are also plans to extend Pier 6.Draft Gatwick Master Plan (Gatwick in 2020 ‚Äì Development opportunities: 6.4.11 Pier redevelopment and Figure A.8, p. 52 and Appendix A ‚Äì Drawings), Gatwick Airport, West Sussex, 13 October 2011 In October 2009, BAA submitted planning applications for Gatwick to handle an extra six million passengers a year by 2018 and for an extension to the North Terminal to provide new check-in facilities and additional baggage reclaim hall capacity, along with a 900 space short-stay car park. Crawley Borough Council's decision to approve these plans was upheld in November 2009 by the Government's refusal to hold a public inquiry despite objections from local environmental protesters. In October 2010, Gatwick Airport Limited (GAL) received planning permission from Crawley Borough Council to adapt both terminals to handle the Airbus A380 on a regular, commercial basis. At the Gatcom meeting held on 26 January 2012 at Crawley's Arora Hotel, GAL announced that its board had approved construction of A380 pier infrastructure comprising new three-bridge gates at the North Terminal's Pier 6.Gatcom (Minutes of the meeting held on 26 January 2012 ‚Äì Agenda item no. 3: Helping our airlines to grow, 3.3 Other, p. 19), Chichester, West Sussex, 19 April 2012 The first of these became operational on 26 March 2013. ='Heathwick' rail link= In late-2011 the Department for Transport began studying the feasibility of a high-speed rail link between Gatwick and Heathrow Airport. This rail link would form part of a plan to combine the UK's two biggest airports into a \\"collective\\" or \\"virtual hub\\" dubbed Heathwick. The scheme envisages a 35-mile high-speed rail route linking the two airports in 15 minutes, with trains travelling at a top speed of 180 mph parallel to the M25 and passengers passing through immigration or check-in only once. A 2018 proposal for a high-speed railway link to Heathrow, HS4Air, was rejected. The proposal was part of a scheme to link the High Speed 1 and High Speed 2 railway lines and connect regional cities in Britain to the Channel Tunnel.

During this time, he also studied at the monastery. In February 846, following the death of Dionysius I Telmaharoyo, Patriarch of Antioch, John was elected and consecrated Patriarch of Antioch at the Monastery of Shila near Serugh. After his consecration, John issued twenty-five canons. John's twenty-second canon forbade the adoption of pagan funeral customs and his twenty-third canon forbade adherents who had married their daughters to pagans, Jews, and Zoroastrians from entering the church.Thomas et al. (2009), pp. 92-93 He corresponded with Pope Joseph I of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a fellow miaphysite church, early in his reign. He later consecrated a certain David, a monk of the Monastery of Qartmin, as Bishop of Harran.Palmer (1990), p. 10 In 869, John held the Council of Capharthutha and issued eight canons on the offices of patriarch and maphrian. A total of eighty-six bishops were ordained by John during his tenure and he served in the office of patriarch until his death on 3 January 873. Notes *John IV is also counted as John III as the third patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church by that name, however, the Syriac Orthodox Church, which claims descent from the Church of Antioch, considers John of the Sedre (r. 631‚Äì648) to be the third by that name.

He played college basketball for the Detroit Titans after transferring from the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team following his sophomore season. He played high school basketball for Columbia Christian Schools. He was one of 26 players selected for the April 18, 2014 Jordan Brand Classic. He is a cousin of Ndamukong Suh. High school career Chatman took official visits to Michigan, Oregon, USC and Arizona in successive weeks in September 2013. Chatman led Columbia Christian to the 2014 Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) Class 1A championship with a team-high 19 points in the 69-48 victory over Horizon Christian Schools on March 8. He formerly played for varsity basketball for Jefferson High School in Portland, Oregon (2010‚Äì12), junior varsity at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, California (2012‚Äì13) due to eligibility issues after transferring. He had transferred to Long Beach, where his godfather and travel team coach Sharrief Metoyer was the coach, but the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) ruled him ineligible for varsity competition for following his travel team coach. Upon returning to Oregon, he chose a small school (Columbia Christian) so that he could focus on his academics with fewer distractions. When he was named to the Jordan Brand Classic, he was the fourth-highest rated commit in the Big Ten behind Ohio State recruits D'Angelo Russell and Keita Bates-Diop and Indiana's James Blackmon, Jr., according to Rivals.com. Russell and Blackmon were also selected for the Jordan Brand Classic. Chatman scored 7 points and had 2 assists in eleven minutes of play in the game. On May 5, 2014, USA Basketball announced the 21 athletes (including Chatman) invited to tryout from June 10 to 19 for the 12-member USA national team for the June 20-24, 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Chatman was one of 10 incoming freshman to be selected. Eventually, 24 players tried out for the team and Chatman was eliminated when the roster was cut to 15 on June 12. Chatman planned to enroll at Michigan for the summer semester on June 19 or thereabouts. College career Chatman in 2015 =Freshman year= The 2013‚Äì14 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team had been outright champions of 2013‚Äì14 Big Ten Conference and reached the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, but lost three players to the 2014 NBA draft: Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary and Glenn Robinson III. Chatman started in his debut and opened the season with a team-high 4 steals against on November 15. On November 29, he contributed career highs of 11 points and 8 rebounds against Nicholls State. On December 2, he posted a team-high 9 rebounds in a 68-65 victory over Syracuse. On January 6 against Penn State Spike Albrecht replaced Chatman in the starting lineup. On January 17 against Northwestern, Caris LeVert suffered a season-ending injury, but Chatman was also injured in the game. On January 20, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert, but with Aubrey Dawkins in the starting lineup (making his first start), not Chatman. On March 7 against Rutgers, Chatman posted his season-high 13 points. =Sophomore year= Chatman began the season as a starter against . In the March 11, 2016 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament quarterfinals upset of No. 1-seeded (#10 AP Poll/#10 Coaches Poll) Indiana, Chatman scored the game-winning three-point field goal with 0.2 seconds remaining. Following the season, Kameron Chatman announced his intention to transfer with two years of eligibility remaining. On June 8, Chatman he committed to transfer to play at for the Detroit Titans under head coach Bacari Alexander after sitting out one season. Alexander had been a Michigan assistant coach until a few weeks earlier. One week later, his father, Canaan Chatman, was announced as an assistant coach on Alexander's staff. =Redshirt junior year= Chatman debuted with a team-high 23 points for Detroit Mercy against Virginia Tech on November 10. On November 19, Chatman achieved a double-double when posted 22 points and 16 rebounds in an overtime victory over Houston Baptist. On November 22, Chatman hit the game- winning shot with 2 seconds left as part of an 18-point, 9-rebound effort in a 72-70 victory against St. Louis. Chatman was named Horizon League Player of the Week on November 27. In a November 28 loss to Fort Wayne, Chatman posted a career-high 31 points and 10 rebounds. Through games of January 5, Chatman led the Horizon League in rebounding (8.8) and three-point shooting percentage (46.2%) and was fourth in scoring (18.0), then he was sidelined with an injury. He missed three games before returning to the lineup on January 16. Following the regular season, he was named to the All-Horizon League second team. After a season in which he led his team in scoring (17.8) and rebounding (8.3) and was among the top 10 in the Horizon League in several statistics, he declared for the 2018 NBA draft but did not immediately hire an agent. Although he was not expected to remain eligible for the draft, he eventually hired an agent and forfeited his college eligibility. An issue for him at the time of his decision was the fact that Detroit Mercy had not hired a coach after firing head coach Bacari Alexander two months earlier, leaving the program in disarray. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Chatman signed with Pƒ±nar Kar≈üƒ±yaka of the Basketbol S√ºper Ligi. He played 13 games in the Basketbol S√ºper Ligi and 9 in the 2018‚Äì19 FIBA Europe Cup averaging 5.1 points and 2.5 rebounds in 16.7 minutes of action for Pƒ±nar Kar≈üƒ±yaka before signing with the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G League.

The complex consists of Kings Mall Shopping Centre, Kings Mall Car Park, Ashcroft Square and Sovereign Court housing estates, and the One Lyric Square office building. History The complex was designed by Richard Seifert and developed by St Martins Property Group. Residential apartments situated above the mall were constructed in 1973, whilst the shopping centre itself opened in 1980. The development originally came with a 950-space car park. It also included two office buildings constructed in the mid 1970s. The five acre site is split into two parts. The southern part, containing the main shopping centre, the original housing estate above it and one of the office buildings, is situated off King Street, to the south of the Hammersmith & City line railway line, and located between Lyric Square to the east and Leamore Street to the west. The northern part, originally containing the car park and other office building, is located to the north of the Hammersmith & City line railway line off Glenthorne Road, with Beadon Road to the east and Leamore Street to the west. The northern and southern parts of the complex are linked via a covered footbridge over the Hammersmith & City line railway line at the first floor level of the shopping centre. The only other amenities at the first floor level are public toilets and access to the original housing estate. In 2011, the owner of Kings Mall, St Martins Property Group sold it to Matterhorn Capital for ¬£115 million. In June 2015, Matterhorn Capital sold the shopping centre on to its current owner Schroders for ¬£153 million. In 2016, the car park and one of the office buildings were demolished and replaced with a smaller 753-space car park with new residential apartments situated above it. As of 2019, the centre is currently undergoing a multimillion-pound transformation. This includes removing the external staircases to the flats above outside each of the entrances to the shopping centre off King Street, and a complete internal refurbishment of the shopping arcade. In January 2020, Swedish furniture conglomerate Ikea purchased the centre https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/09/ikea-buys-west-london- shopping-mall-for-170m-in-city-centre-push Retail units Kings Mall Shopping Centre as of 2019 currently has of retail space which houses around 44 retail units split into two areas: most units are off a single level shopping arcade perpendicular and parallel to King Street, whilst the remaining units directly front onto and are accessed via King Street itself. =Current tenants= There are five anchor stores, including a branch of Primark in Unit 1. Units 2-3 are occupied by Sainsbury's (who relocated from a smaller Sainsbury's Central branch opposite the east entrance of Kings Mall in 2005). The other anchor stores are WHSmith (the only original tenant left and whose shop includes a Post Office in-store concession), H&M; and New Look. Shopping arcade outlets As of 2019, the main shopping arcade outlets are Sainsbury's, WHSmith, Wilko, Tiger, Specsavers, Warren James, The Entertainer, Card Factory, Clarks, Sky, Carphone Warehouse, EE, 02 and Ping Pong Parlour. King Street outlets As of 2019, the main King Street outlets are Primark, H&M;, New Look, Foot Locker, Holland & Barrett, Toni & Guy, Wasabi, Costa Coffee, Patisserie Valerie, NatWest, HSBC and Santander. =Former tenants= Unit 1 used to be occupied by Littlewoods, but now houses a branch of Primark. Units 2-3 were originally operated by Safeway, but this has been a Sainsbury's since 2005. A combined Mothercare and Early Learning Centre branch was previously where H&M; currently is, whilst River Island was in the unit which New Look now leases. Superdrug and Poundland formerly had branches right in the centre of the shopping arcade, but both relocated to be on the opposite side of King Street itself, outside of the Kings Mall Shopping Centre. Shopping arcade outlets The main shopping arcade outlets were Safeway, Blue Inc, Habitat, Superdrug, Poundland, Utopia, Game, Dixons, Clintons, Mrs Florist, Vodafone, The Body Shop, Burger King and Feast Canteen.

Car park Kings Mall Car Park serves the Kings Mall Shopping Centre and the wider Hammersmith area. It is situated to the rear of the development off Glenthorne Road, on the other side of the Hammersmith & City line railway line. =Original car park= When Kings Mall opened in 1980, it originally came with a 950-space four storey multi-storey car park developed by St Martins Property Group. The size of this car park meant that not only could it serve the customers of the Kings Mall Shopping Centre, but it could also be used by people visiting other areas in Hammersmith town centre or even commuters using the Hammersmith tube stations. =Current car park= When St Martins Property Group sold Kings Mall in 2011 to Matterhorn Capital, plans were drawn up to demolish the multi-storey car park off Glenthorne Road along with the adjacent West 45 office building off Beadon Road, and replace it with a mixed use development by St George (part of Berkeley Group Holdings), to be called Sovereign Court. The plans include erecting a single building with heights ranging from 4-17 storeys, plus two basement levels, to provide a smaller 700-space replacement public basement car park, new ground floor commercial floorspace and 418 new homes with 53 residential parking spaces and 460 cycle spaces. Residential apartments Kings Mall is home to two housing estates: Ashcroft Square and Sovereign Court. =Ashcroft Square= Ashcroft Square is a local authority housing estate which consists of seven blocks of flats arranged around a central courtyard. The development is situated right on top of the main shopping centre itself. It was originally built in 1973 by St Martins Property Group and the dwellings were constructed using brick and concrete. The flats are leased to Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council on full repairing and insuring leases, with responsibility for repairs and maintenance being split between the landlord and the council. =Sovereign Court= Sovereign Court is a luxury housing estate which is situated on the other side of the Hammersmith & City line railway line with the basement car park beneath it. It was originally built in 2019 by St George (part of Berkeley Group Holdings). It is one large building with heights ranging from 4-17 storeys comprising 418 luxury apartments with 53 residential parking spaces and 460 cycle spaces. Office buildings Kings Mall has also been home to two office buildings: One Lyric Square and West 45. =One Lyric Square= One Lyric Square is a 14-storey Grade A office building consisting of of accommodation. It was constructed in the mid 1970s and is situated adjacent to the east side of the Kings Mall Shopping Centre, taking its name from the Lyric Square market place area situated in front of it. As of 2019 the first eight floors are leased to The Office Group. =West 45= West 45 was a former eight storey office building consisting of of accommodation with each upper floor having approximately of office space. It was constructed in the mid 1970s and is situated off Beadon Road on the other side of the Hammersmith & City line railway line. It was demolished in 2014 to make way for the Sovereign Court housing development. Transport connections Kings Mall is easily accessible by both private and public transport: *London Underground: Two Underground stations serve the centre - both the Hammersmith Broadway (housing the Piccadilly and District lines tube station), and the separate Hammersmith & City and Circle lines tube station located on the other side of the A315 road, are only a short walk away. *Bus: The Kings Mall Shopping Centre U bus stop is located outside Unit 1 49-63 King Street (currently occupied by Poundland, and previously occupied by Sainsbury's Central and then HMV), opposite the east entrance of the Kings Mall Shopping Centre.

The Foundation is dedicated to reducing the impact of prostate cancer on Australian men, their partners and families, recognising the diversity of the Australian community. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia receives Government funding for specific projects and relies on the generosity of individuals, the community and partnerships to carry out its work.Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia Annual Report 2017-18  History  Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia was formed in Sydney in 1996. The television personality, Roger Climpson OAM, a member of the Rotary Club of Lane Cove, was treated successfully for prostate cancer in 1994. Roger was concerned by the confusing information available to him at the time of diagnosis and treatment and by the apparent lack of research into the disease being carried out in Australia. In 1996 he persuaded fellow club members to join him in forming the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research. Then in 1998 a committee of support group representatives from the greater Sydney and Newcastle area formed the Association of Prostate Cancer Support Groups (APCSG) that had a state focus but hoped to connect support groups nationally. APCSG led by Max Gardner AM moved to affiliate with PCRF. As this occurred another NSW based fundraising group, the Australian Prostate Cancer Foundation (APCF) also emerged. In 1999 PCRF, APCF and APSCG merged under PCRF's corporate structure and the new name Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia was chosen to reflect the organisation's widened agenda. Within this the APSCG maintained its own identity and autonomy. It was not until 2001 that the relationship between the national support group movement and PCFA was clearly and formally established. At this point there were 40 support groups across the country. The key pivotal moment was an Inaugural Conference of Affiliated Prostate Cancer Support Groups (organised by PCFA) that provided the first national forum for support group representatives across Australia to connect and devise strategies to address priority issues for prostate cancer survivors and advance the broader movement. At this conference the support groups declared PCFA as the peak national body for prostate cancer and the Association of Prostate Cancer Support Groups became the Support and Advocacy Committee (now known as the National Support Groups Committee) within PCFA's governance structure.  Work  Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia works across three broad areas *Promoting and funding world leading, innovative research into prostate cancer *Implementing awareness and advocacy campaigns and education programs for the Australian Community, health professionals and Government *Supporting men and their families affected by prostate cancer through evidence-based information and resources, Support Groups and Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurses. = Research = Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia provides funding for prostate cancer research in Australia. The Foundation has a responsibility to the generous public who funds prostate cancer research; it must invest its research funds wisely. By consulting widely with Australian men with prostate cancer and those who care for them, the Foundation directs funds to research projects that best address their needs. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's research strategyProstate Cancer Foundation of Australia Research Strategy 2019-22 provides a clear, long term, approach to funding. Its overarching goal is to create and promote the uptake of knowledge that will improve the lives of Australian men with prostate cancer, their partners and their families. The objectives of Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's research program are: *Support men with prostate cancer, their partners and their families *Contribute to the Foundation's work in advocacy, and its awareness and support programs = Awareness = Prostate cancer remains a significant killer of men in AustraliaProstate Cancer in Australia.

Research, Awareness, Support: Ten Years of Progress in Prostate Cancer. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia 2012. A primary focus of Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's awareness activities is to inform the entire community about this important health issue.  Ambassador Program  The Ambassador Program is a community education program aiming to raise awareness of prostate cancer and provide resources from which participants can further their knowledge.pcfa.org.au/articleLive/pages/PCFA- Ambassador-Program.html Approximately one hundred ambassadors are currently trained to deliver presentations to the public about prevention and early detection, treatment options and challenges. The Ambassador Program operates in all States and Territories of Australia.

Prostate Cancer Information Needs of Australian Gay and Bisexual Men. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia 2013. Development of Consumer Resources for Prostate Cancer. Zest Health Strategies 2012 identified a need to target prostate cancer information toward different audience groups. As part of the Supporting men with prostate cancer through evidence-based resources and support project, a Cancer Australia initiative funded by the Australian Government, Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia has produced a series of information booklets to cater to men with localised prostate cancer, men with advanced prostate cancer, partners and carers, gay and bisexual men, and younger men. Each series contains four booklets covering diagnosis, treatment, side effects and wellbeing. Each booklet can be read as a standalone resource or as part of the set. The resources are available through Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's support group network, hospitals, from Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurses, cancer centres and GPs. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia also provides translated key resources into five languages ‚Äì Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Italian and Vietnamese and a flip chart for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men.  National clinical guidelines  In partnership with Cancer Council Australia and a multi- disciplinary expert advisory panel comprising urologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, general practitioners, medical oncologists, epidemiologists, allied health professionals and consumers, Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia has developed national evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on PSA testing and early management of test-detected prostate cancer. The guideline recommendations have been approved by the CEO of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia's leading expert body for developing health advice for the Australian community, health professionals and governments. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia developed the guidelines in order to resolve the controversy surrounding PSA testing for both men and their doctors. The guidelines do not recommend a population screening program for prostate cancer (a program that offers testing to all men of a certain age group) as evidence does not support such a program. For men who decide to be tested it contains guidance on matters such as what age to start testing; how frequently to be tested; when to stop testing; the PSA level which should prompt further investigation; family history; and the role of the digital rectal examination. = Support = A central part of Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's activities is to support men and their families affected by prostate cancer through the development and delivery of evidence-based information and through its network of Support Groups and Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurses.  Support groups  Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia's network of support groups has grown rapidly in recent years and now comprises over 150 affiliated groups across Australia,pcfa.org.au/articleLive/pages/Prostate-Cancer-Support-Groups sharing information, providing encouragement and raising awareness amongst men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their families. Support groups provide reassurance to men with prostate cancer from others who have personal experience of the challenges they are facing. Men who attend support groups are able to talk through the pros and cons of treatment options with other men, compare their physical and mental wellbeing and outcomes, and benchmark their own progress along the cancer journey.  Prostate Cancer Specialist Nursing Service  The Prostate Cancer Specialist Nursing Service supports the placement of prostate cancer specialist nurses in a variety of Australian health care settings in partnership with health service providers. The Prostate Cancer Specialist Nursing Service has been made possible thanks to funding from the Federal Government and generous local and community supporters. Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurses work within an agreed Practice Framework and Competency Standards which are based on nationally recognised best practice models. Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia is committed to providing ongoing professional development and support for the duration of the program. Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurses work as part of a multidisciplinary team to provide a point of contact for men and offer continuity of care from diagnosis onwards. They see patients at any point during their cancer journey and help patients and their families to navigate the complex system of health services, make decisions about treatment options, and manage side effects of treatment.

Genres  = Instrumental literature = One responsibility of the collaborative pianist is to perform the piano part of the instrumental sonata literature. These are duo chamber works, and the role of the pianist in this genre is that of equal partner with the instrumentalist. This includes a large number of works such as but not limited to the following important works from the string repertoire: * Wolfgang A. Mozart, Sonatas for Piano and Violin * Ludwig van Beethoven, 10 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, 5 Sonatas for Cello and Piano *Franz Schubert, 3 Sonatinas for Violin and Piano, et al. *Robert Schumann, 3 Sonatas for Violin and Piano *Cesar Franck, Sonata for Violin and Piano * Johannes Brahms, 3 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, 2 Sonatas for Cello and Piano, 2 Sonatas for Clarinet (or Viola) and Piano * Edvard Grieg, 3 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, Sonata for Cello and Piano * Gabriel Faur√©, 2 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, 2 Sonatas for Cello and Piano * Claude Debussy, Violin Sonata, Cello Sonata *Richard Strauss, Violin Sonata, Cello Sonata * George Enescu, 3 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, 2 Sonatas for Cello and Piano * Sergei Prokofiev, 2 Sonatas for Violin and Piano, Sonata for Cello and Piano In addition to sonatas, the instrumental collaborative piano literature includes short pieces, often of a virtuoso nature. In this genre, the original work is often for a soloist with orchestral accompaniment; but in order to enable the work to be performed under wider circumstances, composers often also write piano reductions of the orchestral score. Another important responsibility of the collaborative pianist is to perform the accompaniment of other, multi- movement non-chamber works such as concertos. In this role, the collaborative pianist is often serving as a rehearsal partner for the study of this extensive repertoire as preparation for the instrumentalist's subsequent performance with orchestral accompaniment.
