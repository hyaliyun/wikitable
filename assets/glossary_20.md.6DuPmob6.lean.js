The allegations regarding the second controversy are regarding her religion. Born into a Hindu family and named Aparupa Poddar at birth, she converted to Islam and married a Muslim man. She then stood for election from a parliamentary constituency which is reserved for those belonging to the scheduled castes. The Bharatiya Janata Party duly lodged a complaint with the Election Commission seeking cancellation of her candidature on the plea that she had converted to Islam and hence she did not belong to a scheduled caste.

The game was initially released for the Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 operating systems on May 6, 2014 as a free download from the respective app stores. The game is also available for iOS and Android devices. The name Snap Attack was trademarked on April 3, 2014. In March 2018, it was announced that Snap Attack would be shut down as of May 18 of that year.  Gameplay  A game in progress. An example of a Single-Snap is the word \\"fur\\" on the board, and a Multi-Snap are the words \\"cops\\", \\"es\\", \\"er\\" and \\"ar\\". There are also special, high-scoring rounds like \\"Digram\\" as seen here. Like Wordament, players simultaneously compete to get as many points as possible. The game is similar to the Scrabble board game where a board is given with fixed words and bonus tiles (letter and word multipliers) on the board, and seven movable tiles with letters on the \\"rack\\". Snap Attack's board is 8×7 squares, smaller than a traditional Scrabble board. Points are earned by making \\"Snaps\\" - valid combinations of letters that form a word or words with the ones already found on the board. \\"Single-Snaps\\" are linear combinations of letters that form one word, while \\"Multi-Snaps\\" are combinations that form two or more words. Snaps are scored by first multiplying the value of tiles located on a letter multiplier, adding up the points of the tiles forming each valid word, multiplying the total points by any word multiplier crossed, and finally multiplying with a \\"number of tiles used\\" multiplier. Players attempt to make as many high-scoring Snaps as they can find within a round, which lasts two and a half minutes. At the end of a round, a selection of top-scoring valid Snaps are displayed, followed by the results of all players in each round. The next round then automatically begins. Like Wordament, each game runs 24 hours, meaning that players may enter the game in the middle of a round. The memorization of two-letter words is considered a useful skill in this game.

It was developed in 1995 by Waaijenberg together with the Delft University of Technology. In addition to the standard petrol- engined production models, an electric Canta was designed for the German market but it has remained at the prototype stage. In the Netherlands, it is classified as a mobility aid because the width of the vehicle is only 1.10 metres, thus it may - unlike larger microcars - be used on cycle paths as well as sidewalks and footpaths; in addition a driver's license is not required. Each Canta is built with the adaptations required by the customer, such as locating controls and switches on the left or right side, or all on the steering wheel. Seats have a wide range of adjustment and can swivel to ease entry and exit. Instead of having a driver's seat, the \\"Ride-in Canta\\" () model is designed so that a wheelchair user can enter by a ramp at the rear and drive while seated in their wheelchair. The rear of the vehicle is lowered to the ground when parked and is raised pneumatically when the engine is started.  De Canta danst!  De Canta danst! is a TV co-production by Viewpoint Productions and NTR in cooperation with the Dutch National Ballet that choreographically features the microcar. It is part of Het Nationale Canta ballet, which in turn is an initiative of actress-director Maartje Nevejan. It was choreographed by Ernst Meisner of the Dutch National Ballet, with the music written by composer Robin Rimbaud. The project was financially supported by Stichting Doen and the SNS REAAL Fund.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Thetford Mines, Quebec. Thetford Mines was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 7 July 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City, Quebec and launched 30 October later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 24 May 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda, Thetford Mines was assigned to escort group EG 25 based out of Halifax and performed local escort duties. She transferred with the group in November 1944 to Derry. On 7 March 1945, with and , she helped sink in St. George's Channel using depth charges and hedgehogs. Later that month, she rescued 33 survivors from after it was rammed by and scuttled. Two of the survivors died after rescue and were buried at sea. Thetford Mines remained in the waters surrounding the United Kingdom until the end of hostilities in Europe. On 11 May 1945 she arrived at Lough Foyle escorting eight surrendered U-boats. Later that month she returned to Canada and was paid off on 18 November 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia and laid up at Shelburne. Postwar service Thetford Mines was sold in 1947 to a Honduran buyer who intended to turn her into a refrigerated mercantile vessel, primarily to carry fruit. She was converted and renamed Thetis. Her fate is unknown. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John. The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910–1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships.

He served as the chairman and member of the Makah Tribal Council from 1998 until 2000 and from 2001 until 2007. He was chairman of the Makah during the first successful hunt of a Pacific gray whale in 1999. The 1999 hunt, which took a 30-ton 30 1/2-foot female gray whale, was the first harvest of a whale by the Makah since the 1920s. Johnson supported the hunt, which drew worldwide attention and controversy. The Makah had retained the right to practice whaling under the Treaty of Neah Bay in 1855, the only tribe in the continental United States to do so. The Makah stopped whaling in the 1920s due to the decline of the gray whale population, but decided to resume the harvest in the 1990s after the Pacific gray whale was removed from the list of endangered species in 1994. Whale meat had been a vital component of the diet of the Makah people for hundreds of years. Johnson, a proponent of the 1999 hunt, worried that the cultural significance of whaling would be lost on younger Makah members if the harvest did not resume. In a 2009 interview with the Peninsula Daily News, Johnson reflected on the long-term significance of the 1999 hunt on the Makah, \\"I should feel happy about that day, but I'm not because we have people that are still against us...It gets old. We don't want to stir the pot again. People don't like to hear the truth. We have to think about things like that. We [the Makah] are whalers.\\" Ben Johnson was born on May 22, 1939, in Neah Bay, Washington to parents, Bender Johnson Sr. and Harriet Eliot Stewart. He first fished with his father and grandfather when he was five years old, which led to a career focused on the fishing industry. Johnson lived in Neah Bay for his entire life, with the exception of two years when he left to study at Peninsula College in nearby Port Angeles, Washington. He received an associate degree, a fisheries technician degree and several professional certifications from Peninsula College. After leaving Peninsula College, Johnson worked as a biologist for the now defunct U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (which has since merged into the present-day National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). He worked on board a Bureau research vessel, the George B. Kelez, in the Bering Sea. Johnson soon returned to Neah Bay, where he lived for the rest of his life. He devoted much of his professional life to serving the Makah and the Makah Reservation, specifically in tribal government and the fishing industry. He worked as the personnel officer, general manager, fisheries assistant director and fisheries director. He also served as the Makah director of fisheries, member of the Makah Housing Authority, and the executive director of the Makah Tribe Youth Program. Johnson first served on the Makah Tribal Council from 1998 and 2000. He declined to seek re-election, citing the controversy surrounding the 1999 whale hunt while he was chairman. Johnson won re-election in 2001, serving as a council member and chairman until 2007. Johnson died at the age of 74 on March 31, 2014, at Olympic Medical Center following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Jeanne Johnson, five children, thirty grandchildren, and fifty-one great- grandchildren.

The Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley is one of three presbyteries in Alabama, and one of twelve comprising the \\"Synod of Living Waters\\" in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. The Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley was established on January 11, 1988 at the First Presbyterian Church of Selma. Its headquarters are located at 3603 Lorna Ridge Drive in Hoover. The Executive Presbyter is Tom Evans. Associate executive presbyters oversee Divisions focussing on \\"Nurture\\" and \\"Missions\\". A video resource library is kept at the Presbytery offices. The Presbytery operates two retreat locations, the Gulftreat camp in Panama City Beach and Living River, a retreat on the Cahaba River.  Origin  The Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley is named for William Henry Sheppard and his wife, Lucy Gantt Sheppard and for Samuel Lapsley, Alabamians who established a mission in the Congo Valley in 1890. In 2003 the Presbytery invited the Reverend Dr Mulumba Mukundi, General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in the Congo and President of the Presbyterian University of Sheppard and Lapsley there to visit Birmingham. From that visit, a partnership was forged. In 2004 a delegation of eight travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to work out a partnership agreement between the Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley, the Nganga Presbytery, and the Tshibashi Presbytery. The agreement committed all three groups to participate in a mutual relationship, work together in prayer, evangelism, education and development, and to keep contact through frequent visits. This unique partnership was highlighted at the 217th Presbyterian General Assembly which the Presbytery of Sheppards and Lapsley hosted at the Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex. Communion-ware created for the event was modeled after a Congolese wooden chalice given to the Presbytery; all attendees were given a tote-bag made in the Congo of traditional cloth, and a joint choir from the three Presbyteries performed during worship services in Birmingham.

It was taken in production again, in a modified version, in 2014. Mu-tron III Extracting elements from one of the prototypes of a synthesizer he was developing for Guild Guitar Company, Mike Beigel based the Mu-Tron III, at the instigation of Guild engineer Aaron Newman, on a prototype called the Timbre Generator. The Mu-tron III could be used for any number of electric instruments. Beigel said he chose the envelope-controlled filter over other synthesizer elements, such as ring modulation, because it sounded more musical; it was a more general effect that would lend itself to a variety of applications, and it was easy to use. The Mu-tron III was an instant success and was used by jazz/fusion guitarist Larry Coryell, Funkadelic bass player Bootsy Collins (for his \\"Space Bass\\"), guitarist Jerry Garcia, and Stevie Wonder, who used it on his Clavinet for the song \\"Higher Ground\\". Beigel was successfully granted a patent for the circuitry of the Mu-tron III. Musitronics licensed the Mu-tron III circuitry to a few different companies in the seventies – the Univox Funky Filter and Monacor Effectmatic are notable examples. The original Mu-tron III ran on 18V, using two 9V batteries; this gave it a wider dynamic range and more headroom compared to effects that ran on 9 volt. There was an optional power supply (the PS-1), and with later versions had built-in AC power supplies. The Mu-tron III used opto-isolators to control the filter, which was novel for the time, a method would also be used for the Mu-tron Phasor II and Bi-Phase. The state variable filter in the Mu-tron III allowed for low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass filter response, which could be triggered from low to high or vice versa. When ARP Instruments bought Musitronics in ‘79, they made the Mu-tron line for about a year before going out of business, and the Mu-tron III was no more. With the advent of the stompbox revival of the nineties, the Mu-tron III became one of the big-ticket items for collectors and players alike. There was a reissue of sorts, the HAZ Mu-tron III+, but Beigel says this (and other clones) did not have \\"the same magic\\". In early 1995, however, Beigel did lend his expertise to Electro- Harmonix, creating an update of his original design, the Electro-Harmonix Q-Tron, and he also designed a Bi-Filter for E-H. Three other pedals, the Mini Q-Tron, Micro Q-Tron and Q-Tron+, are available from EHX as well, who now also offer the Bi-Filter, a modern version of Beigel Sound Lab's Envelope Controlled Filter, made in 1979. Michael Dregni, in Vintage Guitar, noted that none of the \\"clones, copycats, and other attempts to bring it back...sounded quite like the real deal\\". But in 2014, a renewed version of the Mu-Tron III, now called the Tru-Tron 3X, was made by Beigel's new company Mu-FX. =Tru- Tron 3X= The Tru-Tron can work \\"exactly like the original\\", but has added functionality and range, and is \\"smaller and more robust\\" than the original. It runs on 12 volts. In addition to the original's ability to control the upsweep of notes it adds control over the downsweep, and offers more gain for more intense effects. It also has an internal potentiometer which allows the user to adjust the envelope filter's response time to match the player's style.

Parts of the former lake are now Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Georgian Bay and Lake Michigan. It formed about 7,500 years before present (YBP). The lake occupied the depression left by the Labradorian Glacier.University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, Dept of Geology This body of water drained eastward from Georgian Bay to the Ottawa valley. This was a period of isostatic rebound raising the outlet over time, until it opened the outlet through the St. Clair valley.Publication 9. Geological Series 7; Surface Geology and Agricultural Conditions of the Southern Peninsula of Michigan; Frank Leverett with a Chapter on Climate by C. F. Schneider;Michigan Geological and Biological Survey Lansing Michigan; 1911 Origin The Lake formed from the aggregation of Glacial Lakes Houghton, Chippewa and Hough, and Stanley as water levels increased. Levels returned and Lake Chippewa again flowed through the canyon at Mackinac until around 7,500 YBP. At that time, the waters in the Michigan basin, Huron basin, and the Superior basin created a single lake encompassing all three of the upper Great Lakes. The lowlands through the rapids of Sault Ste. Marie and across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were open bodies of water. Location and area The term \\"Nipissing Great Lakes\\" is applied to the waters of the upper three Great Lakes during the stage. The glacier had receded completely from the Great Lakes Basin. The plural form is used to denote that each basin was a separate unit, with a narrow strait connecting each. Each basin stood at the same elevation and thus appear as a single body of water. Lake Michigan connected to Lake Huron by the Mackinac strait, except the water was higher. There was also a narrower, shallower channel Little Traverse Bay to Huron basin. The outlet of the lakes, however, was eastward from the northeast angle of Georgian Bay.The Pleistocene of Indiana and Michigan, History of the Great Lakes; Chapter XXII, The Nipissing Great Lakes, Frank B. Taylor; Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Vol LIII; Frank Leverett and Frank B. Taylor; Washington, D.C,; Government Printing Office; 1915 Outlets The North Bay Outlet was at North Bay, Ontario, the modern Lake Nipissing. As the ground continued to rebound from the weight of glacier, the Port Huron outlet began to again receive water, creating a temporary two-outlet lake. =1st Ottawa & Mattawa RiverSummary of Surface Geology of Michigan: Fred C. Lane; Geological Survey of the State of Michigan, 1908, pg 136= The North Bay outlet river, ( above sea level) or \\" Nipissing-Mattawa River,\\" Taylor, F.

Geologist, Vol. 20, 1897, pp. 65-66 crossed an area of crystalline rock, chiefly gneiss, reaching the Mattawa River, which joined the Ottawa River at Mattawa, which lead out the St. Lawrence to the ocean. Mattawa River is a chain of lakes. Some of the lakes are long, narrow, and deep, lying in canyon- like valleys to wide, with water to deep. The canyons are or more high. Detailed information on the Mattawa River and its lakes is in the report of R. W. Ells and A. E. Barlow A few places along this route show a scoured bed that would require a similar volume and velocity of water movement as St. Clair River today. =2nd Detroit & Port Huron= In the early part of this closing two-outlet stage a small discharge went by way of Illinois River at Chicago. The basin there is only and the Nipissing beach is above the modern lake. The small discharge would have ended when the outlet at Port Huron had cut down or . Beaches The low water beaches were submerged through most of their range as the land rebounded. Thus, the known beaches of the Nipissing Great Lake are those formed during the period that the St. Clair valley served as the outlet. Only a few of the older beaches survive. Lake Nipissing, like Lake Algonquin, is reflected in the character of the channel in the Niagara Gorge. A part of the gorge at the whirlpool and a small section above and below it shows a shallow excavation both sides. This shallow excavation was made by a weak waterfall when the Erie basin was the main watershed feeding falls. Near the suspension bridges a deep excavation begins which extends up to the present cataract. This seems to have been created since the flow from Lake Nipissing turned into the St. Clair outlet, feeding water to Lake Erie. The rate of recession the falls would require between 2,700 and 3,500 years to make the deep part of the gorge. Since the opening of the St. Clair outlet there has been continuous flow in the present direction, and the outlet has suffered a slight deepening which has lowered the lake level perhaps . The beach at in the southern end of the Huron basin seems to have been occupied by Lake Nipissing as well as by the late stage of Lake Algonquin, so the lowering of the lake is from that height to the present. The present beach is to with a mean stage of water about . =Nipissing Beach= The name \\"Nipissing beach\\" has from the first been applied to the shoreline formed during the two-outlet stage of the lakes. The name more precisely belongs to the older beach made by the Nipissing Great Lakes when the whole discharge passed through the Ottawa River. After the formation of the true Nipissing beach isostatic rebound elevated the region. This lowered the water plane on the north side of the basin and raised it on the south side. Thus the beach from the earlier stage of the Nipissing Great Lakes in the south was flooded and destroyed. Only the area in the northeast corner of Lake Superior still retains remnants of this first or original Nipissing beach. The point of elevation or the ‘hinge line’ for Nipissing beach is the same as the highest Algonquin beach. South of the line the Nipissing beaches are horizontal and vary between above the present lake level, the mean being . In the south, the Algonquin beach and the Nipissing beach can be indistinguishable. Both are from below the Algonquin high beach. Where the Algonquin divides into several ridges, the Nipissing beach will be one these ridges. In the Superior basin where any considerable width of beach deposits intervenes between the Nipissing and the present shore it is likely to be occupied by rather light beach ridges set very close together, with the Nipissing beach as the uppermost. Where the Algonquin is represented by several ridges, the Algonquin beaches are heavier and less sandy (i.e., pebbly or gravelly) than the Nipissing. Along the east side of the Michigan ‘thumb’ the Nipissing beach has been cut away by the present lake. This is most noticeable along the east side of the \\"thumb\\" north of Port Huron, and on both sides of Lake Michigan, and on the east side of Lake Huron. =Beach remnants= A shallow bay between Port Huron and Lakeport has a faint Algonquin beach at its back and a stronger one a mile (2 km) farther west. Outside of these the Nipissing and lower beaches complete the filling of the old bay and bring the shore to a straight line. From Bay City northward to Saginaw, where the hinge line of the Algonquin and Nipissing beaches crosses the west shore of Saginaw Bay, the Nipissing beaches are sandy ridges from the lakeshore. A mile or two north of Alabaster the cliff back of the beach is high and the bench a quarter of a mile (half kilometer) wide. The beach is a wave-cut bench that carries ridges to the mouth of Tawas River. Through Tawas and East Tawas and beyond to Au Sable River it is a low, broad ridge of sand and gravel a half a mile to a mile wide. From East Tawas it lies generally about a mile (1.5 km) back from the shore. Altitude In the Michigan and Huron basins the deformed portion of the Nipissing beach appears, as already stated to hinge on the same line as the Algonquin. South of the hinge line in both basins the Nipissing beach has an altitude of to , the average being about . The altitude of Lake Huron is taken as . Correlatives =Lake St. Clair= During the time of the Nipissing Great Lakes Lake St. Clair was at low stage; in fact, it was almost if not wholly abandoned as a lake. Only a sluggish, relatively small stream with locally expanded ponds or swampy parts remained. =Lake Erie= Lake Erie was at low stage during the time of the Nipissing Great Lakes. Without the inflow from the upper lake basin, both Lake Erie and Niagara Falls would lack the volume of water needed to cut the channel through the Niagara limestone cap rock. Lake Erie was a nonglacial lake in this period. The third stage of nonglacial development ended the Lake Algonquin. A fourth stage was initiated when the upper lakes entered the Nipissing Great Lakes stage and that volume of water was diverted through the outlet at North Bay, Ontario. At this low stage, Lake Erie was to lower than present lake level and which lasted throughout the time of the Nipissing Great Lakes. =Champlain Sea= The Lake Algonquin period of lake development included drainage through the Algonquin River to Trenton, Lake Iroquois, Lake Frontenac, and Gilbert Gulf, which disappeared before the beginning of the Nipissing Great Lakes. It is not certain but that the Champlain Sea had nearly disappeared and all the uplift, except perhaps about , had been accomplished. A heavily developed shore line, called the Micmac beach, extends for below Quebec along the south side of the lower St. Lawrence. It is strong and continuous between Quebec and Ste. Anne de Beaupre. It is above the level of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and is horizontal. Wave action at this level was evidently powerful and prolonged, for the sea cliff is in places high, cut in shale, and the wave-cut bench is unusually wide. Goldthwait, J.

Milder forms of the condition, in which the cervix is present but deformed and nonfunctional, are known as cervical atresia or cervical dysgenesis. Presentation Patients with cervical agenesis typically present in early adolescence, around the time of menarche, with amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain caused by the obstruction of menstrual flow from the uterus. =Complications= If untreated, the accumulation of menstrual fluid in the uterus caused by cervical agenesis can lead to hematocolpos, hematosalpinx, endometriosis, endometrioma and pelvic adhesions. Pathophysiology Cervical agenesis arises during fetal development, during which time the paramesonephric duct fails to canalize in formation of the cervix. Diagnosis The diagnosis of cervical agenesis can be made by magnetic resonance imaging, which is used to determine the presence or absence of a cervix. Although MRI can detect the absence of a cervix (agenesis), it is unable to show cervical dysgenesis (where the cervix is present, but malformed). Ultrasound is a less reliable imaging study, but it is often the first choice by gynecologists to establish a diagnosis and can identify a hematometra secondary to cervical agenesis. Management The first line of therapy after diagnosis typically involves the administration of the combined oral contraceptive pill, medroxyprogesterone acetate or a gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonist to suppress menstruation and thereby relieve pain. Surgically, cervical agenesis has historically been treated through hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) to relieve symptoms caused by hematocolpos (the accumulation of menstrual fluid in the vagina). Other surgical methods of management involve the creation of an anastomotic connection between the uterus and vagina by neovaginoplasty or recanalization of the cervix. Outcomes in these cases are generally poor, since the natural functions of the cervix—such as mucus production and providing a barrier against ascending infection—cannot be replicated. Furthermore, the success rate of uterovaginal anastomosis is less than 50% and most patients require multiple surgeries while many develop cervical stenotis. Despite this, several pregnancies have been reported in women with cervical agenesis who underwent surgical treatment. Epidemiology Cervical agenesis is estimated to occur in 1 in 80,000 females. It is often associated with deformity of the vagina; one study found that 48% of patients with cervical agenesis had a normal, functional vagina, while the rest of the cases were accompanied by vaginal hypoplasia.

After a short career as an army officer, he sat in the House of Commons for two periods, separated by 26 years, and opposed parliamentary reform on both occasions. A duellist and philanderer who outlived his two wives, Thynne gambled away his own wealth and that of his first wife. In 1881, the aged Thynne was described by Vanity Fair magazine as a \\"hoary old reprobate\\".  Early life  Thynne was the 8th child of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath and Isabella Byng, daughter of the 4th Viscount Torrington. He was educated at Charterhouse and then matriculated in 1825 to Oriel College, Oxford. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in March 1828, he was commissioned in April 1828 as a second lieutenant in the Duke of York's rifle corps. He retired from the British Army in June 1830 when he married Elizabeth Mellish, the heir to William Mellish a wealthy naval contractor. The novelist Emily Eden described him in a letter at that time as \\"totally unlike all the Thynnes I ever saw—full of fun and dashes out everything that comes into his head\\".  Career  At the 1831 general election his father bought him a seat as Member of Parliament (MP) for the rotten borough of Weobley, alongside his brother Lord Henry Frederick Thynne. The borough was disenfranchised under the Reform Act 1832, which he and his brother had repeatedly voted against. Despite having been given £20,000 by his father when he married in 1830 (), by 1832 Thynne's marriage and finances were in deep trouble. His wife was estranged from him, and he was repeatedly sued by his creditor Thomas Slingsby Duncombe; in response he canvassed against Dubscombe at the Finsbury by-election in 1834, and at the following year's general election. In 1837, he fought a duel on Battersea Fields with a Mr. Passmore, over \\"a young lady\\". Each fired three shots without effect. In 1835 his father gave him a further £60,000 to clear his debts (). However, after his father's death in 1837, his family cut him off, and by August of that year he was imprisoned for debt in the Queen's Bench Prison in Southwark. Thynne and Dunscombe resolved their quarrel in November, triggering Thynne's release from prison and allowing him to avoid bankruptcy. When Thynne was discharged from insolvency at the end of that month, the court was told that his debts were £221,059 (equivalent to £ in ), which The Spectator described as an \\"enormous sum\\". After the death of Elizabeth's father, when his estate was reported at nearly £3 million (equivalent to £ in ), she unsuccessfully sued her family for more of her father's wealth (having been given £100,000 on her marriage, ). Her estate was worth only £3,000 when she died in 1849. Thynne married again in 1853, to Cecilia Gore, daughter of the novelist Catherine Gore. As a girl, Cecilia had been famous for her wasp waist. The historian Macaulay described the union in his memoirs as \\"the noosing of a young – or rather a defiant young flirt to an old roué\\". Thynne was a skilled marksman who in 1851 shot a golden eagle with a rifle at a hundred yards range, while deer stalking in Scotland as a guest of the Earl of Malmesbury. The killing of the bird was reported to be the only instance of a flying eagle being killed with a single ball. He resumed his military career in 1855, when he was appointed as a cornet in the Wiltshire Yeomanry Cavalry. In 1863, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 18th Somerset Volunteer Rifle Corps = Return to Parliament = In July 1856, the Liberal MP Viscount Dungarvan succeeded to the peerage, triggering a by-election in July for his Commons seat in the borough of Frome in Somerset. Thynne was one of three candidates nominated, and a poll was demanded, but Thynne later withdrew. The seat was won by the Liberal William George Boyle, a relative of Dungarvan's.Craig records the 1856 poll as having been Boyle and Thynne. However, The Times and The Spectator both report that Thynne withdrew, and the poll was between Boyle and Nicoll The following year, at the 1857 general election, Thynne was nominated again, and this time did not withdraw. However, he polled poorly, coming third behind two Liberal candidates. Boyle lost the seat to fellow Liberal Donald Nicoll. At the 1859 general election Thynne was returned to the House of Commons after a 26-year absence. Standing as an \\"anti-ballot conservative\\", he had defeated the sitting Nicoll by 194 votes to 147. A petition was lodged against the result, but subsequently withdrawn amidst a dispute about allegations that Nicoll had made improper use of Disraeli's name, a charge which Nicoll strenuously denied. Thynne did not contest the 1865 election, when Sir Henry Rawlinson regained the seat for the Liberals. Some time in 1872, Thynne called at the London home of the 5th Marquess Townshend, and eloped to France with his wife Clementina (née Duff). Clementina, who was 16 years Townshend's junior and 40 years younger than Thynne, had been neglected by her philanthropist husband, and was described as \\"more than willing\\" to escape. Her husband had to wait 9 years for his revenge. At the Salisbury Petty Sessions in May 1881, Thynne described how he had been accosted by Lord Townshend and two accomplices on the road between Laverstock and Salisbury. A Colonel Nepean held the pony's head while Townshend struck him several times with the handle of a horse whip. Thynne acknowledged having eloped with Lady Townshend in 1872, but noted that the Marquis had never sued for divorce, and alleged that Lord Macduff had attacked him over the same matter while he was abroad. Townshend was convicted of the assault, and sentenced to a fine of £500 or three months in prison. After some hours in jail, he reluctantly paid the fine, equivalent to £ in . Townshend denounced the court, while Vanity Fair reported unnamed others as saying \\"the only regret is that he [Thynne] was not thrashed earlier and worse\\". In January 1884, Thynne fell ill with rheumatic gout. He died on 4 February 1884, at his home Laverstock, near Salisbury. Mary had died in 1879, and they were both survived by one daughter.

It was the oldest independent bookstore in Manhattan owned by its original owners. The shop, run by proprietors Bob Contant and Terry McCoy, specialized in cultural and critical theory, graphic design, poetry, small presses, and film studies—what the New York Times called \\"neighborhood-appropriate literature\\". It featured periodicals and journals, including foreign titles, and included sections on anarchists, art criticism, women's studies, music, drama, and drugs. The store, named after St. Mark's Place, its original location, closed on February 28, 2016 due to rising rent and mismanagement. Description The Third Avenue location featured small press poetry books, among others, in the front and had a table with expensive art books and an information desk in the back. There was also an \\"X case,\\" a section of selections next to the information desk where the books that were stolen the most were kept, works by Charles Bukowski and William Burroughs, and, at one point, a consignment section. History Its first location was at 12 St. Marks Place. This space had a mezzanine level that ran along the shop's right side. The owners were wooed away from this location to below a Cooper Union dormitory on Third Avenue and Stuyvesant Street by the then-vice president of Cooper Union for lower rent. (The point of the lure was the development of the Green Building on the east side of Third Avenue between Sixth and Seventh Streets.) It made a great deal of money in the '90s and Aughts, especially on weekends. Former employee, Margarita Shalina, wrote in 2016, that at this time, \\"it was flush with money.\\" Some of this was due to the popularity of its expensive art books. Jacques Derrida was known to have visited, as well as Daniel Craig and a drunk Susan Sontag. Other visitors included Madonna and Philip Glass,https://nypost.com/2016/01/24/mystery-donor- breathes-new-life-into-citys-oldest-bookstore/ and when the store started to accommodate speakers, Slavoj Zizek and Michael Moore. =Financial problems= At one point, the store manager retired and his replacement focused on book returns and reordering titles from wholesalers. Shalina describes \\"books were cycling through the store without being given a chance to sell, sometimes at as little as four weeks. The scale on which we were doing this was ridiculous and no one seemed to take freight into consideration.\\" She also described how ordering became \\"for the most part, unregulated and unbudgeted.\\" Records were not kept, and \\"the manager would habitually delete the sales history of books.\\" In 2011, St. Mark's Bookshop's financial problems became evident, exacerbated by the high rent. An online petition, started by a patron of the establishment, asking that the store's landlord, Cooper Union, reduce the rent, garnered over 40,000 signatures. In August 2012, over $24,000 was raised in an online funding drive. Cooper Union, in the meantime, had been beset by financial woes of its own: Historically tuition-free, the administrators started charging tuition in the fall of 2014 to try to make up for lost endowment income. In May 2014, the store announced plans to move from 31 Third Avenue to a smaller space at 126 E. Third St; their new landlord was the New York City Housing Authority.

Other examples include The Strand, Westsider, McNally Jackson, Shakespeare & Co, WORD, Longitude, Bluestockings, and Housing Works and in Brooklyn, powerHouse, BookCourt, and Greenlight Bookstore.

In an attempt to be competitive with electronic media, St. Mark's and OR Books engaged in a joint venture where OR Books sold their electronic media via the St. Mark's website. Even some of the larger chains, such as Borders, have been unable to remain solvent in the face of competitive pressures from web-based stores and e-books.

The Motown Soul Sisters softball team was started in 1965 by a group of women who wanted to play softball in a public space. Women during this time did not have equal access to recreational facilities. The Soul Sisters were the only black team in an all-white league, in a city that was racially segregated. The Soul Sisters played on Jayne Field in the late 1960s and 1970s. As a top ranked team, they drew in a mixed-race crowd of hundreds of people.  Race  Over the Soul Sisters' thirteen-year existence, tryouts were open to all women. At least three Caucasians and two Latinas played on the team. Recreation supervisors told the Soul Sisters that as long as the team was all African American, it would have problems at tournaments. Barbara \\"Bubbles\\" Hardison, a white player, helped the team with her presence as well as her ability. The Soul Sisters often faced discrimination while traveling to other states. In Georgia, they stopped at a truck stop to order some food. When the women went to order, the manager told them that he was out of food and could not serve them anything. Then, a white truck driver came up and ordered and was served. Some umpires would declare their equipment to be illegal and disqualified the team.  Youth  The Soul Sisters organized events for young girls to come to Jayne Field and play softball. The team also organized basketball events for young girls.  Gender  Parents worried about letting their daughters participate because of the fear of lesbianism. Playing softball was not considered ladylike. Females running, hitting or using their bodies in an assertive manner was not accepted by many people.

OSCAR I was launched December 12, 1961, by a Thor- DM21 Agena B launcher from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Lompoc, California. The satellite, a rectangular box (30 x 25 x 12 cm) weighing 10 kg., was launched as a secondary payload (ballast) for Corona 9029, also known as Discoverer 36, the eighth and final launch of a KH-3 satellite. The satellite had a battery- powered 140 mW transmitter operating in the 2-meter band (144.983 MHz), employed a monopole transmitting antenna 60 cm long extended from the center of the convex surface, but had no attitude control system. Like Sputnik 1, Oscar 1 carried only a simple beacon. For three weeks it transmitted its Morse Code message \\"HI\\". To this day, many organizations identify their Morse- transmitting satellites with \\"HI\\", which also indicates laughter in amateur telegraphy. OSCAR I lasted 22 days ceasing operation on January 3, 1962, and re-entered January 31, 1962. The uniqueness of the OSCAR-1 spacecraft was not only that it was built by amateurs, only about four years after the launch of Sputnik-1, but that it was the world's first piggyback satellite and the world's first private non-government spacecraft. Immediately following the launch of OSCAR-1, United States vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, honored it with a congratulatory telegram to the group sponsoring this momentous event in the history of Amateur Radio. It read: “For me this project is symbolic of the type of freedom for which this country stands — freedom of enterprise and freedom of participation on the part of individuals throughout the world.” The original backup of OSCAR-1 has been restored and is fully operational, running off AC power. As of 2011 it is on display at ARRL HQ in Newington, Connecticut and continues to broadcast \\"HI\\" in Morse Code at 145 MHz.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSf7HK0V5S4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7iAcl2U4uY Project OSCAR Project OSCAR Inc. started in 1960 with the radio amateurs from the TRW Radio Club of Redondo Beach, California, many who worked at TRW, California defense industries, and Foothill College to investigate the possibility of putting an amateur satellite in orbit. Mr. Projoscar of Foothill College served as the Project Manager for Project OSCAR. Project OSCAR was responsible for the construction of the first Amateur Radio Satellite OSCAR-1, that was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB in California. OSCAR-1 orbited the earth for 22 days, transmitting the “HI” greeting. Project Oscar was responsible for launching the next 3 amateur radio satellites during the 1960s: OSCAR 2, OSCAR 3, and OSCAR 4. Since that beginning, the group has focused on supporting and promoting amateur radio satellite related projects. Some current members take part in university satellite programs as advisors. The Project Oscar club has become more active since the start of the AMSAT Eagle project, with a renewed effort to build hardware and educate hams on the advantages of satellite operation. In 1969 The Radio Amateur Satellite Organization (AMSAT) was founded by radio amateurs working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and living in the Baltimore- Washington DC region, to continue the efforts begun by Project OSCAR. Its first project was to coordinate the launch of Australis-OSCAR 5, constructed by students at the University of Melbourne. Today, more than fifty years later, Project OSCAR's mission is “To initiate and support activities that promote the Satellite Amateur Radio Hobby”. Project Oscar's primary goal is to reach out and provide logistical support, training and in some cases equipment to amateur radio associations, schools and the public at large.

He was awarded the Medal of Honor for capturing a Confederate flag during the Battle of Fort Blakely. Following the Civil War, Vifquain was appointed as US consul to Colombia and was inducted into the Order of the Double Dragon for rendering aid to Chinese citizens. Early life Vifquain was born as Jean-Baptiste Victor Devuyst in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium on 20 May 1836; his parents were not married at the time of his birth, and he was legally recognized by his father in 1845.http://www.kaowarsom.be/documents/bbom/Tome_VIII/Vifquain.Jean_Baptiste_Victor.pdf His father, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Vifquain, was an engineer and served under Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars. Vifquain received military training at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, and served in the Belgian Army for a year. In 1857, he moved to the United States and settled in Saline County, Nebraska. Civil War Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Vifquain joined the Fifty-third New York Infantry so he would not have to wait for a Nebraska unit to be created. The infantry unit was disbanded before it could become involved in the fighting. Following the disbandment, Vifquain and three colleagues snuck into Richmond in an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In 1862, the governor of Illinois appointed Vifquain to be the Ninety-seventh Illinois's adjutant. Battle of Fort Blakely Vifquain commanded the Ninety-Seventh Illinois during the Battle of Fort Blakely. On April 9, he advanced towards and jumped onto the parapet of the Confederate fort. Surviving a barrage of Confederate gun fire without serious injury, Vifquain ordered a general charge of the fort by his unit. During the ensuing fighting, Vifquain used his sword to sever the halliard holding up the fort's Confederate flag while the flag-bearer of the Ninety-Seventh Illinois planted the Union flag in its place. The flag-bearer was killed by Confederate gun fire immediately after placing the flag. Vifquain was concealed by the falling Confederate flag during the attack, so he was not targeted. Vifquain survived the battle and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Later life Near the end of the Civil War, Vifquain yet again attempted to capture Davis. He successfully captured a train believed to be carrying Davis near Selma, Alabama. Davis was not actually a passenger, but Vifquain was able to secure three-thousand heads of cattle and two-thousand horses from the train. Vifquain ultimately achieved a rank of brevet brigadier general by the time he was mustered out of service in October 1865. After the end of the Civil War, Vifquain ran for a seat in Congress, but did not win the election. He also attended the Nebraska Constitutional Convention. Vifquain founded the Daily State Democrat in 1879 and was appointed US consul to Columbia by President Grover Cleveland in 1886. He would later serve as the leader of multiple diplomatic posts in Panama. During his time in Panama, Vifquain aided multiple Chinese citizens at the United States consul. As a result of his actions, the Emperor of China inducted Vifquain into the Order of the Double Dragon. In 1891, he was selected to be the adjutant general of his home state of Nebraska. Vifquain returned to active military service during the Spanish–American War. He served as commander of the 3rd Nebraska Infantry Regiment following the resignation of Colonel William Jennings Bryan. His regiment remained in Cuba at the end of the war to aid in the occupation of the island. Vifquain died in 1904 at his house in Lincoln, Nebraska. He wrote a memoir near the end of his life, which was published nearly a century after his death.

Background  Greenbaum studied privately with Stefan Wolpe, and with Mario Davidovsky at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He holds a Ph.D. in Composition from the City University of NY Graduate Center (1985), and has served as a professor of music composition at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance since 1998. Since 1999 Greenbaum has worked with computer animation to create hybrid works of visual music, as well as chamber music with a video component. Greenbaum has also written on Debussy, Schoenberg and Varèse in relation to Wolpe's dialectical and \\"cubist\\" approach to musical structure. He is the curator of Amphibian, a new music and video series in the Hiart Gallery in New York.  Music  Greenbaum's work shares elements not only with Wolpe but Webern (strict forms such as canon) and late Stravinsky (a highly idiomatic, concise, sectional approach to a piece's structure, along with a brilliant, shimmering, and transparent sound). Greenbaum inherited from Wolpe the idea of the limited pitch field, as well as his technique of \\"cubist polyphony\\" (Greenbaum's term). It describes a process where motivic units are fractured into their component parts and projected into musical space, so that the same event becomes perceivable from different soundpoints. Greenbaum's work is thus linked to the Austro-German musical tradition through Wolpe, who himself was a student of Anton Webern.

Taro plants can be seen growing in the background below the banana leaves Native Hawaiian cuisine is based on the traditional Hawaiian foods that predate contact with Europeans and immigration from East and Southeast Asia. The earliest Polynesian seafarers are believed to have arrived on the Hawaiian Islands in 300–500 AD. Few edible plants were indigenous to Hawaiʻi aside from a few ferns and fruits that grew at higher elevations. Various food-producing plants were introduced to the island by migrating Polynesian peoples. Botanists and archaeologists believe that these voyagers introduced anywhere from 27 to more than 30 plants to the islands, mainly for food.. The most important of them was taro.. For centuries, taro—and the poi made from it—was the main staple of the Hawaiian diet, and it is still much loved. ʻUala (sweet potatoes) and yams were also planted. The Marquesans, the first settlers from Polynesia, brought ʻulu (breadfruit) and the Tahitians later introduced the baking banana. Settlers from Polynesia also brought coconuts and sugarcane. ʻAwa (Piper methysticum, kava) is also a traditional food among Hawaiians. Breadfruit, sweet potato, kava, and heʻe (octopus) are associated with the four major Hawaiian gods: Kāne, Kū, Lono and Kanaloa.Native Food, Native Stories January 24, 2012 Oiwi TV Fish, shellfish, and limu are abundant in Hawai’i. Flightless birds were easy to catch and eggs from nests were also eaten. Most Pacific islands had no meat animals except bats and lizards. Ancient Polynesians sailed the Pacific with pigs, chickens, and Polynesian dogs, and introduced them to the islands.. Pigs were raised for religious sacrifice, and the meat was offered at altars, some of which was consumed by priests and the rest eaten in a mass celebration. The early Hawaiian diet was diverse, and may have included as many as 130 different types of seafood and 230 types of sweet potatoes.. Some species of land and sea birds were consumed into extinction.. Sea salt was a common condiment in ancient Hawaiʻi. Inamona is a traditional relish or condiment often accompanied meals and is made of roasted and mashed kukui nutmeats, and sea salt. It sometimes mixed with edible seaweed.

The offerings are several hundred bowls of poi Early Polynesian settlers brought along with them clothing, plants and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. Upon their arrival, the settlers grew kalo (taro), maia (banana), niu (coconut), and ulu (breadfruit). Meats were eaten less often than fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Some did import and raise puaʻa (pork), moa (chicken), and ʻīlio (poi dog). Popular condiments included paʻakai (salt), ground kukui nut, limu (seaweed), and ko (sugarcane) which was used as both a sweet and a medicine.Adams, 2006, pp. 90–92 The non-native species may have caused various birds, plants and land snails to go extinct.Burney, Back to the Future in the Caves of Kaua'i. pp. 83 Estuaries were adapted to fishing ponds (aquaculture). Irrigation work was also used to farm taro.Kirch, Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia. pp. 130-131 Men did all of the cooking, and food for women was cooked in a separate imu; afterwards men and women ate meals separately per the ancient kapu (taboo) of separating the genders for meals. This kapu was abolished in 1819 at the death of Kamehameha I by his wife Ka'ahumanu. The ancient practice of cooking with the imu continues for special occasions and is popular with tourists. Hāpuu ii, Hawaiian tree fern (Cibotium menziesii) is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and the uncoiled fronds (fiddles) are eaten boiled. The starchy core of the ferns was considered a famine food or used as pig feed. It was prepared by peeling the young fronds or placing the entire trunk with the starchy center in an ʻimu or volcanic steam vents. A saying was \\"He hāpuu ka ai he ai make\\" (If the hāpuu is the food, it is the food of death). Thespesia populnea wood was used to make food bowls. Cyanea angustifolia was eaten in times of food scarcity. It and the now endangered Cyanea platyphylla are known in Hawaiian as haha. There is no fighting when eating from a bowl of poi. It is shared and is connected to the concept because Hāloa (Taro), the first-born son of the parents who begat the human race. Hawaiians identify strongly with kalo/taro, so much so that the Hawaiian term for family, ohana, is derived from the word ohā, the shoot or sucker which grows from the kalo corm.

Dickson was a pioneering photographer on the islands who captured some of the earliest images of Hawaiian people File:Hawaiian men pounding poi, c. 1890.jpgMen pounding poi in 1890 Festivals and special occasions On important occasions, a traditional ʻahaʻaina feast was held. When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ʻahaʻaina mawaewae feast that was celebrated for the birth of a child. Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweed, and taro leaves were required for the feast.. The modern name for such feasts, lūʻau, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ʻahaʻaina and pāʻina.. The name lūʻau came from the name of a food always served at a ʻahaʻaina, young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus. Pigs and dogs were killed by strangulation or by holding their nostrils shut in order to conserve the animal's blood.. Meat was prepared by flattening out the whole eviscerated animal and broiling it over hot coals, or it was spitted on sticks. Large pieces of meat, such as fowl, pigs and dogs, would be typically cooked in earth ovens, or spitted over a fire during ceremonial feasts.. Hawaiian earth ovens, known as an imu, combine roasting and steaming in a method called kālua. A pit is dug into earth and lined with volcanic rocks and other rocks that do not split when heated to a high temperature, such as granite.. A fire is built with embers, and when the rocks are glowing hot, the embers are removed and the foods wrapped in ti, ginger or banana leaves are put into the pit, covered with wet leaves, mats and a layer of earth. Water may be added through a bamboo tube to create steam. The intense heat from the hot rocks cooked food thoroughly — the quantity of food for several days could be cooked at once, taken out and eaten as needed, and the cover replaced to keep the remainder warm.. Sweet potatoes, taro, breadfruit and other vegetables were cooked in the imu, as well as fish. Saltwater eel was salted and dried before being put into the imu.. Chickens, pigs and dogs were put into the imu with hot rocks inserted in the abdominal cavities. Procession offering gifts to Lono during the hoʻokupu protocol presentation of a Makahiki festival Paʻina is the Hawaiian word for a meal and can also be used to refer to a party or feast. One tradition that includes paʻina is the four-month-long Makahiki ancient Hawaiian New Year festival in honor of the god Lono (referred to as the sweet potato god) of the Hawaiian religion. Makahiki includes a first phase of spiritual cleansing and making hookupu offerings to the gods. The Konohiki, a class of royalty that at this time of year provided the service of tax collector, collected agricultural and aquacultural products such as pigs, taro, sweet potatoes, dry fish, kapa and mats. Some offerings were in the form of forest products such as feathers. The Hawaiian people had no money or other similar medium of exchange. The goods were offered on the altars of Lono at heiau - temples - in each district around the island. Offerings also were made at the ahu, stone altars set up at the boundary lines of each community. All war was outlawed to allow unimpeded passage of the image of Lono. The festival proceeded in a clockwise circle around the island as the image of Lono (Akua Loa, a long pole with a strip of tapa and other embellishments attached) was carried by the priests. At each ahupuaa (each community also is called an ahupuaa) the caretakers of that community presented hookupu to the Lono image, a fertility god who caused things to grow and who gave plenty and prosperity to the islands. The second phase of celebration includes: hula dancing, of sports (boxing, wrestling, Hawaiian lava sledding, javelin marksmanship, bowling, surfing, canoe races, relays, and swimming), of singing and of feasting. In the third phase, the waa auhau — tax canoe — was loaded with hookupu and taken out to sea where it was set adrift as a gift to Lono. At the end of the Makahiki festival, the chief would go off shore in a canoe. When he came back in he stepped on shore and a group of warriors threw spears at him. He had to deflect or parry the spears to prove his worthiness to continue to rule. Legacy of traditional Hawaiian cuisine Native Hawaiian dishes have evolved and been integrated into contemporary fusion cuisine.Native America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia , Volume 1 edited by Daniel S. Murphree page 271 Apart from lūau for tourists, native Hawaiian cuisine is less common than other ethnic cuisine in parts of Hawaii, but restaurants such as Helena's Hawaiian Food and Ono Hawaiian Foods specialize in traditional Hawaiian food.

The genus contains a single species known from multiple individuals: Patagotitan mayorum, first announced in 2014 and then validly named in 2017 by José Carballido, Diego Pol and colleagues. Contemporary studies estimated the length of the type specimen, a young adult, at Giant dinosaur slims down a bit. BBC News Science & Environment with an approximate weight of , although subsequent mass estimates indicate a mass of .  Discovery  Femur Remains of Patagotitan mayorum, a part of a lower thighbone, were initially discovered in 2008 by a farm laborer, Aurelio Hernández, in the desert near La Flecha, about west of Trelew. Excavation was done by palaeontologists from the Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio. The lead scientists on the excavation were Jose Luis Carballido and Diego Pol, with partial funding from The Jurassic Foundation. Between January 2013 and February 2015, seven paleontological field expeditions were carried out to the La Flecha fossil site, recovering more than 200 fossils, both of sauropods and theropods (represented by 57 teeth). At least six partial skeletons, consisting of approximately 130 bones, were uncovered, making Patagotitan one of the most complete titanosaurs currently known. The type species Patagotitan mayorum was named and described by José Luis Carballido, Diego Pol, Alejandro Otero, Ignacio Alejandro Cerda, Leonardo Salgado, Alberto Carlos Garrido, Jahandar Ramezani, Néstor Ruben Cúneo and Javier Marcelo Krause in 2017. The generic name combines a reference to Patagonia with a Greek Titan for the \\"strength and large size\\" of this titanosaur. The specific name honours the Mayo family, owners of La Flecha ranch. Vertebra The holotype, MPEF-PV 3400, was found in a layer of the Cerro Barcino Formation, dating from the latest Albian. The particular stratum has an age of 101.62 plus or minus 0.18 million years ago. The holotype consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains three neck vertebrae, six back vertebrae, six front tail vertebrae, three chevrons, ribs, both breast bones, the right scapulocoracoid of the shoulder girdle, both pubic bones and both thighbones. The skeleton was chosen to be the holotype because it was the best preserved and also the one showing the most distinguishing traits. Other specimens were designated as the paratypes. Specimen MPEF-PV 3399 is a second skeleton including six neck vertebrae, four back vertebrae, one front tail vertebra, sixteen rear tail vertebrae, ribs, chevrons, the left lower arm, both ischia, the left pubic bone and the left thighbone. Specimen MPEF-PV 3372 is a tooth. Specimen MPEF-PV 3393 is a rear tail vertebra. Specimen MPEF-PV 3395 is a left humerus as is specimen MPEF-PV 3396, while specimen MPEF-PV 3397 is a right humerus. Specimen MPEF-PV 3375 is a left thighbone while MPEF- PV 3394 is a right one. Specimens MPEF-PV 3391 and MPEF-PV3392 represent two calfbones. The animals found, though excavated in one quarry, did not all die at the same time. Within the 343 centimetre thick sediment containing the fossils, three distinct but closely spaced horizons correspond to three burial events in which young adults perished due to floods. The water did not transport the carcasses any further but covered them with sandstone and mudstone. The animals were about the same size, differing no more than 5% in length. As far as can be ascertained, all bones discovered belong to the same species and are thus part of a monospecific assemblage.  Description and size  P. mayorum compared to a human. Like other titanosaur sauropods, Patagotitan was a quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck and tail and is notable for its large size. In 2014 news reports stated size estimates of long with a weight of ; science writer Riley Black had cautioned in 2014 that it was still too early to make size estimates with the desirable scientific certainty. In 2017 the species description of Patagotitan mayorum was published which estimated a length of long, with an approximate weight of when using a scaling equation, and when using volumetric method based on 3D skeletal models. In 2019 Gregory S. Paul listed Patagotitan at in length and in weight using volumetric models, making it smaller than Argentinosaurus which was estimated at or more in length and in weight. A mass estimate using a revised scaling equation yielded a mean estimate of , with a range including margin of error of , which is close to the estimate of previously obtained from the volumetric method. Patagotitan's humerus was long, smaller from that of other giants such as Notocolossus (1.76 meters) and Paralititan (1.69 meters). It's femur measured in length making it the longest known, although Paul estimated the total size of the isolated femur (MLP-DP 46-VIII-21-3 specimen) ,which is referred to Argentinosaurus, at making it larger than Patagotitan's. He also noticed that the articulated dorsal series length was larger in Argentinosaurus (4.47 meters) than in Patagotitan (3.67 meters). The researchers who described Patagotitan stated in the media: Front limb and shoulder blade at Museo Egidio Feruglio de Trelew, Chubut Following the publication of Patagotitan, Riley Black and paleontologist Matt Wedel further cautioned against the media hype. In blog posts, Wedel noted that based on available measurements Patagotitan was comparable in size to other known giant titanosaurs, however, almost every bone measurement that could be compared are larger in Argentinosaurus. Wedel also criticised the researchers mass estimation technique. In other studies Argentinosaurus has been estimated at . = Distinguishing traits = The authors indicated nine distinguishing traits of Patagotitan. The first three back vertebra have a lamina prezygodiapophysealis, a ridge running between the front articular process and the side process, that is vertical because the front articular process is situated considerably higher than the side process. With the first two back vertebrae, the ridge running to below from the side front of the neural spine has a bulge at the underside. Secondary articulating processes of the hyposphene-hypantrum complex type are limited to the articulation between the third and fourth back vertebra. The middle and rear back vertebrae have vertical neural spines. In the first tail vertebra, the centrum or main vertebral body has a flat articulation facet in front and a convex facet at the rear. The front tail vertebrae have neural spines of which the transverse width is four to six times larger than their length measured from the front to the rear. The front tail vertebrae have neural spines that show some bifurcation. The upper arm bone has a distinct bulge on the rear outer side. The lower thighbone has a straight edge on the outer side.  Classification  Chevrons and other bones Reconstructed skeleton on display at the American Museum of Natural History, New York In 2017, Patagotitan was placed, within the Titanosauria, in the Eutitanosauria and more precisely the Lognkosauria, as a sister species of Argentinosaurus. Several subclades of the Titanosauria would have independently acquired a large body mass. One such event would have taken place at the base of the Notocolossus + Lognkosauria clade leading to a tripling of weight from maximal twenty to maximal sixty tonnes.  Paleoecology  Life restoration of two Patagotitan at dawn Patagotitan lived during the Late Cretaceous period, between 102 and 95 million years ago, in what was then a forested region. The bearing sediments indicate that sedimentation took place with a low energy setting, related to floodplains of a meandering system (Carmona et al., 2016).

It was the 22nd edition of the show since its start in 1989, and the first ceremony since 2010, after which it went on a four-year hiatus. , it has continued another unexplained hiatus of five years. Awards At the ceremony, Mariah Carey received the Pop Icon Award for having sold over 200 million records and having more No.1 singles in America than any other solo artist. Miley Cyrus received the award for world's Best Pop Rock Female Artist. She also won World's Best Video for \\"Wrecking Ball\\" and World's Best Female Artist voted by the fans. Han Geng received the awards for World's Best Male Artist voted by the fans. Laura Pausini received an award for her 20 years of career. Ricky Martin received the Latin Legend Award for his global record sales. Taylor Swift won four awards. Delays and difficulties The 22nd edition of the World Music Awards had been scheduled to be held December 20, 2012 at Miami's Marlins Park, but was canceled days beforehand due to issues with visa approval for artists coming in for the ceremony and in its own statement, out of respect to victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The show was not held in 2013, and then was to return in mid-May 2014. The organization came to an agreement with the American NBC network to broadcast the ceremony with a tape delay on May 28. Delays due to talent and technical difficulties caused the event to be delayed until May 27, and the shows' executive producers failed to deliver the show to NBC in time for it to be broadcast due to further delays, which included the late arrival of Mariah Carey to the ceremony, all factors which caused the ceremony to run 4 hours over its original taping schedule. Sharon Stone had been slated to host the ceremony, but pulled out at the last minute due to a payment dispute with the WMA organizing body. Likewise, a scheduled livestream of the red carpet via the website of music industry publication Billboard was called off due to further technical issues. Pamela Anderson and Jason Derulo stepped in to host the ceremony at the last minute. NBC never received a final cut of the ceremony from the show's executive producers, and substituted it on May 28 with a time- stretched rerun of the premiere of that season's America's Got Talent.

Then, she married in 1522 to Kara Ahmed Pasha, who was the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire between 1553 and 1555, and they had two daughters. After his execution, she either went to live in Bursa but returned to the Imperial Palace after the death of Suleiman I, or, according to other sources, was forcibly married in 1556 to Hadım İbrahim Pasha, presumably as a punishment for her intrigues.

It was the worst accident on the New York City Subway since the Malbone Street Wreck in 1918. Track maintenance workers had discovered the faulty switch where a storage track branched off south of the platform, but decided not to spike (immobilize) it. The train had been held in the station while repairs were made, and was packed with approximately 1,800 passengers; an empty train was first sent over the switch without incident. Aftermath and investigation Some newspapers ran a photograph taken soon after the accident, which showed a view into the street where emergency vehicles and police were gathering; it had been transmitted over the telephone to the NEA Service in San Francisco.\\"New York Wreck Scene Pictured\\", Bend Bulletin, August 27, 1928, p. 4.

The accident was blamed on human error, but the precise cause was never established. However, it was known that the switch should have been spiked closed. The maintenance foreman on the scene, William Baldwin, said at the time that someone in the signaling tower located in the tunnel south of 40th Street must have pushed the button to open the switch, but the towerman, Harry King, maintained that no one had, leading to the suspicion that Baldwin had activated it from trackside with his assistant holding down the automatic brake tripper.

The village was a base for sawing local timber in the nineteenth century, with a sawmill powered by the water of the river rapids close to the village. The sawmill at Baggböle was abandoned towards the end of the 19th century, but was in its heyday the largest water powered sawmill in Sweden. The operations at the sawmill resulted in a new word in Swedish, baggböleri, a term that originally meant illegal felling of timber in forests belonging to the Crown, but is now a pejorative term for 'reckless deforestation' (Swedish: ). Today Baggböle is known for Arboretum Norr, an arboretum that has been developed to attract visitors, and develop plants suitable for northern latitudes. History The original sawmill at Baggböle Rapids, which was built in 1813-14, stemmed from a partnership between Johan Unander, Eric Nyberg and Johan Vikner, who obtained permission to build a sawmill there. The original business was bought by James Dickson & Co of Gothenburg, Sweden, a company started by Scottish-Swedish brothers James and Robert Dickson, who had built up a successful business in the province of Värmland, further south in Sweden, in the 1830s. After buying the business at Baggböle they had large new water-powered sawmills built at Baggböle, the first in 1842 and the second in 1850, sawmills that were the largest water powered sawmills in Sweden. The Dickson sawmills employed 170 male seasonal workers during the ice-free part of the year, from May to October, each year, from the start of operations until the company moved to a new steam powered sawmill at Holmsund, the seaport at the mouth of the Ume River from where the lumber from the sawmill was exported, in the 1880s.Baggbole , Umea.SE, retrieved 18 May 2014 Dickson also had a manor house built at Baggböle in 1846, as residence for the local manager of the mill. The house was designed by Johan Anders Linder to look as if it was made of stone, in spite of being built entirely of wood. The Baggböle manor and the now demolished gazebos The mills' impressive productivity was partially due to the owners' disregard for the law. During 1842–68, the locals, who delivered logs to the sawmill, felled more trees on land belonging to the Crown than they had permissions for. A reckless cutting of timber that through the press coverage of the resulting court cases became so infamous that a new word in the Swedish language was derived from the name of the village: baggböleri, a derogative term for reckless deforestation. =The court cases= The business methods of the sawmill owned and operated by James Dickson & Co became headline news in Sweden when the manager and director of the company, James Dickson Jr, was taken to court on 15 June 1850, accused of encouraging his suppliers upstream to supply him with logs that did not belong to them. Dickson's defence was that he did not know that a large part of the logs that the sawmill was processing belonged to the Crown. The Crown was, however, said to be well aware of the fact that much of the wealth the sawmill was creating for local residents and land owners, for which the local population was very grateful, came from illegal felling of timber on Crown land. By swearing to his honesty and his lack of knowledge of what had happened Dickson was able to escape a conviction, which was allowed under Swedish law at that time, in cases where all evidence was circumstantial.The Term \\"Baggböleri\\" , SkogsMuseet, retrieved 19 May 2014 James Dickson was fortunate in avoiding a conviction, because even if he personally had been unaware of it his company was guilty of receiving stolen goods, having, every year since 1842, taken in more than the 4,500 logs per annum from Crown forests than had been agreed.Welcome to the Arboretum North!, arboretun-norr.se, retrieved 17 May 2014 A satirical cartoon from 1867 features Oscar Dickson who was a manager at the time The exploitation of Crown timber continued but in 1866-67 the company was again taken to court and this time they were obliged to agree to help prevent the use of Crown timber. This was the time when the company was featured in satirical cartoons and the term baggböleri was first seen in print. The rights to fell a certain quantity of timber on Crown land had been given to the farmers and the local villages, which in theory put them in a position of power, but since the only way for the farmers and villages to move logs at that time was by log driving, i.e. letting the current of the river move the logs downstream, the only viable purchaser was the sawmill at Baggböle; which since the sawmill set the price made it possible for the mill to exploit its suppliers. An exploitation that was also included in the meaning of the term baggböleri. The sawmill was able to use its power to set the terms of logging contracts with local villages, contracts that through the nature of them, giving Baggböle sawmill exclusive rights to all timber felled on all forest land belonging to the villages for a period of 50 years, resulted in no one feeling responsible for, or being interested in, replanting clear-cut areas. Which caused deforestation, so in the 1880s the sawmills had to be prevented from signing such contracts in order to stop further damage. The sawmills also used their power over their suppliers to buy their land, with the sawmills in some areas buying more than half of all land. In that exploitation the Baggböle sawmill wasn't the worst offender, though, and in fact didn't start to invest in real estate until after the sawmill closed. =The end of the sawmill era= Fishing near Baggböle in the late 19th century The sawmill came under threat when steam power was introduced at Tunadal, further south along Sweden's Baltic coast, in 1849, followed by an additional twenty steam powered sawmills in Sweden within a decade. The new steam powered sawmills were usually placed near the seaports from where the lumber was shipped, forcing the old water powered sawmills, which by necessity had been positioned at rapids a bit up the rivers, to close. The water powered sawmill at Baggböle closed in 1884, as one of the last in Sweden, when a new steam powered sawmill was opened in Holmsund, the seaport at the mouth of the Ume River. After the sawmill at Baggböle closed the facility changed hands a number of times, and there was a plan to build a pulp mill there at the end of the nineteenth century, plans that were ultimately abandoned. Instead a hydro-electric powerplant was constructed at the Baggböle Rapids in 1899, in order to provide electricity for the city of Umeå, replacing a local steam powered plant.History, Umea Energi, retrieved 25 May 2014 In 1916-17 a new power plant was built at Baggböle, which supplied electricity at 40,000 volts, mainly to a pulp mill at Obbola, across the mouth of the Ume River from Holmsund, approximately from Baggböle. This power plant was eventually sold to the city of Umeå in 1947. The hydro-electric power plant at Baggböle was demolished in 1958 when a new substantially larger power plant was opened at Stornorrfors, only about up the Ume River from Baggböle.Visit Areas , Umea.se, retrieved 25 May 2014 Today the land formerly used by Baggböle sawmill is Arboretum Norr, an arboretum that has been developed to attract visitors, and develop plants suitable for northern latitudes, while the manor, which originally served as residence for the manager of the sawmill at Baggböle and became a historically listed/graded building in 1964, is used for business conferences and as a restaurant.Baggbole Mansion, Vasterbottens Museum, retrieved 3 June 2014Baggbole Manor House , visitumea.se, retrieved 18 May 2014 Notes 1\\\\. \\"Baggböleri, skogsskövling, olovlig skogsavverkning.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1978 until October 1980, he ran fourteen times and won six races. After showing some promise in his early races he emerged as a top-class stayer in the autumn on 1979, winning the Geoffrey Freer Stakes, Irish St. Leger and Prix Royal-Oak. In the spring of 1981 he won the John Porter Stakes and the Ormonde Stakes but was beaten in his three remaining races. He was retired to stud where he became a very successful breeding stallion. Background Niniski was a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks, bred in Kentucky by Caper Hill Farm Inc. Niniski was sired by Nijinsky, the Canadian- bred winner of the English Triple Crown in 1970 who went on to become an important breeding stallion, siring horses such as Ferdinand, Lammtarra, Sky Classic and Shahrastani. Niniski's dam Virginia Hills was a granddaughter of the Fashion Stakes winner Ridin' Easy, herself a descendant of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Pearl Cap, making her a distant relative of Pearl Diver, Belmez, Lypharita (Prix de Diane), Fine Pearl (Prix de Diane) and Yelapa (Grand Critérium). As a yearling the colt was sent to the sales at Saratoga and bought by representatives of Lady Beaverbrook for $90,000. Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko, Petoski), as this was the most common form for Derby winners. The colt was sent to Europe where he was trained by Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career =1978: two-year-old season= Shortly after his arrival in Europe, Niniski contracted pneumonia and almost died. He was not seriously trained as a two-year-old and did not race until October. He made his only appearance of 1978 in a six furlong maiden race at Newbury Racecourse in which he finished twelfth of the twenty-three runners behind Martial Arts. =1979: three-year-old season= Niniski began his second season by recording his first success against a large field in a maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse. In his next race, he ran in the Glasgow Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York in May in which he was beaten a head by the Peter Walwyn-trained New Berry. On 6 June, Ninisiki started an 80/1 outsider for the 200th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse and finished ninth of the twenty-three runners behind his stablemate Troy. In his next appearance, Niniski finished second by three quarters of a length to More Light, another Hern trainee, in the Group Three Gordon Stakes over one and a half miles at Goodwood. Niniski won five of his next six races. In August he was moved up in distance and tried against older horses for the first time in the Group Two Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs at Newbury. Ridden by Willie Carson, he raced towards the back of the seven runner field before making steady progress in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from the four-year-old M-Lolshan, the winner of the Irish St. Leger and Grosser Preis von Baden. At Doncaster Racecourse in September, Niniski started co-favourite for the 203rd running of the St Leger Stakes. Ridden again by Carson, he took the lead early in the straight but tired in the closing stages and finished third behind the French colts Son of Love and Soleil Noir. On 13 October, Niniski was sent to the Curragh Racecourse to contest the Irish St. Leger. Starting the 11/10 favourite, he drew away from his opponents in the final quarter mile to win by ten lengths from Torus. The independent Timeform organisation commented that \\"there can seldom have been a more decisive winner\\". Two weeks later Niniski started 7/5 favourite for the Prix Royal Oak, France's equivalent of the St Leger, run over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. The 1979 edition of the race was the first to be open to older horses, having previously being restricted to three-year-olds. Niniski appeared to be struggling at half way but rallied and turned into the straight in third place. He took the lead inside the last 400 metres and held on to win by one and a half lengths from the filly Anifa (later to win the Turf Classic). Niniski became the first foreign-trained horse to win the race since 1962 and the first to complete the Irish St. Leger/ Prix Royal Oak double. =1980: four-year-old season= On his four-year-old debut, Niniski was brought back in distance for the John Porter Stakes over one and a half miles at Newbury in April and started at odds of 2/1. He looked beaten when boxed in on the rail approaching the last quarter mile and when Carson had to switch to the outside of the field to obtain a clear run he was eight lengths behind the leaders. Niniski produced an unexpected burst of acceleration, taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by three lengths from Morse Code. In the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse a month later, he was made the 4/7 favourite but was less impressive, winning narrowly from Two of Diamonds and Son Fils. At Epsom in June, Niniski started favourite for the Group One Coronation Cup, but after being held up by Carson in the early stages he was never able to get to the leader Sea Chimes and finished second, beaten two and a half lengths. Timeform commented that he appeared to be uncomfortable on the firm ground. Niniski did not reappear until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 5 October. Ridden by Joe Mercer he started at odds of 21/1 and finished thirteenth of the twenty runners behind Detroit. On his final appearance, Niniski started the 4/1 third favourite as he attempted to repeat his 1979 success in the Prix Royal Oak. He finished sixth of the thirteen runners, five length behind the winner Gold River. Assessment In 1978 the independent Timeform organisation did not give Niniski a rating, but awarded him a \\"p\\", indicating that he was likely to make more than usual improvement, commenting that he would \\"do better over middle distances at 3 yrs\\". In the following year he was rated 125 by Timeform, twelve pounds behind Troy. In the official International Classification he was also rated twelve pounds behind Troy, making him the sixth-best British-trained colt of his generation. In 1980, Niniski was rated 118 by Timeform. Dick Hern said that Niniski was \\"as game and genuine as any horse I ever handled. He was also very sound and easy to train\\". Stud record Niniski was retired from racing at the end of the 1980 season and began his career as a breeding stallion at the Lanwades Stud at Newmarket, standing at a fee of £2,500. He made an immediate impact at stud, siring the champion two-year-old Kala Dancer and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Petoski in his first crop of foals and was the leading first-season sire in 1984. His other progeny included Hernando, Minster Son, Caitano (Premio Presidente della Repubblica, Aral-Pokal), Sapience (Ebor Handicap), Assessor, San Sebastian and the multiple Group One winner Lomitas (sire of Danedream). Niniski was euthanised in 1998. Kirsten Rausing, the owner of the Lanwades stud said: \\"It is entirely to Niniski that I owe the success of Lanwades Stud. I will be forever grateful to him\\".

Developed in the early 1890s, it was one of the largest country estates on the lake's shores. The main house, a three-story mansion built in 1891–92 by Frank Eugene Greene, is the most elaborate such house built in Moultonborough. A remnant of the estate, encompassing the former main house and some outbuildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The property is now a residential condominium. Description and history Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire's largest lake, is roughly shaped like a three-fingered hand, the fingers pointing approximately north. The right two fingers are separated by the Moultonborough Neck, from which a narrow channel separates it from Long Island, the lake's largest island. Long Island juts more directly south, and it is roughly the southern third of the island that was the Windermere estate. The island was farmed for much of the 19th century by a few families, the southernmost by Robert Lamprey until 1891, when he sold his holding to Frank Eugene Greene, a doctor who made and marketed patent medicines. He retained J.H. Besarick, an architect from Boston, to design his estate, which was built over a reported two-year period between 1891 and 1893. Materials for the buildings were brought to the site by boat, and the workmen doing the construction, said to number about 200, camped in tents. The principal surviving elements of the estate complex are its main house, gatehouse/caretaker's cottage, two barns, an ice house, and a hen house. The main house is a large three-story wood frame building, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The building has massing that is Colonial Revival, and includes decorative features from Queen Anne and Shingle styles. When built, the house had all of the modern amenities of the time, include gas lighting. Fresh water was supplied from a water tank in the attic of the cow barn, which was supplied from the lake by a steam-powered pump. The buildings of the complex today have been converted to residential use; the house has been subdivided into multiple residences.

Named for distinctive outcrops in the Minnesota River Valley near the town of Jordan, it extends throughout the Iowa Shelf and eastward over the Wisconsin Arch and Lincoln anticline into the Michigan Basin. Stratigraphically, the Jordan Formation is the uppermost unit of the type St. Croixan Series (historically, the uppermost subdivision of the Cambrian in North America). It is predominantly composed of mature, poorly cemented quartz sandstone, though several distinct facies have been identified on the basis of grain size, feldspathic content, and sedimentary structures. The Jordan is an important source of silica. Historically, the unit has been mined extensively for glass manufacturing, though recently it has been utilized as a source of frac sand. This porous, poorly cemented stratum is also an important aquifer and a major source of drinking water for people throughout the upper Midwest.  Definition and history  The earliest references to strata now referred to as Jordan were made by many of the pioneering geologists of the upper Midwest. In an 1852 report on the geology of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, D. D. Owen assigned it to the uppermost part of his “Lower Sandstone” (the “Upper Sandstone” referring to what is now called the St. Peter). The term Jordan Sandstone was first applied in 1874 by N. H. Winchell, who based his description on exposures in a quarry near Jordan, Minnesota.  Extent  The Jordan Formation is represented extensively by outcrops and exposures throughout Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa Geologic Map of Wisconsin; Geologic Map of Minnesota). It is particularly well represented in outcrops along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. It is also present in the subsurface in many parts of these states, and it has been identified in cores and drill cuttings in Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan as well (though here, it is not found at the surface). Beyond this region, rocks of similar age are present, though they are referred to other lithostratigraphic units. Presumed lateral equivalents of the Jordan Formation include the Eminence Dolostone of the Illinois Basin, the Au Train Formation of the northern Michigan Basin, and some horizon of the Knox Supergroup in the east-central United States.  Sedimentology  The Jordan Formation is composed primarily of very mature, well-sorted sandstones of uncertain provenance. Although it is composed primarily of quartz grains, feldspathic and lithic fragments are present in significant quantities, as are a variety of bioclasts derived from marine invertebrates. At least three distinct facies types have been identified and distinguished on the basis of sedimentary structures and grain size: a hummocky cross stratified facies, a trough-cross stratified facies, and a large scale-cross stratified facies. Overall, the Jordan Formation displays a coarsening upward sequence.  Stratigraphy  Generally, the Jordan Sandstone is assigned formational rank and considered the uppermost subdivision of the Trempealeau Group (though it is sometimes ranked as the uppermost Member of the Trempealeau Formation). Although the original type section is no longer exposed, a new reference section is defined at an exposure near Homer, Minnesota in Winona County, where several distinct tongues of the formation are seen intertonguing. The Jordan Sandstone ranges from 15 to 115 meters (50 to 377 feet). = Underlying = The lower Jordan contains relatively high proportions of feldspathic material and its lower contact is fairly gradational. Throughout much of the upper Midwest, it overlies the St. Lawrence Formation, which consists of a dolomitic facies (the Black Earth Member) and a silty facies (the Lodi Member). Earlier studies often combined the Jordan and the St. Lawrence, though they may be distinguished on the basis of lithology. The contact between these units is generally set at the top of the uppermost siltstone bed of the Lodi, where it is overlain by a continuous layer of sandstone. = Overlying = An outcrop of late Cambrian and early Ordovician rocks in a road-cut at Miller's Curve, just to the west of Madison, Wisconsin. The Jordan sandstone is the light grey rock in the lower third of this outcrop, the Oneota (dolomitic carbonate) is the orange grey rock in the upper two thirds of the road-cut. The Jordan is overlain by the Oneota Formation, a dolomitic carbonate unit of early Ordovician Age. The massive, well-cemented microbial carbonates of the Oneota Formation generally overlie several meters of sandy shale with calcareous interbeds referred to as Coon Valley or Stockton Hill Member. Although these beds have traditionally been allied with the Jordan Formation based on lithostratigraphic properties, but more recent sequence and biostratigraphic studies suggest it is more closely allied with the Oneota. The upper contact of the Jordan is interpreted to be a topographically complex, unconformable surface. = Subunits = The Jordan has at least four named subdivisions distinguished on the basis of sedimentary structures, grain size, and stratigraphic position. The basal Norwalk Member is composed of fine grained hummocky-stratified sandstone containing a relatively high proportion of feldspar. This subunit is heavily bioturbated, and contains occasional fossils of marine organisms. A photo-mosaic of the Jordan Formation at Mendota Station, a few miles north of Madison, Wisconsin. The lower Van Oser Member is at the base, Sunset Point Member is in the middle, and Upper Van Oser Member is at the top. The Norwalk is generally overlain by the Van Oser Member, a medium-grained trough-cross stratified quartz sandstone facies. At least two tongues of this facies are present in the Jordan Formation, generally separated by either a fine-grained hummocky stratified sandstone called the Waukon Member, or a bioturbated, laminated feldspathic quartz sandstone with dolomitic cement, which is called the Sunset Point Member.  Depositional history  = Deposition = Owing to the presence of rare fossils and bioturbated sediments, the Jordan Formation is interpreted as a product of marine depositional environments. The bioturbated, fine-grained facies are interpreted as lower shoreface deposits influenced by tidal fluctuations and storms. The coarser, cross-bedded deposits, such as the Van Oser, may be deposits of large, submarine dunes. The Jordan is one of many “sheet sandstones” which covered a large swath of the continent during the late Cambrian. At this time, most of North America was covered by shallow sea, blanketed by laterally continuous sheets of sandstone and carbonate covering tens of thousands of square kilometers (the Paleozoic orthoquartzite-carbonate suite). = Age = The Jordan Formation has long been regarded as Upper Cambrian, more specifically, it encompasses part of the Saukia trilobite biozone, as determined by the presence of trilobites such as Tellerina strigosa. Conodonts from the Norwalk Member suggest assignment to the Eoconodontus zone, which corroborates the ages provided by trilobites. The overlying Oneota Formation is early Ordovician in age, as indicated by conodonts and trilobites. This suggests that the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary should reside either in the upper Jordan, or at the contact with the overlying Oneota. But this is still an area of active study.  Economic impact  = Frac sand = The well-sorted, well-rounded sediments of the Jordan Formation are mined extensively as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing. The sand is commonly added to fracking fluids for the purpose of keeping induced hydraulic fractures open. The thickness of the unit, its relatively poor cementation, and its close proximity to major waterways and roadways has made it a lucrative target for mining companies. = Groundwater = The coarse grained Jordan Formation is poorly cemented, and it has a low clay content, meaning the unit is highly permeable. These properties make it an excellent aquifer, which extends throughout the north-central United States.

Hayıg-B. Werner), formerly Dersim Province, is located in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. The least densely-populated province in Turkey, it was originally named Dersim Province (Dersim vilayeti), then demoted to a district (Dersim kazası) and incorporated into Elâzığ Province in 1926.Album of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey , Vol. 1, p. XXII, Dersim İli, 26.06.1926 tarih ve 404 sayılı Resmi Ceride'de yayımlanan 30.5.1926 tarih ve 877 sayılı Kanunla ilçeye dönüstürülerek Elazıg'a bağlanmıştır.  Geography  Pertek Castle The adjacent provinces are Erzincan to the north and west, Elazığ to the south, and Bingöl to the east. The province covers an area of and has a population of 76,699. Tunceli is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.The Munzur Valley National Park is also situated in the province.  History  The history of the province stretches back to antiquity. It was mentioned as Daranalis by Ptolemy, and seemingly, it was referred to as Daranis before him. One theory as to the origin of the name associates with Darius the Great. Another, more likely hypothesis, considering the region's Armenian background, says the name Daranalis or Daranaghis comes from the historical Armenian province of Daron, of which Dersim belonged. They are named Daranaghi in what is today Dersim, that in Mamigonian times was part of Daron. The area that would become Dersim province formed part of Urartu, Media, the Achaemenid Empire, and the Greater Armenian region of Sophene. Sophene was later contested by the Roman and Parthian Empires and by their respective successors, the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. Arabs invaded in the 7th century, and Seljuq Turks in the 11th.Seyfi Cengiz Tarih (2005). History. As of the end of the 19th century, the region, called Dersim, was included in the Ottoman sancak (sub-province) of Hozat, including the city and the Mamuret-ul-Aziz Vilayet (now Elazığ), with the exception of the actual district of Pülümür, which was in the neighboring sancak of Erzincan, then a part of the Erzurum Vilayet. This status continued through the first years of the Republic of Turkey, until 1936 when the name of the province (\\"Dersim\\") was changed to Tunceli, literally 'the land of bronze' in Turkish (tunç meaning 'bronze' and el (in this context) meaning 'land') after the brutal events of the Dersim rebellion. The town of Kalan was made the capital and the district of Pülümür was included in the new province. = Inspectorate General = Following the Tunceli Law 1935, which demanded a more powerful Government in the region, the Fourth Inspectorate-General (Umumi Müfettişlik, UM) was created in January 1936. The fourth UM span over the provinces of Elaziğ, Erzincan, Bingöl and Tunceli, and was governed by a Governor Commander. Most of the employees in the municipality were to be filled with military personnel and the Governor-Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in other parts. Also the juridical guarantees did not comply with the law in the other parts in Turkey. The trials were at most 15 days long and sentences could not be appealed. For a release, the Governor Commander had to give his consent. The application of the death penalty was under the authority of the Governor-Commander, while normally it would be the authority of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to approve such a punishment. In 1946 the Tunceli Law was abolished and the state of emergency removed but the authority of the fourth UM was transferred to the military. The Inspectorates-General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.  Demographics  It has the lowest population density of any province in Turkey, just 9.8 inhabitants/km2. The majority of the population is Kurdish. =Armenians of Tunceli= The Armenians of Dersim lived peacefully alongside the Alevi Zazas, who partially assimilated into and had various Armenian beliefs.http://www.kirdki.com/images/kitaphane/Meqale%202.pdf Many of the region's Armenians were living among the Alevi Zazas of the region, with whom they had good relations. This allowed the Armenians to avoid deportation because their Alevi neighbors didn't have any negative affinity towards Armenians, and as explained before were somewhat Armenian themselves. The Armenians lived quietly in their mountain villages until 1938, when Turkish Armed Forces soldiers invaded the region to put down a Dersim rebellion, and in the process blew up St Karapet's Monastery and killed around 60,000-70,000 Alevis and Armenians alike, causing an abrupt end to any open Armenian life in the province. Armenians now were forced to assimilate fully into the Alevi population, moving from their majority Armenian villages to blend in better with the population, and therefore becoming Hidden Armenians. = Tunceli Alevis = Tunceli is the only province of Turkey with an Alevi majority. They have been practicing Alevism before the Ottoman Empire came to the Middle East and many believe Munzur, Dersim to be the heartland of the Alevi. Where holy places, all of which are natural features of the landscape, are found in abundance, and where the region's isolation has insulated it from the influence of Turkeys' dominant Sunni sect of Islam, helping to keep its unique Alevi character relatively pure. An example of this would be Newroz, the Kurdish New Year and a key date in Zoroastrian. The Alevi Kurds come out to sing and dance around the fire, they dress in traditional clothing, wear a red band over their heads and play soft music to their land. Kadir Bulut, one of the few remaining \\"dedes\\" in Tunceli, stated that \\"If you really call yourself Alevi, there is not really room for it in Islam\\". On Prime Minister Davutoğlu's visit to Tunceli, Engin Dogru, head of the Kurdish Democratic Regions Party, stated that \\"Davutoglu's visit was an attempt at assimilation, he tried to define a Muslim, and we do not want this.\\"  Name changes  It is said that ancient Greek historians and geographers named the Dersim region Daranis and Derksene. Baytar Nuri includes this information at the entrance of his book Dersim in Kurdistan history.Baytar Nuri Dersim, Dersim in the History of Kurdistan After the Dersim rebellion, any villages and towns deemed to have non-Turkish names were renamed and given Turkish names in order to suppress any non-Turkish heritage.(Turkish) Tunçel H., \\"Türkiye'de İsmi Değiştirilen Köyler,\\" Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, Firat Universitesi, 2000, volume 10, number 2.Eren, editor, Ali Çaksu ; preface, Halit (2006).

Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"Preservation\\" basically sum up the plot of the two Preservation albums. It describes how \\"once upon a time in a faraway land, lived a villain called Flash, he was such a wicked man,\\" who \\"terrorized the people ... broke arms and crushed hands ... ruled with a fist and ... purchased all the land.\\" However, under Flash, the \\"people were scared\\" and \\"they didn't know where to turn.\\" They soon realized that Flash only did what he did for money and \\"for his own preservation.\\" Now, because Flash broke his promise, \\"he's got to pay for his crimes and his lies and his evil ways.\\" Unfortunately, the problems for the people will continue, as \\"it's gonna get rough\\" in the \\"story of self preservation.\\" Musically, the track opens with a guitar riff. \\"Preservation\\" also features Ray Davies on vocals, and the track has a rock style. Female backing vocalist appear at the very end of the track. Release \\"Preservation\\" was not released on either of the Preservation albums when they were first released in 1973 and 1974, respectively. It first was released as a standalone U.S. single, backed with \\"Salvation Road\\", the closing track of Preservation Act 2. It did not chart, performing similarly to other Kinks singles of the time. However, it was not released in the U.K. until it was issued as a bonus track on the 1998 CD Velvel edition of Preservation Act 1. However, unlike most other bonus tracks on CD reissues of Kinks albums, it was placed at the beginning of the track listing (rather than being tacked on at the end), making it the opening track. Andrew Hickey wrote in his book, Preservation: The Kinks' Music 1964-1974, that \\"by starting the CD with a song in the style of ['Demolition'],\\" the album's \\"structure is ruined.\\" Reception \\"Preservation\\" has received mixed reviews. Pitchfork Media described the track as \\"a lankier, reworded take on the album closer 'Demolition.' 'Preservation' never made the album, instead working as a single that sold the concept of the album.\\" Hickey said that the track \\"for what it is ... this is decent enough - it's a three-chord glam stomper that wouldn't have sounded at all out of place on 70s rock radio, with a catchy guitar riff - but the lyrics are just a giant infodump rather than being particularly clever or moving.\\" References Category:The Kinks songs Category:1974 songs Category:1974 singles Category:Songs written by Ray Davies Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Davies Category:RCA Records singles ","title":"Preservation (song)"},{"id":"42785157","text":"Red King, White Knight is a 1989 spy thriller television film starring Tom Skerritt, Max von Sydow, and Helen Mirren.

It is the smallest Empidonax flycatcher in eastern North America. Taxonomy The closest relative to the least flycatcher was long thought to be the Hammond's flycatcher based on similarities in their songs and appearances. However, mitochondrial DNA analysis has revealed that the least flycatcher diverges significantly from its congeners and does not possess any sister taxa. Description The least flycatcher is hard to distinguish from the other birds of its genus. The bird is one of the smallest of the genus Empidonax, measuring 12 to 14 cm in height with a wingspan of 19 to 22 cm and weighing approximately 10.3 g. Its plumage is dull olive-gray on its back and whitish on its belly, notably brighter than the other Empidonax birds. The least flycatcher's wings are lined with two white bars, and white rings contour its eyes. Its beak is short and the lower mandible is yellowish. The juveniles look similar to the adults except that their wing bars are slightly darker, with tawny/olive hues. Because other flycatchers also have those field marks, the best way to identify the least flycatcher is by its call and habitat. Distribution and habitat The least flycatcher inhabits the Eastern Rockies of Canada, and the Central-North and Northeastern United-States. During winter, they migrate to Central America and establish themselves from Mexico to Panama. The least flycatcher lives in aspen clusters, orchards, shade trees and open woods. They breed in deciduous or mixed forests and occasionally in coniferous groves. They tend to prefer breeding sites near clearing or edges but can also nest in dry woods. They spend the winter in Central America where they nest in forest edges and second growth. The least flycatcher also made its way in the open country. They often live in villages or city parks, nesting in shade trees and orchards, or along rural roads and forest edges. Behaviour: vocalization, diet and reproduction = Vocalization = thumbThe vocalization of the least flycatcher is often characterized as being dry and sounding like a piercing «che-bec» pushed with strength, the second syllable being louder than the first. During the hottest days of the summer, they often call incessantly. Singing is essential to the least flycatcher to establish and defend their territory. While the female remains quietly in the nest, the male sings from several perches some distance away from the nest, and a few kilometers above the level of the nest. From there, he sings the Che-bec repeatedly and rapidly during the morning (about 60 times per minute), losing some speed and regularity throughout the day. All of the males in a same area seem to sing in unison. This singing fervor gradually decreases throughout the summer, as the breeding cycle reaches an end. The female sings rarely. She instead uses a call-note that Macqueen (1950) describes as sounding like «Chweep». She sometimes calls while feeding her nestling, or to her partner when he leaves and returns to the nest. She also uses her chweep- note in outbursts when defending her nest. = Diet = The least flycatcher, as its name indicates, feeds on flies but includes many other items in its diet. They mainly eat insects such as many small wasps, winged ants, beetles, caterpillars, midges, a few true bugs, grasshoppers, spiders and other small invertebrates. They also occasionally eat berries. To forage, the least flycatcher mainly catches its insects mid-air, but they also catch some insects from the vegetation. When foraging, the bird watches from a perch and flies out to catch the insects that pass by. The Least flycatcher is considered a slow searcher in comparison to other birds, switching perch around 10 times/minute and frequently turning around on its perch to get a 360° view. Least flycatchers rarely glean but hover extensively in comparison to its congeners. Those perches are mainly dead twigs of the bottom part of a tree located in opened patches of the forest. In short, Robinson and Holmes (1982) determined that the least flycatcher attacks 81.1% of their preys by hovering, 9.6% by hawking, 6.2% by flush-chasing and 3.1% by gleaning. = Reproduction = The least flycatcher breeds in spring in highly clumped groups. The proximity of neighbors even appears to be more important than habitat quality when the bird is selecting its breeding site.Sherry TW, Holmes RT. 1985. Dispersion patterns and habitat responses of birds in northern hardwoods forest. Cody M, editor. In: Habitat selection in birds. New York (NY): Academic Press. p. 283-309. The advantage that could explain such a behavior remains unclear and has been the subject of many studies. Some of the hypothesis the scholars explored include: clustering to take advantage of heterogeneous resources,Keister AR, Slatkin M. 1974. A strategy of movement and resource utilization. Theoretical Population Biology. 6: 1–20. to deter predators,Perry EF, Manolis JC, Andersen DE. 2008. Reduced predation in interior nests in clustered all purpose territories of least flycatchers (Empidonax minimus). The Auk. 125(3): 643-650. or to keep away other species with similar resource requirements. The courtship behavior of the least flycatcher remains largely unknown but it is thought to involve the male chasing the female through trees. The males are aggressive and sing incessantly until pairs form. Once pairs form, the female starts building their nest on either the forks of small trees like maples, birches, or ashes, or on the top of a large branch. The average height of the nest is 12 to 25 inches above the ground, but can vary from 2 to 65 inches depending on the habitat. The female builds the nest by weaving fine pieces of grass, strips of bark, twigs, lichen, spider and caterpillar webs, animal hairs and feathers, and other plant-derived materials together to form a tidy cup, a process that takes her about five days. The female least flycatcher typically lays three to five creamy-white colored eggs, with a strong tendency towards four. The female incubates the eggs for a period of 13 to 16 days while the male remains in the area and occasionally feeds her. The eggs hatch together in June over a period of one to three days. Once the eggs hatch, both parents bring food to their newborns. The nestlings fly for the first time at the age of 12 to 17 days. They typically remain being fed by their parents for another 2 to 3 weeks. = Territoriality = The couple spends most of its time in their chosen breeding site. Their average defended territory size is 0.18 acres (8036.8 feet square), with an average distance between congener's nests of 175 feet. Both parents become particularly aggressive and territorial to both intra- and heterospecific intruders. If another least flycatcher intrudes their territory, the resident male quickly reacts, uttering a sharp note and adopting a threat-display. In its threat-display, the male attempts to look bigger by “fluffing out its breast feathers, raising its chest, extending, vibrating and bending the wings, spreading and flicking the tail up and down, and crouching”. This display lasts only a second or two before the male flies off to chase the trespasser away. If the intruder is too persistent, the resident male engages in a fight and usually wins. Females can also engage in territorial defenses in certain occasions. If the trespasser comes in a radius of about 20 feet surrounding her nest, the female reacts. If her partner is absent, she flies off to chase the intruder and attacks if necessary. She can also work in tandem with her partner to defend their territory in scenarios where there are more than one intruder at a time. In that case, they both cooperate and chase them away, although the male is always first to react.  Migration  Least flycatchers’ age and sex groups migrate at different intervals. In Fall, adult males leave the breeding ground first, followed by adult females about a week later. The younger ones only join the rest of the group a month later.Johnson NK. 1963. Comparative molt cycles in the tyrannid geuns Empidonax. Proc. XIII Intern. Ornithol. Congr no. 870-883.Hussell DJT, Davis T, Montgomerie RD. 1967. Differential fall migration of adult and immature Least Flycatchers. Bird-Banding. 38: 61-66.Ely CA. 1970. Migration of Least and Traill's flycatchers in west-central Kansas. Bird-Banding. 41: 198-204. Fall migration occurs in July and early August, peaking in late- August. In the Fall migration, it has been reported that populations living in the west first migrate east before heading south. From the East, they then fly down to the Tropics. A few of them establish themselves for the winter in southern Florida, but most of them choose to spend their winter on the coasts of Central America. Once in that region, they inhabit wooded ravines of the Pacific slope or the dense bushes and wooded edges habitats of the Caribbean side. The least flycatcher leaves its wintering ground relatively early in comparison to other birds, arriving back north in late April to mid-May. It is thought that they can afford to arrive so early because they can subsist on small-sized insects which are out early in spring. They might also arrive early because of their highly competitive breeding site selection – a product of their habit to breed in clustered distribution. The least flycatcher spends its breeding season in southern Yukon to central Quebec and Maritime Provinces, in Wyoming Indiana, New Jersey and in the mountains of North Carolina. The breeding season only last about 64 days, after which they return south in the Tropics. The adult least flycatcher molts after migrating to its wintering ground, which differs from most other passerines. The juveniles, on the other hand, molt prior and throughout their Fall migration. The reason why the molt of the adults is delayed remains unclear, but might be due to the highly competitive site selection of winter habitat, where the first to arrive are the first to be served.

Established in 1574, the post ranked among the most important in the Ottoman Empire until the early 19th century, especially after the stewardship of the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the supervision of all charitable foundations (vakifs) in the Empire came under his purview. The wealth thus amassed, the proximity to the sultan, and the role the harem ladies played in court intrigues (\\"Sultanate of Women\\") meant that its occupant had considerable political influence; several kizlar aghas were responsible for the downfall of grand viziers and the accession of sultans. Soon after its creation and until its abolition, close to the end of the Ottoman Empire, the post came to be occupied by Black African eunuch slaves, and hence is also referred to as the Chief Black Eunuch.  History and powers  19th-century depiction of the Chief Black Eunuch (left), a court dwarf (middle) and the Chief White Eunuch (right) The post of the kizlar agha was created in the reign of Murad III () in 1574, with the Habeshi Mehmed Agha as its first occupant. Until then, the Ottoman palace had been dominated by the white eunuchs, chiefly drawn from the Christian populations of the Balkans or the Caucasus. The 16th century, however, saw a rapid rise of the population of the Topkapi Palace, including among eunuchs, whose numbers rose from 40 under Selim I () to over a thousand under Murad III. While black eunuchs had served alongside white eunuchs in the palace, by 1592, for reasons that are unclear, both a separation of roles as well as the ascendancy of the black eunuchs over the white ones had become established: white eunuchs were restricted to the supervision of the male pages (içoğlan), while black eunuchs took over the far more prestigious supervision of the private apartments of the sultan and the palace women (harem). Consequently, the \\"chief black eunuch\\" quickly eclipsed the \\"chief white eunuch\\" or kapi agha (kapı ağası, \\"agha of the gate\\"), who had hitherto been the head of the palace personnel, and rose to become, in the words of the Orientalist C. E. Bosworth, \\"in practice the principal officer of the whole palace\\". At the height of the post's power in the 17th and 18th centuries, the kizlar agha was a vizier of the first rank (\\"with three horsetails\\") and came third in the state hierarchy, next only to the Empire's chief minister, the grand vizier, and the chief religious authority, the sheikh ul-Islam. The post's power derived not only from its proximity to the sultan, but also from its association with the mothers of the sultans, the powerful valide sultanas, who often dominated politics (the so-called \\"Sultanate of Women\\" period). The kizlar agha was also the de facto sole intermediary between the closed world of the harem and the outer, male quarters of the palace (the selamlik), controlling its provisioning as well as the messages to and from. In addition, he was the only individual allowed to carry the grand vizier's communications to the sultan and had a recognized role in public ceremonies. Among his duties in the palace was also the supervision of the education of imperial princes until they entered puberty, when they were enrolled in the palace school. In Ottoman legal theory, the sultan was supposed to conduct affairs of state exclusively via the grand vizier, but in reality this arrangement was often circumvented. As the Ottomanist Colin Imber writes, the sultan \\"had closer contact with the pages of the privy chamber, the agha of the gate, the agha of the girls or with other courtiers than he did with the grand vizier, and these too could petition the sultan on their own or somebody else’s behalf. He might, too, be more inclined to take the advice of his mother, a concubine or the head gardener at the helm of the royal barge than of the grand vizier\\". Thus the kizlar agha's political power, although exercised behind the scenes, was very considerable, influencing imperial policy and at times controlling the appointments to the grand vizierate, or even intervening in dynastic disputes and the succession to the throne. The Kizlar Agha Hacı Mustafa Agha secured the succession of Mustafa I () on the throne in 1617, and backed Osman I's () attempts at military reform; while in 1651 the Kizlar Agha Uzun Süleyman Agha murdered the powerful Valide Sultan Kösem on behalf of her rival and daughter-in-law, Turhan. The often pernicious involvement of the chief black eunuchs in politics led to at least one attempt, by Grand Vizier Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha in 1715, to curb their influence by prohibiting the recruitment and castration of black slaves, but this was never carried out due to his death soon after. Indeed, the long tenure of Hacı Beshir Agha that followed in 1717–1746 is recognized as perhaps the apogee of the post's power and influence. Beshir Agha was a notable patron of the \\"Tulip Era\\" culture then flourishing in the empire, being was engaged in \\"intellectual and religious pursuits\\" that according to historian Jateen Lad \\"contributed to the Ottoman brand of Hanafi Islam and Sunni orthodoxy in general\\". After the downfall of Sultan Ahmed III in 1730, his influence was such that he was responsible for the elevation of grand viziers and the direction of foreign affairs. In 1731, Grand Vizier Kabakulak Ibrahim Pasha tried to force Beshir's retirement to stop him from interfering in state affairs, but through the influence of the valide sultan, Beshir secured Ibrahim's dismissal instead. After Beshir Agha's death, in the late 18th century, the grand viziers started curtailing the kizlar aghas' power, but it was not until the reforms of Sultan Mahmud II () in the 1830s that the political power of the kizlar aghas was finally ended, and its holders confined to their palace and ceremonial role, which continued until the abolition of the office following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908. = Administration of the vakifs = Depiction of a Kizlar Agha, The kizlar agha also held a special role as the administrator (nazir) of the charitable foundations and endowments (vakifs) designated for the upkeep of the two holy cities (al-Haramayn) of Islam, Mecca and Medina, being responsible for their supply as well as for the annual ritual sending of gifts (sürre) to them. Vakifs designated for the upkeep of the Muslim holy places had been established by members of the Ottoman court since early times, and their administration entrusted to special departments already since the late 15th century. Initially under the overall supervision of the Kapi Agha, in 1586 Murad III transferred the responsibility to the kizlar agha. Control of the vakifs was, in the words of Bernard Lewis, a major \\"source of power and profit\\" for the kizlar agha, and the foundation of the office's political influence: its conferment by Murad III marked the start of the office's ascendancy, and its eventual removal by Mahmud II marked its end. As part off the grand viziers' attempts to lessen the power of the kizlar aghas, unsuccessful attempts were made in the reigns of Mustafa III () and Abdul Hamid I () to remove the vakifs from his jurisdiction. Finally, in 1834, Mahmud II deprived the post of the supervision of the vakifs and granted it to a new Ministry of Vakifs. This began a long process whereby the kizlar agha gradually acquired a sweeping jurisdiction over the various vakifs of the Empire: already in May 1598, he acquired control of the foundations allocated to the upkeep of the imperial mosques in the capital, followed soon after by vakifs in both Constantinople and other parts of the Empire, often entrusted to his care by the ladies of the palace. Among the possessions that fell to the kizlar agha in this way was the city of Athens. According to a—possibly semi-fictional—17th-century account, the administration of the city was originally granted to Basilica, one of Sultan Ahmed I's () favourite concubines, who hailed from the city and who, having received many complaints of its maladministration, obtained its possession as a gift from the sultan. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the kizlar agha. The administration of the vakifs was exercised through two subordinates, the chief secretary (yazici) and the inspector of vakifs (müfettiş), and was divided into two fiscal departments: the Bureau of Accounts of the Holy Cities (muhasebe-i haremeyn kalemi), which by the late 18th century supervised the imperial mosques and the vakifs of Istanbul and European provinces, and the Bureau of the Leases of the Holy Cities (mukataa-i haremeyn kalemi), which supervised the vakifs of the Asian and African provinces. A special treasury, the haremeyn dolabi, contained the revenue from the vakifs, and the kizlar agha held a weekly council (divan) to examine the accounts.  Recruitment and advancement  Postcard with the chief black eunuch of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, early 20th century Most of the office's holders, like most black eunuchs in general, were of Habeşi, slaves were traditionally drawn from the Nilotic groups inhabiting Ethiopia's southern hinterland as well as Omotic groups. Black slaves, usually purchased as boys from Nubia, then castrated and inducted into the palace service, had begun to be employed as the guards of the women of the sultan's harem since the time of Murad III's predecessor, Selim II (), and continued to be so employed until the Ottoman Empire's end. The eunuchs usually received flower names, and after a period of training in the palace school, they entered service in the harem. The eunuchs began at the post of ordinary recruit (en aşağı, literally \\"the lowest\\", and acemi ağa, \\"the untrained\\"), and gradually advanced through the ranks, from nevbet kalfa (\\"watch substitute\\") to senior posts in the guard of the harem. Having completed their training and after a period of service, some were detached from guard duties and transferred to the attendance of the inhabitants of the harem: the sultan's personal attendants (müsahip ağaları), the seven eunuch servants plus a head eunuch (baş ağa) attached to each valide, principal wife (kadın), or prince (şehzade), the eunuch imams who led harem prayers, the harem's treasurer (haznedar ağası), or the müsendereci, who supervised the work of the other eunuchs. The senior-most eunuchs were known as hasıllı, from an Arabic word meaning \\"product\\". From these senior posts a eunuch could be selected and appointed to the post of kizlar agha by imperial decree (hatt-ı hümayun) and the ceremonial receipt of a robe of office (hil'at) from the sultan. Alongside the lands belonging to the office, the kizlar agha usually received a personal fief (hass). In the Topkapi Palace, the kizlar agha had his own spacious apartment near the Aviary Gate, while the other eunuchs under his supervision lived together in cramped and rather squalid conditions in a three-storey barracks. When they were dismissed, the chief black eunuchs received a pension (asatlık, literally \\"document of liberty\\") and from 1644 on were exiled to Egypt or the Hejaz. Starting in the late 17th century, many former holders were appointed to head the eunuchs who guarded the Tomb of Muhammad in Medina. As a result, serving kizlar aghas often took care to prepare for a comfortable retirement in Egypt by buying property and establishing vakifs of their own there. Thus they became local grandees and were involved in patronizing trade and agriculture. Thus, and given the important role Egypt played in the provisioning of the two holy cities, for which the kizlar aghas were particularly responsible while in office, the aghas and their agents (wakils) came to play a very important role in the economy of Egypt under Ottoman rule. The careers of a great number of kizlar aghas are known from the Hamiletü’l-kübera of the late 18th-century Ottoman statesman and historian Ahmed Resmî Efendi, listing the occupants of the office from Mehmed Agha (1574–90) until Moralı Beshir Agha (1746–52). The work is complemented by select biographies in the Sicill-i Osmani by the late 19th- century scholar Mehmed Süreyya Bey, while information on the history and evolution of the office in the institutional framework of the Ottoman palace is contained in Tayyarzade Ahmed Ata's Tarih-i Ata (1876).

The MPT was designed for robust high altitude, all weather combat, capable of functioning in extreme hot and cold weather. The MKEK MPT is a rifle intended to take abuse and extreme mistreatment and still maintain high accuracy and reliability in order to survive in true battle environments. The Turkish government has invested US$22 million into the project. It made its first public appearance at the Eurosatory 2014, ADEX 2014 and the MSPO 2014 events. History After the first prototypes were built in 2008 as the Mehmetçik-1 in 5.56×45mm NATO, the rifle received negative feedback from Turkish soldiers testing it who reported that they preferred the 7.62×51mm NATO round which has far greater stopping power and range similar to those of the existing G3 service rifles. The proposed Mehmetcik-1 was therefore cancelled after the first prototype and engineers started the redesign process. The first batch of 200 MPT-76s were delivered on 18 May 2014 and received positive feedback. The rifle was reported to be extremely accurate, reliable, and outmatched the G3 in all categories. The Turkish Army plans to gradually phase out its G3 and to make the MPT-76 its main service rifle. Azerbaijan plans to produce parts of the rifle in cooperation with Turkey. Serial production began in 2015. The initial phase of the project will see a total of 35,014 MPT-76s being produced in two tranches. The first tranche of the initial phase, consisting of 20,000 rifles was contracted to the state- owned company Machines and Chemical Industries Board (MKEK) in June 2015. The second tranche, consisting of 15,014 rifles, was contracted with local company Kalekalip in December 2015. The first batch of rifles was ready for delivery to the Turkish military in January 2017. Approximately 25,000 MPT-76s have been built by December 2018 and there is 350,000+ firm order for the rifle in 2019. Design The design was based on the AR-15, but the gas piston system was influenced by the HK417. It has a Picatinny rail system and mounting options for an under-barrel shotgun and grenade launcher. Variants The following variants are in production: * Battle Rifle with 16-inch barrel using 7.62×51mm NATO. * Carbine with 12-inch barrel using 5.56×45mm NATO. * Designated Marksman's Rifle with 20-inch barrel using 7.62×51mm NATO. =MPT-76= The MPT-76 is a gas operated, selective fire weapon, chambered for a standard NATO 7.62×51mm ammunition. Number in the designation denotes the 7.62 mm caliber. There is also an MPT-56 assault rifle, chambered for the standard NATO 5.56×45mm ammunition. However, as of 2016 the 5.56×45mm version was not adopted. It looks like the Turkish soldiers preferred the more powerful 7.62×51mm round over the 5.56×45mm due to longer range and penetration. =MPT-55= In May 2017, MKEK introduced the MPT-55 of the MPT, which is chambered in 5.56×45mm. The standard version is with a barrel, and the shorter MPT-55K is with an barrel. Turkey plans to obtain 20,000 of the smaller-caliber rifles to replace license-produced HK416s within special forces. =KNT-76= The KNT (Keskin Nişancı Tüfeği, English: Sniper Rifle, lit. \\"Sharp Shooter Rifle\\") is the DMR version of the MPT series. KNT-76 is produced in Kırıkkale Arms Factory like the MPT-76. The rifle with the same \\"Gas Operated Rotary Bolt Action\\" mechanism can fire semi-automatically. The MPT-76 can fire fully automatic and semi-automatic. Trigger sensitivity in the KNT is reduced by five Newtons which allows the trigger to move with less pressure. This drop prevents the involuntary movement of the barrel due to trigger movement. The KNT-76 weighs 500 grams heavier while the magazine capacity remains the same. The effective range increased from 600 meters to 800 meters thanks to the barrel extending from 406 mm to 508 mm. MOA is reduced to 1.5 MOA in KNT-76 as it was 4 MOA with the MPT-76. =KAAN-717= KAAN-717 is the carbine version of the MPT series, chambered in 7.62x51 NATO. Designed for the Special Forces, it uses a short-stroke action. KAAN-717 also comes with a different stock with cheek rest. Users *: 30 MPT-76s and 30 MPT-55s * : Requested to take part in the project as a fellow Turkic nation. Ordered an unknown number of rifles with an eventual intent of full adoption for service. * * : Around 2,500 MPT-76s delivered. * : A total of 450 rifles were delivered to Somalia, which is dealing with an insurgency. * : 66,000 MPT-76 and MPT-55s as of 2020 =Potential users= * : Expressed interest in fully adopting the rifle for military service. * * See also * List of battle rifles References Category:5.56 mm assault rifles Category:7.62×51mm NATO battle rifles Category:Rifles of Turkey Category:Turkish inventions Category:ArmaLite AR-10 derivatives Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 2014 ","title":"MKE MPT"},{"id":"42785949","text":"A DJ cues up a record track To cue audio is to determine the desired initial playback point in a piece of recorded music. It is a technique often used in radio broadcasting and DJing. One dictionary definition is to \\"Set a piece of audio or video equipment in readiness to play (a particular part of the recorded material).\\"  Process  DJs typically find the desired start place on a record, tape, CD, or other media by listening to the recording with headphones and manipulating the turntable or other playback controls. Some DJs mark parts of a record with stickers to make it easier to find parts of record tracks. DJs use headphones to cue up the start point; this means that the audience cannot hear the playback until the DJ wants them to. Once the recording is cued up to the desired start point, the DJ can then commence the playback of the recording at the desired moment. The goal of cueing is to avoid \\"dead air\\", that is, silence.  Slip cue  A subtype of cueing is slip cueing. To slip cue a record, there has to be a felt mat under the record. The DJ finds the desired start point then leaves the stylus at the start point while holding the side of the record, with the turntable spinning. The DJ can then release the record and the music will start immediately. References Further reading * Category:Audio mixing Category:DJing ","title":"Cue (audio)"},{"id":"42785963","text":"David J.

The developers worked with Let's Players and YouTubers on the script for the story and for building the characters. It was first released on February 27, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, followed by Linux and OS X on May 11, 2015. The game was re-released as BLACKHOLE: Complete Edition on June 15, 2016. This version includes the fully updated base game, 3 DLCs (Testing Lab, Secret of the Entity and Challenge Vault), digital artbook and soundtrack, developer diaries, first prototype of the game, printable high resolution artwork, wallpapers, and collector cards. The same version was ported to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles on August 8, 2017.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65JZLXRZugI  Gameplay  Blackhole is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle-platformer. The player's task is to collect \\"selfburns.\\" At least one must be collected in each level to move on. If all selfburns are collected in the level, the time is saved. The player can also try to get a better time once he collects all of them. To finish the game, the player needs to collect a certain number of selfburns. The game contains six acts, including Cave, Jungle, and Desert. Every act is set in a different environment and includes different puzzles or objects. For example, the jungle includes trampolines and the desert includes pushable crates. Each act includes a special platform that changes gravity.  Plot  The game is set in 2121. Earth is threatened by black holes. A group of astronauts are sent on a mission to neutralize them. Their effort is successful until their spaceship called Endera is sucked into one of the massive black holes and crashes on Entity; a mysterious object resembling a planet. The first person to wake up, and who the player takes control of, is the crew's coffee-maker assistant, a.k.a. Coffee Guy; accompanied by the ship's artificial intelligence Auriel loaded into his PDA. The Coffee Guy must collect nanobots called \\"selfburns\\" to repair the ship and find the rest of the crew.  Development  The developers originally intended to remake PacIn: Revenge of Nermessis, FiolaSoft Studio's previous title. Unlike the original game, the remake was intended to be released on Steam and in English. Due to technical problems, the game was cancelled and FiolaSoft started to work on a new project. Vojta Stránský, a member of the FiolaSoft team, began production of a prototype. The prototype interested other members of FiolaSoft and they began to work on it, naming it Blackhole. Blackhole was announced in March 2014 at Game Expo 2014 in Bratislava. Developers also started a Steam Greenlight campaign, and in May 2014 the game was greenlit. The game was originally scheduled to be released in September 2014, but was delayed several times before being finally released on February 27, 2015. Developers started to work on a DLC after the release of the original game. The first DLC, titled Testing Laboratory, was released on May 19, 2015. It serves as a prequel to the original game and tells the story about how the Coffee Guy gained his position in the Endera mission. Developers released a free expansion, The Secret of the Entity, on July 13, 2015. The expansion adds 12 new hardcore levels set right after the end of the original game when the Captain finds out that Endera is low on fuel. Both add-ons are included as part of Complete Edition. Reception The game has received generally positive reviews from critics. It currently has a rating of 82% at Metacritic. Destructoid gave the game 9/10, praising the gameplay for requiring thinking as well as platform skills. The review also praised the writing, even though \\"it could be delivered in a more convenient fashion.\\"  References  External links * * Category:2015 video games Category:Black holes in fiction Category:GameMaker Studio games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Nanotechnology in fiction Category:Physics in fiction Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Puzzle-platform games Category:Science fiction comedy Category:Science fiction video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Teleportation in fiction Category:Video games about artificial intelligence Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games set in the 22nd century Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Windows games Category:Works set in the 2100s Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Play Anywhere games ","title":"Blackhole (video game)"},{"id":"42786135","text":"Martyn Lee may refer to: * Martyn Lee (broadcaster) (born 1978), British radio broadcaster * Martyn Lee (footballer) (born 1980), English former footballer  See also  * Martin Lee (disambiguation) ","title":"Martyn Lee"},{"id":"42786145","text":"Rachel Wilde (born Rachel Wilson) is a British actress who played Nikki Spraggan in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.

He continued his training in the Pontifical Irish College, Rome from 1974 - 1977 where he was a student at Pontifical Gregorian University earning an STB. He was ordained Deacon on 6 May 1976 in the Pontifical Irish College by Bishop Dominic Joseph Conway of Elphin and ordained a priest on 6 July 1977 for the Archdiocese of Dublin. From 1978 to 1979 he studied at UCD where he earned a Higher Diploma in Education. Priestly Ministry After ordination, until 1983 he was a teacher in the vocational school in Ringsend, Dublin. From 1980 to 1983 he served in the diocesan Secretariat for Education. In 1983 he was appointed University Chaplain. He furthered his studies at University College Dublin, from 1985 to 1987 where he earned an MA in Philosophy. In 1991 he returned to Rome, to undertake a doctorate in philosophy at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum which he completed in 1995, at the same time carrying out the service Spiritual Director at the Irish College. He returned to Ireland and was Parochial Vicar at Foxrock Church from 1995 to 1998, and director of the diocesan, and then national programme for vocations from 1998 to 2006. He was appointed parish priest of Glendalough in 2005, serving until 2009. He was appointed Secretary General of the Preparatory Committee of the 50th International Eucharistic Congress (2008–2012). From 2007-2014, he was the Director for the Formation of Permanent Deacons and secretary of the Commission of the Bishops' Conference on Bioethics (1996). He was also a member of the board of directors of Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Dublin. From 2005 to 2009 he served as a Consultor to the Congregation for Catholic Education. From 2013 until 2014 he was administrator of the Sacred Heart parish, Donnybrook in Dublin. He has published several articles in journals such as The Linacre Quarterly and Studies. In a ceremony at the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Sligo, Bishop-elect Doran said: \\"I must confess to being a little surprised to find myself here this morning. Two weeks ago, we finalised a development plan for the parish, and that was the only plan I had in mind for the foreseeable future. I have learnt over the years, however, that vocation is never static\\". Bishop of Elphin He was ordained as bishop on 13 July 2014 by Bishop Christopher Jones with the Principal Co-Consecrators being Archbishop Michael Neary of Tuam and Archbishop Charles John Brown. In February 2017, the Irish Catholic newspaper announced that Bishop Doran had reached an agreement for a new community of religious sisters to establish a house in his diocese. These are members of the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother congregation, and would settle at Sacred Heart Parish, Roscommon. Controversies =Abortion= In October 2013 he resigned from the board of the Mater Hospital after management confirmed it would comply with the new Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. Following the result of the May 2018 referendum (which resulted in the 8th amendment being repealed). Doran said, \\"What I’d say to a Catholic who voted 'Yes', is this: if you voted 'Yes' knowing and intending that abortion would be the outcome, then you should consider coming to confession,\\" \\"where you will be received with the compassion shown to any other penitent.\\" \\"All sins are ultimately about decisions that impact on our relationship with God.\\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and- beliefs/catholics-who-voted-yes-should-consider-confession-says- bishop-1.3511127 =Views on homosexuality= On 24 February 2015, in advance of the same-sex marriage referendum, Doran said, \\"The reality is that those who wish to change the Constitution are not actually looking for marriage equality. They are looking for a different kind of relationship which would be called marriage; a relationship which includes some elements of marriage, such as love and commitment, but excludes one of the two essential aspects of marriage, which is the openness of their sexual relationship to procreation. This is only possible if we change the meaning of marriage and remove that aspect of openness to procreation.\\" In an interview with NewsTalk Breakfast radio in March 2015, Doran differentiated between marriage and same-sex relationships: \\"One [...] is of its very nature, directed towards the upbringing, the care of children, and one which isn't and they can't be said to be the same.\\" and that some people who have children \\"are not necessarily parents\\". The Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, subsequently described it as \\"an unfortunate phrase\\" and hoped that people were not offended by Doran's comments. Doran later said that he regretted the hurt experienced by people either due to his choice of words or to the manner in which what he said had been subsequently reported. =Views on contraception= In August 2018, at an event commemorating the papal encyclical Humanae Vitae, Doran claimed \\"the fact that [women who use contraception] are less likely to become pregnant also takes away from women one of the principle motives or freedoms for saying no to unwanted sex\\", and stated \\"There is a very direct connection between the contraceptive mentality and the surprisingly high number of people who seem ready to redefine marriage today as a relationship between two people without distinction as to sex.\\" In response, the Minister for Health, Simon Harris, tweeted \\"Please just make it stop! Increasing access to & availability of contraception is and will remain public health policy. Religion plays an important role for many on an individual basis - but it will not determine health and social policy in our country any more. Please get that.\\" References Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:Clergy from Dublin (city) Category:Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas alumni Category:Alumni of Mater Dei Institute of Education Category:Alumni of the Pontifical Irish College Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Pontifical Gregorian University alumni Category:Alumni of Clonliffe College Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Elphin Category:Irish Roman Catholic bishops Category:Post-Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland Category:People educated at C.B.C.

Choir The college awards a number of choral exhibitions every year to incoming students, and these choral exhibitioners make up most of the choir; the choir is also supplemented by a number of volunteers, who are often from other colleges. The choir sing three services per week during term-time, on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Owing to the Precentor's wide-ranging interests the choir sings an eclectic mix of repertoires, and has developed a niche for resurrecting forgotten repertoires: the CD released in June 2014 is of Celtic chant from the 8th to 12th centuries with the virtuoso piper Barnaby Brown, whilst their most recent recording project, which is yet to be released, is of South American choral music. Recordings The Choir releases one or more CDs every year, recently on the Delphian record label. The Choir has recorded several CDs of contemporary composers, such as Judith Weir, Robin Holloway (a fellow of the college), Cheryl Frances-Hoad, and Rodion Shchedrin. Other interesting projects include a reconstruction of the J. S. Bach Mark passion, and a recording with the Choir of King's College, London of Strauss's Deutsche Motette Op. 62 for its centenary.

He is best known as the star of the 2011–2014 Discovery Channel reality series Sons of Guns. He was convicted of sex crimes in April and July 2017, receiving three life sentences, and is currently serving those sentences at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Early life Hayden was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is partly of Choctaw descent. From an early age, he was a firearms enthusiast, and often read about weapons and warfare. Hayden survived a large house fire as a \\"three or four year old\\" child. He stated in a 2011 interview that he remembers, \\"waking up to fire 'eating me up'... burning the bed... the sheets... the room\\". Hayden also stated that he was abused by his father in a piece titled Sons of Guns: Straight-Shootin' Stories from the Star of the Hit Discovery Series. He says in the article, \\"Hell, he put me through a wall with a punch when I was five... From that moment on I realized I had to pick my battles carefully. Very carefully. Any battle I could get up and walk away from was a victory. It didn't matter if me or my psyche looked or felt like it'd been run through a meat grinder. Victory is victory.\\" By age 12, he began building firearms. When he turned 18, he enlisted in the Marines, serving for six years and achieving the rank of sergeant. Career After returning home from the service, Hayden started his own construction and refrigeration business, while working on guns on the side. =Red Jacket Firearms= His side business began to take off, and in 1999, he sold his main business and officially opened Red Jacket Firearms. The name of the company is the translation of his mother's name, Osguma, which means \\"red jacket\\" in Choctaw. The firm's first commercial order was from a large distributor called Manotick Firearms for twenty rifles. From 2011 until 2014, Hayden received nationwide fame when Sons of Guns - a reality TV program focusing on the specialized firearm builds at Red Jacket - aired on Discovery Channel. On August 26, 2014, it was announced that Red Jacket Firearms had received a legal separation as an entity from Hayden. Personal life He resided in the Greenwell Springs area of Central, Louisiana. Hayden's daughter Stephanie and son-in-law Kris Ford also appeared on the show as well as working at Red Jacket. =Juvenile rape conviction= On August 11, 2014, Hayden was arrested and charged with molestation of a juvenile and aggravated crimes against nature. Hayden claimed that the allegations were false and made in retaliation by a vengeful ex- girlfriend, the 12-year-old girl's mother. He was subsequently charged with rape of a child based on the statements of the victim. The charges led to the cancellation of Sons of Guns. Hayden was additionally accused of aggravated rape by his oldest daughter. She told police that she was raped 22 years before when she was 12 by her father, Hayden. She came forward after the allegations were made against Hayden. As a result of this last charge, his bail was raised from $200,000 to $350,000. In January 2015, he pleaded not guilty. In August 2015, the judge relieved Hayden's three private lawyers from the case per the lawyers' request. The lawyers said that confidential conditions for their representation hadn't been met, but that there was \\"no bitterness\\" between them and Hayden. Hayden was represented by a public defender at a later court date. On April 7, 2017, Hayden was convicted of two counts of aggravated rape and one count of forcible rape, of two girls over the course of two decades. On May 11, 2017, Hayden was sentenced to two life sentences (mandatory for aggravated rape), to run concurrently, plus 40 years, to run consecutively, in prison. He is not eligible for any parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and will spend the rest of his life in custody. On July 12, 2017, after pleading no contest to the charges facing him, Hayden was sentenced by Livingston Parish Judge Robert Morrison to a third life sentence for rape. Morrison ordered that the new sentence shall run concurrently with Hayden's previously ordered sentences. Hayden has now been sentenced to three life sentences plus 40 years and was transferred to Louisiana State Penitentiary.

UNESCO 2000.Academic mobility. International Association of Universities. 5 June 2015. Background Students choosing to study abroad (International students) aim to improve their own social and economic status by choosing to study in a nation with better systems of educations than their own. This creates movement of students, usually South to North and East to West.Teichler U. Why Mobility? What We Know and What We Do Not Know. In: International Programme Office for Education and Training (ed.): From Individual Development to Employability. International Programme Office for Education and Training, Stockholm 2001. pp 6 - 20. It is predicted that citizens of Asian nations, particularly India and China, will represent an increasing portion of the global international student population.Böhm A. Global Student Mobility 2025: Analysis of Global Competition and Market Share. IDP Education Pty Ltd, Melbourne 2003. Accessed 2014. The total number of students enrolled in tertiary education abroad (international students) increased from 1.3 million in 1990, to 2 million in 2000, to more than 3 million in 2010 and to 4.3 million in 2011.Bacchus M. Towards a strategy for increasing student mobility between less developed countries in the Commonwealth through third country training. International Journal of Educational Development 1986. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 did not decrease these figures. The formation of academic mobility networks can be explained by changes in systems of education. The governments of some countries allocated funds to improve tertiary education for international students. For some countries, the presence of international students represents an indicator of quality of their education system. International students contribute to the economy of their chosen country of study. In 2011, OECD countries were hosting seventy percent of international students. Within the OECD, almost half of international students were enrolled in one of the top five destinations for tertiary studies. These were United States (17 percent), United Kingdom (13 percent), Australia (6 percent), Germany (6 percent) and France (6 percent). International students prefer to study in English-speaking countries. Popular fields of study are the social sciences, business and law. Thirty percent of international students studied in these fields in 2011.  Function  Academic mobility networks aim to assist students by providing cultural and social diversity, encouraging adaptability and independent thinking, allowing them to improve their knowledge of a foreign language and expand their professional network. By bringing international students, the network can provide educational institutions with a source of revenue and contribute to the nation's economy. For example, in Canada, international student expenditure on tuition, accommodation and living expenses contributed more than CAD (Canadian dollar) 8 billion to the economy in 2010.Education indicators in focus. OECD.org 2013. International students also have a long-term economic effect. Their stay after graduation increases the domestic skilled labor market. In the 2008-2009 year, the rate of staying in OECD countries was 25 percent. In Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, and France, the rate was greater than 30 percent. In 2005, 27 percent of international students from a European Union member state were employed in the UK six months after graduation. In Norway, 18 percent of students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who were studying between 1991 and 2005 stayed in the country; the corresponding number for EEA students was eight percent.Suter B. and Jandl M.

Founded in 1949, the Comité Para regards itself as the originator of the modern skeptical movement. For the events that led up to the formation of the group, see chapter Historique du Comité - Les grands évènements in Comité Para (Ed.) (2005). La science face au défi du paranormal. Brussels: Relie-Art. The group's motto (by Robert Rendu) is Ne rien nier a priori, ne rien affirmer sans preuve (\\"Do not deny anything a priori, do not assert anything without evidence\\"). \\"Comité Para\\" originally stood for Comité Belge pour l'Investigation Scientifique des Phénomènes Réputés Paranormaux (\\"Belgian Committee for Scientific Investigation of Purported Paranormal Phenomena\\") until it adopted its present name on 19 June 2014.  History  Challenging paranormal phenomena began long before the foundation of the Comité Para. For example, in the 19th century the debate raged about spiritism and the existence of spirits. The illusionist Harry Houdini (1874–1926) is seen by skeptics as a debunker of mediums, and therefore regarded as one of the founding fathers of the modern skeptical movement. Discussion to form a committee that would regularly perform experiments with scientific controls to assess extraordinary claims originated in January 1947, after a group of academics was challenged to prove the validity of radiesthesia (the results were negative). The organisation was eventually founded by seventeen members including astronomer Sylvain Arend on 15 January 1949, and officially registered as an association without lucrative purpose on 4 June 1949. It emerged in part as a response to a pressing consumer protection problem in the aftermath of the Second World War: a predatory industry of bogus psychics was selling false hope to the grieving relatives of people who had gone missing during the war. The Comité Para tried to combat clairvoyants, astrologers, dowsers etc. American philosopher Paul Kurtz was inspired by the Comité Para to found the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal in the United States in 1976 after the debate around the Mars effect (that allegedly proved astrological influences). This made that the organised modern skeptical movement became an international one, and also gave a new impulse to scientific skepticism in Belgium. The Comité was formally bilingual, but after a sleeping existence it was revived by almost exclusively French-speaking members, most of them astronomers. When in 1976 teacher Jean-Marie Gantois founded the working group Prometheus within the Dutch-speaking Society for Astronomy (VVS), that besides astrology and ufology also began taking on other pseudosciences during the 1980s, discussion rose whether Prometheus was still compatible with the aims of the VVS. One proposal was to integrate the entire working group into the Comité Para, of which several people already had a membership, but the Comité concluded that founding a separate Dutch-speaking would be a better solution. This gave rise to the Flemish SKEPP as a sister society of the Comité in 1990. Represented by Arlette Fougnies, the Comité Para became a founding member of the European Council of Skeptical Organisations (ECSO) in 1994.  Members  * Jean Champenois is a former spirit medium who became an illusionist and skeptic, in the line of Harry Houdini, James Randi and also Gérard Majax. Currently he organises skeptic conferences in this domain. He uses his talents as a magician to imitate the techniques mediums utilise to convince their audience that they can contact the dead. * Jean Dommanget (1924–2014) was an astronomer and long-time president of the Comité, who took the lead in many astrology and dowsing experiments. * Jacques Van Rillaer is the author of Les Illusions de la Psychanalyse (1980) and co-author Le Livre Noir de la psychanalyse (2005), criticising the theories of Sigmund Freud as pseudoscientific.

Etymology Chippenham Lodge was named by their first owners, the brothers Francis and George Goldney, for their birthplace Chippenham in Wiltshire, England. It is located in Brown's Road, which was named for John Evans Brown, one of the notable owners of Chippenham Lodge. History The Goldney brothers bought of land in St Albans for their Christchurch home in 1862. They were the owners of the Cora Lynn sheep station in the Southern Alps in the upper Waimakariri basin. There is uncertainty whether their town residence was designed by Benjamin Mountfort or Maxwell Bury, but from the stylistic features, the work was more likely undertaken by Mountfort. The substantial brick home had six rooms. George Goldney returned to England and the building was sold to Henry Mytton on 12 September 1865 for £1,400. Later that year, Mytton commissioned a substantial southern extension for the building from Mountfort and Bury, who by then were business partners. This turned Chippenham Lodge into a house with ten rooms. The plainer design suggests that Bury carried out the commission. Mytton was born in 1840 in Garth, Glamorgan, Wales, the son of the judge R. H. Mytton, and he worked in Christchurch as a merchant and commission agent. Mytton's business failed in 1867, his household effects were sold, and he left New Zealand for England on the Mermaid in the following year. The lawyer Thomas Joynt occupied the building for some time before it was sold in 1875 to John Thomas Peacock, who owned the neighbouring Hawkesbury house. Peacock had previously represented the electorate in the House of Representatives, and at the time of the purchase was a member of the Legislative Council and the Canterbury Provincial Council. Peacock transferred the house in the same year to his brother-in-law, John Evans Brown, who moved in with his wife (Peacock's sister) and children. Brown sometimes referred to his home as simply 'The Lodge'. While living there, Brown lost his eldest son aged 16 in February 1877, and four days later, an infant son also died. His wife died at Chippenham aged 42 years in February 1880; all three are buried at Barbadoes Street Cemetery. Brown moved to the nearby Amwell after his wife's death, but the house remained in his estate. Brown remarried in late 1883 and then emigrated to America in August 1884. They went to Asheville in North Carolina, where he died on 9 July 1895. While Brown had lived at Chippenham Lodge, he represented the electorate in the House of Representatives. Walter Joseph Moore bought Chippenham Lodge from the Brown estate in 1902. Moore, who was an accountant and estate agent, undertook some subdivision. In 1924, the property was sold to the surgeon Hugh Acland, who kept subdivided some more land and kept the house until his death in 1961. After Acland, there were two more owners prior to the current owner, the Heartwood Community Incorporated, which bought the house in 1971. This commune was active in social and political issues. Many prominent organisations held their first meeting at Chippenham or were founded there, including HART (Halt All Racist Tours), Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand, and Women's Refuge. Christchurch Women's Refuge, which was started in a house next door to Chippenham Lodge, celebrated its 40th birthday in May 2013. At its peak as a commune, 20 people were living in the building, including Marian Hobbs, who would later become a cabinet minister in the Fifth Labour Government. Chippenham Lodge was significantly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. As it will have to be \\"virtually rebuilt\\" anyway and is hidden at the end of a long drive, the current owners have proposed to relocate it to the edge of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens in Hagley Park to make it accessible to the public. Heritage listing Chippenham Lodge was originally registered as a heritage building by Heritage New Zealand with registration number 1846 classified as C, as shown in the 1988 publication Historic Buildings of Canterbury and South Canterbury. With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category II listing. Following an audit of the heritage register in 2003, there were some deficient registrations identified by the Historic Places Trust that had to go through the registration process again; mostly in cases where a valid board minute could not be found upon audit.See the Linwood House talk page for further detail As such, the date of registration is shown as 25 June 2004 when it had already been listed prior to 1988.

He was one of the first European artists to paint in Sub-Saharan Africa. Life and work Hens (before 1900) Hens was born in Antwerp and began his studies there under Jacob Jacobs at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 1872.Kunst in de wandelgangen, Lannoo, 2006 - . He went to America in 1873, but returned the following year to continue his education at the Academy, where he became friends with Theodoor Verstraete and was influenced by exhibitions of post-impressionist art given by the Cercle Artistique of Antwerp. Although committed to being an artist, his adventurous personality sought other outlets for his creativity, including a stint as an acrobat in a German circus. In 1886, he visited the so-called \\"Congo Free State\\" as part of a brief expedition. Finding himself impressed with the artistic potential of Africa, he made another trip there from 1887 to 1888 at his own expense, having been unable to find sponsors. He travelled throughout the Bas-Congo, then sailed up the Congo River to what is now Équateur Province, painting landscapes along the way. Upon his return to Belgium, he held several successful exhibitions, but was later ignored at the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894). Following this snub, he joined with Eugène Broerman to produce a diorama that would be displayed in a pavilion devoted to the Congo (currently the Royal Museum for Central Africa) at the Brussels International (1897), founding the Société de nom collectif Hens et Broerman for that purpose. The project was never fully realized. Ironically, many of his works are now part of the permanent collection at the museum. He was a member of several artists' associations, including Pour l'Art and Weest U Zelve (Be Yourself) and was a founding member of De XIII and Kunst van Heden (Art of Today). From 1919 to 1923, he was a teacher at the Royal Academy. Despite the prominence given to his African paintings, most of his work was focused on the Belgian coast, with ships as a recurring theme. He died in his native city of Antwerp, aged 71.

Plot  Having killed in a duel yet again, \\"The Fastest Sword of the South\\" Ding Menghao is challenged to a duel by an 80 year old monk armed with only a long smoking pipe. If Ding wins the monk will be his servant for three years and if the monk wins Ding has to do what the monk says for three years. The monk wins with a single blow and Ding follows him to his otherwise empty temple. He spends six months meditating before he complains, is then told to copy all the scriptures in a room which he pretends to have finished, then he is then given a hammer and told to make whatever he wants out of a large boulder of granite at the temple gate. The monk says he will return in six months. When he returns the monk says the larger than life size seated statue of Budai is too large and make it smaller and he will return in six months. When he returns there is a smaller statue but he again says too large and he will return in six months. He returns again and finds a smaller statue with which he is pleased. Ding immediately prepares to leave as the three years are up and the monk in parting tells Ding that he must die before he can live. Ding takes up residence in a sword school. He refuses duels and tries to befriend his attackers but still there are thirteen fights ending in death. Then an eighteen year old also attacks Ding while Ding is drinking in a shop. Ding walks away, telling the youth to leave but the youth follows Ding and attacks him again, running onto the edge of Ding's only partly drawn sword and dying. Ding is asked to leave by the school's master. Ding takes up residence in a small village, assumes the name of Zhang, works for another man as a mason/statue carver and is considered odd because he was seen with a fine sword when he arrived and never socialises. After one month bandits attack. Every house and shop in town is damaged except for the masonry, the leader of the attack having taken one look at \\"Zhang\\" and left quietly. Rumours start that \\"Zhang\\" is in league with them and he prepares to leave but is summoned by the village leader and asked to work on a monument. \\"Zhang\\" agrees and is investigated by the leader's daughter Liu Qing, who becomes smitten with him. The father of the eighteen year old arrives with his sword fighting students and demands that Ding be handed over for revenge. Ding refuses to fight and is whipped by the father. His arm is about to be chopped off when a stranger intercepts the blade and kills all the students. The stranger says he was almost fooled into not discovering \\"Zhang's\\" identity as Ding Menghao and challenges him to a duel, revealing himself as Qiu Yixing, The Fastest Sword of the North. Ding refuses. The leader of the bandit raid reports to his leader, Flying Centipede, the sighting of someone who may be Ding resurfaced after three years. They attack again and Ding has to draw his sword and help. With the bandits despatched, Qiu arrives and insists upon the duel in a temple. Again Ding refuses. Liu Qing has been kidnapped and Qiu denies involvement but says he knows how to find her and will tell Ding if he agrees to fight. Ding reluctantly agrees. Qiu takes him to the kidnapper White Snake, who thought Ding had killed his brother Black Snake, and Qiu reveals he killed Black Snake before killing White Snake. Liu Qing is saved. Ding meets Qiu in the temple but refuses to draw his sword despite being attacked by Qiu. When he finally agrees to show his sword he reveals that in his commitment to not fighting he has broken it. Qiu breaks his sword to balance the match. Remembering the monk's words Ding draws the fighter into a smaller space where he is knocked down as Qiu prepares his final thrust. The next day a rider arrives to challenge Ding but is told that he is too late and is directed to the funeral of the two Fastest Swords who killed each other. At the funeral Liu Qing talks to Ding, revealing her father's plan to have a fake funeral for him after killing Qiu so that he can now live in peace.  Reception  The final duel is considered a cinematic masterpiece. Lead actor Liu Ping provided a good performance but due to a lack of big name director or actors the film remains rather uncelebrated. The fight choreography is used as an example of how to include meaningful motivation and development in the skills of a character who fights in a film.Fight Choreography: The Art of Non-Verbal Dialogue, John Kreng, Cengage Learning PTR, 2007, page 302  References  External links * * The Fastest Sword at Hong Kong Movie Database Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films ","title":"The Fastest Sword"},{"id":"42786975","text":"Belluno Cathedral: west front and campanile Belluno Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic cathedral in the historic centre of the city of Belluno, Veneto, Italy, dedicated to Saint Martin. It is the episcopal seat of the diocese of Belluno-Feltre. It was elevated to the status of a minor basilica on 18 June 1980 by Pope John Paul II. Construction The present cathedral stands on the site of a palaeo-Christian church. A subsequent church dedicated to Saint Martin and built in around in 850 is documented. The present building was built between 1517 and 1624, to plans by the architect Tullio Lombardo, in the style of the Renaissance. The cupola was completed only in 1756. The campanile dates from the 18th century and is by Filippo Juvarra. Description =Exterior= Engraving of the cathedral and the Piazza del duomo in 1750, by Tommaso Salmon The unfinished west front is of stone, divided vertically into three, between two lower wings. The lower part contains a rich Baroque portal and two Gothic windows, while the upper part, terminating in a tympanum which rests on an entablature delineated by lesene, contains a central rose window, the glass of which depicts figures of Saint Gioatà, Saint Lucanus and Saint Martin. =Interior= The interior of the cathedral, majestic in appearance, has Renaissance lines even if the height of the pilasters tends more to the Gothic. There are three naves of six spans. The presbytery has triple rows of stalls. The cupola is airy and light. The semi-circular apse contains a fresco by Antonio Ermolao Paoletti of a triumphal Assumption. Among the works by distinguished artists kept in the cathedral, two paintings by Gaspare Diziani stand out for the complexity of their composition: Saints Charles Borromeo, Francis de Sales, Cajetan and Andrew Avellino and the Conversion of St Paul. An altar in the northern nave is decorated by a painting by Egidio Dall'Oglio depicting the Holy Family. The organ, dating from 1946, is by Mascioni. Interior =Campanile= The Baroque campanile, built between 1732 and 1743, stands at the exit from the sacristy. It was designed by the Messinese architect Filippo Juvarra. Including the angel on the top it is 67.35 metres high. The angel, of wood covered in copper, by Andrea Brustolon, is 4.63 metres high.

(2008 A.D.) with the charter granted by the Parliament of Nepal. The stated aim of the PAHS is to work in close partnership with the national health system to improve the health care services in the remote/rural areas primarily through producing technically competent and socially responsible health care workers. Currently PAHS has been running School of Medicine and School of Nursing and aims to run School of Public Health in near future. PAHS MBBS curriculum focuses on holistic care of individual and community. PAHS preferentially enrolls students from rural areas and trains them in curriculum that emphasizes on community health and is subsequently provides support for its graduates who work in the rural areas. History PAHS was established in 2064 B.S. (2008 A.D.) with the charter granted by the Parliament of Nepal. by an Act. PAHS has its own constitution passed by the parliament of Nepal, under the name Patan Academy of Health Sciences Act, 2008. Academics PAHS has MBBS course duration of 6 years unlike rest of the universities in Nepal.https://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/patan/en/ PAHS also has international tie up for the clinical placement such as The University of Sydney. It has also started its own School of Nursing, which runs nursing programs of all levels including PCL, BN, BSc Nursing and Masters in Nursing. It also run its own School of Public Health, and post graduate course in clinical sciences. =Curriculum Design= PAHS is implementing a highly progressive curriculum, modeled after modern curricula used by a growing number of Western medical schools. The curriculum at PAHS focuses on community health, the values of service and altruism, and the health of the entire population, to enhance students’ sensitivity to the health care needs of the rural poor. =Students Selection= Students from rural areas are strongly encouraged to apply to and enroll in PAHS with a view to increase the likelihood of PAHS graduates practicing in remote areas. Preference is given to female applicants, members of socially disadvantaged groups, and applicants who have been employed as paramedics in remote regions. =Locations for Clinical Training= To supplement the core training in Patan Hospital, PAHS students are assigned to clinical postings at rural hospitals and health care centers throughout the diverse ethnic landscape of Nepal, with an emphasis on regions with disadvantaged populations. Students begin these rotations in their first year at PAHS and continue them throughout their medical education. Students’ experiences at these community postings will reinforce the principles of social responsibility and compassion that the PAHS curriculum is designed to instill in them. At the remote postings, students live with local villagers and learn to overcome the apprehensions associated with working with limited resources in unfamiliar cultures. The hospitals and health care centers where students complete these rotations are carefully chosen to ensure that students have positive learning experiences. PAHS faculty and staff give the students careful guidance and moral support, in addition to providing them with practical knowledge.

Set against the backdrop of the Battle of Singapore in World War II, the film is nearly wordless. Plot In 1942, war between the Allies and the Japanese rages in the jungles of Singapore. Jim (Khan Chittenden), a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Australian Air Force, awakens to find himself hanging from a tree by his parachute, shot down in action. Disentangling himself he realises that he has lost his pistol, his only form of defence but manages to salvage his survival gear and sets off into the jungle, narrowly avoiding a Japanese patrol. Making his way through mud, swamp and a field full of Japanese propaganda leaflets, he eventually runs into Chinese guerrilla fighter Seng (Morning Mo Tzu-Yi) who has also been separated from his unit behind enemy lines. They have another close encounter with a Japanese patrol and elect to set off together to aid each other in reaching friendly territory, despite not being able to speak the other's language. Early on in their travels Seng is aggrieved to find the body of a comrade he was close to. They are briefly separated when Jim is left to contemplate the scene but he is alerted to Seng's location by the sound of gunfire. Jim is forced to rush to Seng's aid as the guerrilla collapses from a gunshot sustained to the abdomen, the Australian being forced to perform emergency surgery to retrieve the bullet with only bare hands and his sparse survival kit while simultaneously having to keep Seng silent to avoid the attention of the Japanese patrol. The following night, flashbacks of his 36 hours in the jungle are interrupted as Seng wakes Jim to alert him to another Japanese patrol walking right by them, before the pair are briefly forced to fight off venomous insects from the tree which they had been sleeping under. As they settle back under the tree for the night, Seng shows Jim a photo of his family, causing Jim to drift into a reverie remembering his own wife back home. Jim awakes from his memories to find it is the next morning. He and Seng share a moment together in which they finally learn each other's names before Japanese soldiers find and separate them. As Seng is killed in cold blood by the patrol's officer, troops drag Jim away to a truck and he is driven off to the Japanese base. He watches helplessly out of the back of the truck, knowing that his bid for freedom has finally failed. A time skip then shows Jim back home in Australia, with Seng's family photo in a frame on his cupboard.

Biography  Kaltenbach was born in Germany but immigrated to the United States at the age of one or two. Most of his childhood was taken up by helping work on his family's farm. He joined the 12th Iowa Infantry near the start of the Civil War in 1861. On April 6, 1862, during the Battle of Shiloh, Kaltenbach was shot in the right hand. The injury gave him two crooked fingers that would continue to pain him throughout his life. Kaltenbach was captured by Confederate forces the same day he was injured. However, he returned to active service with his unit after being paroled by his Confederate captors.  Battle of Nashville  During the Battle of Nashville Kaltenbach and the 12th Iowa Infantry attacked entrenched Confederate positions. On December 16, 1864, Kaltenbach participated in a final charge against several Confederate regiments. During the attack, the color bearer of the 44th Mississippi Infantry was incapacitated. Kaltenbach advanced ahead of his unit over Confederate barricades and captured the regiment's flag. Two days after the battle, a special field order was given to allow Kaltenbach and sixteen other soldiers who had captured enemy flags during the Battle of Nashville and the Battle of Franklin to journey to Washington, D.C.. While there, they presented flags they had captured from Confederate forces to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. All of the soldiers were granted furlough for a month, pay, and the Medal of Honor for their actions.  Official Citation   Later life  In 1868, Kaltenbach attempted to find a warmer climate to lessen the pain caused by the hand wound he received during the Battle of Shiloh. He moved to Colorado, then Utah, then California and lastly into Mexico. He moved to the state of Washington in 1878 following a stroke so he could be cared for by his brother. Several years later, he moved to Arizona where he worked as a Justice of the Peace. In 1892, Kaltenbach started to receive a disability pension of two dollars a month, and would later receive an extra ten dollars month for receiving the Medal of Honor. In 1903, he moved to California again. In 1905, Kaltenbach was granted a pension of twenty-four dollars a month by an Act of Congress. He married May Wardlow in 1907, but they divorced several years later. Kaltenbach died in 1922 after being hit by a car.

It is a small, bright-green parrot with a greyish breast and greenish-yellow abdomen. Its average lifespan is 20–30 years. It originates from the temperate to subtropical areas of Argentina and the surrounding countries in South America. Self-sustaining feral populations occur in many places, mainly in North America and Europe. Taxonomy The monk parakeet was described by the French polymath Georges- Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François- Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name, but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Psittacus monachus in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. As Buffon did not specify the origin of his specimen, in 1937 the American ornithologist James Peters assigned the type location as Montevideo, Uruguay. The monk parakeet is now placed in the genus Myiopsitta that was introduced by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek mus, muos meaning \\"mouse\\" and the New Latin psitta meaning \\"parrot\\", alluding to the mouse-grey face and underparts. The specific epithet monachus is Late Latin for a \\"monk\\". The monk parakeet is one of two species in the genus Myiopsitta, the other being the cliff parakeet (Myiopsitta luchsi). The two parakeets were previously considered to be a single species. However, due to morphological and behavioral differences, as well as dissimilarities geographically, the cliff parakeet has been elevated to species status. The cliff parakeet's altitudinal range apparently does not overlap, so is thus entirely, but just barely, allopatric. The American Ornithological Society has deferred recognizing the cliff parakeet as distinct \\"because of insufficient published data\\". Three subspecies are recognized: * M. m. monachus (Boddaert, 1783) – Argentina from southeastern Santiago del Estero Province throughout the Río Salado and lower Paraná basins to Buenos Aires Province and Uruguay :The largest subspecies * M. m. calita (Boddaert, 1783) – Andean foothills up to 1,000 m ASL, from southeastern Bolivia (Santa Cruz and Tarija departments) to Paraguay and northwestern Argentina, then west of the range of monachus, extending into the lowlands again in Río Negro and possibly Chubut provinces. :Smaller than monachus, wings more prominently blue, gray of head darker. * M. m. cotorra (Finsch, 1868) – southwestern Brazil (Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, possibly Rio Grande do Sul) (electronic supplement , PDF) throughout the Río Paraguay and middle Paraná basins as well as the Gran Chaco. : Essentially identical to calita but reported as less yellow below and brighter overall. The subspecies' ranges meet in the general area of Paraguay, and there they are insufficiently delimited. The distinctness and delimitation of M. m. calita and M. m. cotorra especially require further study. Like the other neotropical parrots, the monk parakeet is usually placed in the tribe Arini, which might warrant elevation to subfamily rank as the Arinae. M. monachus belongs to the long-tailed clade of these – macaws and conures, essentially, which would retain the name Arini/Arinae if this polyphyletic group were split. Description Female pet monk parakeet The nominate subspecies of this parakeet is long on average, with a wingspan, and weighs . Females tend to be 10–20% smaller, but can only be reliably sexed by DNA or feather testing. It has bright-green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale gray with darker scalloping and the rest of the underparts are very light-green to yellow. The remiges are dark blue, and the tail is long and tapering. The bill is orange. The call is a loud and throaty chape(-yee) or quak quaki quak-wi quarr, and screeches skveet. Domestic breeds in colors other than the natural plumage have been produced. These include birds with white, blue, and yellow in place of green. As such coloration provides less camouflage, feral birds are usually of wild-type coloration. Behaviour and ecology Nests in Zaragoza, Spain Birds and their nest in Santiago, Chile The monk parakeet is the only parrot that builds a stick nest, in a tree or on a man-made structure, rather than using a hole in a tree. This gregarious species often breeds colonially, building a single large nest with separate entrances for each pair. In the wild, the colonies can become quite large, with pairs occupying separate \\"apartments\\" in nests that can reach the size of a small automobile. These nests can attract many other tenants including birds of prey such as the spot-winged falconet (Spiziapteryx circumcincta), ducks such as the yellow-billed teal (Anas flavirostris), and even mammals. Their five to 12 white eggs hatch in about 24 days. Unusually for a parrot, monk parakeet pairs occasionally have helper individuals, often grown offspring, which assist with feeding the young (see kin selection). The lifespan of monk parakeets has been given as 15–20 years or as much as 25–30 years; the former might refer to typical lifespans in captivity and/or in the wild, while the latter is in the range of maximum lifespans recorded for parakeets.  Distribution  The monk parakeet is globally very common. In Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, monk parakeets are regarded as major agricultural pests (as noted by Charles Darwin, among others). Their population explosion in South American rural areas seems to be associated with the expansion of eucalyptus forestry for paper pulp production, which offers the bird the opportunity to build protected nests in artificial forests where ecological competition from other species is limited. =As an introduced species= Monk parakeets in Parc de la Ciutadella of Barcelona, Spain Self-sustaining feral populations have been recorded in several U.S. states and various regions of Europe (namely Spain, Portugal, Azores, Madeira, Balearic Islands, Gibraltar, France, Corsica, Malta, Cyprus, Sardinia, Italy, Greece, Channel Islands, Great Britain, Ireland, and Belgium), as well as in British Columbia, Canada,List of birds of British Columbia Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Israel, Bermuda, Bahamas, the United States, Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Easter Island, South Korea, and Japan. As it is an open-woodlands species, it adapts readily to urban areas. In areas where they have been introduced, some fear they will harm crops and native species, while others dispute evidence of harm caused by feral colonies, and oppose exterminating these birds. However, local bans and eradication programs exist in some areas of the U.S. Outside the U.S., introduced populations do not appear to raise similar controversy, presumably because of smaller numbers of birds, or because their settlement in urban areas does not pose a threat to agricultural production. The U.K. appears to have changed its view on its feral populations and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is planning to remove monk parakeets from the wild, as it believes that they threaten local wildlife and crops. Feral populations are often descended from very small founder populations. Being as social and intelligent as they are, monk parakeets develop some cultural traditions, namely vocal dialects that differ between groups. In populations descended from a large number of birds, a range of \\"dialects\\" will exist. If the founder population is small, however, a process similar to genetic drift may occur if prominent founders vocalize in an unusual \\"dialect\\", with this particular way of vocalizing becoming established in the resulting feral colony. For example, no fewer than three different \\"dialects\\" occur among the feral monk parrots of the Milford, Connecticut, metropolitan area. Brazil The species has in recent years expanded its range in Brazil, where a self-sustaining population occurs in the downtown area of Rio de Janeiro. Since this population occurs far from the bird's original range in Brazil – it was only found in the far south and southwest – it is most probably a consequence of escapees from the pet trade. In Rio de Janeiro, the bird can be easily seen at the Aterro do Flamengo gardens – where it nests on palm trees and feeds on their fruit; the Rio birds seem to favor nesting amid the leaves of coconut palm trees, as well as in the vicinity of the neighboring domestic flight terminal, the Santos Dumont Airport and in the gardens of Quinta da Boa Vista, where communal nests roughly 1 m in diameter have been seen. In Santa Catarina State, probable escapees have been reported on occasion for quite some time, and a feral population seems to have established itself in Florianópolis early in the first decade of the 21st century when birds were observed feeding right next to the highway in the Rio Vermelho-Vargem Grande area. Mexico Monk parakeets in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua, México. The monk parakeet was first recorded in Mexico City in 1999. Records exist from seven other locations, including the cities of Puebla, Morelia, Celaya, Oaxaca, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Hermosillo, and Mexicali, and the mouth of the Loreto River in Baja California Sur. Nesting populations are known in Mexico City and Oaxaca. A small but growing population has also been established in the southern part of the city of Puebla, Puebla, in the surroundings of the city's aviary, which they are known to visit frequently, and where they can often be seen clinging to the outer side of its mesh walls. No studies have been made to assess the impact they might have on the relict populations of green parakeet that live in the same area and other well-wooded zones of the city. Following the ban on the trade of native parrot species, local traditional bird sellers have now switched to the monk parakeet as their staple parrot, and that might have increased the number of escapees. Sometimes, the head and breast feathers of monk parakeets are dyed yellow to deceive uninformed buyers, mimicking the endangered yellow-headed amazon. The presence of this species in seven geographically distant and independent locations in Mexico indicates that the source of these individuals is most likely the pet trade. United States Thousands of monk parakeets were imported to the United States between the 1960s and the 1980s as pets. Many escaped or were intentionally released, and populations were allowed to proliferate. By the early 1970s, M. monachus was established in seven states, and by 1995, it had spread to eight more. In Florida alone, estimates range from 150,000 to 500,000. As one of the few temperate-zone parrots, the monk parakeet is more able than most to survive cold climates (partly because they build communal nests about heat- producing electrical equipment atop utility poles), and colonies exist as far north as New York City, Chicago, Dallas, Austin, Wisconsin, Cincinnati, Louisville, coastal Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southwestern Washington. Edgewater, New Jersey has had a colony since 1980.https://www.nj.com/bergen/2019/12/wild-parrots-escaped-into-this-nj- town-30-years-ago-and-they-never-left.html This hardiness makes this species second only to the rose-ringed parakeet among parrots as a successful introduced species. In 2012, a pair of monk parakeets attempted nesting in Watervliet, New York (about north of New York City, near Albany, New York). Prior to egg-laying, one bird was captured and the nest eventually was removed due to concerns that the nest built adjacent to an electrical transformer created a fire hazard. They have also found a home in Brooklyn, New York, after an accidental release decades ago of what appear to have been black- market birds within Green-Wood Cemetery. The grounds crew initially tried to destroy the unsightly nests at the entrance gate, but no longer do so because the presence of the parrots has reduced the number of pigeons nesting within it. The management's decision was based on a comparative chemical analysis of pigeon feces (which destroy brownstone structures) and monk parakeet feces (which have no ill effect). The monk parakeets are in effect preserving this historic structure. Brooklyn College has a monk parakeet as an \\"unofficial\\" mascot in reference to the colony of the species that lives in its campus grounds. It is featured on the masthead of the student magazine. They have also made their homes in the lamp posts in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Most of these monk parakeet populations can be traced to shipments of captured birds from Argentina. In Chicago, parrot origin theories include a University of Chicago experiment gone awry, an overturned truck on its way to a pet store, escaped birds from a holding pen at O'Hare Airport or discarded/escaped pets. According to University of Chicago ornithologist Dr. Stephen Pruett- Jones, \\"They got here through the pet trade and the pet trade really peaked in the mid to late 1960s.\\" The first documented parrot nest in Chicago dates to 1973. The species continues to thrive despite several unusually harsh winters that occurred during the 1980s and in 2014. Various attempts to remove them were made over the years, most of which were resisted by a group of Hyde Park residents, including Mayor Harold Washington. The birds are generally welcomed in the city, especially by bird watchers, and were the subject of a 2012 ornithological study. The population is estimated to be at 1,000 birds, with healthy colonies located in several of the city's parks. Austin, Texas and Houston, Texas also have thriving monk parakeet populations.

They were first seen around 1975. In Madrid, they especially frequent the Ciudad Universitaria (Complutense university campus) and Casa de Campo park. They are a common sight in Barcelona parks, often as numerous as pigeons. They form substantial colonies in Parc de la Ciutadella, Parc de la Barceloneta, and in smaller city parks such as Jardins Josep Trueta in Poble Nou, with a colony as far north as Empuriabrava. They are more frequent in watered urban parks with grass areas and palm trees, near to a river or the sea. The monk parakeet, as an invasive species, has become a problem to local fauna such as pigeons and sparrows, but not yet so harmful to magpies. Parakeets have also caused trouble to agriculture near the cities. Spain has outlawed the possession, selling, breeding and trafficking of monk parakeets since 2013. Madrid has the greatest population of monk parakeets in Europe with 10,800 parakeets as of June 2015. As of 2015, the estimated population of monk parakeets in Barcelona was 6,248. In Greece, they have established breeding colonies in the National Garden, Athens.A real urban \\"jungle\\" at Greekbirding. The United Kingdom population in 2011 is believed to be around 150, in the Home Counties region. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced plans in 2011 to control them, countering the threat to infrastructure, crops, and native British wildlife by trapping and rehoming, removing nests, and shooting when necessary. Groups of monk parakeets can be found in the Belgian capital city Brussels and its surrounding areas. They have been living in the wild at least since the 1970s.  As pets  Monk parakeets are highly intelligent, social birds. Those kept as pets routinely develop vocabularies of scores of words and phrases. Due to this early speaking ability, it is overtaking the cockatiel as the favorite bird to teach to talk. Another contributing factor to growing popularity is that this bird has a shorter lifespan and lower price than African grey parrots. Because of monk parakeets' listing as an agricultural pest, the U.S. states of California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wyoming, as well as Western Australia outlaw sale and ownership. In Connecticut, one can own a monk parakeet, but cannot sell or breed them. In New York and Virginia, one can own a monk parakeet with banding and registration. In Ohio, owning one is legal if the bird's flight feathers are clipped or it is incapable of free flight.

Description The lake has a north–south orientation and is accessible via Manitoba Highway 10. There is a seasonal cottage community on the south end, many cottages on the Big Island and scattered cottages elsewhere on the lake. The lake drains into Schist Lake via Big Island Creek, part of the Nelson River watershed. The lake is surrounded by Precambrian boreal forest, a mixed forest of coniferous and deciduous trees of the Canadian Shield. The area is a favourite location for hunters who can find large game such as moose, black bear, white tailed deer, woodland caribou, as well as many species of waterfowl. Fish species include northern pike, walleye, burbot, whitefish and lake trout. Etymology Big Island's name comes from the large island which dominates the lake. The name was officially registered in 1999. Prior to that, the traditional Cree name of nearby Schist Lake (Manistikwan which means \\"Devil's Head\\") was applied to Big Island Lake.

It is held each year on 18 May, the date on which the civil war ended in 2009, and is named after Mullivaikkal, a village on the north-east coast of Sri Lanka which was the scene of the final battle of the civil war. Background Labour Party MP Charles Chauvel lighting a candle on Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day 2010 in Wellington, New Zealand Uthayan staff donating blood on Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day 2013 in Jaffna, Sri Lanka Between 1983 and 2009 Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups led by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fought against the Sri Lankan state to create an independent state of Tamil Eelam in the north and east of Sri Lanka. By 2007 the civil war had cost an estimated 70,000 lives. The final months of the civil war in late 2008/early 2009 witnessed particularly brutal fighting between the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE. Around 300,000 civilians were trapped between the two sides. The civil war ended on 18 May 2009 with the killing of Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the LTTE. A United Nations report found that as many as 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war, mostly as a result of indiscriminate shelling by the Sri Lankan military. There are widespread allegations that both sides committed atrocities and human rights violations including war crimes. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is currently investigating the alleged war crimes. Commemoration banned The Sri Lankan government, which has declared 18 May as Victory Day, celebrates the day with military parades. The day is also a commemoration for dead military personnel who are treated as \\"war heroes\\". However, there is no official commemoration for the thousands of Tamil civilians killed in the civil war despite the government's own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission recommending that all the war's dead be commemorated on National Day (4 February). Instead, the government has virtually banned Tamils from commemorating their war dead. In the run up to 18 May security is tightened in the Tamil dominated Northern and Eastern provinces and schools and universities are closed to prevent any public commemoration. The government and its security forces regard any commemoration by Tamils to be commemoration of the LTTE, not civilians. The security forces claim that Tamils may commemorate dead LTTE members in private but there have been reports of the military entering homes to prevent commemoration. Remembrance day Despite the security restrictions Tamils in Sri Lanka hold small events on 18 May, which they call Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day, to commemorate their dead. However, public commemorations are dealt harshly by the Sri Lankan security forces. Tamil politicians have been arrested for commemorating Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day. In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a number of political parties, youth organizations, social movement groups etc. engage themselves in organizing a number of remembrance events across the state.

It is considered a distinct species by some authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union. Others, including the American Ornithological Society, consider to be a subspecies of northern pygmy owl. If considered conspecific, the scientific name G. gnoma is usurped by the northern pygmy owl. The Northern Mountain Pygmy Owls’ habitats range from coniferous forests to deciduous bottomlands, and despite its large geographic distribution, “it is one of the least studied owls on the continent” (Holt & Peterson 2000). Its diet consists of small birds and mammals, and it has a reputation of being a fierce hunter. This species of owl will nest in natural cavities and in ones created by woodpeckers (Holt & Peterson 2000). In a study conducting research on Northern Mountain Pygmy Owls preferred habitats in the Rocky Mountains, it was discovered to prefer large diverse forests with trees near a stream because it offered protection from predators and camouflage for ambush attacks (Jageman et. al. 2018).

A member of the USSR Union of Artists (1975)  Biography and professional activity  In 1956 Nikolai Markarov graduated from the Baku Art School. Then he enrolled and graduated from the Moscow State Academic Art Institute named after V.I. Surikov, being qualified as a sculptor - artist and continued to live and work in Moscow. From 1963 to 1965 Nikolai worked as a sculptor in a sculptural production factory of RSFSR. In 1965 Nikolai Markarov was invited to Moscow Architectural Institute (State Academy) – MarchI first as a teacher at the Department of the figure, and then as a sculptor, where he was working for over 13 years. In 1975 N. Markarov was admitted to the USSR Union of Artists on the recommendation of members of the Union of artists - sculptors A. Stemkovsky, D. Shakhovsky and N. Lavinsky, who believed that N. Markarov entered the list of the thirty best sculptors of the USSR. Besides the main work of the sculptor -artist N. Markarov illustrated books, wrote poetry and prose. Lev Feodorovich Dyakonitsyn, Academician of the Russian Academy of Arts, the European Academy of Arts and Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences and Arts, the artist and art critic, at the opening ceremony of N. Markarov’s exhibition at the Art Gallery Dresden in autumn 2013 said: Nikolai Markarov managed to find in his work such a hand movement, a line that would talk about the nature of a man and of the divinity of a man. We are captivated by so soft, friendly, love game of the artist with paper space. It's a very rare, just exceptional phenomenon. Nowadays such masters are few. I think that he will be recalled very often. His wealth of nature is not confined only to graphics. Nikolai Markarov was also a theater artist and a poet, and an illustrator of many books, including his own ones. He was gifted by nature and did not know restraints in his imagination, and this fantasy is a kind of discovery of the world for us. The main theme of Nikolai Markarov is the image of beauty, the image of a woman, his companion or just the one met by his enamored eye, a caught character, and he immediately embodies them with simple means. Nikolai Markarov seems to catch a glimpse of a face in a crowd; he grabs beautiful faces and wants to remember them, as found little treasures. Sometimes these images are pinched out, the line is so solid, being the formula of the character, and the other vice versa are very lazy, very naughty. It is this combination of confidence and freedom that is particularly interesting, because the artist was coming from one method to another and was not afraid to experiment. Nikolai Markarov has left wonderful heritage for us. The artist remains alive for us, a living master, who tells us that we need to endure routine and everyday life philosophically patiently and even heroically and try to rise above it. Nikolai Markarov entered a cohort of selected artists, who knew how and what to say.

And there was in his bosom A small round mirror without a rim. And now and then When it was light for him like a day He took his glass, Mapped sweat and dust off And cleaned until It became bright, As bright as the sky. And the sky was clean in it Like a glass. And not looking into it He put it again in his bosom And went on going. ABOUT AN ARM-CHAIR I ordered an arm-chair. But in good time It wasn’t ready. And when it was ready The lacquer didn’t stick. When it stopped sticking, Lost its luster. And I went to the wood, Where a stump waited. All I needed was To flick the bug off To seat myself on the stump.

Early life Dan Panosian was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to artistic parents.. He is of Armenian descent Career =Comics= At age 14, Panosian sent an art submission to Marvel Comics, which responded with encouragement. Years later he showcased his work at the New York Comic Convention, where noted comic book artists Neal Adams and Walt Simonson took notice. Adams offered him a position at his ad agency Continuity Graphics and Simonson called his editor, Ralph Macchio, at Marvel Comics. Panosian was soon working for both companies. Upon entering the Marvel offices for the first time he was greeted by the same Submissions Editor, Len Kaminski, who had corresponded with the young Panosian years earlier. On his office wall was a \\"thank you\\" illustration from the 14-year- old Dan Panosian. After working on back-up features for Captain America, Batman, Spider-Man and Thor, Panosian's work caught the eye of the artistic teams working on the X-Men line of comic books where he became a regular inker. When Marvel's top artistic talents left to form Image Comics he was asked to join them and began illustrating comics that often sold close to a million copies each month, sometimes more. Panosian has also done work for Dark Horse Comics, Boom! Studios, and Dynamite Entertainment. He also illustrates a series of graphic novels for Le Lombard/Dargaud called John Tiffany. Being a descendant of survivors from the Armenian Genocide, Panosian also contributed to a graphic novel about the Armenian genocide called Operation Nemesis: A Story of Genocide & Revenge =Advertising, film and game design= Panosian founded Dan Panosian, Inc., through which he began doing advertising work. He was soon also working with movie and commercial studios providing design and storyboard artwork. Panosian also branched out into book and magazine illustration, apparel lines, and toy design work. He was the lead designer on a DreamWorks video game about animals that embody the spirit of Kung-Fu. The game caught the attention of Steven Spielberg and became the springboard for the blockbuster movie, Kung-Fu Panda. Shortly after, Dan was doing the lead design work for the best-selling video game, Duke Nukem. Panosian illustrated one of Byron Preiss’s first CD-ROM comic books, The Suit. In 2006, Teshkeel Media Group contacted Panosian to design the first original characters for the controversial comic book, The 99, created by Dr Naif Al-Mutawa. The first of five planned 99-based theme parks opened in Kuwait in March 2009. An animated series has been produced and Teshkeel signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Endemol to produce the series. He made the fake comic book covers seen in the film Logan, as Marvel Comics did not allow to use actual comic book issues. Personal life Panosian, his wife and their son live in Los Angeles. Panosian is of Armenian descent Awards Best-of-Show Addy Award for his work on the DSL ad campaign: Jack Flash. In 2011, Panosian was the Keynote Speaker for the 2011 Inkwell Awards Awards Ceremony at HeroesCon.

The lake is well known for its sport fishing and has held three world records to date. In 1937, Leone Grayson caught a world record Lake Trout off Gull Island, a feat recorded in a memorial cairn at the Bakers Narrows Campground. History Cha Chay Pay Way Ti’s Map showing Lake Athapap (1806)The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological digs at Bakers Narrows revealed pottery, arrowheads, and other artifacts which were at least 2,500 years old and indicated regular habitation by the \\"Shield Archaic Culture\\", who hunted caribou in the area as far back as 7000 years ago. They were eventually supplanted by the Woodland Cree who were nomadic hunters in this region. The site of Cranberry Portage has been the primary route linking the Grass River and Saskatchewan River watersheds for at least 2,000 years. Many of the most important explorers in Canadian history travelled through Lake Athapapuskow. In 1763, Hudson's Bay Company explorers Joseph Smith and Isaac Batt, guided by Cree leader Meesinkeeshick, became the first European recorded to visit Lake Athapapuskow; Smith died on the return journey to York Factory. Ten years later, the Governor of Churchill sent the fur trader Joseph Hansom, also guided by Cree, inland to extend the reach of the HBC. He paddled from Lake Kississing down the Pineroot River, reaching Lake Athapapuskow. In 1774 the explorer Samuel Hearne with 2 Englishmen, 6 native guides, and 5 canoes, laden with \\"180 lbs. Brazil Tobacco, 130 lbs. Powder, 100 wt. of Shott & Ball, 6 Gallns Brandy and some other trifling articles of Trading goods\\" paddled up the Grass River to Cranberry Portage and into Lake Athapapuskow en route to establishing Cumberland House. This route became an important part of the North American fur trade, known as the \\"Upper Tract\\". It was abandoned by 1800 in favour of the Nelson River and Hayes River routes. In 1794, the fur-trader and cartographer David Thompson, surveyed the lake. The lake first appeared on a map drawn by Peter Pond in 1785 and was described as the \\"Middle Road to Hudson's Bay\\". The name of the lake was first noted In 1806, when explorer and surveyor Peter Fidler recorded the main waterways of his Cree partners in the notable \\"Cha Chay Pay Way Ti’s Map of the Waterways of a Part of Northern Manitoba\\", Cranberry Portage and Lake Athapapuskow are clearly marked on it. In 1896 J.B. Tyrell surveyed a portion of the south shore, but due to its remoteness, the lake was not fully mapped until 1914 when the Geological Survey of Canada sent Everend Bruce to do so in 1914. The S.S. Tonopah on Lake Athapapuskow circa 1918After the discovery of ore at Flin Flon, the lake became an important transportation link. During the First World War, ore from the Mandy Mine on Schist Lake, was barged across Lake Athapapuskow on the stern-wheeler S.S. Tonapah on its way to The Pas where it was then shipped by rail for smelting. In 1917 a road first reached the south shore from Sturgeon Landing and in 1928 the Hudson Bay Railway reached Cranberry Portage. The town of Cranberry Portage itself was established on the southeast arm of the lake in 1922 when William Thompson built a house there. Manitoba Highway 10 reached Cranberry Portage in 1949 and was extended to Bakers Narrows in 1951. In 1961 Bakers Narrows Provincial Park was established on the lake. There are several fishing lodges located on the lake. The name was officially registered in 1948 and is believed to be derived from \\"Athapa'puskow Saka'higan\\" meaning \\"rock on both sides lake\\" in Swampy Cree, which aptly describes the stony pre-Cambrian shores. Islands The lake has over 575 islands, most of them unnamed. Some of the named islands include: *Bakers Island *Four Mile Island *Gull Island *Half Moon Island *Hudson Bay Island *Isabelle's Island *Log Cabin Island *See-Through Island *Seven Mile Island *Sewell's Island *Steckler's Island *Washing Machine Island *Windmill Island See also *List of lakes of Manitoba References Athapapuskow Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts ","title":"Lake Athapapuskow"},{"id":"42787374","text":"Main building Ventspils University College () is a higher education establishment in Ventspils, Latvia.

Known as \\"The Turtle King\\",\\"The Turtle King\\" in The Sketch, 23 February 1898, p. 213. he established a thriving business in London at the end of the 19th century, producing turtle products that promised health benefits and were a staple of Victorian fine dining and civic banquets. Career Bellis was born in Liverpool,1881 England Census and educated there at Liverpool College. He travelled to London to work in a West India house (West Indies merchants) as a young man.\\"The Turtle King\\" in Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 28 June 1898, p. 6. It was probably there that he learned about the turtle trade. He started his own business in the trade in 1874 and in 1882 won a silver medal for turtle products at the International Fisheries Exhibition.\\"The International Fisheries Exhibition\\" in The Times, 18 April 1882, p. 10. He created a niche for himself, so that by the end of the nineteenth century he had almost monopolised the trade in turtle products in Britain. His firm produced turtle soup and pate, turtle herbs, turtle oil soap, sun-dried turtle and various kinds of preserved turtle, and supplied Queen Victoria.Advertising in Wills, Walter H. and R.J. Barrett (Eds.) (1905) The Anglo-African Who's Who and Biographical Sketch-Book. London: George Routledge, p. i Importing turtles The turtles, which were only of the chelonia mydas species, were caught in the Gulf of Mexico and transported by schooner to Kingston, Jamaica, from where they were shipped to Britain by Royal Mail steamer. In 1898 approximately one hundred turtles were imported every two weeks, and they were kept alive if possible using salt-water hose and tanks on ship. However, many died during the journey, 105 out of 120 on one occasion. The cold was a particular problem. Each weighed over 100 pounds and up to 140 but heavier ones were not required as the meat was less tender. Originally, Bellis kept the survivors alive in his cellars until required, but later took to slaughtering them on arrival and processing the meat straight away. In 1905, it was reported that there was not a single live turtle available anywhere in London, not even for a guinea an ounce (a great deal of money then). A quarrel had broken out between fishermen from Kingston and the Nicaraguan authorities, off whose coast the fishermen were accustomed to work. Kingston vessels had been seized, the men imprisoned by the Nicaraguans, and their catch set loose. Bellis, the \\"chief importer of turtles in Britain\\" advised that other boats would not venture out, however, a British gunboat would soon be going along to protect them, so there was hope that turtle would be available for the Lord Mayor's Banquet the following month, and that mock turtle soup would not have to be served.

On 25 June 1957, it became the 58th Motor Rifle Division, and around the same time the 1st Rifle Corps became the 1st Army Corps. The 58th was directly subordinated to the district in 1970 when the corps transferred to Kazakhstan. Michael Holm's research indicates the division comprised the 160th Motor Rifle Regiment (73806) - Kazandzhike (BMP-1), the 161st Motor Rifle Regiment (73884) - Kyzyl-Arvat (BTR-60), the 162nd Motor Rifle Regiment (14142) - Nebit-Dag (trucks), and the 231st Tank Regiment (61631) - Kazandzhike (T-55), plus artillery and the other normal units of a motor rifle division. In the spring of 1982, the division became part of the new 36th Army Corps. Carey Schofield's Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, p.117, says the division's regiments in 1989 were 254 strong (MRR BTR), 256 strong (MRR BMP) and 210 (tank regiment), and was under the command of Acting Commander Colonel Mishin.

History On 19 January 1935, the Anglo-Celt recorded the birth of Drumalee club as follows, it grew out of an informal meeting at Drumalee Cross where it was decided to start a club. The club was affiliated at the 1935 county convention and Charlie O'Reilly, Drumherrish, was its delegate to the county board. That year it entered a club in the junior championship which was run on a home and away league basis. Lacken, Kilmore, Butlersbridge and Ashgrove were in their division. The first outing of the club was against Lacken. They wore all-white jerseys and were afterwards frequently referred to in match reports as the 'Lily Whites'-a title applied to the famous Kildare team of the 'twenties and early 'thirties. They were hand-knitted woolen jerseys and one old veteran who wore this white jersey with distinction recalled that on a hot day 'you would suffocate in it and after it was washed once or twice it wouldn't fit a child'. They got off to a good start beating Lacken by 1-4 to 1-1 in what the Anglo-Celt described as a 'bright clean game'. The most successful year in the club's history was in 1969 when they won the Intermediate League and Championship and earned promotion to senior ranks for the first time. They defeated a fancied Arva team in the Championships by 1-9 to 1-6. A large crowd turned up in bad weather for the final on 5 December. They were rewarded with plenty of good football despite the bad conditions. Drumalee were a point behind at half-time after playing against the wind. They served up great football in the second half to win by 1-9 to 1-6. Drumalee regained their senior status in 2006 winning the Cavan Intermediate Football Championship.

He was injured multiple times throughout the war, surviving a gunshot wound to his left thumb and being struck by debris from a falling bridge. Battle of Columbus On April 16, 1865, seven days following the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Hays marched on Columbus, Georgia to secure the city's naval yards, weapons factories and supply depots. During the ensuing battle, Hays stormed a bridge over the Chattahoochee River and helped to capture a fort guarding it. During the battle for the fort, Hays captured the flag and the flag bearer of an Austin Battery stationed there. He received the Medal of Honor for this act. Citation Later life Hays returned to his family farm following the conclusion of the Civil War. However, he left to open a blacksmith shop in Greenfield, Iowa in 1868. He later moved to Troy, Idaho in 1888 and opened a new blacksmith shop. The shop was ultimately destroyed in a fire. Hays began prospecting following the destruction of his shop and experienced some success at mining for silver. In 1894, Hays was appointed City Marshall of Troy. Death On January 27, 1904, Hays attempted to arrest Paine Sly for domestic disturbance. Sly killed Hays in the ensuing shoot-out. Although fatally wounded, Hays returned fire and was able to injure Sly. Sly was later convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.

The club was founded in 1888 and is solely a Gaelic football club as hurlers from the parish play with neighbouring Glenroe. They won the County Senior Football Championship on four occasions in 1917, 1999, 2007 and 2014. Location Ballylanders is situated 45 km from Limerick City in the southeast of the county at the foot of the Galtee Mountains. Footballers from the neighbouring parish of Glenroe/Ballyorgan also play with the club. Neighbouring clubs include sister club Glenroe, Garryspillane, Galbally, Galtee Gaels and Mitchelstown in County Cork. History Before the foundation of the GAA in 1884, Gaelic football was widely played in southeast County Limerick. There is an account and photograph of a Ballylanders Shamrocks team that played Aherlow. Bally won the County Junior Football Championship in 1911 beating Castlemahon in the final. The cup stayed in the parish for six years as the County Board did not run the championship during the First World War. Meanwhile, football grew rapidly in the parish and Ballylanders won their first County Senior Football Championship in 1917 beating Commercials. Several Ballylanders players were on the Limerick team that lost to Dublin in the same year. During those early days of the GAA, Frank Dineen, a native of Ballylanders, gave a great contribution to the GAA. He was President from 1885-1898 and was General Secretary from 1898-1901. Dineen famously bought a site in 1913 on Jones's Road that was later to become Croke Park. Ballylanders won a Junior Championship in 1920 and were beaten in the 1925 Senior final by Oola. The club were again Junior champions in 1933 beating Ahane but football was in decline at this time. in 1952 they won another Junior title beating Oola but again failed to build on it lasting just two years at senior. In the 1970s Bally were senior and succeeded in winning a South Championship. After a disappointing 1980s the 1990s were extremely successful for the club. In 1991 they joined with Galtee Gaels and Garryspillane under the Glenacurrane name and they won the County Senior Championship. In 1995 the club won Under-14, Minor and a Junior county title beating Gerald Griffins to win their fifth junior crown. In 1996 an Under-21 success was added. In 1998 Pallasgreen were defeated in the County Intermediate final and the following year Bally won their first Senior Championship for eighty-one years when they beat Hospital-Herbertstown. The club carried through its success into the 2000s with the minors and under-21s winning County Championships in 2004 and 2006 respectively. A third Senior Championship was added in 2007 when Dromcollogher-Broadford were beaten. They reached the final again the following year but Drom-Broadford gained revenge. The club won an unprecedented fourteen South Senior Championships between 1998 and 2011 and continues to ply its trade at senior level. Grounds Through the years Ballylanders GAA club rented various fields around the parish for training and matches. In the early days Osborne's field was used where the daycare now stands. Lynch's field where Galtee Wood now stands was also used as well as Walshe's field. McGrath's field on the Galbally road was a mainstay. The club finally purchased a site on the Kilfinane road in 1981 and throughout the 1980s and 90s the field and dressing rooms were developed. However, the club has since outgrown these facilities and have built a brand new clubhouse containing four dressing rooms and a multi purpose hall. The grounds is now known as Frank B. Dineen Park.

Geography Churchill is located at (45.749951, -111.310256). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. Demographics History Church Hill, or Churchill as it was later shortened by Gallatin County Road Department, is located seven miles south of Manhattan, just to east of Amsterdam on a prominent hill. Churchill is at the center of the Montana's largest Dutch settlement that runs from Manhattan south to Little Holland which is 14 miles distant. While Amsterdam may have been the retail center of the Dutch settlement, Churchill was the cultural center with the site of the Dutch community's original church- the 1st Christian Reformed Church, today known as Manhattan Christian Reformed Church; and related parent-operated private P-12 school, Manhattan Christian School; both of which exist today along with Bethel Christian Reformed Church (a spin off of the original church) and Churchill Retirement Home. The large church on the hill is the probable origin of the name, and once was the largest wooden structure west of the Mississippi River.Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers. Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman . Montana Historical Society Press. In the late 1890s, Dutch immigrants came to the Gallatin Valley, with the aid of the Manhattan Malting Company, and created a \\"linear settlement\\" of homes, farms, and ranches that stretched roughly 14 miles south of Manhattan, with Amsterdam and Churchill roughly in the middle. Recognizing the growth of the community, the Northern Pacific designated a siding called Amsterdam to the west of \\"the hill\\" along its Anceney Spur; not to be outdone, the C.M. & St. Paul Railway (aka:the Milwaukee Road) created a siding for agricultural goods about two miles to the east of Churchill along its Gallatin Valley Railway called the \\"Holland Siding\\", subsequently the \\"east of the hill\\" became known on maps as Holland. Seven miles to the south of Churchill, near an area where many Dutch settlers homesteaded, is an area called \\"Little Holland\\" and today is marked by one of the two cemeteries established by the original Dutch settlers, while the other cemetery is located in Churchill.

It states that every drawing in the plane of a non-planar graph contains a pair of independent edges (not both sharing an endpoint) that cross each other an odd number of times. Equivalently, it can be phrased as a planarity criterion: a graph is planar if and only if it has a drawing in which every pair of independent edges crosses evenly (or not at all).. History The result is named after Haim Hanani, who proved in 1934 that every drawing of the two minimal non-planar graphs K5 and K3,3 has a pair of edges with an odd number of crossings,. See in particular (1), p. 137. and after W. T. Tutte, who stated the full theorem explicitly in 1970.. A parallel development of similar ideas in algebraic topology has been credited to Egbert van Kampen, Arnold S. Shapiro, and Wu Wenjun...... Continued in 6 (1): 23–35, 1986. Applications One consequence of the theorem is that testing whether a graph is planar may be formulated as solving a system of linear equations over the finite field of order two. These equations may be solved in polynomial time, but the resulting algorithms are less efficient than other known planarity tests. Generalizations For other surfaces S than the plane, a graph can be drawn on S without crossings if and only if it can be drawn in such a way that all pairs of edges cross an even number of times; this is known as the weak Hanani–Tutte theorem for S. The strong Hanani–Tutte theorem, known for the projective plane as well as for the Euclidean plane, states that a graph can be drawn without crossings on S if and only if it can be drawn in such a way that all independent pairs of edges cross an even number of times, without regard for the number of crossings between edges that share an endpoint.. The same approach, in which one shows that pairs of edges with an even number of crossings can be disregarded or eliminated in some type of graph drawing and uses this fact to set up a system of linear equations describing the existence of a drawing, has been applied to several other graph drawing problems, including upward planar drawings,. drawings minimizing the number of uncrossed edges,.. and clustered planarity..

It is an adjustment or consolidation, made in 1924 by Shinjiro Sonoda (1876-1961), to traditional Chinese divination and geomancy methods, such as Flying Star Feng Shui, the Ming Gua (Chinese: 命卦) number from the Eight Mansions Compass School of Feng Shui, and combining the Lo Shu Square with the \\"Later Heaven\\" Bagua.  The Stars  There are thought to be nine-year and nine-month cycles of Ki/Qi on Earth, which are related to solar and seasonal cycles, and which have common effects across the planet on people's mental and physical development and experiences throughout their lives. The 9 Star Ki 'stars' are numbers that represent those cycles. The numbers can be calculated for anyone on/from Earth using only a birthdate. The system most commonly uses two numbers. First, the Honmei star (Japanese: 本命星; translation: \\"true feelings star\\", like Honmei choco) is the principal, adulthood, or year number, describing one's most mature mind/heart, karma, or spirit type. Second, the Getsumei star (Japanese: 月命星; Google translation: \\"month life star\\") is the character, childhood, or month number, describing one's physical connection to the Earth, namely one's more primitive or physical features.:ja:九星気学 A third, 'energetic' number is given by some sources and calculators, especially in the Western world, and is said to describe one's outward behavior, personality, or the first impression one usually makes on others. Being derived from the principal and character numbers, the energetic number may not provide new information. It is not a day-specific number, which one can determine by other means. The energetic number also differs from the Ming Gua number used by the Chinese Eight Mansions Compass School of Feng Shui.  Star Characteristics and Compatibilities  The numbers are each associated with one of the Chinese Five Elements, following the \\"Later Heaven\\" Bagua pattern. Each number/star is considered a variation on the characteristics of that Element group. For example, 3 is the blue-green Wood star, whereas 4 is the dark-green Wood star. Combining the Lo Shu Square with the \\"Later Heaven\\" Bagua, blue-green is meant to indicate being more excited, aroused, and early Spring-like, whereas dark- green means being more gentle, flexible, and later Spring-like. Here are the group assignments: 1 stands alone as Water; 2, 5, and 8 are the Earth group; 3 and 4 are the Wood group; 6 and 7 are the Metal group; and 9 stands alone as Fire.:ja:九星気学 Compatibilities between the stars and groups generally follow the Five Element cycles of supporting vs. controlling. For example, a person with a principal number of the Fire type/group might feel mentally energized or nurtured by someone whose principal number is in the Wood group. Lengthy interpretations of the characteristics and compatibilities of the stars and groups are a hallmark of many 9 Star Ki books and articles (e.g.,).  Star Calculations  At least two online calculators find all three principal, character, and energetic numbers for a given birthdate for free. Several online calculators provide only the principal and character numbers. Some calculators present 9 Star Ki numbers alongside other numbers used for Feng Shui, such as the Ming Gua number. The numbers can be manually determined using tables and/or equations. The energetic number is determined by superimposing the Lo Shu Square on a fixed pattern of annual permutations of that square, called the tables of the Movements of Ki/Qi. Those permutations consistently result in a table of 81 possible number combinations. 9 Star Ki uses the Chinese solar calendar, with the beginning of a year falling at the midpoint between the winter solstice and the following spring equinox, which is in early February on the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the Chinese and Gregorian years and months do not exactly overlap. People with birthdays in January, or early in a Gregorian month, can have the principal or character number(s) of the previous Chinese solar year or month.

They are affiliated to Cavan GAA. History =1970's= From the inception of the club, on Thursday 18 December 1969, CLG Cuchulainn made its presence felt in Division 1 of the Cavan senior league and senior championship. In the first round of the 1970 Cavan senior championship, Cuchulainns beat Cornafean after a replay. The club's participation in its initial championship came to an end when beaten by Baileborough on a score line of 0–9 to 0–8 at the quarter final stage of the championship in Breffni Park, on Sunday 30 August 1970. In May 1971 Cuchulainns met the vastly more experienced Crosserlough in the 1970 league final. Incidentally Crosserlough were on their way to winning a record breaking seven in a row senior championship. The Anglo Celt reports that Crosserlough gave clear notice that they were still a force in Cavan football, when they won yet another Cavan title, this time the 1970 league, when beating Cuchulainns by 2–12 to 2–8 in an entertaining match at Breifne Park on Sunday last. The 1970s ended with the club relegated to intermediate status as a number of the older players retired. On the playing field then, it was a decade of unfulfilled promise and disappointment, but by no means failure. =1980s= If the 1970s saw a gradual decline in the playing fortunes of the club, the 1980s have seen a gradual improvement as the successful juveniles came through to adult level. Cuchulainns did have a good championship run in 1980 when they overcame the challenge of Killygarry after a replay to reach the intermediate championship final. Like the drawn match, the replay was a very close encounter and the possibility of extra time loomed until Aidan Connell snatched a point in the dying moments of the game. The match itself was fast and exiting, but both sets of forwards found scores hard to come by. The final score was 0–10 to 1–6. The final was to be another disappointing day for Cuchulainns, with their opponents Munterconnaught gaining their first intermediate championship title. The Anglo Celt reports that both teams played with resolute determination in a tough exciting match, the final score being 2–4 to 0–7. Munterconnaught the more balanced outfit settled quickly. Cuchulainns relying heavily on Ray Carolan found it harder to get into their stride and it was indeed the second half before they really got into the game. However, with M. Hetherton and O. Stanley in commanding form in midfield, Munterconnaught laid the foundations for victory. In 1983 the club reached its lowest ebb when relegated to Division 3 In 1985 Cuchulainns gained promotion to division 2 and contested both the league and intermediate championship finals. The intermediate championship final was reached by beating literally the best teams in the competition. One only has to remember the thrilling games against Kildallan, Denn and Killeshandra. Gowna, the opponents in the final, proved once again to be the bogey team. Cuchulainns fought hard to get into this game but with Gowna dominating midfield there was to be no joy for the large group of supporters from the parish. The league final against Kildallan in Mullahoran was yet another disappointing day for Cuchulainns. The game started at break neck speed with Cuchulainns dominating the opening twenty minutes. However, an abundance of scoring chances were missed and slowly Kildallan came back into the match scoring two goals from virtually their only two attacks of the first half. The goals proved to be the turning point of the game with Kildallan going on to dominate the second half, and ran out worthy winners. The disappointment suffered in 1985 served as a powerful motivator in 1986. The intermediate team firmly established itself in Division 2 of the football league only narrowly missing promotion to Division 1. They also reached the intermediate championship final only to be defeated by the narrowest of margins – one point. The junior team gained the club's first trophy of note by defeating Kildallan in the final of the 1985 Division 3A league which incidentally was not played until October 1986. The intermediate championship competition threw up many strong sides and with only seven teams in the draw, games were obviously going to be keen. Cuchullainns went in as clear favourites against Drung in the first round but were somewhat lucky to just get home by three points. They entered the semi-finals against a strong and experienced Redhills side and won by 2–5 to 1–5 with two-second half goals settling the issue, scored by P. Carolan and J. Farrelly respectively. The final brought together Cuchulainns beaten finalists in 1985 and the side they accounted for in the semi-final of the same competition, Killeshandra. Sadly for Cuchulainns it was to be a familiar story with Killeshandra winning the title by 0–10 to 1–6 in a hard-fought final. It was a clash of two very determined teams and it was an occasion when Killeshandra with a well organised defence made the most of their attacking opportunities. Cuchulainns with the benefit of the breeze in the first half enjoyed a greater share of the play but found themselves trailing by 0–4 to 0–2 at the interval. At this stage the Cuchulainns midfield had the upper hand. However, the tactic of lobbing in some high centres into the Killeshandra square proved fruitless and a great deal of good possession was wasted. As the game entered the third quarter Killeshandra gradually took control, having built up a commanding six- point lead. Cuchulainns responded with a goal and a point from R.Carolan. However, time was running out they could only get within a point of the opposition. The year 1987 is going to stand out in the history of the club. It was the year that Cuchulainns won the Cavan Intermediate Football Championship and in fact were unbeaten until 6 September 1987. The inclusion of young players produced a winning brand of football. Since some minors were also senior and junior panels, all the panels trained together. Indeed, it was a sight to behold to see 36 or 38 players heading off round the field in Cross. The hard training and large turnouts were rewarded with eight consecutive wins in the league and with a confident air Cuchulainns approached the first round of the intermediate championship against Redhills. However, Cuchulainns were lucky to survive a late rally before eventually winning by a slender one point, 0–16 to 3–6. Cuchulainns forced their way into the semi-final by defeating Kill 0–11 to 1–3 in a disappointing game in Cootehill. In the semi- final Cuchulainns scored an emphatic 4–9 to 0–5 victory over Lavey. The tie ceased to be a contest after the opening 11 minutes when Cuchulainns led by 3–2 to 0–0. In the final Cuchulainns met favourites for the title, Denn. The game itself was described by both local newspapers The Anglo Celt and The Cavan Leader, as the most competitive decider at the Breifne Park venue in years and said both teams were to be complimented on turning in a very enjoyable hour's football. The teams were so evenly matched a draw seemed on the cards from the early minutes. The reason however why the title went to Cuchulainns rather than Denn, was that the winners made the most of their scoring opportunities. =1993 Intermediate Title Goes to Cuchulainns= One of the best performances on the club scene in Cavan in '93 was Cuchulainn's defeat of Lacken in the Cavan Intermediate Football Championship final played in Breffni Park last September. The score line of 3–11 to 1–4 tells its own story, as the East Cavan side were much too good for a young and inexperienced Lacken side on the day. =2000 Seven A side Title= The county board included in the millennium celebrations a \\"7 A side club\\" run off competition. Cuchulainns entered a team for play in Ballyhaise. The competition was to be on one Saturday in May. The Cuchulainn lads were surprised to win their section and advance to the finals. The finals were played that same day in the evening in Terry Coyle Park, Cavan. The Cuchulainns football team were crowned County 7 A side champions. =2004 Division 2 League Title= Losing out, after a replay, in the IFC semi-final to the champions-elect would have knocked the stuffing out of most teams. But not Cuchulainns. With great gusto, the Cross-Mullagh lads bounced back to win the ACFL Division Two title less than eight weeks later. Cuchulainns set their stall out from the very early part of the year with a 0–13 to 0–6 win over Lavey at Edwin Carolan Park, putting down a marker for the rest of the season. Come the end of July it became increasingly obvious that Cuchulainns were the team to beat in the league in 2004. The champions-elect showed their consistency and their pedigree with a well merited win over would-be IFC finalists Drung at the Bunnoe venue. Both sides played fast and open football in a match played in excellent playing conditions. That assuredness was manifest too in the decisive 1–13 to 1–6 victory over would-be IFC kingpins Lacken Celtic. Victory over the Celtics underlined Cuchulainns’ potential and growing stature among their peers. By the end of October, the feeling in Cross-Mullagh was that their favourites could only throw away a place in the last four of the competition. And while they arguably drew the short straw in being pitted against Ballinagh in the semi-final of the league, nobody in any part of the county of Cavan was in doubt but that Cuchulainns had the grit and the toughness to give as good as they would get from the Saffrons, and a little more back besides. There was no sense of cockiness in the Cuchulainns camp though. It did not matter that the team had amassed 22 points from thirteen league games, losing just two matches out of thirteen into the bargain, including a shock reverse to Cornafean. In a titanic struggle played in Lavey at the end of November, Cuchulainns beat the Saffrons by 1–14 to 1–8. The victory was sweet, well-deserved. Indeed, it probably saw Cuchulainns at their very best in 2004. In capturing their first bit of silverware in eleven years, Cuchulainns were made to fight all the way to the finishing post. Indeed, it took a late, late point to actually decide the issue in Cuchulainns’ favour. Not since 1993 when they captured the Cavan Intermediate Football Championship had Cuchulainns tasted success at senior level. So the win was a joy to behold for all belonging to the club. =2005 Intermediate Championship= Cuchulainns captured the Cavan Intermediate football championship title for the third time in the club's history when they accounted for Drumalee in the final at Kingspan Breffni Park – Cuchulainns 1–6 Drumalee 0–7. This final which many expected to be an open game proved to be a nervous tense affair with the deciding score coming in the nineteenth minute of the second-half when minor star Adrian Taite was on the end of a great move to slot home the team's decisive score. Cuchulainns, who had to change colours from their traditional white with blue trim for this meeting and who are playing their league football in Division 1, showed their experience when for the most of the first half they were under pressure from a lively Drumalee side. =2014 Senior Championship= Cuchulainns progressed to the Semi-final stages of the Cavan Senior Championship for the first time in their history in 2014. Cuchulainns began their Senior Championship Campaign by beating the County Champions Ballinagh in Kingspan Breffni Park in a highly entertaining game on a scoreline of 1:16 to 15. Cuchulainns were then beaten by the eventual Champions Cavan Gaels in the next game which set up a game against Gowna for a place in the Quarter final stages of the competition. Cuchulainns dominated this game in every area of the pitch running out winners on a scoreline of 0:16 to 0:9 points. In the Quarter finals Cuchulainns accounted for Killygarry, in a tense, nervous encounter. Both teams were guilty of wayward shooting in the first half with Cuchulainns coming off slightly better than their opponents, leading by 0:4 to 0:1 at halftime. The Second half began at a ferocious pace, Killygarry fought back to draw the game at 9 points a piece until Cuchulainns kicked the final 2 points of the game which sealed their long-awaited berth into the Semi-final Stages. In the Semi-finals Cuchulainns were drawn against Cavan gaels for the second time in the Championship. Cuchulainns put on a fantastic defensive display in the first half and were very unlucky to go into the half time break losing by 0:6 to 0:3. The Second half proved a step to far for Cuchulainns with the eventual Champions Cavan Gaels grabbing 2 goals to end Cuchulainns Championship for 2014. Cuchulainns Centre half back Seamus Clarke was Nominated for Cavan Senior Club Player of the year after a fantastic Campaign. The Kit Traditionally Cúchulainn's have worn a white jersey with Blue trims, as well as white shorts and blue socks. They have also worn blue jerseys with white trim such as in the Cavan Intermediate Football Championship final in 2005.

Graham with cat-like reflexes pounces on the loose ball and sprints up the field. Despite hearing calls to pass the ball, Graham bursts through the Killygarry defence and strikes a beautiful, curling, dipping point sailing over the crossbar. When this magical moment occurred, the watching fans leaped to their feet in excitement and praised Graham for his wonderful score. The shouts of Huzzah were heard echoing over the mountains.

Through time, the gifts became more monetary based and a part of the monarch's wealth. Although they were allowed to approach the monarch with the gifts, they were handed to a royal attendant so as not to touch the aliʻi.

Early life and education Collier-Thomas was born the second of three children of Joseph Thomas Collier, a business executive and public school teacher, and Katherine (Bishop) Collier, a public school teacher. She attended elementary schools in New York, Georgia, and Florida, and high school in Jamaica, New York. Her family belonged to the black middle class, with professions such as nurse, building subcontractor, and barber represented among her near relatives as well as teacher and businessman. Her great-uncle Frank Richard Veal was an African Methodist Episcopal minister and president of the historically black Allen University (South Carolina) and Paul Quinn College (Texas).Scanlon, Jennifer, and Shaaron Cosner. American Women Historians, 1700s–1990s. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. She thought that she would go into law, but an 11th grade teacher inspired her to become an historian instead. She hyphenated her name upon marriage to Charles J. Thomas, an educator (now retired) and writer. Collier-Thomas got her bachelor's degree at Allen University, where she was inducted into the Alpha Kappa Mu National Honor Society (the black Phi Beta Kappa during segregation). She won a Presidential Scholarship to attend Atlanta University, where she got her master's degree. In 1974, supported by a Ford Foundation Fellowship, she became the first black woman to receive a Ph.D. in history from George Washington University. Career Between 1966 and 1976, Collier-Thomas held various positions in academia, including serving as a professor and administrator at Howard University and holding faculty positions at Washington Technical Institute and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. In 1977 she was hired as a special consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, for which she developed the NEH's first program of technical assistance to black museums and historical organizations. That same year, she became the founding executive director of the Bethune Museum and Archives (BMA) in Washington, D.C., which was headquartered in a former private house. In 1982 the BMA was designated a National Historic Site and its name changed to the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site. Today it houses the National Archives for Black Women's History. It opened to the public in 1981, and under her direction, it became a nationally prominent institution.Elder, Charles. \\"Funds Sought to Keep Bethune's Legacy Alive.\\" Washington Post. April 27, 1989. In 1994, Collier- Thomas was awarded the Department of the Interior's Conservation Service Award in recognition of her leading role in creating the BMA. In giving the award, then–Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt wrote: :\\"Dr. Collier-Thomas has established the only repository in the country solely devoted to the collection and preservation of materials relating to African-American women in America. Other repositories may collect materials on black history or on women’s history, but no other repository gives black women their principal attention.\\" Collier-Thomas left the museum in 1989 to join the faculty at Temple University, where she serves as associate professor of history and director of the Temple University Center for African American History and Culture.Jackson, Leigh. \\"Bethune Founder Leaves to Take Temple U Post.\\" Washington Post, Nov. 16, 1989. She is also a distinguished lecturer for the Organization of American Historians and a public policy Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center. As a scholar, Collier-Thomas specializes in the social history of African-American women and his written on topics such as black theater, religion, and women's organizations. She argues that too many historians write as if race is the only locus of discrimination for African-Americans.Brown- Collins, Alice R., and Deborah Ridley Sussewell. \\"The Afro-American Woman's Emerging Selves.\\" Journal of Black Psychology 13.1 (1986): 1-11.

This experience, in turn, provides them with a strong ground from which to speak truth. Collier- Thomas's book Jesus, Jobs and Justice (2010) examines the ways in which both black and white Protestant women dealt with racial issues in the first half of the 20th century, prefiguring the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement. Her Daughters of Thunder (1998) is an anthology of 19th and 20th century sermons by black women, selected from a collection amassed by Collier-Thomas over the course of two decades.

Biography  Ali was the son of a certain Il-Arslan, and had a brother named Il-direk. Ali was known as khwishawand (kinsman), which possibly suggests him being related to the Ghaznavids, or either suggests a high rank. During the reign of Sultan Mahmud, Ali served as the sipahsalar (commander-in-chief) of the Ghaznavid army. After the death of Mahmud in 1030, Ali became a dominant figure civil war that ensured between Mahmud's two sons, the youngest one being Mohammad Ghaznavi, and the oldest one being Mas'ud I. Along with the Ghaznavid vizier Hasanak Mikali, Ali supported Mohammad and expected that he would held absolute power over the Ghaznavid state, while Mohammad would stay as a figurehead. Ali shortly became the main center of Ghaznavid power and had authority over all offices apart from the vizier office. Ali, however, soon distanced himself from Hasanak, and when Mas'ud began marching towards the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni, he decided to betray Mohammad and change his adherence to Mas'ud. Mohammad shortly left Ghazni to face his brother who had reached Herat. When Mohammad arrived to Zamindawar, Ali, in order to officially declare his support to Mas'ud, sent Il-direk to the latter. Meanwhile, the majority of Mohammad's began deserting to him, and Mohammad himself was shortly defeated and imprisoned by Mas'ud, who ascended the Ghaznavid throne. Once established in power, Mas'ud, who deemed the power of Ali too great, had the latter imprisoned, who soon died. Ali had a son named Ibn Ali Khwishawand, who in 1040 took part in the overthrow of Mas'ud and the short-lived restoration of Mohammad.

He was chosen to be the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in May 2014. He previously served as president of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice in Newark, New Jersey, and as executive director of the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington. Brooks was formerly Senior Counsel with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), directing the FCC’s Office of Communication Business Opportunities. He also served as a trial attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and ran as the Democratic Nominee for U.S. Congress for the 10th District of Virginia in 1998. Brooks has served on the transition team for two New Jersey governors.  Early life and education  Brooks was born in El Paso, Texas in 1961. He grew up in Georgetown, South Carolina and is a graduate of Head Start. Brooks attended Jackson State University, where he received a B.A. degree in political science with honors. He subsequently earned his Master of Divinity, with a concentration in social ethics and systematic theology, at the Boston University School of Theology. While studying as a Martin Luther King Scholar, Brooks was awarded both the Oxnam-Leibman Fellowship for outstanding scholarship and promoting racial harmony, and the Jefferson Fellowship for outstanding scholarship and excellence in preaching. He also received a J.D. degree from Yale Law School, where he was a Senior Editor of the Yale Law Journal and member of the Yale Law and Policy Review.  Career  Brooks began his career serving a judicial clerkship with Chief Judge Sam J. Ervin, III, on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In Washington, DC, he directed the FCC’s Office of Communication Business Opportunities and served as the Executive Director of the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington. His work continued as a trial attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the U.S. Department of Justice, where he secured one of the largest government settlements for victims of housing discrimination based on testing, and filed the government’s first lawsuit against a nursing home alleging housing discrimination based on race. Rev. James Edmund Prioleau, Brooks’s grandfather, ran for Congress in the 1940s, in a symbolic effort to increase voter registration among blacks and to help recruit NAACP members. Brooks was the Democratic Nominee for U.S. Congress for the 10th District of Virginia in 1998. He was the president and CEO of Newark-based New Jersey Institute for Social Justice prior to taking the helm of the NAACP. Following his tenure with the NAACP, Brooks has held a variety of appointments in higher education, including Visiting Professor of Social Ethics, Law, & Justice Movements at Boston University, Visiting Fellow and Director of the Campaigns and Advocacy Program at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a Senior Fellow at the New York University School of Law. He is a regular contributor on CNN. In 2012, Brooks was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. As of August 2018, Brooks is Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at Harvard Kennedy School.  NAACP Leadership  Election The executive board of the NAACP elected Brooks as the next chief executive on May 16, 2014 by a large majority. His appointment followed a period of turmoil for the organization, which had a severe budget shortfall and laid off workers only months before Brooks' election. Furthermore, even though branches are autonomous from the main organization, the national office received scrutiny about fundraising after the Los Angeles branch awarded Donald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers owner who was banned from the NBA after racist remarks, with a lifetime achievement award. Brooks led the NAACP during a period of national turmoil through a three-pronged action plan of polls, protest, and policy. During the NAACP’s 2014 convention, where Vice President Joe Biden addressed delegates about voter suppression, Brooks called for an NAACP “one million members strong.” Near his exit youth leaders protested at the National Convention in 2016, stating \\"We are tired. We want accountability.\\" \\"Youth leaders want its demands heard by national NAACP president Cornell William Brooks and the board.\\" Direct Action and Civil Disobedience In October 2014, Brooks began a Justice Tour, starting in his birthplace, El Paso, TX. The bus tour had a goal to encourage people to vote and discuss social justice issues in their community. He also led a 7-day \\"Journey for Justice\\" through Missouri from the Canfield Green Apartments, where unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson police officer, to Jefferson City in 2014. The march met ice storms, bitter cold, and racist taunts. Brooks was heckled down by St. Louis activists about the organization lack of youth participation at a major 'Ferguson October' rally. One woman is quoted as saying, \\"I had my back turned while that NAACP guy was speaking,\\" explaining the divide between historic black civil rights organizations and the new #BlackLivesMatter Movement taking shape. In Rosebud, MO, a \\"display of fried chicken, a melon and a 40-ounce beer bottle had been placed in the street.\\" The 134-mile march culminated with a protest at the state Capitol Building. The agitation and advocacy in Missouri contributed to the Ferguson Police Department being held accountable by the Department of Justice using the Racial Profiling Law that the NAACP passed. In the summer of 2015, the NAACP took the Journey for Justice millions of steps further. NAACP staff, volunteers, and allies marched 1,002 miles from Selma, AL to Washington, DC to demonstrate the urgency of voting rights and police reform. America’s Journey for Justice – and the thousands who marched by day and slept in synagogues and church halls by night – worked to consolidate support among progressive organizations to advance voting rights legislation in the House and the Senate. The NAACP led a coalition of nearly 300 grassroots organizations representing thirty million members in mass rallies and protests at the Capitol in the spring of 2016 to call for restoration of the Voting Rights Act and a fully seated Supreme Court. The Nation magazine touted the demonstration, with its 1,400 arrests, “the most important protest of the 2016 election.\\" In January 2017, the NAACP stood against the Trump administration with the sit-in opposing the nomination of Jeff Sessions. The NAACP organized a sit-in at Senator Sessions’ Alabama office, turning his workplace into a digital and broadcast platform to teach the country about the evils of voter suppression. Brooks was arrested alongside five other NAACP activists in the first highly visible act of civil disobedience against the Trump administration. This sit-in energized other nomination fights and flooded Senate phone lines. On January 11, 2018, Brooks was one of four opposition voices asked to testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee at Sessions’ confirmation hearing. Legislative Advocacy In the second decade of the 21st century, criminal justice reform emerged as a priority for the NAACP and for the nation. The NAACP successfully advocated for the Missouri Municipal Fine Law after the death of Michael Brown, as well as the federal racial profiling guidance during the Obama Administration. To combat the culture of mass incarceration, NAACP staff and members successfully pushed for more Ban-the-Box laws in states and municipalities across the country. Another legislative priority for the NAACP under Brooks’ leadership was the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Impact Litigation Under Brooks’ leadership, the NAACP Legal Department achieved eleven major legal victories against voter suppression within the span of about a year. The NAACP Texas State Conference saved 608,470 votes with a victorious decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The NAACP North Carolina State Conference saved nearly five percent of the electorate when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that the state legislature had enacted discriminatory voting laws that intentionally targeted and disenfranchised black voters. And, just days before Election Day, the NAACP saved nearly 4,500 voters from being purged from the North Carolina rolls. After children were poisoned with lead in Flint, MI, the NAACP took to the streets and the courts, engaging in direct action and filing a federal lawsuit against Michigan and its governor on behalf of the residents and businesses in Flint. Select News Coverage Brooks’ NAACP tenure saw a rise in the Association’s presence in print, on television, and on social media. Brooks became a frequent guest on broadcast news shows like CNN’s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer and Out Front with Erin Burnett. The Nation termed the NAACP’s Democracy Awakening protest, “The Most Important of the 2016 Election.\\" Brooks was praised for how he handled allegations that Rachel Dolezal, former president of the NAACP’s Spokane, WA chapter, was a white woman who was telling people she was Black. In a Wall Street Journal article on the NAACP’s treatment of the controversy, Anthony Johndrow, co-founder and CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, said: “I cannot think of an organization that has done a better job of using the attention that comes from a crisis to emphasize a core message ‘to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons.’ For an organization that has largely been out of the public eye for some time, it is surprising how articulate and focused the NAACP is on both its civil and human rights mission and its intersection with the far more weighty issues of the day […] Meanwhile, for Cornell William Brooks to be able to clearly and succinctly say ‘our focus must be on issues not individuals’ is far better than the typical corporate dodge and a forceful shift to what we all should be focusing on instead of this story.” Departure On May 19, 2017, the national board of the NAACP voted to dismiss Brooks from his position as president and CEO, explaining the move was part of a “systemwide refresh.” In discussing the decision, NAACP Board Chairman Leon Russell said the change was made to ensure the organization would be better positioned to contest the \\"onslaught of civil rights assaults and rollbacks\\" the board expected would occur under the new presidential administration of Donald Trump. The press coverage of Brooks’ departure reflected a general sense of surprise at the Board’s unexpected decision, and several, including the president of the National Congress of Black Women, spoke out in favor of his reinstatement. In October 2017, the NAACP Board of Directors named Derrick Johnson the next president and CEO.  Personal life  Brooks is a fourth-generation minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Brooks was called to join the ministry while attending Jackson State University where he met his wife, Janice. He has two sons, Cornell II and Hamilton. Brooks is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

In the name of the Radio Arts Foundation, Jim Connett, program director at KFUO, and Michael Neidorff, CEO of the Centene Corporation, made a purchase proposal for KFUO that was rejected by the synod board member and paid negotiator Kermit Brashear. The foundation immediately began plans for a new classical station, even before the Classic 99 format ceased analog operations and became available by webstream only. KFUO was sold to Gateway Creative Broadcasting in March 2010, as approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in May. After announcing that the station would broadcast contemporary Christian music and be branded as Joy FM, Classic 99 ended its 62-year classical music format at 10 p.m. on July 6, 2010 after playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. St. Louis was without a full-time classical station from 2010 to 2013. The Centene Charitable Foundation provided the Radio Arts Foundation a $1 million startup grant for the new station, and FCC Form 350 was filed for the translator station February 1, 2013, which was to be owned and operated by the Radio Arts Foundation–St. Louis, with Connett as general manager. Approval was announced March 7, 2013. After a week of signal testing, RAF-STL Classical debuted on 107.3 K297BI and 96.3 KIHT-HD2 at 10 a.m. on April 8, 2013, with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

The 18th Battalion was formed in New Zealand in September 1939. After a period of training, in 1940 it embarked for the Middle East as part of the 2nd New Zealand Division and then, in 1941, on to Greece. It participated in the Battle of Greece and later in the fighting on Crete. Evacuated from Crete, it then fought in the North African Campaign and suffered heavy losses during Operation Crusader. Brought back up to strength, in June 1942 the battalion participated in the breakout of the 2nd New Zealand Division from Minqar Qaim where it had been encircled by the German 21st Panzer Division. The following month, the battalion fought in the First Battle of El Alamein. In October 1943, the battalion was converted to armour and re-designated the 18th Armoured Regiment. To replace men lost at El Alamein, personnel were drawn from a tank brigade being formed in New Zealand. The regiment spent a year in Egypt training with Sherman tanks, before embarking for Italy in October 1943 to join up with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division. It participated in the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. The regiment finished the war in Trieste and remained there for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans also present in the city withdrew. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the regiment was disbanded in late 1945. Formation and training Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. After consulting with the British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be in the form of an infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Bernard Freyberg. The new division would require nine battalions of infantry and consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers. The 18th Battalion was formed in September 1939 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Gray. It was the first of three infantry battalions designated to make up the first echelon of the 2nd New Zealand Division, destined for overseas service. Its personnel, all volunteers, were drawn from the Northern Military District, which took in the upper half of the North Island of New Zealand. They were formed into four rifle companies, designated A to D and corresponding to the Auckland, Hauraki/Bay of Plenty/Rotorua, Northland and Waikato districts. A headquarters company included the specialist support troops; signallers, anti-aircraft and mortar platoons, pioneers and transport as well as administrative personnel. A period of rudimentary training followed, firstly at Hopuhopu Military Camp and then at Papakura, before it was confirmed that the battalion was on active service. It departed New Zealand on the Orient liner RMS Orion for the Middle East on 5 January 1940 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division New Zealand Division. Before it left, it paraded before the public at the Auckland Domain and was addressed by the commander of the Northern Military District, Lieutenant Colonel Norman Weir. The Orion journeyed to its destination as part of a convoy of liners by way of Fremantle, Colombo, and Aden before it arrived at Tewfik, Egypt, where the battalion disembarked on 13 February 1940. After a train ride to Cairo, the battalion arrived at what would the main base in the Middle East for the 2NZEF, Maadi Camp, in mid-February. At Maadi, the battalion undertook further training. Following Italy's entry into the war in June, it moved to a newly established defensive position, the Baggush Box, to perform garrison duty. It remained there for the next several months, conducting regular patrols and working on the improvement of the defensive positions. During this time, the battalion suffered its first casualties of the war, although non-fatal, as a result of Italian air raids. By January 1941, the defensive work was completed and the battalion moved to Helwan Camp, near Cairo, for re-equipping and more intensive and large scale training. alt=A black and white photograph of a desert landscape; in the mid distance are several huts Greece In early 1941, the British Government anticipated an invasion of Greece by the Germans and decided to send troops to support the Greeks, who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania. The 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March. The 18th Battalion was the first New Zealand unit to depart Egypt, and sailed for Greece on 7 March aboard the Royal Navy cruisers HMS Orion and Ajax. The 2nd New Zealand Division was tasked with the defence of the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece and was positioned on the northern side of Mount Olympus; the 4th Brigade manned the left side of the New Zealand section of the line while the 6th Brigade took the right. The 18th Battalion was the first complete unit in the line; one company was positioned in Olympus Pass itself while the remainder started digging in the sector allocated to 4th Brigade. By 5 April, the battalion's defensive work was completed. On 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and advanced so rapidly that their forces quickly threatened to outflank the New Zealand positions. On 9 April the 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn and began moving south to the Servia Pass. Here, the 18th Battalion was positioned in the hills above the town of Servia and to the right of 19th Battalion, which was defending the pass itself. From 11 April, Stukas mounted air raids on the New Zealand positions before the Germans brought artillery to bear two days later as their ground forces approached. It was during an artillery barrage on 15 April that the battalion suffered its first fatality of the war. The same day, the 18th Battalion fended off initial probing attacks by elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were unable to prevent the Germans from occupying Servia. Despite this, the battalions of 4th Brigade remained in good defensive positions. However, they were withdrawn two days later to the Thermopylae Line, a new defensive position to the south, due to pressure on their flanks. The withdrawal did not go smoothly for the New Zealanders who had to walk out on foot under the cover of darkness amidst harassing artillery fire. Having the furthest to travel, at one stage two companies of 18th Battalion got lost before making their way to the safety of the rear of Servia Pass and their transport. Once clear of the pass, the battalion's transport was subjected to several air raids before they finally made it to the Thermopylae Line, the next defensive position for the New Zealanders. The Thermopylae Line was defended by the 2nd New Zealand Division and 6th Australian Division, with the 4th Brigade held in reserve while the 5th and 6th manned the front lines. However, on 22 April, the Allies decided to abandon Greece and the battalion moved out the same day with the rest of the 4th Brigade as part of an intended rearguard. Originally the battalion was to hold a gorge through which other units would pass for 24 hours but it ended up remaining there for three days. During the intervening period, the intended embarkation route for the battalion's departure from Greece was cut off by the Germans and so the entire brigade made its way to Porto Rafti, east of Athens, where the battalion was one of the first units of the 2nd New Zealand Division to be shipped to the island of Crete. Total casualties during the campaign in Greece were 23 killed in action and 42 wounded. In addition, 117 men, mostly personnel recuperating in hospitals in Athens and unable to evade the Germans, were captured. Crete Peter McIntyre Situated along vital air and sea lanes of communication in the middle of the Mediterranean, Crete was of considerable strategic importance to both sides and, after the conclusion of the campaign in Greece, the Allies fully expected that the Germans would attempt an invasion. The 4th Brigade was stationed as a reserve force in the area around Galatas with the 18th Battalion near the newly established general hospital. When the airborne invasion began on 20 May, the battalion quickly dealt with a company of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) that landed near them. It carried out mopping up operations and patrolled the area for the next two days before assisting the 19th Battalion in an attack on Fallschirmjäger that had established a strong defensive position nearby. Despite heavy casualties during the initial attack, the Germans were able to land reinforcements and the situation on the island quickly deteriorated for the Allies. The brigade had abandoned its initial positions and moved to a new location to the west of Galatas to eliminate the threat that it would become separated from the 5th Infantry Brigade. On 25 May, the 18th Battalion had to deal with a full-scale attack by Fallschirmjäger. This caused heavy casualties and a large portion of one of the battalion's companies was captured. Despite reinforcements arriving from the 20th Battalion and the best efforts of Gray in rounding up stragglers, the Galatas position was breached and the township captured. Some battalion personnel, led by Gray, along with the bulk of the 23rd Battalion, participated in an attack that briefly re-took the township but it later had to be abandoned again after further fighting. The battalion was then withdrawn to the east as the order to evacuate Crete was received, making its way towards Suda Bay, where Allied ships were taking troops off the beaches. Along the way, they were subjected to heavy air raids, one of which killed a company commander, Captain Jack Lyon, the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate. During the evacuation of the 4th Brigade, which took place from Sfakia on 30–31 May, the 18th Battalion formed a rearguard helping police and maintain order; it was the last battalion of the brigade taken off. Casualties during the fighting on Crete were heavy for the 18th Battalion, with 105 men killed or missing and 110 more taken prisoner. North Africa Back in its former base in Egypt and with its ranks restored with 400 reinforcements that arrived in June, the battalion began intensive weapons training. In September it moved to Baggush where on occasion it worked alongside tanks in training exercises. =Operation Crusader= In November 1941, the battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Peart as Gray had been hospitalised, participated in Operation Crusader as part of the British Eighth Army and was engaged in offensive operations towards the Sidi Azeiz area. On the night of 25 November, along with the 20th Battalion, it was tasked with the capture of Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh. With two companies leading the battalion's portion of the advance, the objective was captured with a bayonet charge. Peart was wounded during the attack but remained in command. The battalion held the hill for three days and then swapped its positions with the 20th Battalion before, on 30 November, the 15th Panzer Division surrounded and attacked Belhamed. While the 20th Battalion was effectively destroyed, the 18th Battalion, with Peart maintaining tight control of some personnel who were close to panicking, managed to evacuate in time and reached the British 70th Division in Tobruk. =Rebuilding= At Tobruk and with Gray back in command, the battalion manned the frontlines, fending off German attacks, until 11 December when it was withdrawn to Baggush. Meeting up with the rest of the division, it was brought back up to strength and manned defences to protect the lines of communication to the front. In February 1942, after spending a period of time engaged in training for an amphibious landing behind German lines which never eventuated, the 2nd New Zealand Division was dispatched to Syria to defend against a possible attack through Turkey on the Middle East oilfields by the Germans. Along with the rest of the 4th Brigade the 18th Battalion worked on defences to the north of Damascus before the whole division was recalled to Libya on 17 June following the attack on the Eighth Army's Gazala Line by Panzer Army Africa. It was initially based at Mersa Matruh, but after the fall of Tobruk to Rommel's forces, the division was ordered on 25 June to establish defensive positions at Minqar Qaim. The 18th Battalion was temporarily detached from the rest of the 4th Brigade to act as the main infantry component of the divisional reserve. On 27 June, the division's defensive positions at Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion was the lead unit of one of the columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the tanks with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines. =El Alamein= The battalion was withdrawn from the frontlines after a brief period of recovery at the Kaponga Box. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ray Lynch due to Gray being promoted to brigadier and given command of the 4th Brigade, it served as security for the divisional headquarters from late June to early July as the entire division relocated several times during this period. On the evening of 14 July, the battalion, now back with its parent brigade, was part of the attack on Ruweisat Ridge, held by the enemy. Although an Italian strongpoint caused the battalion to scatter in piecemeal fashion, it advanced to the western end of the ridge taking several prisoners on the way. A German counterattack in the afternoon of 15 July which overwhelmed the 19th and 20th Battalions also caused heavy losses amongst the 18th Battalion, including Lynch, but many men were able to return to the Allied lines. Following the effective destruction of the 19th and 20th Battalions, the 18th Battalion remained in the field attached to the 5th Brigade. It then supported an attack by the 6th Brigade on El Mreir. Inadequately supported by armour, the attack proved a failure although the battalion escaped with relatively few casualties. It remained in the line throughout August and into September at which time, having been reduced to just 350 personnel, it was withdrawn to Maadi to rejoin the reconstituted 4th Brigade. Conversion to armour As the war progressed, the New Zealand government decided to form an armoured brigade to provide tank support to the 2nd New Zealand Division. As a result, the 1st New Zealand Army Tank Brigade was formed in New Zealand. This brigade was still undergoing training in September when it was decided to convert the 4th Brigade to armour instead, thus creating the 4th Armoured Brigade. Personnel were transferred from the tank brigade in New Zealand to bring the 4th Brigade back up to strength. As one of the constituent units of the brigade, the 18th Battalion was officially re-designated the 18th Armoured Regiment, with three squadrons of tanks, on 5 October 1942. One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders while the other two squadrons would operate Shermans. The regiment spent much of the next year in training under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clive Pleasants, who had taken over command after the death of Lynch. By May 1943, many of the regiment's personnel had been on active duty for well over three years, and the majority of these men were returned to New Zealand on furlough. Lieutenant Colonel Clive Pleasants oversaw the conversion of the 18th Battalion from infantry to armour and led it through the early stages of the Italian Campaign With the close of the North African campaign in May 1943, attention then turned to the European theatre of operations. Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed to the Pacific theatre of operations to fight against the Japanese, it was decided that the division would remain in Europe and continue its service with the Eighth Army. Accordingly, in October, the division was transferred to Italy. Italy The 18th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and gradually travelled north towards the Sangro River, which it duly crossed on 3 December. The advance had been slow due to mine fields and delaying ambushes by the Germans. Pleasants, the regiment's commanding officer, was slightly wounded by artillery fire and Major Hugh Green briefly took over. He was mortally wounded by artillery fire on 3 December at the village of Melone, to the north of the Sangro River. Two days later the regiment, with Pleasants back in command, mounted an attack on the German positions at Melone but this failed and seven tanks became stuck. The crews remained with the tanks until they were recovered at the beginning of 1944. In the following weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, and then the 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, as part of the Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become stuck in the sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944. Following its withdrawal from the area around Orsogna, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of divisions that were transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, then engaged on the western side of the Apennines. This was part of an overall strategy to breach the Gustav Line and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front. Together with the 4th Indian Division and supporting British and American artillery, the division formed the New Zealand Corps with Freyberg, now a lieutenant general, in command. The corps moved to Cassino, the defenders of which had resisted Allied forces for several weeks, on 12 February 1944 to replace the American II Corps. As at Orsogna, the 18th Armoured Regiment was to play a supporting role in the forthcoming attack on Cassino, with the infantry of the 5th and 6th Brigades bearing the brunt of the battle. When the attack began on 15 March, the regiment was initially held as a reserve, ready to exploit any breakthrough by the infantry but this did not eventuate. The infantry struggled to make progress in the face of determined resistance. The regiment's tanks were first used at Cassino as artillery support for two weeks, each squadron being rotated in three-day stints to a position overlooking the town. Then in mid-April, one squadron was detached to remain on the Cassino front while the other two squadrons were withdrawn for training. The regiment remained fragmented into May, for once training was completed, another squadron was detached and sent into Cassino itself to man tanks which had been effectively set up as pillboxes. By the end of May, the regiment was reunited and at full strength. It was briefly detached from the 2nd New Zealand Division and, placed under the direction of the 8th Indian Division, participated in operations north of the Liri Valley. Returning to the control of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it supported the infantry brigades as the New Zealanders advanced to Florence, duly entering the city in August. After this, the division was transferred to the I Canadian Corps, then on the Adriatic Coast, and advanced up to Rimini. On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was involved in its first and only action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 18th Armoured Regiment on the right flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. The attack was a success and pushed the Germans across the Savio, although their progress had been slower than expected because of poor weather and muddy conditions. A Sherman of the 18th Armoured Regiment ready to cross the Po River in Italy After the crossing of the Savio, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn from the front for rest and refit. During this period, the regiment received upgunned Shermans; these new tanks were known as the Firefly. After a month, the New Zealanders returned to the front at Romagna and they advanced to the Lamone River in anticipation of a crossing but instead supported the British 46th Division in its attack across the river on 3 December. During this operation, the tanks of the 18th Regiment fired 6,200 shells in a single day. It then attacked towards the Senio River, supporting infantry from the 5th Brigade. The division was positioned along the Senio River for three months, over the worst of the winter period. The regiment spent most of this time behind the lines at Forlì and Faenza, or on short spells on the Senio frontlines. Relieved by a Polish unit in March 1945, the regiment returned to the front lines in early April after a period of rest. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard and on 2 May, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. The partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders, and the regiment remained in Trieste for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans withdrew. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the regiment was disbanded in December 1945. During the war, the 18th Battalion and its successor, the 18th Armoured Regiment, lost nearly 320 officers and men either killed in action or who later died of their wounds. Of the exactly 350 personnel made prisoners of war, a further 21 men died while in captivity. Honours Seven members of the battalion, including three of its commanders, were awarded the Distinguished Service Order while another member was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and a second was made a member of the same order. Nine officers were awarded the Military Cross while two others received the Greek Military Cross. Three soldiers received the Distinguished Conduct Medal and 26 others the Military Medal. Twenty-one soldiers received awards of the Greek Silver and Bronze medals. The 18th Battalion and its successor, the 18th Armoured Regiment, was awarded the following battle honours: Mount Olympus, Servia Pass, Platamon Tunnel, Tempe Gorge, Elasson, Molos, Greece 1941, Crete, Maleme, Galatas, Canea, 42nd Street, Withdrawal to Sphakia, Middle East 1941–44, Tobruk 1941, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Omars, Belhamed, Mersa Matruh, Minqar Qaim, Defence of Alamein Line, Ruweisat Ridge, El Mreir, Alam el Halfa, North Africa 1940–42, The Sangro, Castel Frentano, Orsogna, Advance to Florence, San Michele, Paula Line, Celle, Pisciatello, The Senio, Santerno Crossing, Bologna, Idice Bridgehead, Italy 1943–45. Commanding officers The following officers served as commanding officer of the 18th Battalion: * Lieutenant Colonel John Russell Gray (September 1939 – July 1941; August – November 1941; March – June 1942); * Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Norris Peart (July – August 1941; November 1941 – March 1942); * Lieutenant Colonel Raymond James Lynch (June – July 1942); * Lieutenant Colonel Clive Lochiel Pleasants (July 1942 – December 1943; January – March 1944); * Lieutenant Colonel John Burns Ferguson (December 1943 – January 1944; July 1944 – January 1945); * Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Amuri Robinson (March – July 1944; March – December 1945); * Lieutenant Colonel John McMahon Elliott (February – March 1945); * Lieutenant Colonel Hoani Haereroa Parata (March – May 1945); * Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Scoltock Playle (June – December 1945).

Cambridge Springs station was on the Main Line's Meadville Division, which was the section of the line between Salamanca, New York and Meadville, Pennsylvania. The station was located from Manhattan and the Barclay Street Ferry, which connected to Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey and from Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey. For nearly three decades, the station had connections to the Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway, which was a trolley line that connected the city of Erie and Meadville. Modern Erie Railroad station signage denoted the station as \\"Home of Alliance College,\\" a local private university that closed in 1987. Service to Cambridge Springs began in October 1862, with completion of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway to Meadville, a railway that originally went from Salamanca to Corry, Pennsylvania until work was suspended in 1861 due to financial issues. The Atlantic and Great Western would later be completed in June 1864, with connection to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad in Dayton, Ohio. Ownership of the line was transferred in 1880 to the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad, a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad. Meanwhile, a trolley line was completed through Cambridge Springs from Meadville, which was completed on October 19, 1900. The trolley station was constructed in 1903. The new Meadville and Cambridge Springs Street Railway was extended to Linesville, Pennsylvania, where it connected to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In November 1912, the railway was merged with the nearby Erie Traction Line, becoming the new Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway. Located near some mineral springs, Cambridge Springs became a popular place for people to visit. On October 26, 1912, President of the United States William Howard Taft visited Cambridge Springs to visit the mineral springs, coming from nearby Edinboro, Pennsylvania. A second benefit of being located on the main line, was that Cambridge Springs was halfway between New York City and Chicago. In 1904, the municipality was host to the Cambridge Springs International Chess Congress, an international chess tournament that was the first held in the United States since the turn of the 20th century. Sponsored by the Erie Railroad, the tournament was held from April 25-May 19. In October 1924, the halfway point was dedicated by Erie Railroad officials, with 175 members of the railroad attending a nearby convention and being hosted in nearby hotels. However, the decline of railway service in Cambridge Springs began in 1912, with a series of accidents on the Northwestern Pennsylvania, which caused a big-money lawsuit. In December 1919, the company was forcibly sold to the Erie Trust Company, and in 1922, the company merged with the People's Incandescent Light Company, creating a monopolization of services in Erie and Crawford counties. After a bus line was established in 1925, the service on the trolley line continued to decline, and on September 1, 1928, services on the line through Cambridge Springs was terminated. Service on the Erie Railroad continued, even after it merged with the Lackawanna Railroad. Prior to the merger, the station saw only three stops daily, and by 1965, the last trains servicing Cambridge Springs, the Pacific Express and the Atlantic Express, marking the last passenger service to Cambridge Springs, were canceled. The depot for the Erie Railroad, located at 302 Venango Avenue was demolished in 1964 after a deal was reached with the borough of Cambridge Springs and replaced with the Cambridge Springs Volunteer Firefighter Department building. The former Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway station, modeled to look similar to the Erie Railroad depot, continues to stand on Venango Avenue, along with the monument marking the halfway point, not far from the old depot site.  Construction and service  = Atlantic & Great Western / Erie Railroad = The first railroad that was proposed through Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, then named Cambridge, was the Franklin and Warren Railroad, a proposed railway by Marvin Kent in 1851. This new railroad, slated to go between Franklin, Pennsylvania and Warren, Ohio, was surveyed on October 26, 1852 by officials of the Franklin and Warren, as well as executives from the Erie Railroad. Construction of the new railroad would commence in July 1853, about two months after construction began on the Erie and New York City Railroad, a long line through Salamanca, Dayton and Dunkirk, bypassing the city of Jamestown. Construction commenced on the Erie and New York City on May 19, 1853, but was abandoned on January 7, 1855 due to the funding being scant. In April 1857, the Pennsylvania State Legislature approved the creation of the Meadville Railroad Company, which would construct a brand new railroad from Meadville, Pennsylvania to nearby Erie, Pennsylvania. The company became official on July 13, 1857, and ten days later, the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad turned over their rights to a branch so the Meadville Railroad could construct other branch lines, including the new Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, created in 1853 when the Franklin and Warren changed names. The railroad accepted the offer and looked for money with the A.C. Morton, a contractor, to construct the railroad. However, the company was unable to get money from a trip to Europe and the contract was voided. The Meadville Railroad would change its name in April 1858 to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad as well. On a second voyage to Europe in July 1858, executives were able to convince James McHenry to pay for the railroad, on the condition one of his engineers surveyed the new route. At the same time, José de Salamanca, a nobleman and banker from Spain agreed as well, donating $1 million (1858 USD) in bonds to the effort. In May 1859, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company of New York was founded and agrees with sharing bonds between it and the Pennsylvania and Ohio equivalents. This also buys the Erie and New York City Railroad, which had been abandoned for four years. Construction of the Atlantic and Great Western begins in May 1860, with the first piece (Salamanca-Jamestown) opening on September 11. On May 7, 1861, the railroad was extended to Corry, Pennsylvania. However, that summer, the finances were too little and construction was suspended. After a third trip to Europe for funding, the three companies merged in March 1862, allowing funding to continue to construct the railroad once again starting in the fall. Construction reached Cambridge in 1862, and on October 27, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad was completed through to Meadville. This marked the first railroad through Cambridge, and by 1864, there were four trains daily that passed through but did not stop at Cambridge, two westward express night and day trains as well as two eastern. By the next year, a mail train from Cleveland to Salamanca and vice versa was stopping at Cambridge, one at 10:52 am westbound and 1:52 pm eastbound. On April 3, 1866, the borough of Cambridge was established as a separate entity from Cambridge Township. In 1873, the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, now under the ownership of Jay Gould and other investors, bought two franchises for new railways that would fork off the main line in Cambridge. One of these proposed lines was the Pennsylvania Petroleum Railway, a road out to Titusville, along with a route that crossed through Drake's Mill and Edinboro for moving oil to the ports in Erie from Titusville, which had become a big oil region after its discovery on August 27, 1859. However, the oil rush had died off, and though some grading had been done along modern-day Route 408 outside of Cambridge Springs, the railroads were abandoned. By 1889, ten passenger trains stopped in Cambridge, and as a result, over 80,000 people commuted to or from Cambridge that year. This estimate of over 80,000 yearly passengers remain stable, with the same number being reported in 1898. Although the new depot in Cambridge Springs was reportedly built in 1891 according to the Historic American Engineering Record, the report to the Interstate Commerce Commission recorded its construction date as 1914 due to track tie-ups during derailments, the Erie had to redo the track through Cambridge Springs, resulting in several places where the eastbound and westbound tracks would cross, reducing the problems for trains crossing at the odd angle through town. This resulted in the existing depot at Cambridge Springs being demolished and replaced with a new structure on Venango Avenue. = Trolley lines = In 1891, the Erie Transit Company was chartered by the state of Pennsylvania as a brand new trolley line from Cambridge to the borough of Edinboro, connecting several local communities through the area. The line ran over the Erie and Edinboro Plank Road (currently Route 99), which was completed in 1852. Another line went through Cambridge, the Meadville Street Railway Company, which came into existence on February 29, 1896. This line was proposed to run from Meadville out to Cambridge and onto Edinboro, which opened on April 14, 1898. During this time, the borough of Cambridge changed into Cambridge Springs, and two more trolley lines had been proposed. One, the Meadville and Saegertown Street Railway was to run from Saegertown to Meadville, while the other, the Saegertown and Venango Street Railway ran along modern-U.S. Route 19 to reach Venango. There was a shift right after construction began on the Meadville- Saegertown line, which instead followed modern-day Route 86 and Route 198 to Saegertown. The first service of the line between Edinboro and Erie began on October 19, 1900, while the line that split off towards Meadville was completed in 1903. By May 2, 1909, the new electrified railway had twenty- seven trains going through Cambridge Springs, serving as the connection to Meadville. A traveler who used the line from Cambridge Springs to Erie would expect a commute of about 85 minutes. However, On November 6, 1912, it was agreed that the two services would merge and become one operation, the Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway, providing direct service between Erie and Meadville.  1904 chess tournament  An advertisement of the 1904 Cambridge Springs International Chess Congress, sponsored by the Erie Railroad, held in Cambridge Springs Cambridge Springs was the host of the first major chess competition held in the United States in the 20th century, with the competition being held at the borough's Rider Hotel, a majestic, six-story structure constructed from 1895-1897\\\\. The hotel, which became a large booster of traffic to Cambridge Springs for the mineral spring spas, held a major theater inside, and from April 25-May 19, 1904, an international chess conference was held. This chess conference, called a \\"congress\\", had sponsorship from several people, including the Erie Railroad, along with the owner of the hotel, William D. Rider. The Erie exploited the tournament, as the station agent at Cambridge Springs would be giving away informational booklets about Cambridge Springs, taking out full-page advertisements to sponsor the tournament, with the railroad in large capital letters. The tournament in itself was a major success, bringing many people from the United States and Europe, eventually won by Frank Marshall (1877-1944) in an upset over David Janowski. There was intent to hold another chess conference in 1905 in Cambridge Springs, however, the death of William Rider on September 13, 1905, who had a major piece in creating the original, killed off any hopes for a second tournament. The following owners after Rider could not maintain the amount of popularity the hotel had under Rider, changing names to the Vanadium. However, this was not enough and in 1911 the Rider Hotel was sold to the Polish National Alliance, who used the hotel as Alliance College. Alliance College opened in 1912, with almost 9,000 students and a dedication ceremony involving President of the United States William Howard Taft. The former hotel, which housed the entire college, burned down in a 1931 fire. The college would rebuild on the site off Beach Avenue, as well as be signed at the Erie Railroad depot, but only remain open until 1987, when it closed. Four years later, the state of Pennsylvania took the current site and turned it into State Correctional Institution – Cambridge Springs, a prison for women.  Decline in service  = Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway = Although trolley service in Cambridge Springs had been beneficial to rural farmers, connecting them to marketplaces and when a farmer sold land along it, the railroad would be an attractive draw for potential buyers. However, it was not unknown that the Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway would have problems with the farmers. On December 8, 1912, a train crashed into a flock of 80 sheep, killing 17 of them instantly. On May 31, 1913, a cow from another farm wandered on the right-of-way in Nicholson Hill and was killed the second the trolley made contact. No passengers were killed or injured, however. The former Northwest Pennsylvania Railroad station in Cambridge Springs in July 2015 The decline of service in Cambridge Springs, however, began in the late 1910s, when the Northwestern Pennsylvania Railway had accrued a significant debt since 1912, totaling $493,937.50 (1919 USD). This debt became too much for the company to afford, and the railroad was put up for sale immediately in December 1919, with a sale to be run on December 27\\\\. On the day of the sale, Felix Curtz of the Erie Trust Company bought the trolley line for a total of $115,000 (1919 USD). The extension lines to Meadville and Linesville were sold only for $2,500. The railroad retained its name for another few years, until the trolley company was merged with the Peoples' Incandescent Light Company of Pennsylvania, becoming the Northwestern Electric Service Company, a corporation that dealt with electricity, trolley operation, heat and power for the entirety of Northwestern Pennsylvania. In 1925, with the introduction of bus service to Erie and Meadville, the decline of the trolleys expanded even further. Service was cut from downtown Meadville in September 1927, service was ended to Linesville the same year. The Meadville and Conneaut Park line was canceled in August 1928\\\\. Finally, the last service of trolley lines through Cambridge Springs, which went from Meadville to Erie, was ended on September 28, 1928. However, a remnant of the trolley services remains in Cambridge Springs, as the former trolley station continues to stand on Venango Avenue, across the tracks from the site of the former Erie Railroad station. The station re-opened as a museum in June 2017 run by the Northwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Partnership, who purchased the building in 2014. = Erie Railroad = Riverside Inn in Cambridge Springs, where the convention was held. The inn burned down on May 2, 2017. In October 1924, the Erie Railroad documented the location of the Cambridge Springs depot as the halfway point of the line between New York and Chicago. Located historically at from New York, a monument was made to recognize the spot, with a celebration in October. Over 175 railroad station agents and their spouses attended the ceremony which unveiled a marble monument stating the halfway point. The event was held at the Bartlett and Riverside hotels in Cambridge Springs, during a convention of the Erie Railroad. The 132-year old Riverside Inn was demolished in a fire that ravaged the building on May 2, 2017. By August 1911, the Erie Railroad operated ten trains through Cambridge Springs, nine that would accept passengers and one that would only discharge passengers who boarded from Hornell. By 1916, the Erie had cut this down to six daily (three in each direction). After those cuts, the schedule of trains through Cambridge Springs became steady for over a decade, as by 1927, the schedule of services had not changed, with westbound trains to Meadville, Cleveland and Chicago and eastbound trains to New York City via Jersey City, New Jersey. With the debut of the Erie Limited on June 2, 1929, the service at Cambridge Springs was further curtailed, with two daily regular passenger stops in each direction, a train that ran six days a week in each direction to Meadville, and a request stop in each direction on the Chicago Express. The Erie Limited did not stop at Cambridge Springs. By September 1931, a mixed train (freight and passenger), Nos. 37 and 38, had been added between Jamestown, New York and Meadville, serving as an extra train through Cambridge Springs. When timetables came out in June 1933, another mixed train was added in each direction, However, by November, all the mixed trains had been deleted from the schedule During the presidency of Frederick Douglas Underwood, the Erie Railroad had accrued some serious debt, and although the railroad survived well under Underwood, the railroad was in need of modernization, which other railroads had begun to do. Although the Erie's financial problems were serious, they were not unsolvable, as Henry Sturgis, a banker from New York City suggested to Underwood. The proposed solution was to work on the Erie's bonds, but that ended up not being a solution that was done, and the Erie's financial troubles continued. After Underwood's retirement, the following presidents were unable to help the Erie, due to various government regulations and in 1929, the stock market crash and the Great Depression killed any hopes for financial stability, as it killed a lot of the railroad's business in the freight industry. From 1929-1932, the passenger business fell 50%, but this stabilized in later years, with only a 2% drop from 1933-1936\\\\. In 1937, President Charles Denney and the railroad filed for its fourth bankruptcy, which ended up being a partial benefit to keeping the railroad afloat for passenger service. During this time, the Erie also took a massive hit in railroad territory, causing \\"tremendous\\" losses during the latter half of 1937. Despite the filing for bankruptcy with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Erie became the first railroad of many to return to making a profit and exit bankruptcy. In 1941, an agreement was made in federal courts to reorganize the Erie, which also took control of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railway, a rail line it had been leasing since the 1880s. The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad and New Jersey and New York Railroad were both released from control of the Erie, but critics felt the changes did not reduce the Erie's serious debt by that point. By September 1939, the Erie Railroad through Cambridge Springs had become stable once again, with numerous trains in each direction stopping at Cambridge Springs, including the Erie Limited, Atlantic Express and sister Pacific Express, the brand-new Midlander and the Lake Cities, all of which served as through trains between New York and Cleveland or Chicago. This would remain the same until 1944, when the Midlander and the Lake Cities would merge into one train (the Midlander-Lake Cities), going from Chicago to Cleveland to New York and vice versa. By 1945, the Erie Limited had reduced Cambridge Springs and nearby Union City stations to a request stop rather than a regular stop. In September 1947, another change was made as the Midlander ceased to exist, just returning as the Lake Cities, but retaining the route of the merged trains. In June 1948, the eastbound Lake Cities reduced Cambridge Springs to only discharge customers from Youngstown and west except on Mondays, where it would receive passengers. With the debut of diesel engine locomotives in January 1949, this was changed to just a routine request stop, which ran on the aforementioned engines. The Cambridge Springs Volunteer Fire Department in July 2015, the structure that replaced the depot On October 2, 1957, the Erie president Harry Von Willer announced that the railroad would donate the land of the depot, which would be used for a new fire station for the Cambridge Springs Volunteer Department and Relief Association. A rare agreement between the railroad and community, the site coming at free of charge was one of the first times ever that such a transaction occurred. The new fire station would have a modern waiting room for passengers of the remaining trains going through Cambridge Springs as well as an office for the agent. New parking areas and driveways would be constructed and the Erie promised to pay for painting its section of the building as well as bringing in the furniture. Upon completion, the Erie agreed to raze the 1914 depot and landscape the foundation. Cambridge Springs station's former platform and stairs in July 2015 The same trains, the Erie Limited, Lake Cities, Atlantic Express, and the Pacific Express, remained running through Cambridge Springs, but changes for the Erie Railroad were on the horizon, as in 1957, the Erie Railroad and Lackawanna Railroad announced that they would share tracks between Binghamton, New York and Gibson, a suburb of Elmira, New York. This would set the stage for the merger of the two companies, who could no longer afford to own separate tracks through the area. In 1956, service to Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City had also consolidated, with all through trains going to the Lackawanna's Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey instead. On October 17, 1960, after getting permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission, the two railroads merged into the Erie- Lackawanna Railway. Despite the changeover, the Erie-Lackawanna retained the four trains through Cambridge Springs, now numbered E-1, E-2 E-5, E-6, E-7 and E-8 on the October 30, 1960 timetables. However, by October 1961, the names on several trains had been changed as the Lake Cities became the Chicago Lake Cities due to a new one being sent to Buffalo, New York, as well the Erie Limited becoming the Erie-Lackawanna Limited. This was quickly reverted to Lake Cities by April 1962. On September 29, 1963, the Erie-Lackawanna Limited was discontinued in favor of an extended version of the famous Phoebe Snow, which went to Chicago instead. In 1964, the new firehouse for Cambridge Springs was completed, the station depot was demolished. In April 1965, the Lake Cities was replaced by the World's Fair, in honor of the 1964-65 World's Fair going on in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, New York. However, passenger railroad services ended entirely when the Erie-Lackawanna canceled the Atlantic Express and Pacific Express on August 1, 1965.

The dog was pulling Jeremy down his driveway when Tara, who the family states was very attached to Jeremy, tackled the dog and chased him away, then returned to Jeremy's side to check on him. Jeremy needed 10 stitches in his left calf following the attack, but he quickly recovered and was thankful for Tara's actions, calling her \\"my hero\\". A few days later, the local minor league baseball team the Bakersfield Blaze invited the cat, assisted by Jeremy's family, to throw the first pitch at a Bakersfield minor league baseball game in Sam Lynn Ballpark as a recognition for her deed. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- In the same spirit, Cat Fanciers' Association announced Tara the recipient of its first-ever Cat Hero Award. On June 3, 2014, the Bakersfield Board of Supervisors proclaimed June 3 Tara the Hero Cat Day. On August 15, 2014, Tara was awarded the Special Award For Cat Achievement by the Cat Vid Festival. On September 26, 2014, Tara was awarded the Blue Tiger Award; an award only awarded to Military service dogs. Tara became the first non-human to be named the grand marshal for Bakersfield's Christmas parade in 2014. On June 19, 2015, Tara was awarded with the Los Angeles SPCA's \\"Hero Dog\\" award, for which she also won a year's supply of cat food. On New Year's Day, 2018, Tara and her family rode in the Rose Parade on the Lucy Pet Foundation Paws for Life float honoring heroic animals.http://www.bakersfield.com/news/bakersfield-s- hero-cat-who-saved-boy-from-biting- dog/article_48b69578-ec36-11e7-b859-1795013a4ba6.html \\"Bakersfield's Hero Cat ... to be Honored on Rose Parade Float\\" Bakersfield Californian, December 28, 2017 Records * Ranked 22nd-most influential cat on the internet by Friskies. Fate of the dog Scrappy, an approximately 8-month-old Labrador- Chow mix was surrendered by its owners to the City of Bakersfield Animal Care Center later on May 13, when it began a mandatory 10-day quarantine period to determine whether the animal had rabies. After the video of Tara went viral, websites and online petitions popped up urging the dog not be put down, and calls flooded the phones at the Bakersfield Animal Care Center, according to its director Julie Johnson. Despite this, based on the observations in the kennel during the quarantine period, the dog remained classified as a \\"vicious\\" and \\"dangerous\\" animal. Therefore, adoption requests were strictly denied. At the end of the mandatory 10-day quarantine period, Scrappy was euthanized despite opposition from animal groups and online petitioners. The dog \\"was humanely euthanized over the weekend,\\" May 24, 2014, according to Johnson, who noted the incident has ended far from quietly.

A postal office operated from May 26, 1897 to November 1900 and again from 1903 to July 1917. Atholton was founded at the crossroads of Old Columbia Pike, Guilford Road and Clarksville Pike. Atholton takes its name from a land grant named \\"Athole\\" granted from King Charles to James Macgill 17 August 1732. He built a nearby manor house named \\"Athol\\" built between 1732 and 1740. In 1845, Nicolas Worthington freed seventeen of his slaves, and gave them of the \\"Athol enlarged\\" land which was then called \\"Freetown\\". In 1869, the Atholton Colored Church was founded and renamed to the Locust Chapel (Locust United Methodist) between 1871 and 1876. Atholton was situated one mile north of Simpsonville without well-defined boundaries. By the 1930s, postal service was concentrated at Simpsonville. In 1962, Edward G Pickett and Walter Shank built the Atholton Village Shopping Center, which was one of the first commercial properties taken over by Columbia Research & Development (Rouse)in 1965. The same year the historic Volkmann home burned down by arson shortly after being purchased for the Holiday Hills Development.

Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was established in 1853, under the name De Oostpost (\\"The Eastern Post\\"); it was the second newspaper published in Surabaya. Although the initial publication was limited to advertisements, the newspaper eventually began including news and items of general interest, including filmSee, for instance, and book reviews.See, for instance, The name was changed in 1865 to Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, which remained in use until the newspaper was shut down in 1942, following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Although for most of its existence the newspaper was dated using the Gregorian calendar, from 17 May to 6 June 1942 (during the occupation, which lasted until 1945) it used the Japanese kōki (皇紀) calendar. The Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was reestablished in 1945 as the Nieuwe Courant (\\"New Courant\\"); through 1946 it was billed as the official newspaper of the Allied Military Administration-Civil Affairs Branch, a semi-military organization tasked with restoring Dutch colonial administration and law in the recently proclaimed Republic of Indonesia, which claimed most of the Indies.

Early life Dinnerstein was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, in 1943 to pharmacist Louis and homemaker Sarah Dinnerstein. One of two children, his older brother Harvey Dinnerstein is also an artist. Education and career Dinnerstein holds a Bachelor of Arts in History from the City College of New York. He studied painting and drawing at the Brooklyn Museum Art School with Louis Grebenak, David Levine, and Richard Mayhew. He was a member of the faculty at the New School for Social Research, Parsons School of Design, and New York City Technical College. He lectures widely and has lectured at Pennsylvania State University. Style and influences Dinnerstein's art is mostly in the figurative style, with folk, expressionistic, and surrealistic influences, possessing a \\"narrative\\" and \\"psychological edge\\". He uses a variety of media, pencils, charcoal, and oil paints. Dinnerstein renders still-life's, but most of his work involves portraiture or human figures. He often \\"paints the figure in unexpected juxtaposition with landscape or interior elements,\\" of which Dinnerstein says, > What interests me is the ability of Degas, Balthus, Lucian Freud and Antonio > López García ... to deal with the figure ... to create art ... rich in > scale, yet abstract adventurous, experimental ... deeply human ... a > combination of modernism and tradition of skill medium and ... a fresh, > personal response to the human form in art ... Hopefully my work speaks to > these issues. Often the human figures are portrayed against a background of hyperreality, or in dreamy surreal landscapes. Light plays an important role in Dinnerstein's work achieving \\"an inwardness ... in the play of light that radiates from the object and renders it mysterious.\\" or makes \\"Brooklyn sunlight on an ordinary floor seem supernatural.\\" The use of light contributes to Dinnerstein's paintings being described as \\"magical realism\\". In early Dinnerstein works, strong left-right symmetry prevails, although later works are noted for their asymmetry. Dinnerstein draws on diverse sources for inspiration: Northern European art (Albrecht Dürer, Hieronymus Bosch), Mexican art (Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera), as well as literature (D. H. Lawrence, August Strindberg) and film (Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock). The Fulbright Triptych Dinnerstein's most notable painting, The Fulbright Triptych, was started in Germany in 1971 while he served as a Fulbright Scholar in Graphics. It was completed in 1974. A largely autobiographical work, it combines stark realism with American figurative tradition to produce a secular rendering of the usually religious form, the triptych. Writer Jonathan Lethem commented: \\"Simon Dinnerstein's 'The Fulbright Triptych' is one of those singular and astonishing works of art which seem to imply a description of the whole world merely by insisting on a scrupulous gaze at one perfect instant.\\" The oil-on- wood painting consists of three panels approximately 14 feet wide, depicting a graphic artist's studio. Three figures, representing the Dinnerstein family, occupy the outer panels. The central panel consists of the artist's desk, engraving tools, a copper disk of the commissioned Fulbright engraving project, and an outward view in perspective of Hessisch Lichtenau (near to Kassel). Plants, photographs, old master's paintings, children's grade school writing, and an exit visa from Russia, appear tacked to the wall of the studio. The \\"Triptych\\" is noted for its symmetry, meticulous detail, mixture of textures, and sense of space. Widely praised, with each viewer bringing a different sensibility and interpretation of the work, the painting is the subject of numerous essays, articles, and books, including \\"The Suspension of Time: Reflections of Simon Dinnerstein's The Fulbright Triptych\\" edited by Daniel Slager, published 2011. Among the many who have commented on the painting are art critic John Russell, Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas M. Messer, art historian Albert Boime, artist George Tooker, writer Anthony Doerr, composer George Crumb, poet Dan Beachy-Quick, actor John Turturro, and Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri. Personal life In 1965, Dinnerstein married Renée Sudler, a noted educational consultant. Renée Dinnerstein is the author of the book Choice Time: How to Deepen Learning Through Inquiry and Play, PreK-2 published in August 2016. She runs the popular blog, Investigating Choice Time: Inquiry, Exploration and Play. They have a daughter, Simone Dinnerstein, a concert pianist. Both wife and daughter (as an infant) figure prominently in The Fulbright Triptych as well as other works. Dinnerstein resides in Brooklyn, where, in addition to practicing his art, he teaches classes on art history and appreciation.

Herzer flourished in music prior to and during World War I. The Columbia recording of his 1912 composition, \\"Everybody Two-Step\\" — performed by ragtime pianist Mike Bernard on December 2, 1912, in New York City — is the first recording of ragtime music. It became a hit and coincided at the start of a renewed craze for ragtime and dance — fifteen years after William Krell's \\"Mississippi Rag\\" had been published, the first known published music with \\"rag\\" in the title. Several other recordings of \\"Everybody Two-Step\\" became hits. Herzer composed three other hits — a 1913 piano rag, \\"Tickle the Ivories\\" – which also became hit as a vocal arrangement; a 1914 foxtrot song, \\"Get Over, Sal\\"; and a 1916 Hawaiian waltz song, \\"Aloha Land\\". Other compositions — including his 1908 piano ragtime two- step and barn dance, \\"The Rah-Rah Boy\\", and his 1913 rag turkey trot, \\"Let's Dance\\" — were internationally distributed.  Career  Of the 13 compositions by Herzer in the United States copyright records, there are 8 extant musical scores in national, academic, civic, and private libraries. The piano rolls and recordings of 4 of those works far exceed the number of compositions. As of 2014, at least 2 of Herzer's works are included in the repertoire of ragtime artists today. Herzer published his music while working for insurance agencies in San Francisco. Beginning 1901, when he was 16, until about 1904, Herzer was a clerk for insurance agents Gutte & Frank (Isidor Gutte; 1833–1908; Julius Gutte; 1828–1900; and William Frank; 1839–19??). From 1904 to 1920, Herzer was an insurance adjustor and broker for Christensen & Goodwin (Charles H. Christensen; 1839–1921; & Benjamin Frank Goodwin; 1859–1945) at 241 Sansome Street — the same address as his publishing company. From 1920 to 1924, he was the manager of the city department (in San Francisco) for Bentley & Waterman (Leroy Vernon Bentley; 1883–1932; & Clyde Waterman; 1868–1950). In 1924, Herzer became the manager of the city department (in San Francisco) for Glens Falls Insurance Company, headquartered in Glens Falls, New York. Music critic Winthrop Sargeant, in 1975, stated that the best ragtime came from outside New York and he cited Herzer & Brown, Wallie's first publishing company, as being among publishers of some of the best, earliest, and most imaginative rags. The title from Herzer's 1914 composition, \\"Get Over, Sal\\", was a turn-of-the-19th-century African-American expression for a slow-drag dance step that was incorporated in a variation of the fox trot. The expression had been published in an earlier song, \\"Music Hall Song\\", copyrighted 1879 — popularized by Jenny Hill, the 'Vital Spark': :: You may get over water-butts, :: You may get over fountains, :: But I'll take particular notice :: That you don't get over Sal. A song rendition of \\"Everybody Two-Step\\", published in 1913, became a popular hit in vaudeville. The solo piano and song versions of \\"Everybody Two-Step\\", his 1913 composition, \\"Tickle The Ivories\\", and his 1916 composition, \\"Aloha Land\\", were hits.

His mother, Elizabeth (née Ulrich; 1855–1923) was born and raised in France, and emigrated to the United States in 1860. Hugo, Sr., among other things, was engaged in civic service for the City of San Francisco, namely as Deputy Tax Assessor from about 1891 to 1901, then City Cashier in 1902 of the License Department of the Tax Assessor, and in 1905, Expert Searcher, Tax Office of San Francisco. Hugo, Sr., was also a member and officer of the Turners; and, also was a member of the German-American Republican Club of San Francisco, and the Grant and Wilson Club. ; Siblings Wallie was the youngest of five siblings. One of his two brothers, Hugo G. Herzer, Jr. (1879–1921), was an operatic vocal instructor, first in Honolulu, in various capacities, including a position at the Honolulu School of Dramatic Art, from about 1902 to 1918. Hugo studied voice with Francis W. Stuart (1865–1939) at The King Conservatory of Music (Frank Louis King; 1854–1914) in San Jose in 1899. Hugo was a pedagogical of Francesco Lamperti. Hugo married Agnes Lovell Lyle (maiden; 1887–1951) on March 2, 1907, in Honolulu. Agnes was a soprano, pianist, and piano teacher. In 1918, they both resettled in San Francisco. After the death of Hugo, Jr., in 1921, Agnes remarried Robert Montgomery Gehl (1888–1971). ; Spouse Wallie married Sylvia (née Scalmanini; 1885–1955) in San Francisco on May 4, 1910. Sylvia's father, Carlo Scalmanini (1820–1891), had been a California Forty-Niner, a major vineyard owner-winemaker, co-owner, with Baptiste Frapolli (Italian spelling, Battiste; 1821–1890), of the Swiss Republic Restaurant at 19 Long Wharf, and, with Frapolli, a wholesale and retail grocer.

He based his pseudonym on two artists who greatly influenced him, the landscape painter Shitao and writer Lu Xun.  Life and art  Shi Lu came from a wealthy land owning family in Renshou County, Sichuan Province. A student of the Chinese traditional painting style guohua, he studied at Dongfang Art College and West China Union University in Chengdu (1934-1940). He joined the Communist Party of China and in 1949 at the first national assembly was elected and executive member of the China Artists Association. In 1955 Shi Lu travelled to India to supervise the overall art design of a Chinese pavilion at an international expo. In 1956 he attended the Asian-African National Art Exhibition in Egypt. During these travels he made many sketches of the people he observed developing his technique of Western drawing and Chinese brushwork. In 1959 he was commissioned to produce a large scale painting to be displayed in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the forming of the People's Republic of China. By this time Shi Lu had developed a mature style and looked upon the opportunity to create what is now considered his masterpiece. The painting depicts Mao Zedong standing on the precipice of the Shaanxi mountains in 1947, leading his troops against the National Revolutionary Army. The painting was criticized for the small image of Mao with a grand landscape and his back turned to the viewer. One critic saying that he appeared \\"isolated and at the end of the road\\". Shi Lu refused to revise the painting when asked and further uncompromising stances on his artistic vision lead to his eventual persecution by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. His art was publicly denounced, he was put in prison and not allowed to touch a brush for three years. During this time Shi Lu suffered a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After his release in 1970 he quickly returned to painting, taking some of the water color landscape sketches he had made in India and Egypt and adding a dense overlayer of ink painting that exhibited a darker and more erratic style, similar to that sometimes found in the work of people with schizophrenia.Britta Erickson, “Shi Lu: Giving Form to the Incomprehensible,” A Life in Chinese Art: Essays in Honour of Michael Sullivan, ed. by Shelagh Vainker and Xin Chen (Oxford: Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, 2012), pp. 48-58.

The music was written by Max Goldt and Gerd Pasemann, the lyrics by Max Goldt. The song caricatures a sightseeing tour around a rather normal city.  Background  Max Goldt, having worked previously as tour guide for sightseeing tours in West Berlin, reflects on his thereby gathered experiences . The song appeared on the album Von Bullerbü nach Babylon and was also released as a single.  Music  The instrumentation depends on simple musical aspects. There is a simple drum backbeat, the bassline, and a string instrument riff as well as a trumpet fanfare. The song is in 4/4 time and characterized by the constant change between B minor and A major chords. Ironically, the song starts with seagulls screeching and a fog horn, which is inappropriate introduction considering Erlangen's inland location.  Content  The song is spoken rhythmically, from the perspective of a tour guide, showing German-speaking tourists around Erlangen, but from an outside perspective, without any useful information about what makes the city unique. (\\"Here on the left is the church / It was built in the past [...] / Now we're approaching the marketplace / in the local dialect they call it \\"das Stadtzentrum (city center)\\") And trite, unoriginal statements such as (\\"This place is unknown for miles around.\\" or \\"Here are the past and present joined.\\"). In the refrain, Max Goldt imitates a feminine tourist group, singing \\"That is a nice young man / He knows everything about this! / There are so many useful facts about Erlangen!\\" ; the first syllable of the word \\"Erlangen\\" is stretched out. The lyrics portray a philistine chat between the tourists and the tour guide about German places, regions, and tours, with Goldt playing every role himself. First the city- dwellers reply with praise, (\\"I love the Erlangers' humor, [...] and Erlanger is so hospitable.\\"), then the tone shifts gradually rougher, with the tour group outraged at long-haired, the Jeans-wearing tour guide, and the cigarette butts littering on the street. The result of the discussion is the tourists boasting about their respective hometowns, (\\"Well Martha, In Bielefeld, everything oh so clean.\\" -\\"I'm from Wolfsburg, there everything is oh so beautiful.\\")  Reception  The song reached #36 on the German Single Charts, making Wissenswertes über Erlangen the most commercially successful song the band has ever made. Foyer des Arts performed the song, among others, in music shops and on the ZDF Hit Parade. In 2001 Bürger Lars Dietrich published a cover version.

Originating in the former jagir (feudal estate) of Bijolia (near the town of Bijolia in Bhilwara district), the movement gradually spread to neighbouring jagirs. Leadership to the movement was provided, at different times, by Sitaram Das, Vijay Singh Pathik, and Manikyalal Verma. The movement continued till 1941 after a bitter struggle lasting about half a century, gained national attention and resisted state oppression.C. S. K. Singh, \\"Bhils' Participation in Politics in Rajasthan in the 1920s \\" Social Scientist, University of Chicago Press, v 13, no. 143 (April 1985) p. 32.  Origins  Land revenue and other taxes were the main issues behind the movement. Bijolia was a jagir in Mewar State, ruled by the Parmar jagirdar, one of the leading 16 nobles (solah umrao) in Mewar State. Peasant discontent started after the accession of Rao Sawai Kishan Singh ji to the jagir in 1894. \\"Rao Sawai\\" was the title given to the Jagirdars of the Pawar /Parmar dynasty who ruled on Bijolia; Rao Sawai Kishan Singh ji shuffled the administrative personnel of the jagir and the new officials were encouraged to realize more revenue from peasants. Certain taxis (lagat) which were formerly imposed under extraordinary circumstances for short periods were now made to last longer.  Early Phase (1897-1915)  In 1897, a delegation of peasants consisting of Nanji Patel of Berisal and Thakari Patel of Gopal Niwas went to Udaipur and attempted, in vain, to get an audience with the Maharana. But the Maharana did institute an inquiry which concluded that certain taxes had been arbitrarily imposed by the jagirdar. The Maharana issued a warning to the jagirdar, which only resulted in him retaliating against the two delegates who had gone to Udaipur. The peasants continued appeals to the jagirdar who ultimate granted some concessions to the peasants in 1904. The concessions granted in 1904 did not last. In 1906, Prithvi Singh ascended to the jagir and withdrew the concessions granted in 1904 and instructed officials to collected increased taxes. Failing to get a hearing from the jagirdar, some peasants chose not to cultivate their lands and migrated to neighboring Gwalior and Bundi. Some more concessions were promised to the peasants on 1914, but never implemented.  Second Phase (1915-1923)  In 1916, war fund contributions were further imposed on the peasants which lead to renewed dissatisfaction. It was in 1916 that Bhoop Singh alias Vijai Singh Pathik arrived in Bijolia and organized the peasants under the Bijolia Kisan Panchayat to oppose payments to the war fund and other taxes. Petitions were sent to the Maharana, and stories of the agitation started receiving publicity in various newspapers. Partially because of the negative publicity in the press, the Maharana appointed a commission of inquiry, which found the peasants' grievances to be genuine and recommended the abolition of some taxes and begar (unpaid or forced labor). But the Maharana failed to act on the report and the oppression as well as the movement led by Pathik continued. After the failure of the inquiry to yield results, Pathik advised peasants to cultivate unirrigated lands which were subject to lower taxes. In February 1920, the Maharana appointed another commission of inquiry which also reached the same conclusions as the earlier commission. Other jagirdars feared that the Maharana's intervention would result in a chain reaction, and influenced the Maharana to not act on the commission's report. Leaders of the Bijolia movement attempted to obtain the support of the Indian National Congress (INC). In December 1919, Pathik succeeded in putting a resolution before the INC in support of the Bijolia peasants, but the resolution failed, largely because the INC leadership disfavored agitation in the princely states. Nonetheless, these efforts attracted the attention of national leaders towards the Bijolia movement and the movement obtained the support of some of the leaders. Meanwhile, the peasant movement of Bijolia continued to get increased publicity and began to spread to other jagirs such as Begun, Parsoli, and Bhinder. In December 1921, the Mewar State Resident reported: > The unrest is now spreading to Bhinder, an estate under the darbar > management, where the cultivators are refusing the pay revenue. The > situation in Bijolia and in the neighbouring thikanas of Parsoli, Begun and > Basi has distinctly deteriorated. There is a general refusal to pay revenue. > There is threat of violence if any attempt is made to collect revenue or to > enforce official orders...An atmosphere of discontent is being created and > the movement is spreading. This compelled the Agent to the Governor General to visit the various jagirs of Mewar and direct the jagirdar and Mewar State to conclude an agreement with the peasants. Finally, the Bijolia Agreement was signed on 11 February 1922. The agreement brought about the following changes: reduction in amount of talwar bandhi, no taxes when there was no cultivation, reduction in chatoond tax and land revenue, etc.  Third Phase (1923-1941)  By 1928, there was a general complain among the peasants of Bijolia that the agreement of 1922 had been violated by the jagirdar. The peasants also complained that taxes on unirrigated lands were very high and jagir authorities were interfering in the affairs of the Bijolia Kisan Panchayat.

Adjacent to the church is a 16th-century monastery. Construction The original church of San Vicenzo had been built in the 16th century, but refurbished over the following centuries. The church is now also dedicated to Caterina de' Ricci (1522-1590), who had been a nun associated with the adjacent convent of San Vicenzo Ferrer. About 150 years after her death, Catherine was beatified (1732) and subsequently canonized (1742). After her beatification, this church underwent major refurbishment (1732-1735) under Giovanni Battista Bettini (il Cignaroli) and Girolamo Ticciati. Saint Catherine's remains are displayed under the main altar. The reconstruction and canonization led to making the church a minor basilica. Both the interior and exterior are baroque in style.Prato Tourism site. Works of art The church houses a Nativity (16th century) by Michele delle Colombe, a marble relief of Madonna and Child (15th century) by Matteo Civitali, and the Martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alessandria by Vincenzo Meucci. On the wall of the nave and above the altar is a series of framed relief sculptures by Girolamo Ticciati and Vicenzo Foggini (died 1755), son of the better-known sculptor Giovanni Battista Foggini, depicting various miracles associated with Saint Catherine. The ceiling canvases are by Pucci. Adjacent monastery Next to the church is the cloistered monastery founded in 1503 and later expanded during the life of Caterina de’ Ricci. The atrium leads to the Papalini Madonna Chapel. Legends hold that the chapel houses a 16th-century maiolica bust that caused the Spanish troops of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Pope Julius II to spare the monastery during the 1512 Sack of Prato. The altar has two panels depicting and Assumption and Scenes from the Passion (circa 1576) by Michele delle Colombe; it also houses precious paintings by Simone Pignoni (Saints Catherine and Tecla); Lorenzo Lippi (St Francis di Sales); Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio (Madonna and Child); as well from the studio of Giovanni Battista Naldini.

Several witnesses reported a car and a pickup truck fell into the river, however only the two occupants of the car were recovered, no other vehicles were found and no other persons were ever reported missing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the temporary bridge collapse was the selection by the Hamilton County Engineer's Office of a design by the National Engineering and Contracting Company that did not consider lateral loads and the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to promptly close the bridge when it became subject to significant debris loading. Contributing to the cause of the collapse was the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to submit the bridge design plans to the Ohio Department of Transportation for review as required by state law.Accident Investigations - NTSB - National Transportation Safety Board References Category:Bridge disasters in the United States Category:Bridge disasters caused by engineering error Category:Transport disasters in 1989 Category:1989 disasters in the United States Category:Road bridges in Ohio Category:1989 in Ohio Category:Transportation disasters in Ohio Category:U.S. Route 52 ","title":"Miamitown bridge collapse"},{"id":"42788698","text":"Christina Novelli (born 27 November 1986) is a British DJ, vocalist and songwriter who resides in London.

It was part of Shell Presents, which consisted of monthly presentations of standalone television dramas and comedies. It aired on GTV-9 in Melbourne and ATN-7 in Sydney, as this was prior to the creation of the Seven Network and Nine Network. A set of pictures from the show appear in a 1960 edition of The Age Unlike most of the Shell Presents presentations, it wasn't aired live. Although produced in Melbourne, it aired in Sydney first. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Plot Set in a Polish- Jewish household in Melbourne. Aaron tries to prove his individuality by taking money from his wife Shirley's blue vase. Sister in law Esther tells Shirley that marriage is a state of war and she needs to take a stand. Aaron goes drinking and asks his brother in law Herman why he lets Esther bully him. Shirley gets advice from her mother in law, Reba. Cast *Alan Hopgood as Aaron *Coralie Neville as Shirley *Sue Saffir as Esther *John Bluthal as Herman *Rachel Holzer as Reba *Edward Howell as Uncle Ben *Don Crosby as a barman *Joe Hudson as Taxi Driver Production The script was written by Richard Benyon (1925–99), author of the play The Shifting Heart.Richard Benyon at Austlit Reception The TV critic from the Sydney Morning Herald said the play was \\"refreshing for its observation that there don't have to be lurid triangles or melodramatic boozing or homesacrificing career obsessions to put marriages on the rocks\\" but still lacks something of the warmth by which a Chayefsky allows his commonplace characters to arouse deeply compassionate interest in their everyday conflict, collaboration and compromise. Beynon's people... are carefully observed and their talk runs pretty naturally, but some want of rich detail in the writing and among... [the]players prevented them from making a compelling appeal.\\" The Age wrote that \\"the story wasn't 'big' enough to carry an hour of television. Otherwise the drama is quite good. The cast performed well.\\" Radio Adaptation The play was adapted for radio in 1960. There was another adaptation in 1963. The cast: Nigel Lambert (Aaron), Mark Kelly (Herman), Miriam Karlin (Reba), Patricia Gallimore (Shirley), Amber Cecil (Esther), John Cazabon (Uncle Ben), Brian Harrison (Barman), and Brian Harrison (Taxi driver).

Part of the Avondale Mills, the area is architecturally significant for the first sawtooth roofed mill in Alabama, and the mill village represents a relatively intact example of an early 20th century company town. The mill and its village were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The mill closed in 2006, and burned in 2008 while being dismantled for scrap. History The mill was built in 1902–1903 on the northwestern outskirts of Pell City, at the confluence of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and Southern Railway lines. Sumter Cogswell purchased the of land in 1890 after stopping to change trains in the town. By 1902, he had convinced Atlanta industrialist George W. Pratt to build a cotton mill on the land. The following year, the Pell City Manufacturing Company began operational with 21,000 spindles and 640 looms. In 1919, the mill was purchased by the Birmingham-based Avondale Mills Company. At the time, the mill employed 600 people. Avondale spent over $1 million improving the mill and village homes during the 1920s and 1930s. A hospital was built in 1925, streets in the village were paved, and 40 new houses were built, bringing the total to 163 by 1945. Mill capacity was expanded to 25,584 spindles, 800 looms, and 800 employees by 1940. The mill village was incorporated into Pell City in 1956, and the company gradually sold the houses to private owners. See also: Automation and foreign competition caused employment to decline beginning in the 1970s. In the aftermath of a deadly train crash at one of its facilities in South Carolina, Avondale closed its plants in Pell City and Sylacauga and sold several others in July 2006. Architecture =Mill= Chimney stack, demolished in November 2015 The main mill building was a two-story structure built of brick and measuring approximately 225 by 640 feet (70 by 200 meters). The mill featured a sawtooth roof, which allowed clerestory windows to be placed on the vertical roof sections for light and ventilation. It was the first saw-toothed mill in Alabama. The walls were lined with windows and blind arches, separated by stepped string courses. The walls are punctuated by protruding buttresses at the bases of the sawtooths and small vents that open into the clerestory area. Four two-story pavilions spaced along each of the long sides of the building contained restrooms and staircases. The interior was divided into four large rooms: the main mill room at the north end, the picker room and dye room in the middle, and the weaving room at the south end. In addition to the main building, the complex consisted of engine and boiler rooms, a chimney stack, reservoir and water works, a warehouse, an office building, a cottonseed oil mill, and a cotton gin. Today, only the office and a water tower remain. The chimney stack was demolished on November 24, 2015 after two attempts at an implosion and then weakening the base with a backhoe. Part of the chimney fell on the backhoe cab, the driver was uninjured. =Mill village= The mill village was constructed at the same time as the mill, and originally consisted of 115 houses. The village grew to a height of 163 houses in 1945. Roads were laid out in a grid pattern to the north and east of the mill complex. Houses were built to four different plans: a pyramidal four-room plan with a central chimney and front porch that was either shed roofed or gable roofed; a side-gabled three room plan, which featured two equal-sized rooms with a rear shed room; a hipped roof three-room plan, where the main entry opens into a vestibule leading to the other two rooms; and a cross-gable six-room plan, which was built for managers and foremen and featured a central hipped roof with hipped roof ells on either side. The majority of the houses have been modified, many with rear additions and enclosed porches. In addition to houses, the village also contained a school (closed in the 1960s and demolished in the 1970s), community house (used until it was demolished in the 1980s), and a hospital (built in 1925 and demolished in 1965).

It is the first species of columbid to be described from pre-Pliocene fossil deposits in the Australasian region. Description The pigeon was described from fossil material (a left coracoid) collected in 2008 from the Saint Bathans Fauna, above the base of the Bannockburn Formation, by the Manuherikia River in the Central Otago region of the South Island. It was a large pigeon, most similar to, and apparently most closely related to, the clade containing Hemiphaga, Lopholaimus and Gymnophaps, especially the former. Etymology The genus name Rupephaps comes from Rupe (a widespread Polynesian word for “pigeon” which is also an honorific for the New Zealand pigeon in Māori mythology), with the Greek phaps (“pigeon”). The specific epithet ”taketake” is Māori for “long established”, “ancient” or “original”, referring to the age of the fossil specimen.

It occurs in roughly 1 in 1,000 twin deliveries and 1 in 90,000 deliveries overall. Most often, locked twins are delivered via Caesarean section, given that the condition has been diagnosed early enough. The fetal mortality rate is high for the twin that presents first, with over 50% being stillborn. Description There are two types of locked twins: breech/vertex and vertex/vertex. In breech/vertex presentations, which are much more common, the first twin is in the breech position, presenting feet-first, and the second is in the cephalic (vertex) position, presenting in the normal head-first manner. In these cases, the chin of the first twin locks behind the chin of the second twin while in the uterus or birth canal, preventing vaginal delivery. In vertex/vertex presentations, where both twins are positioned for head-first delivery, the two heads become locked at the pelvic brim, preventing either fetus from passing through the pelvic inlet in a vaginal delivery. Contributing factors to the interlocking of twins include uterine hypertonicity, small fetal size, and reduced levels of amniotic fluid following rupture of the membranes. It is more likely to occur in women with large pelvises, young primigravidae (young women in their first pregnancy), and pregnancies with monoamniotic twins. Management If locked twins are diagnosed in early delivery, before either twin is born, both fetuses can be delivered by Caesarean section. If one fetus has been partially born, attempts can be made to disimpact the twins manually, such as by the Zavanelli maneuver, with a view to performing an assisted delivery with ventouse or forceps. If the diagnosis is made only after the first locked twin has died in the birth canal, or if it is not expected to survive, the first twin may be decapitated and its head pushed up to allow safe delivery of the second twin. At least one case has been reported where hexoprenaline was used to relax the uterine smooth muscle to thereby temporarily inhibit labour and disimpact the fetal heads. Outcomes Since locked twins are often diagnosed in the late stages of delivery, it is often too late to intervene to save the life of the first twin and thus there is a high rate of stillbirth, estimated to be over 50%.

She was born in Paddington to Polish-Jewish emigrants Stanley Kaplun and Adel, née Gutman. She attended local primary schools and then Parramatta and Sydney Girls' high schools. She topped the state in history in the Leaving Certificate, also winning first-class honours in English and Latin; consequently she won a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Law in 1956. In that year she married Neville Albert Cohen; they would adopt one son in 1960 before Cohen gave birth to another in 1961. She was the first woman employed as a solicitor at Minter Simpson, before moving to F. W. Jenkins and Co. which she eventually bought after Jenkins's death. She explored the option of teaching when her sons began attending school and enrolled externally at the University of New England, but discovered that teaching positions were only readily available north of Tamworth and gave up the idea. She joined the Parents and Citizens (P&C;) Association at Coogee and by 1968 rose to the state council. She ran as a candidate for the Defence of Government Schools group in the 1969 federal election, challenging the Speaker of the House, Sir William Aston, for his seat of Phillip; she received 2.3% of the vote. In 1973 she was elected president of the Federation of P&C; Associations, and significantly increased the influence and political involvement of the organisation. Awarded an OBE in 1978, she was a parent representative on the Education Commission and vice- president of the Australian Council of School Organisations. She retired in 1980. Following her retirement from the P&C; presidency, Cohen served part- time on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Consumer, Trading and Tenancy Tribunal, and was chairwoman of the New South Wales Privacy Committee from 1983 to 1993.

Population Those who consider themselves a part of this movement are a minority of those who consider themselves to be Eastern Orthodox Christians, but True Orthodox writers have argued that in missionary areas such as the United States, Orthodox membership numbers may be overstated, with the comparative number of True Orthodox as up to 15% of the Orthodox population. The number of official Orthodox in America is approximately 415,000, whereas True Orthodox may comprise up to 40,000 Americans combined. In Russia, it has been said by some clergymen that up to a million Russians may be True Orthodox of different jurisdictions, though the Greek Old Calendarists and True Orthodox Russians are often cited at 1.7-2 million together. History Most True Orthodox Christians hold to a reading of history from the age of the Apostles to the 1920s virtually identical to that of the mainstream Orthodox Church. True Orthodox Christians added the additional word \\"True\\" to distinguish themselves from those whom they believe to have abandoned Orthodox doctrine after this period. (The term orthodoxy, from Greek ὀρθοδοξία, orthodoxia, already means \\"correct belief\\" or \\"right opinion\\".) Most True Orthodox historians agree that the rise of the Ecumenical movement manifested through the change of the church calendar in the 1920s throughout the Orthodox world, as well as the 1927 capitulation of Metropolitan Sergius (Stragadorsky) to the Soviet authorities marked the formative period for True Orthodoxy, where those Orthodox who either would not go along with changes to the calendar or were disobedient to the civil authorities began to organize against the official church in earnest and create parallel hierarchies. While the early period in the history of True Orthodoxy marked a \\"grey area\\" in terms of how to regard those who went along with the innovation, today most True Orthodox disregard \\"World Orthodoxy\\"—at least the hierarchy—as part of the church at all. Because of the late departure of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) into union with the Moscow Patriarchate with the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, some jurisdictions glorify saints who are still well-regarded among mainstream Orthodox, such as St John of Shanghai and San Francisco (†1966) and St Philaret of New York (†1985). Doctrine Like mainstream Eastern Orthodox Christians, True Orthodox remain Chalcedonian in their Christology and accept the doctrinal authority of the Church's Seven Ecumenical Councils. However, they strongly reject the ecumenical movement and consider most ecumenical dialogues, such as those with the non-Chalcedonians and Roman Catholics, to be invalid and unacceptable, citing canonical prohibitions against joint prayer. Nevertheless, True Orthodox Churches are considered to have certain characteristic views and positions distinct from the Eastern Orthodox Church: #They reject the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Moscow Patriarchate, and those Churches in communion with them, accusing them of heresy and placing themselves under bishops who do the same. #They use the Old Julian liturgical calendar exclusively and denounce the Revised Julian calendar as a wayward, Latinising innovation. Among those satisfying these two characteristics, there is the historically disputed requirement that they consider the sacraments of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Moscow Patriarchate to be invalid and ineffectual for salvation. For the most part, True Orthodox repudiate such communion under a rejection of ecumenism and Sergianism (Named for Metropolitan Sergius) as heresies, and many Churches have added those alleged heresies to the anathemas on the Sunday of Orthodoxy. There is less dispute on the issue of the rejection of official mysteries in the present day after the change of the Cyprianites (who openly rejected this principle), however, historically this issue has been a source of disagreement. The issue of whether the EP and MP are graceless or simply viewed as incorrect persists to the present day in differences in baptism and chrismation policies (official and unofficial) among the so-called True Orthodox Churches. Organisation As Eastern Orthodox Christianity is both collegial and local in structure, there is no single organization called the \\"True Orthodox Church\\" nor is there official recognition among the \\"True Orthodox\\" as to who is properly included among them. While some unions have taken place even up to the present, the majority of True Orthodox are only secondarily concerned with reunion as opposed to preservation of Eastern Orthodox teaching. Organisations that are usually included in the True Orthodoxy are: *Greek Old Calendarists Holy Synod of Milan Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles Autonomous Orthodox Metropolis of Ecuador and Latin America True Orthodox Metropolis of Germany and Europe *Old Calendar Bulgarian Orthodox Church *Old Calendarist Romanian Orthodox Church *Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church *Churches descending from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia *Serbian True Orthodox Church Inter-church relations and intercommunion Many True Orthodox synods do not publish information concerning other synods, citing limited interest outside of their locality. Some are open to dialogue, whereas some hierarchies are more insular and prefer to keep to themselves. For example, the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (ROAC) through the late Metropolitan Valentine, stated informally that they no longer actively seek to join other True Orthodox churches, but would not refuse incoming dialogue. A number of unions, however, between different True Orthodox bodies have taken place for limited periods of time in recent decades, even to the present. The most notable of these was the reunion between the Greek Old Calendarists and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (1971–85) and the current union of the Church of the Genuine Orthodox Christians, ROCOR under Metropolitan Agafangel (Pashkovsky), and the Old Calendar Bulgarian Orthodox Church.

The photograph depicts the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, on fire after being struck by American Airlines Flight 11 at 8:46 a.m., and shortly before its collapse at 10:28 a.m. Visible in the photograph are numerous people trapped in the upper floors of the building, hanging out of windows because of the intense smoke and heat. They were unable to escape because all of the stairwells and elevators above the 91st floor were severed by Flight 11's impact. The photograph was later nominated for the Pictures of the Year International award, coming in second place. A similar, closer photograph, taken at a different angle by Jeff Christensen of Reuters, was later used in an attempt to identify the victims depicted. Background On September 11, 2001, four commercial aircraft were hijacked and deliberately crashed as part of a coordinated attack on the United States by extremist al-Qaeda terrorists. Two, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. respectively. Both towers collapsed in less than two hours because of structural failure caused by the weakening of their support beams from the intense fire; the South Tower at 9:59 a.m., and the North Tower at 10:28 a.m. Because of the angle at which Flight 11 impacted, nobody above the 91st floor of the North Tower was able to escape the building, trapping 1,344 people. All of them died because of either smoke inhalation or jumping/falling from the building, or the eventual collapse of the building at 10:28 a.m. Numerous photographs were taken of victims as they fell from the building or were trapped inside of it. The Falling Man, taken by Associated Press photographer Richard Drew, has become one of the most famous and controversial images of September 11. Impending Death was taken by freelance photojournalist Thomas Dallal, shortly before the collapse of the North Tower. Present in the image are roughly 50 people, located on the floors occupied by Cantor Fitzgerald (which lost 658 employees in the attacks, or nearly two-thirds of its workforce) and Windows on the World (which lost 73). Identification In September 2006, Vanity Fair published an excerpt from the book Watching the World Change, detailing the efforts of family members of 9/11 victims to identify their relatives in the photograph and similar ones taken at other angles.

Background  Reverend Wesby of Aurora, Illinois, created this revamp of an old gospel song \\"I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on Jesus\\" while spending time in Hinds County jail during the freedom rides. The song spread and became part of the civil rights movement as did many others during the time, this song being one of the more notable pieces. The song has been printed more recently by Pete Seeger in his book Everybody Says Freedom. Songs such as these were used as a means of protest propaganda, uniting together those with causes to demonstrate for. This song falls under the folk music genre, which was popular in the 1930s and 1940s but lost momentum. The genre was revived in the 1960s during the civil rights movement. Music and singing were an integral part of the movement, many of them being adapted from earlier religious songs.

Religious career Fagnano was ordained as a priest. In 1752 he became a canon, and in 1755 he was appointed as archdeacon. Mathematics Fagnano is known for Fagnano's problem, the problem of inscribing a minimum-perimeter triangle within an acute triangle. As Fagnano showed, the solution is the orthic triangle, whose vertices are the points where the altitudes of the original triangle cross its sides.. Another property of the orthic triangle, also proven by Fagnano, is that its angle bisectors are the altitudes of the original triangle. Fagnano also partially solved the problem of finding the geometric median of sets of four points in the Euclidean plane; this is the point minimizing the sum of its distances to the four given points. As Fagnano showed, when the four points form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, the geometric median is the point where the two diagonals of the quadrilateral cross each other. In the other possible case, not considered by Fagnano, one point lies within the triangle formed by the other three, and this inner point is the geometric median. Thus, in both cases, the geometric median coincides with the Radon point of the four given points.... http://www.izwtalt.uni- wuppertal.de/Acta/NAE1775.pdf References Category:1715 births Category:1797 deaths Category:Italian mathematicians Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Giovanni Fagnano"},{"id":"42789725","text":"Indie Director is a 2013 independent film that was directed by Bill Zebub.

He has nothing but disdain for people who compromise their own values in order to succeed and vows never to fall into the trap that has lured other directors away from their own creative visions. However when one of Bill's films becomes wildly popular in the porn industry- despite Bill never intending it to be seen as such- he finds himself preparing another movie in order to take advantage of his newfound success, essentially compromising his own strict standards.

Built around 1605 to replace an earlier windmill, it was used as a gristmill until it was severely damaged in 1950. The mill was bought by the local government and restored in 1961, and it was listed as a national heritage site in 1974.  History  Inscriptions from 1804 An earlier windmill had existed on the same location and was mentioned in 1557 as \\"the mill in the Sundertsch Field\\" (de molen in de Sundertsche Akker), and this earlier windmill was in its turn a replacement of a nearby watermill, De Poelmolen, which was mentioned in 1438. The earlier windmill was destroyed in 1584 by Spanish troops and the building of a new mill took several years. The new windmill was first mentioned in 1605. The mill was owned by the margrave of Bergen op Zoom and was a banmolen (nl), meaning peasants in the locality were obligated to use this mill to grind their wheat. In 1794 it became property of William V, Prince of Orange and baron of Breda. Banmolens were taken out of common law during the French revolution, meaning that people could choose where they wanted to grind their wheat, and in 1830 the mill became private property. The mill was in constant use as a gristmill until the wooden windshaft broke in 1950, which caused the sails to crash into the ground, making the future of the mill uncertain. The mill was bought in 1959 by the municipal government of Zundert and restored in 1961. It ceased to be an active gristmill, but was in functioning order. The mill needed another restoration in 1991 when it was taken apart and rebuilt.  Description  \\"Kruisplaat\\", the junction of the crosstree and double quarterbars. De Akkermolen was built as an open trestle post mill, meaning that the whole body of the mill that houses the machinery is mounted on an uncovered single vertical post or trestle, around which it can be rotated to bring the sails into the wind. The mill is made out of painted wood, the body is partially covered in tar and it has a roof of bituminous waterproofing. The mill has four common sails of span, that drive a wheel of 71 cogs, driving the lantern pinion stone nut, which has 15 staves. The stone nut drives a pair of Cullen millstones from Mayen (\\"Cullen\\" for \\"Cologne\\", where such millstones were marketed from), 17 hands in diameter or . Inside the mill inscriptions can be found by the miller and his assistants from 1804. The mill was listed as a national heritage site (nr 41113) on 11 July 1974.

It was originally released by the Daiei Motion Picture Company (later acquired by Kadokawa Pictures). Zatoichi and the Fugitives is the eighteenth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot Zatoichi comes to a village which is the local hub of family farms in a silk growing region. The most prominent villager is Matsugoro who apparently will stop at nothing to bring all under his control. The small village does have a kind doctor, Dr. Junan, who lives with his daughter Oshizu. Boss Matsugoro appears to be very prosperous. As a minor gangster he has a large retinue of toughs he uses to bully and intimidate others and he owns a silk weaving factory where at least some of his weavers work to service debt and are actually in bondage. He has also acquired some appointed local political position from which he plans to gain more benefits. Into this situation enters a group of fugitives - criminals who have caused a lot of trouble elsewhere and have a reputation for shocking and unnecessary cruelty. Amongst this group of men is one woman - Oaki. Also amongst these men is Ogano, the disowned son of Dr. Junan from whom he's been estranged since Ogano killed a man 5 years ago in the town of Edo. The fugitives and Boss Matsugoro reach an arrangement where he will allow them to hide out above his weaving factory and they will do some unnamed strong arm favors for him when asked. Zatoichi and the fugitives have some minor clashes due to their pugnacity but Ogano prevents these situations from escalating as he knows Zatoichi could easily kill his fellow ruffians if provoked because he witnessed Zatoichi slice a snake in half as it fell through the air from a tree branch when he happened to pass Zatoichi eating his lunch in the woods previously. Zatoichi and Boss Matsugoro have a final falling out when Zatoichi compels him to allow a sick weaver to return home with her father, release her from compulsory service and burn her bond papers. Matsugoro orders his henchmen to get rid of the troublesome Zatoichi and they wound him severely but he escapes and goes into hiding. Believing Dr. Junan or his daughter Oshizu to know Zatoichi's whereabouts, Matsugoro has his men severely beat the doctor but he refuses to talk. They then take his daughter away and since she won't talk either, Matsugoro orders his men to strip her naked and hang her up. Just as they begin to struggle with her Zatoichi appears to rescue Oshizu and Dr. Junan. Still weak and severely wounded from his previous fight, Zatoichi nevertheless defeats those holding Oshizu and instructs a redeemed Oaki to lead her to her father back at the factory. The women are discovered by some of Matsugoro's men and are about to be questioned when Zatoichi appears and kills all but 1 who runs to warn Matsugoro. This leads to a large running sword battle inside Matsugoro's house where many of his men and finally Matsugoro himself are slain by Zatoichi. Following the house battle Zatoichi goes outside to rest and is set upon by the fugitives, all of whom he kills until only Ogano is left to face him. Just as their battle is about to begin the women and Dr. Junan arrive to witness Zatoichi swiftly put an end to Ogano's life. Oshizu cradles her brother's dead body and cries while Zatoichi backs up and then begins to walk away, alone again as the background song says \\"only the cicadas cry ...\\".

Likewise, while Ichi has been shown to get hurt or be in trouble, this entry finds him beaten and shot, bloodied and battered more so than usual, or at least until the next to last, original cycle film, Zatoichi In Desperation.\\" References External links  *Zatoichi and the Fugitives (1968), review by Steve Kopian for Unseen Films (20 February 2014) *REVIEW: Zatoichi 18 – Zatoichi and the Fugitives (1968), by Mark Pollard for Kung Fu Cinema *Zatoichi and the Fugitives (1968), review by D.

Career Delamétherie was born in La Clayette. He edited Journal de physique, de chimie, d'histoire naturelle et des arts from 1785. He was elected member of Leopoldina in 1792. He was a supporter of the French Revolution, but opposed to the Jacobins, and was forced to leave Paris during the Reign of Terror, interrupting publication of the Journal de physique until 1797. Numerous minerals were first systematically described by Delamétherie. In 1795, Delamétherie first described the Lherzolite (which he named after the site of its discovery, Étang de Lers in the Pyrenees). Delamétherie was an advocate of transmutation of species.Corbey, Raymond. (2005). The Metaphysics of Apes: Negotiating the Animal-Human Boundary. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.

Springer. pp. 11-39. Delamétherie held similar views to Jean-Baptiste Lamarck but differed on his views on the history of earth. According to science historian Pietro Corsi: > Delamétherie believed in a primeval ocean in which rocks and life were > formed through countless ages thanks to processes of crystallization, and > maintained that all life forms known to man developed from a restricted > number of prototypes equally generated by specific forms of crystallization. Delamétherie was supportive of the inheritance of acquired characteristics and suspected that Lamarck had copied some of his ideas.

Life Born at Croxdale Hall on 4 April 1817, was fifth and youngest son of William Thomas Salvin, of Croxdale Hall, Durham, by his wife Anna Maria, daughter of John Webbe-Weston, of Sutton Place, Surrey. Educated at Ampleforth College, he served for several years in the militia, joining the 3rd battalion of the York and Lancaster Regiment in 1839 and retiring with the rank of captain in 1864. In 1857 Salvin inherited from his uncle, Thomas Monnington Webbe-Weston, the Tudor mansion Sutton Place, Surrey, but usually lived at Whitmoor House on the estate. He trained young otters to follow him like dogs and sleep in his lap, and at one time kept a wild boar with collar and bell. He was active in field sports when past 70. Salvin died unmarried on 2 October 1904, at the Manor House, Sutton Park, Guildford, and was buried in St. Edward's cemetery, Sutton Park. Field sports Fishing by Proxy, Salvin and his cormorants are represented in James Clarke Hook's painting Salvin's early love of hawking was stimulated by an acquaintance with John Tong, assistant falconer to Thomas Thornton. In 1843 he made a hawking tour with John Pells, employed by the Hereditary Grand Falconer of England, through the north of England; and when quartered with his regiment in Ireland he used to fly falcons at rooks and magpies. He also for some years kept goshawks and made successful flights with them at mountain hares, rabbits and water hens. He invented a portable bow-perch for these birds. He was a prominent member from 1870 of the old Hawking Club which met on the Wiltshire Downs. Salvin was also the first to revive successfully in England the old sport of fishing with cormorants. In 1849 he took with four birds in 28 days some 1200 large fish at Driffield, Kilney, and other places in the north of England. His famous cormorant \\"Izaak Walton\\", brought from Rotterdam, was stuffed in 1847 by John Hancock and went to the Newcastle-on-Tyne Museum. Another, \\"Sub-Inspector\\", the first known cormorant bred in confinement, was exhibited at the Fisheries Exhibition, South Kensington, in 1883, and was sent to the London Zoological Gardens after Salvin's death, surviving till 1911. Works Salvin, a contributor to The Field, collaborated in two works on falconry. The first, Falconry in the British Isles (1855; 2nd edit. 1873), with William Brodrick of Chudleigh, had figures of hawks drawn by Brodrick, and compared to the work of Joseph Wolf. Salvin also assisted Gage Earle Freeman with Falconry: its Claims, History, and Practice (1859), the Remarks on training the Otter and Cormorant appended to it being his.

Protected area status The South Islet was declared a closed area in 1909 in respect to birds and animals under the Birds Protection Act 1900 following lobbying by the South Australian Ornithological Association which was concerned about the ongoing survival of one of the few remaining colonies of New Zealand fur seals on Kangaroo Island. North Islet was declared a sanctuary in September 1955 to protect the fur seal population ‘from shooting parties from the mainland’. Both islets were declared as fauna reserves under the Fauna Conservation Act 1964 and as a fauna conservation reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967. Both Islets were proclaimed as part of the Flinders Chase National Park in 1972 and have since been specifically proclaimed as prohibited areas in order to protect breeding fur seals and seabirds. As of December 2012, the waters around both islets are part of a restricted access zone located within the boundaries of the Western Kangaroo Island Marine Park.

It is located about north west of Wiluna and east of Meekathara in the Mid West region of Western Australia. The Meekatharra to Wiluna railway used to traverse the property. Frederick Albert Crews along with his son C. V. Crews and Reginald Grant acquired Paroo in 1923 and set about stocking the property with sheep. Crews and Grant put Paroo up for auction in 1927 after they dissolved their partnership. At this time Paroo occupied an area of and was stocked with 5,500 sheep. Approximately had been enclosed by of fencing dividing it into 10 paddocks. Stock were watered by 14 wells, most which were equipped with mills and troughs. The Crews family retained Paroo and appointed J. C. Baker as station manager. In 1934 the property was put back on the market after Clarrie Crews fell to ill health. At his time the station occupied an area of and divided into 14 large paddocks. The property boundary was almost completed fenced falling short of finishing the boundary fence. The property had 21 wells and was stocked with 8,000 sheep. In 1950 the station produced 115 bales of wool from a flock of 4,500 sheep.

These tissues are classified as either laticiferous tissues or glandular tissues. Introduction  Cells or organizations of cells which produce a variety of secretions. The secreted substance may remain deposited within the secretory cell itself or may be excreted, that is, released from the cell. Substances may be excreted to the surface of the plant or into intercellular cavities or canals. Some of the many substances contained in the secretions are not further utilized by the plant (resins, rubber, tannins, and various crystals), while others take part in the functions of the plant (enzymes and hormones). Secretory structures range from single cells scattered among other kinds of cells to complex structures involving many cells; the latter are often called glands. Epidermal hairs of many plants are secretory or glandular. Such hairs commonly have a head composed of one or more secretory cells borne on a stalk. The hair of a stinging needle is bulbous below and extends into a long, fine process above. If one touches the hair, its tip breaks off, the sharp edge penetrates the skin, and the poisonous secretion is released. Glands secreting a sugary liquid—the nectar—in flowers pollinated by insects are called nectaries. Nectaries may occur on the floral stalk or on any floral organ: sepal, petal, stamen, or ovary. The hydathode structures discharge water—a phenomenon called guttation through openings in margins or tips of leaves. The water flows through the xylem to its endings in the leaf and then through the intercellular spaces of the hydathode tissue toward the openings in the epidermis. Strictly speaking, such hydathodes are not glands because they are passive with regard to the flow of water. Some carnivorous plants have glands that produce secretions capable of digesting insects and small animals. These glands occur on leaf parts modified as insect-trapping structures. In the sundews ( Drosera ) the traps bear stalked glands, called tentacles. When an insect lights on the leaf, the tentacles bend down and cover the victim with a mucilaginous secretion, the enzymes of which digest the insect. See insectivorous plants. Resin ducts are canals lined with secretory cells that release resins into the canal. Resin ducts are common in gymnosperms and occur in various tissues of roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive structures. Gum ducts are similar to resin ducts and may contain resins, oils, and gums. Usually, the term gum duct is used with reference to the dicotyledons, although gum ducts also may occur in the gymnosperms. Oil ducts are intercellular canals whose secretory cells produce oils or similar substances. Such ducts may be seen, for example, in various parts of the plant of the carrot family (Umbelliferae). Laticifers are cells or systems of cells containing latex, a milky or clear, colored or colorless liquid. Latex occurs under pressure and exudes from the plant when the latter is cut.  Laticiferous tissues  These consist of thick walled, greatly elongated and much branched ducts containing a milky or yellowish colored juice known as latex. They contain numerous nuclei which lie embedded in the thin lining layer of protoplasm. They irregularly distributed in the mass of parenchymatous cells. Laticiferous ducts, in which latex are found are again two types- # Latex cell or non-articulate latex ducts # Latex vessels or articulate latex = Latex cells = Also called as \\"non-articulate latex ducts\\", these ducts are independent units which extend as branched structures for long distances in the plant body. They originates as minute structures, elongate quickly and by repeated branching ramify in all directions but do not fuse together. Thus a network is not formed as in latex vessels. = Latex vessel= Also called \\"articulate latex ducts\\", these ducts or vessels are the result of anastamosis of many cells. They grow more or less as parallel ducts which by means of branching and frequent anastamoses form a complex network. Latex vessels are commonly found in many angiosperm families Papaveraceae, Compositae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, etc. = Function = The function of laticiferous ducts is not clearly understood. They may also act as food storage organs or as reservoir of waste products, or as translocatory tissues.  Glandular tissues  This tissue consists of special structures; the glands. These glands contain some secretory or excretory products. A gland may consist of isolated cells or small group cells with or without a central cavity. They are of various kinds and may be internal or external. Internal glands are * Oil-gland secreting essential oils, as in the fruits and leaves of orange, lemon. * Mucilage secreting glands, as in the betel leaf * Glands secreting gum, resin, tannin, etc. * Digestive glands secreting enzymes or digestive agents * Special water secreting glands at the tip of veins External glands are commonly short hairs tipped by glands. They are * water- secreting hairs or glands, * Glandular hairs secreting gum like substances as in tobacco, plumbago, etc. * Glandular hairs secreting irritating, poisonous substances, as in nettles * Honey glands, as in carnivorous plants.

A small side-street of the same name branches off Milligan Street (on the east side) between Murray and Wellington Streets, and forms a second intersection with Wellington Street. History Milligan Street appears in maps of Perth from as early as 1838, running from what is now Spring Street to Murray Street. It was named after Dr William Lane Milligan, the original owner of the land on the southern end of Milligan Street, south of St Georges Terrace. In 1863 the section of Milligan Street south of St Georges Terrace was rezoned and transferred to Matthew Hale, the Anglican Bishop of Perth. By 1894 Milligan Street extended north to Wellington Street. =Melbourne Street= The small side-street between Murray and Wellington Streets was originally part of a separate (although intersecting) thoroughfare named Melbourne Street that ran north-east from the corner of Milligan and Murray Streets, past Wellington and Roe Streets, and (in 1845) to James Street. In 1923 Melbourne Road was renamed to Milligan Street and the two were considered a single road when the Perth City Council adopted a committee recommendation: However the name Melbourne Road continued to be used at least until the 1940s. In December 2017 the City of Perth Council agreed to a request from Landgate and the portion of Milligan Street between Roe and James Streets was renamed back to Melbourne Street.

Ananthapadmanabha Rao and his friends B K Subba Rao, G S Keshavacharya and a few others became the youth workers. =Kannada Sahitya Sammelana= In the year 1932, the Kannada Sahitya Parishat organised its 18th annual literature conference. Legendary scholar and poet, DV Gundappa was chosen as the president of the conference. Odlemane Aatmaram Shastri, Shenoy Master, DM Siddhalingaiah and others were part of the presiding committee. First in the line amongst the youth workers was Ananthapadmanabha Rao. Ananthapadmanabha Rao, drew the attention and appreciation of DVG, who inspired him to become a lifetime member of Kannada Sahitya Parishat. DVG handed over the left over funds of the conference and suggested Ananthapadmanabha Rao to establish a Kannada Sangha at Coorg. Thus, in the year 1932, with the blessings of DVG, the first ever Kodagu Kannada Sangha was established and started. Ananthapadmanabha Rao became the first Director of the sangha and in the later days he also served as its Secretary and Vice-President. Ananthapadmanabha Rao was also selected as the member of Kannada Sahitya Parishat's working committee and became the representative of the Coorg State. He conceptualised and organised the Vasanta Sahityotsava (the spring festival of literature) every year.

As part of the event, Gamaka Bhageeratha Kalale Sampathkumaracharya performed Kaavya Vachana or Gamaka Vachana for 3 consecutive days. Inspired by this performance, Ananthapadmanabha Rao was drawn towards to the art of Gamaka. Until then, Ananthapadmanabha Rao was a Harikatha artiste. He had also composed the Jadabharatha Upakhayana (a piece of poetry) specifically for the Harikatha aspirants. Gamaka as a new art form drew his attention and interest. In the later days he got himself admitted as a pupil of Gamaka Vidwan Krishnagiri Krishna Rao and mastered the art of Gamaka. In the year 1942, he started to teach Gamaka to aspiring students and contributed to the development and survival of the art form. Ananthapadmanabha Rao had a special interest in Hindustani music ragas. Poet D R Bendre was one of the biggest admirers of Ananthapadmanabha Rao as a Gamaki. On the occasion of Bendre's 50th birthday, he invited Ananthapadmanabha Rao to his house to perform Kavya Vachana and encouraged him. Rashtrakavi Kuvempu once told him, \\"You have the blessings of Krishnagiri Krishna Rao. You are just not a singer, but you are the cuckoo of Coorg (Kodagina Kogile)\\".

It covers the majority of the population, and is directly funded by the national budget and allocated on a mixed per-capita basis by the National Health Security Office (NHSO). The programme was launched in 2002 during the government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, based on foundational developmental work by public-health civil servants, especially Doctor Sanguan Nitayarumphong, beginning in the 1980s. At its launch, the programme required a copayment of 30 baht (approx. 1 US dollar) per visit, and it became widely known by that name. Thailand became one of the first few middle-income countries to implement universal healthcare, and the system was internationally praised and contributed greatly to Thaksin's political popularity. The system has, since its original implementation, seen various modifications, including the removal of the 30 baht copayment (which happened following Thaksin's overthrow by coup in 2006) and the provision of direct access to antiretroviral therapy, haemodialysis and other chronic diseases.

Life Born on 3 June 1820 at Tamworth, Staffordshire, was son of Capt. Charles Earle Freeman of the 69th Regiment by his wife Mary Parsons. After private education he was admitted a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 8 July 1840, and graduated B.A. in 1845, proceeding M.A. in 1850. Ordained deacon in 1846 and priest in 1847, Freeman held a curacy at Geddington, Northamptonshire, from 1846 to 1854, and the perpetual cure of Emmanuel Church, Bolton-le-Moors, from 1854 to 1856. He was then incumbent of Macclesfield Forest with Clough, Cheshire, till 1889, when he became vicar of Askham, near Penrith, and private chaplain to the Earl of Lonsdale. This living he held for the rest of his life. Freeman died at the vicarage, Askham, on 15 December 1903, and was buried at Macclesfield Forest Chapel. Hawking Freeman was a devotee of hawking, introduced to the sport by William Brodrick of Belford, Northumberland (later of Chudleigh). In Northamptonshire he enjoyed his first experience with a kestrel-hawk, equipped with a hood of home manufacture, and he afterwards flew sparrowhawks, merlins and peregrine falcons at pigeons and larks. In his isolated Cheshire parish, Freeman hawked grouse with peregrines on Buxton Moor; also at Swythamley, the property of his friend, Philip Brocklehurst of Swythamley Park, Staffordshire. Next to peregrines, Freeman preferred goshawks, with which he killed hares and rabbits, with or without ferrets. Lord Lilford praised Freeman's influence on English falconers. Works To The Field, Freeman contributed articles on falconry for a quarter of a century, as \\"Peregrine\\", and on them he based two books: *Falconry; its Claims, History, and Practice (1859), written with Francis Henry Salvin; Freeman had the main share in this handbook for beginners, with plates by Joseph Wolf; * Practical Falconry; and how I became a Falconer (1869), more discursive. Freeman contributed the section on \\"Falcons and Falconry\\" to Lord Lilford on Birds (ed. A. Trevor-Battye, 1903); and had an essay printed in connection with falconry and the opening of Alexandra Park, London (1871). In later life Freeman wrote four Seatonian Prizes for his poems: The Transfiguration (1882), Jericho (1888), Damascus (1893), and The Broad and the Narrow Way (1894). He also published Five Christmas Poems (1860, reprinted from The Field, with additions, and Mount Carmel, a Story of English Life (1867). Family Freeman was twice married: # On 5 January 1848 to Christiana (died 1886), daughter of John Slade of Little Lever, Bolton-le-Moors, with whom he had eight sons and two daughters; # In April 1891 to Mary, daughter of Francis William Ashton, cotton-spinner and calico printer, of Hyde, Cheshire, who survived him.

Facts Homebuyers on a Liverpool estate owned their property enjoying the right (having an easement) to use estate roads, drains, the promenade, and sea walls subject to the obligation to contribute to repair and upkeep. Brizell, a successor of an original purchaser (buyer from the developer), wished to continue to benefit from all of these but claimed he should not need to pay, as payment was a positive covenant. Law It was already trite law that positive covenants routinely bind successors in leasehold land. Until this case, conflicting decisions pointed to a narrow category of application of positive covenants (chiefly limited to for example the obligation to erect and maintain railings or fences) could bind successors (beyond the first covenantee, that is purchaser or donee) owning freehold land. This decision clarified that positive covenants, such as the responsibility to maintain or repair infrastructure, attached to a right to enjoy and use that infrastructure, can routinely attach to freeholders who choose to use that infrastructure. Judgment Mr Justice Upjohn held (decided) that Brizell could not claim the benefit of the facilities without having to pay for them. He could not exercise the rights without paying his costs of ensuring that they could be exercised. Significance The case was approved by Rhone v Stephens, but also distinguished.

The film premiered on October 10, 2013 at the BFI London Film Festival and released to DVD on July 2, 2014. It stars Caitlyn Folley and Ian Duncan as a young couple that decides to film a sex tape in an abandoned hospital, only to discover that it is not as abandoned as they believed it to be. The film has had a predominantly negative critical reception. Synopsis The film opens with a detective informing Jill (Caitlyn Folley) that her boyfriend Adam (Ian Duncan) is dead and that two others are missing. The film then cuts to Adam shooting film of Jill with the intention of turning it into a film about her and her paintings. He jokingly asks to film a sex tape and despite Jill initially declining, he then films the two of them trying to have sex in various locations. During a drive home, Adam points out The Vergerus Institute for Troubled Women, an abandoned hospital rumored to have given various women abortions. He idly mentions that he would like to hold a party there and have Jill display her paintings, which prompts Jill to push the two into exploring the hospital. The two are nearly caught by a passing policeman, which prompts them to stay in the hospital and explore until they are sure he has left. During this time Adam talks Jill into letting him tie her down to an operating table, after which he pretends to leave her. While he is gone, a female ghost attacks and possesses Jill. When Adam returns, Jill shows no outward sign of her state and agrees to a sexual encounter with Adam, during which she suffers a nose bleed. They decide to leave but find that their car has been towed. Jill manages to persuade her friend Ellie (Diana Garcia) to pick them up, but Ellie's boyfriend Bobby (Chris Coy) talks Jill into going back inside. This elicits jealousy from Adam, who believes that Jill is only doing this because she is attracted to Bobby. Once inside Adam keeps trying to get everyone to leave and nearly comes to blows with Bobby, who keeps flirting with Jill. Bobby threatens Adam with a gun and wanders off with Jill. Ellie persuades Adam to wait behind while she goes to find the others, knowing that Adam would likely spark a lethal fight. After waiting a while, Adam goes looking for them and eventually finds a hysterical Jill standing near blood spatters and gun shells. Jill vaguely tells Adam that she had a fight with Ellie after she caught Bobby kissing her. They continue to wander around the hospital looking for the exit and the pair finds the hospital's medical record archive, where Jill is engrossed by the records of Nicolette, a lobotomized patient that had exhibited aggression and suicidal tendencies. Adam pushes Jill to leave, which provokes her to anger. As they continue trying to find the exit they come across the ghost of Nicolette, who systematically terrorizes them. Jill tries to call the police, only for the dispatcher to angrily tell her to go to the office and get away from Adam. Jill takes off and Adam follows her until they get to the office, where Jill gets trapped inside. He breaks down the door and finds Jill holding a videotape. Adam tries to take it from her, at which point Jill runs away. He tries to find her by looking at the hospital's still working security system, which shows Jill having a threesome with Ellie and Bobby before shooting them both to death. Adam then physically locates Jill in a bathroom where she is acting erratic and demands to perform oral sex on him before shooting him to death. The film then shows footage of Nicolette getting anesthetized and it is implied that she is raped before getting lobotomized. The film ends with a man filming Jill giving him oral sex, which ends with her biting his penis off. Cast *Caitlyn Folley as Jill *Ian Duncan as Adam *Chris Coy as Bobby *Diana Garcia as Ellie *Julie Marcus as Nicolette \\"Colette\\" McLeod *Daniel Faraldo as Doctor *Eric Neil Gutierrez as Detective Reception Critical reception for Sx Tape has been predominantly negative. Fangoria and SciFiNow both expressed disappointment that the movie did not build more upon its premise, as SciFiNow commented that \\"the idea of a horror film attacking the exploitative nature of sex tapes and beyond has potential. However, there’s no clear indication that this premise was given any real thought beyond comparing this exploitation to the institutional abuse suffered by women in mental hospitals, a comparison that is made with all the subtlety of a head-butt.\\" Twitch Film wrote an extremely negative review for Sx Tape, stating that \\"SX_Tape is a masterclass in how not to structure your film, found footage or otherwise.\\" The A.V. Club and The Hollywood Reporter were slightly more positive in their reviews but overall panned the movie, as The Hollywood Reporter felt that while the movie was at times \\"gripping and claustrophobic\\", Sx Tape \\"does not have the gory excess and high body count to impress hardcore horror fans, but it also lacks the sly wit, deeper subtext and formal originality which might have earned it broader mainstream appeal.\\" References External links * * Category:2010s erotic films Category:2010s ghost films Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:American films Category:American haunted house films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American erotic horror films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Found footage films Category:Hospital films Category:Films about spirit possession ","title":"Sx Tape"},{"id":"42791117","title":"Waves (film)"},{"id":"42791137","text":"Some of the restored Chinese huts The Arrowtown Chinese Settlement is a heritage listed, historic village located in Arrowtown, New Zealand and set up by Chinese people during the Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s.

They are among the strongest known thermosetting plastics and are stable to solvents at pH > 3, but decompose to the monomers in acidic solutions. Synthesis Room- temperature synthesis of polyhexahydrotriazines Polycondensation of 4,4'-oxydianiline and paraformaldehyde. At low temperatures, a hemiaminal dynamic covalent network is formed, which is plasticized with ~27% N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and water. Heating to higher temperatures yields a polyhexahydrotriazine. See also supplementary materials Various PHTs have been synthesized at room temperature in one step in the early 2000s; they were considered impractical due to their poor mechanical properties. It was later elucidated that, due to the temperature of synthesis, the poor mechanical properties observed were likely due to poly(hemiaminal) formation and not PHT formation. In 2014, Jeanette Garcia and a team of researchers at IBM Almaden Research Center, US, developed a new type of PHT (1.6) in what has been called a \\"happy accident\\". Garcia had left out a reagent when preparing her mix of chemicals. When low heat was applied to the beaker of paraformaldehyde and 4,4ʹ-oxydianiline, it had created a hemiaminal dynamic covalent network (HDCN). Heating the HDCN to 200 °C transformed it into two new polymers: PHT 1.6 and an organogel known as polyhemiaminal (PHA) Properties The PHT 1.6 has a yellowish color. It is resistant to solvents at pH > 3, but decomposes into monomers within a day in acidic solutions at pH < 2\\\\. This property is unusual for thermosetting plastics and allows easy recycling. This PHT has a Young's modulus exceeding 10 GPa, which is among the highest for a thermosetting plastic; it can be further increased by ~50% by dispersing carbon nanotubes in the polymer. The PHT is brittle, and cracks when strained to 1%. Upon heating, it softens at a glass transition temperature of ~190 °C and decomposes at ~300 °C.  Possible uses  A number of industries could benefit from the use of PHT in manufacturing parts and devices due to its recyclability, lightweight structure, and strength: * Aerospace - PHT used in the development of wings, tails, bodies, and rutters would provide a lightweight, durable vessel for both commercial and personal aircraft applications. PHT in combination with PHA could be used to adhere aircraft pieces that are exposed to harsh environmental conditions and high speeds. * Automotive - When manufacturing automobiles, PHT would provide a light, high performance option for auto body parts such as panels, hoods, and exterior trim pieces. * Semiconductors - Semiconductor chips and transistors made of PHT would allow for the reworking of defective electronics rather than having to discard the equipment.

It is owned and created by Afarin Neyssari. The gallery comprises two exhibitions halls for dual exhibitions based in the: Sheikh Bahaei area in northern Tehran. Aun calls itself the Iran's first commercial art space designed and built to showcase contemporary art. The building offers 120 square meters of open exhibition space, a five-meter high ceiling and a paneled roof to provide maximum natural light. The gallery's unique architectural features allow for exhibitions of various arts including painting, photography, sculpture, video, installation and performance. History Aun Gallery was established in September 2009 to promote young Iranian artists and support their contribution to Iran's cultural scene. The gallery holds ten to eleven solo exhibits per year, lasting approximately one month at a time. The gallery also hosted mixed media sculpture specialist Bita Fayyazi in 2009. The Vanak area has been popular with Iranian artists since the early 2000s, at which time it was a quiet residential area with light industry. More recently it has undergone extensive redevelopment with cafes, restaurants and media businesses. Sheikh Bahaei Square is a prime site with a central area of dining areas and shopping precincts.  Imprisonment of Owner  Aun's owner, Afarin Neyssari, and her husband Karan Vafadari were arrested in Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Intelligence Service (IRGIS) on 20 July 2016 when she was about to board a plane to travel to Italy in order to jump start an important art project, which was to prepare for Mr. Bizhan Bassiri’s solo exhibition at the Venice Biennale festival as approved and certified by the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and the Minister of Culture. Karan was supposed to join her a few days later on their trip, and to visit his three children who live in the US. Karan received a call from Afarin, and when he went to see her he too was arrested. Afarin and Karan were held in solitary confinement for over one month, and were not allowed to speak to a lawyer for 5 months. Afarin first spoke to a lawyer when she first showed up in court, 5 months after imprisonment. The Iranian judiciary has coerced the family to dismiss their chosen lawyer multiple times, and as of May 2017, they still have not found a suitable lawyer. As a Zoroastrian, Karan could be another example in a history of confiscation of Zoroastrians' property. Karan is a US citizen, and Afarin is a Greencard holder. A wave of public support for Karan and Afarin followed, from the artistic community within Iran, as well as from customers and friends of Aun Gallery. Robert Toscano, former ambassador from Italy to Iran, refuted the authorities’ justification for their detention in an open letter, saying that “One has to be truly gullible and the easy victim of propaganda” to accept such charges. He continued, “The reason must be a different one…political blackmail toward the US (of which [she is] also citizens), envy for their success, intimidation toward the Zoroastrian community, desire to grab their properties, [and] repression of contemporary art.” Media Aun Gallery has appeared in magazines and publications such as Bidoun, as well as other local and international publications. The gallery also featured in international travel magazine websites and online magazine The Culture Trip. Aun Gallery was also instrumental in the creation of the Tehran Gallery Guide, a dual English and Persian publication highlighting the upcoming month's art events in the Iranian capital. The publication ceased production in 2012. International work Aun's artists have exhibited globally with the gallery itself taking a summer excursion to the show fives artists' work in the Sydney Biennale in 2012.

The small number of known individuals of this species has put it under Schedule 5 (Rare) of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. However, Thismia rodwayi is not considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Biology Thismia rodwayi can be seen as a small reddish-yellowish flower – the lantern – seemingly without stem and leaves. The plant most often emerges from the forest floor or lies hidden under the litter. As it does not contain any chlorophyll, the mature plant consists of a flower stalk and roots, both devoid of chlorophyll.Listing Statement for Thismia Rodwayi (Fairy lanterns), Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/Documents/Thismia-rodwayi-LS.pdf (consulted on 2014-5-4) As a mycoheterotroph, Thismia Rodwayi is associated with a fungus, which is the true saprophyte. Its whole life cycle, and especially its reproduction, is still mostly unknown. =Description= Thismia rodwayi is, as botanist Mark Wapstra puts it, 'aptly described' by its common name: fairy lantern.M. WAPSTRA, B. FRENCH, N. DAVIES, J. O'REILLY-WAPSTRA, D. PETERS, 2005, A bright light on the dark forest floor: observations on Fairy lanterns Thismia Rodwayi F. Muell. (Burmanniaceae) in Tasmanian forests, The Tasmanian Naturalist, 127, pp. 2-18, http://www.ecotas.com.au It is a very small flower, only visible as an orange and red obovate floral tube of 10 to 18 mm in length. This flower is surmounted by six perianth lobes: three inner lobes curving inward, and three outer ones spreading outward. The flower lies atop a 0.5 to 3 cm long colourless and subterranean flower stem which bears six bracts, increasing in size toward the flower. The flower stem arises from the juncture of the 1 to 1.5 mm thick and 4 to 15 cm long roots. Each individual plant usually produces only one flower per bloom cycle, occasionally two; plants can be found in groups of 2 to 5 (and up to 12) in an area of less than 1 m2. Thismia rodwayi in bud. =Autecology= Thismia rodwayi occurs in wet eucalyptus forests, mainly Eucalyptus obliqua, E. regnans, E. delegatensis and E. viminalis, between 100 and 650 m above sea level. The potential habitat in Tasmania is estimated with the RFA (Regional Forest Agreement), such as \\"tall E. obliqua forest\\" (OT) or \\"wet E. viminalis forest\\" (VW). As occurrence data for the species are sparse, the potential habitat is much more widespread than the flower itself. On a local scale, potential Thismia areas are identified by a sparse canopy cover, and a damp, dense and cohesive topsoil with a thick litterfall.N. Roberts, F. Duncan, M. Wapstra, A. Woolley, 2003, Distribution, habitat characteristics and conservation status of Thismia rodwayi F. Muell. in Tasmania, 24p., http://www.ecotas.org.au =Biological life cycle= Thismia rodwayi's life cycle is still very poorly understood. As it usually appears in patches of closely situated individuals, it is generally accepted that both pollen and seeds are transported only short distances, which could explain why the plant occurs in only a fraction of its potential habitat. There currently exist two main hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of Thismia rodwayi's pollination: *Entomophily: Fungus gnats could be constrained inside the floral tube, and be forced to exit through the gaps between the anthers, thus coating themselves in pollen.K.R. Thiele, P. Jordan, 2002, Thismia clavarioides (Thismiaceae), a new species of Fairy Lantern from New South Wales, Telopea, 9, pp.765-771 *Zoophily: Mammals such as the potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) are known to feed on roots and subterranean fungus in similar habitats and could serve as pollinators. Another possible vector could be the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae). Vegetative expansion by stolons is also considered a possibility. =Mycoheterotrophy= Although earlierThismia Rodwayi, New Zealand Plant Conservation Network, 2014, http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=328 (consulted on 2014-04-04) regarded as a saprophyte, Thismia rodwayi is actually a mycoheterotroph, a non-chlorophyllous plant associated with a truly saprophytic fungus. The fungal hyphae are found in the cortical cells of the plant's roots, and also around those roots. Nutrients in rotting organic material are absorbed by the fungus and stocked as fat globules in the hyphal bladders of the fungus. The hyphal cells are then induced to discharge the fat globules into the cells of the plant, where they are turned into a polysaccharide, possibly glycogen. Rarity and protection Because of the anecdotal occurrence data concerning this plant, Thismia rodwayi is not listed by the IUCN. It is, however, listed on Schedule 5 (Rare) of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 under criterion B (species subject to stochastic risk of endangerment because of naturally small population sizes). One of the main difficulties in obtaining new data is the covert nature of the plant: although brightly coloured, it is often covered by litterfall, and non-specific botanical surveys have a high probability of missing it. Improved surveys, however, have been increasingly successful in detecting Thismia rodwayi, and the amount of data is growing. Although most potential habitat zones are protected by being located in national parks, riparian reserves or other protected areas, Thismia rodwayi may not be negatively impacted by normal native forest silvicultural operations such as clearfelling, selective cutting, or even regeneration burning. On the other hand, a conversion to monospecific plantations may be deleterious to plant populations.

Built c. 1870 by Alpheus Gay, a local building contractor, it is one of the state's most elaborate Italianate houses. The house was owned for a time by the nearby Currier Gallery of Art, but is now in private hands. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Alpheus Gay House is located in a predominantly residential area northeast of downtown Manchester, at the northwest corner of Myrtle and Beach streets. It is a 2½-story wood frame structure, with gabled roof section and a flushboarded exterior. It has complex massing, a roofline studded with paired brackets on the main block and modillions on the servants' wing, and a three-story tower above its main entry. The main entrance is sheltered by a porch with square posts and decorative arches below the cornice. Windows have a variety of surrounding treatments, including rounded arches, peaked lintels, and bracketed flat lintels with projecting cornices. A carriage house is attached to the house's eastern servants' wing, with vertical board siding and simpler but similar styling to that on the house. The house was built about 1870 by Alpheus Gay, a prominent local contractor, as his personal residence. It appears to have borrowed heavily from design patterns published by Andrew Jackson Downing and Calvert Vaux. It is a late but particularly well-executed example of the Italian villa style promoted by those architects, and has undergone only modest alterations since its construction.
