She holds a degree in Arabic Studies from the University of Barcelona. She is the author of a personal essay on her bicultural identity, and three previous novels, the first of which earned her the 2008 Ramon Llull Prize, the 2009 Prix Ulysse, and was a finalist for the 2009 Prix M√©diterran√©e √âtranger. Life At the age of 8 she immigrated with her family to Catalonia, Spain. El Hachmi studied Arab literature at the University of Barcelona and currently resides in Granollers. She began writing when she was twelve years old and has continued ever since, first as entertainment, and later as a means to express concerns or to reflect and re-create her own reality, in the (at least) two cultures to which she belongs.CRAMERI, Kathryn (2014): ‚ÄúHybridity and Catalonia Linguistic Borders: the Case of Najat El Hachmi‚Äù, in Flocel SABAT√â (ed.) Hybrid Identities. An interdisciplinary approach to the roots of present. Peter Lang, s/p. Career Her first book, Jo tamb√© s√≥c catalana (I am also Catalan, 2004), was strictly autobiographical, dealing with the issue of identity, and the growth of her sense of belonging to her new country. In 2005, she participated in an event sponsored by the European Institute of the Mediterranean, along with other Catalan writers of foreign descent, including Matthew Tree, Salah Jamal, Laila Karrouch and Mohamed Chaib. During the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2007, where Catalan culture was the featured guest of honour, she traveled to various German cities to participate in conferences in which she offered her perspective on contemporary Catalan literature. El Hachmi has made frequent appearances in the media, including Catalunya Radio, and the newspaper Vanguardia. In 2008, she won one of the most prestigious award in Catalan letters, the Ramon Llull prize, for her novel L'√∫ltim patriarca (The Last Patriarch). The novel tells the story of a Moroccan who immigrates to Spain, a sometimes despotic patriarch who enters into conflict with his daughter, who breaks with the traditional values of the old country to adapt to the new, modern culture in which she finds herself.

Education Marmaduke Sheild was born in 1858 in Landawke, near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. In 1875, he began a distinguished student career at St George's Hospital winning the Brackenbury Prize and two William Brown Exhibitions before graduating MRCS in 1879. After starting as a house surgeon at St George's, Sheild then spent three years from 1881 in Cambridge, simultaneously as a house-surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital and an undergraduate at Downing College; during this period he qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883.Obituary of Marmaduke Sheild, The British Medical Journal, 26 August 1922 Surgical career After leaving Cambridge Sheild held posts at St George's as anaesthetist and Westminster Hospital, culminating in a seven-year period at Charing Cross Hospital where he was assistant surgeon, aural surgeon, demonstrator of anatomy and lecturer in practical surgery. In 1893 he returned again to St George's, becoming full surgeon in 1900. While practising as a surgeon he also acted as an examiner for Cambridge University and the Society of Apothecaries. During his career Sheild published many articles and books; his most notable work was a Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Breast which was published in 1898. Retirement and war service Sheild's career as a surgeon was cut short in 1907 at the age of 49 when he accidentally inoculated himself while operating, resulting in a long illness requiring many operations. He retired to Budleigh Salterton and during the First World War was sufficiently recovered to be able to provide surgical services at the nearby military hospital at Exmouth. Death and legacy Sheild died on 5 August 1922 in the Hebrides after suffering a seizure. By his will he established the Marmaduke Sheild Fund at Cambridge University which initially funded the Sheild Readership in Pharmacology and medical scholarships which are awarded to the present day.Statutes and Ordinances of the University of CambridgeCambridge University Database: Readerships In 1946 Cambridge University honoured Sheild by naming its newly established chair in pharmacology in his name.

The AN/PRC-6 is a walkie-talkie used by the U.S. military in the late Korean War era through the Vietnam War. Raytheon developed the RT-196/PRC-6 following World War II as a replacement for the SCR-536 \\"handy-talkie\\". The AN/PRC-6 operates using wide-band FM on a single crystal controlled frequency in the 47 to 55.4 MHz low band VHF band. History The AN/PRC-6 was designed and used by the US military during the Korean War, and was in use by the US Marine Corps as late as 1972. It was commonly known as the \\"walkie-talkie,\\" \\"banana radio,\\" or \\"Prick-6.\\" The AN/PRC 6 was also used by various NATO nations. It was manufactured under license in France (\\"TR-PP-8\\") and Germany (6 channel version or PRC6-6). Israel too manufactured single channel equipment. Modernization of the AN/PRC6 resulted in various solid state crystal controlled and synthesized radios, usually with higher output ratings. For example, Greek valved sets were refurbished in the mid-1980s and converted into single channel solid state one watt units housed inside the original casing. These updated solid state versions were given various designations such as PRC-6T (for \\"Transistor\\"), PRC - 6T/180 (180 channel synthesized unit) and PRC - 6GY. Specifications The AN/PRC-6 circuit uses 13 vacuum tubes for the receiver and transmitter combined, all but one subminiature. The unit may be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and adjusting tuned circuits, using tuning indicator ID-292/PRC-6. The tuning chart inside the case is not accurate enough to properly align the unit. The AN/PRC-6 uses a whip antenna, with a BNC connector for an external direction finding antenna. There is an optional handset H-33*/PT that can be connected to the AN/PRC-6 by a cable. The RT-196 can be carried over the shoulder using a provided web sling. Rated power output is about 250 mW. The range is about one mile (1.5 km), but much less in jungle.AN/PRC-6 Walkie Talkie OliveDrab.com The frequency range of the PRC-6 covers the 6 meter amateur radio band (50-54 MHz in the US and Canada, 50-52 MHz in the United Kingdom), and the many versions of these sets are relatively available and cheap (around ¬£30-40 in the UK) in comparison to other vintage military radios. As a result, many examples have been put on the air, although practical operation is hampered by the necessity of building new, custom power supplies (the original dry batteries, which supplied +1.5, +4.5, +45 and +90 volt outputs, being unobtainable or display pieces only) and the limited output power and range. In addition, a separate crystal and laborious retuning is required every time a frequency change takes place. For this reason in the US 51 MHz is used as a net frequency at many radio events, necessitating only the one crystal. Gallery File:PRC-6open.agr.jpg  AN/PRC-6 with case opened.

Meeks is an American investigative journalist. He founded the online publication CyberWire Dispatch in 1994 and helped pioneer the world of online journalism. At its peak, Meeks estimated that CyberWire Dispatch was distributed to more than 800,000 readers via mailing lists and newsgroups. At the height of his online career, Meeks was \\"the most widely read reporter in cyberspace\\" according to J. D. Lasica. CyberWire Dispatch officially ceased publication in early 2004. Meeks's articles focused on the intersection of government and technology, and explored issues such as online rights - including free speech and the right to privacy - encryption, censorship, and the regulation of content. Meeks was the first journalist sued for libel in cyberspace while writing his CyberWire Dispatch. Journalist and author Dan Gilmor wrote in his book We the Media: \\"[Meeks] was, by most accounts, the first Internet journalist to be sued for libel. For all practical purposes, Meeks won the case; he paid nothing to the Ohio company that sued him over his critical report about the company‚Äôs business practices, though he did agree to notify the company before publishing anything else about it or the man who ran it. Meeks did pay his lawyers, including several noted First Amendment specialists who donated the vast majority of their time. He was lucky, in a sense, because his case drew the attention of people who wanted to protect our rights.\\" In the mid-1990s, Meeks was the Washington correspondent for Wired and its online counterpart, HotWired. He wrote features for the magazine and produced two columns for HotWired: Muckraker and Campaign Dispatch. The latter was dedicated to his coverage of the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign. From 1997 to 2006, Meeks served as chief Washington correspondent for MSNBC.com, covering a variety of policy-related technology topics, including civil liberties and legislative attempts to control the Internet. After the September 11th attacks in 2001, Meeks created and developed the homeland security beat for MSNBC.com. His work on national security won him the Carnegie Mellon Cybersecurity Journalism award in 2005. During his ten-year stint with MSNBC.com, Meeks appeared regularly on TV for MSNBC cable and did occasional on-air spots for NBC Nightly News. He also won an award from the Online News Association as part of a special projects team that produced \\"Rising from Ruin\\", a multimedia project chronicling the recovery of two small Gulf Coast communities in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. He was a founding staff member of the Inter@ctive Week magazine (in 2001 the magazine merged with ZD publication eWeek) where he served as chief Washington correspondent. Before that he spent two years as senior editor for Communications Daily, where two of his stories‚Äîone on the possible medical risk of cellular telephones and another on how cell phones were causing deadly interference with critical medical devices‚Äîmoved Congress to hold hearings. In the latter case, hospitals also established no-cell phone zones. In 2007 Meeks joined the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based, non-profit public interest group, as Director of Communications. In 2013 Meeks joined Atlantic Media where he worked as executive editor for Atlantic 57. He left Atlantic 57 in November of 2018 to return to a freelance writing career.

In the distance, the route leads to Kykotsmovi Village, the home of Hopi tribal government, between Second Mesa (on the right) and Third Mesa (on the left). An Indian route is a type of minor numbered road in the United States found on some Indian reservations. These routes are part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Road System, which also includes federal aid roads, interior or locally funded roads, highway trust fund roads, tribal public roads, county or township roads, parts of the state highway system, and other federal agency public roads. Description Indian routes are signed by shields featuring a downward-pointing arrowhead with varying designs depending on the state and/or reservation. Maintenance of these routes varies by locality and could be the responsibility of the BIA, a given tribal nation, or both. BIA route numbers are used on sign posts, atlas maps, plans, programs, reports, and other bureau records requiring similar identification. A spur to an existing route is always assigned its own route number. Historical usage Historically, the term \\"Indian route\\" referred to one or more components of an extensive network of trails used by indigenous peoples for war, trade, and migration, long before the advent of railroads and highways. These routes were often along relatively high ground or ridges where the soil dried quickly after rains and where there were few streams to be crossed, following important mountain passes to connect river drainages, while trails traveling across rather than along rivers usually followed the Fall Line. Oral tradition is usually the major source for route identification, but this is sometimes supplemented by field notes of land-grant surveys, old county maps, and historic narratives from scientists, explorers, soldiers and law enforcement officials. Later explorers, traders, and colonists followed some of the major routes, such as the Iroquois trail, up the Mohawk River, the Great Warrior Path that connected the mouth of the Scioto River to the Cumberland Gap and Tennessee Country, the Chickasaw-Choctaw Trail, which became the noted Natchez Trace, and the Occaneechi Trail, from the site of Petersburg, Virginia, southwest into the Carolinas. Sections View from Indian Route 1300, San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation Contemporary Indian routes are divided into sections, each of which represents a discrete and specifically defined portion of the route. Sections are usually numbered 10, 20, 30, etc. in one of the orders that the sections would be traversed during travel. A section break occurs when it is necessary to accurately report data associated with a change in the nature of the route. In particular, a section break is required whenever any of the following occur: * The route crosses a state boundary * The route crosses a county boundary * The route crosses a reservation boundary * The route crosses a congressional district boundary * A bridge begins * A bridge ends. * The surface type changes * The standard to which the road was constructed changes * There is a significant change to the condition of the road The main span of a bridge together with all its approach spans is a single section.

A battery electric multiple unit (BEMU), battery electric railcar or accumulator railcar is an electrically driven multiple unit or railcar whose energy is derived from rechargeable batteries driving the traction motors. Prime advantages of these vehicles is that they do not use fossil fuels such as coal or diesel fuel, emit no exhaust gases and do not require the railway to have expensive infrastructure like electric ground rails or overhead catenary. On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between . Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars. One or more charging stations are required along the routes they operate, unless operation is on a mixture of electrified and unelectrified track, with the batteries being charged from the electrified track. Battery technology has greatly improved over the past 20 years broadening the scope of use of battery trains, moving away from limited niche applications. Vivarail in the United Kingdom claim their trains have a range of 100 miles on only battery power, with a 10 minute charging time.https://vivarail.co.uk/battery-trains-and- decarbonisation-of-the-national-network/ These sorts of ranges and battery recharging times greatly widens the scope of use of battery or battery- electric trains. Despite higher purchase, on certain railway lines battery trains are economically viable as the very high cost and maintenance of full line electrification is eliminated. Previously, incorporating lightly used unelectrified lines into an electrified network meant extending expensive electrical infrastructure, making many extensions unviable. Modern battery- electric trains have the ability to operate on both types of track. A number of metro networks around the world have extended electrified metro lines using battery-electric technology, with a number of networks considering the option. From March 2014 passenger battery trains have been in operation in Japan on a number of lines. Austria has overhead wire/battery trains which became operational in 2019.http://www.railway- technology.com/features/featurepowering-the-trains-of-tomorrow-5723499/ Britain successfully trialled fare paying passenger hybrid overhead wire/lithium battery trains in January and February 2015.https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/551880/Network-Rail-launches-first- battery-run-passenger-train-in-50-years History Railcar no. 517 008 of the German national railway, DB British Rail BEMU, operationally fare paying from 1955 to 1966, now acting as a shunting train. Experiments with accumulator railcars, as they were originally called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. Full implementation of battery trains were undertaken with various degrees of success. In the U.S., railcars of the Edison-Beach type, with nickel-iron batteries were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar with a range of 160 km operated from 1926 to 1934 on the 34 km long Little River Branch line. The Drumm nickel-zinc battery was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the Harcourt Street Line in Ireland. British Railways used lead-acid batteries in a British Rail BEMU from 1958 to 1966 on the 38 mile long Aberdeen to Ballater line in Scotland. The BEMU was a success however was decommissioned as the line was closed. A BEMU has been restored operating as a shunting train until proper battery charging facilities are built.https://www.railscot.co.uk/articles/Aberdeen_to_Ballater_by_BMU:_Notes_on_the_Battery_Railcar_Experiment/ In Germany between 1955 and 1995 Deutsche Bahn railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 railcars utilising lead-acid batteries. Supercapacitors Supercapacitor trams on the Haizhu Tram in Guangzhou. A number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery tramcars that combine the traction battery with a supercapacitor that will be charged at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid overhead wires across a city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery. This technology is hoped to be transferred to full trains. The CAF Urbos 3 tramways was ordered for the Seville MetroCentro with the Acumulador de Carga R√°pida system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging. The Seville trams have been operating since Easter 2011.

A Combino tramway using four car tramsets equipped with the Sitras HES system has been in regular service from Almada to Seixal, Portugal, since November 2008. It is capable of running up to distances of 2,500 metres without overhead wires. A number of catenary-free tramways have opened in China that recharge at tram stops and terminals. The 20.3km Huai'an tram line in China, opened in February 2016. The line is entirely catenary- free utilising battery-powered trams supplied by CRRC Zhuzhou which recharge at tram stops. By countryAustralia= Byron Bay Train in Byron Bay, Australia The Byron Bay Train service in Byron Bay, New South Wales operates a heritage 600 class railcar. The railcar was formerly diesel powered which was operational from 1949 to 1994. The railcar had the diesel equipment stripped out with electric traction motors fitted, being converted to solar power using a battery set to store solar generated energy from the cars' roof panels. The solar train came into operational use on a formerly disused section of line through Byron Bay in 2017. It is believed to be the world's first solar-powered train. =Austria= Siemens Desiro battery train being trialled in Austria The Austrian Federal Railways has purchased 189 Siemens Desiro ML trains from 2013 to 2020.

In 1887 the first German accumulator railcars were placed in service by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Their development continued with the pre-Second World War classes ETA 177 to 180, the post-war DB Class ETA 176 (later 517) and finally ended with DB Class ETA 150 (later 515). The latter were used until 1995 having been since modernised into the Nokia ETA, painted light grey and green and deployed onto the so-called Nokia Railway (timetable number RB 46), nowadays the Gl√ºckauf-Bahn from Gelsenkirchen via Wanne-Eickel to Bochum. In July 2019, Schleswig-Holstein rail authority NAH.SH awarded Stadler a ‚Ç¨600m order for 55 battery-powered Flirt Akku multiple unit trains along with maintenance for 30 years.

The five routes of: Offenburg to Freudenstadt/Hornberg, Offenburg to Bad Griesbach, Offenburg to Achern, Achern to Ottenh√∂fen and Biberach (Baden) to Oberharmersbach- Riersbach will operate from 2013 on electrified and unelectrified track, the 120 seat Seimens Mireo Plus B battery-powered/overhead power line trains. On only battery operation the trains have a range of 80 kilometers.https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-mobility- receives-first-order-battery-powered-trains =Georgia= Georgia The New Athos Cave Railway in Abkhazia in the country of Georgia has three narrow- gauge battery electric multiple units built by the Railroad Machinery Plants of Riga in Latvia. Two Ep ¬´Tourist¬ª trains were built in 1975 and later modernized in 2005 and 2009, and the new Ep-563 train was built in 2014. Since 2014 this it been the only train in use. The first Ep train is based at Anakopea station for doubling the Ep 563 train in case of malfunction. Another Ep train is based at the depot. Each train consists of 6 cars, including 1 control car with motors and power equipment and 5 trailer cars for passengers. Both models can run either on a third rail with 300 V DC or batteries with 240V DC being used for short unelectrified sections at switches without a third rail, and also at passenger stations where the third rail has no voltage for safety reasons. =Hungary= Fifty battery-electric trains will be gradually delivered from 2023 to 2029 for use on Hungary's railways. The trains will have a range of 80-120 km with a speed of 100 km/H. Line 29 will take the first batch of trains then further trains operational on the reconstructed Budapest-Lajosmizsei line. The new battery-electric trains will also be operational on the lines: Gy≈ër to Szombathely, Miskolc to √ìzd, Esztergom to Kom√°rom, Gy≈ër to Keszthely to Kaposv√°r to P√©cs and Szolnok to Hatvan to Somosk≈ë√∫jfalu. The battery-electric trains will be capable of operation on both electrified overhead wire 25kV 50Hz lines, and non- electrified lines using the battery power.https://www.railwaypro.com/wp/hungary-launches-battery-electric-train- procurement/ =Ireland= Between 1932 and 1949, two battery electric trains ran successfully between Dublin and Bray. Two additional trains were built and placed into service in 1939, also running until 1949. The train's batteries were charged at each terminus via an overhead pickup. The train could reach 60 mph/105km/h, though service speeds were typically limited to 40 mph/66 km/h. In 2019, Iarnr√≥d √âireann announced they would purchase 250 new carriages, with an option of up to 600, over a 10-year period, for use on the DART network. The order will consist of both electric multiple units and battery electric multiple units. =Japan=N700S bullet train  N700 bullet train with battery backup. The N700s train had battery backup introduced in June 2020. The batteries power the train at reduced speed to the nearest station when power outages occur. The train will operate on the Tokaido Shinkansen line between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka.https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/egeb-japan-bullet- train-li-ion-battery-self-propulsion-system-chargeup-europe/ NE Train Smart Denchi-kun In Japan, JR East tested a \\"NE Train Smart Denchi-kun\\" battery electric railcar from 2009. This vehicle is capable of operating under 1,500 V DC overhead wires or on battery power alone for a distance of up to 50 km away from an overhead power supply. The batteries are charged via the pantograph either when running under an overhead electric supply or at a specially built recharging facility.https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/development/tech/pdf_23/Tec-23-17-20eng.pdf EV-E301 series EV-E301 charging from the overhead conductor bar From March 2014, a two-car battery electric multiple unit, the EV-E301 series with 1,500 V DC overhead wire and battery power capability, entered revenue- earning service on the long non-electrified Karasuyama Line. Since March 4, 2017, battery electric trains have completely replaced diesel multiple units on this route. There are four two-car sets in operation, each set equipped with a 190 kWh lithium-ion battery. The trains recharge their batteries at Karasuyama Station (the end of the line) via their pantographs, using a rigid conductor bar placed where the overhead wires would be, connected to the local electric grid. At the other end, at H≈çshakuji, the Karasuyama Line meets the electrified Tohoku Main Line. The trains then continue over the electrified Tohoku Main Line to Utsunomiya, where passengers can change to Shinkansen high-speed trains. BEC819 series BEC819 at Kashii Station From April 2016, JR Kyushu started trial operation of a two-car BEC819 series BEMU train, nicknamed \\"DENCHA\\", on part of the Chikuh≈ç Main Line, with revenue-earning service scheduled from October of the same year, and six more trains planned to be introduced on the line in spring 2017. It can also be powered via overhead AC power line. The BEC819 series battery-electric trains became operational on the through services on the Fukuhoku Yutaka Line in October 2016, which is electrified at 20 kV 60 Hz AC and the non-electrified Chikuh≈ç Main Line, known as the \\"Wakamatsu Line\\", between Orio and Wakamatsu. The battery capacity is 360 kWh. In 2019, a total of 11 new BEC819 trainsets were introduced on the Kashii Line, replacing all diesel multiple units previously operated on that line. This brought the total number of BEC819 trainsets in revenue service to 18. EV-E801 series EV-E801 at Oiwake Station, Akita A new EV-E801 series two-car BEMU train was introduced on the long non-electrified Oga Line in Akita Prefecture in March 2017. It shares some characteristics with the BEC819 trains: it uses a 360 kWh battery and is recharged from a 20 kV 50 Hz AC overhead supply instead of a 1,500 V DC overhead supply used by the earlier EV-E301 trains. =United Kingdom= Test Electrostar Train converted to run on batteries and overhead wires Historically, a number of battery electric trains have been used on British railways. The British Rail BEMU was taken out of service because the line from Aberdeen to Ballater in Scotland was closed in 1966. The trains have been renovated being ready for reuse on the Royal Deeside Railway.https://www.deeside-railway.co.uk/allstock.html The British Rail Class 419, motor luggage van, was operational from 1959 to 2004, which could run on either on batteries or a third rail, being used for short unelectrified section on quaysides. The United Kingdom has almost two-thirds, 58%, of the 20,000 mile rail network on non-electrified track, which consumes 469 million litres of diesel each year. Mark Carne of Network Rail, who are responsible the tracks of the British rail network, in March 2017 stated: \\"The idea that you need to electrify an entire route is no longer necessarily the case. I think that where we have got hybrid trains, that opens up quite a lot of interesting opportunities for partial electrification.\\" Carne also stated: \\"technology was advancing at such a pace that better reliability could be achieved without the construction of unsightly overhead cables.\\" He added that developments in batteries are such that it might soon be cost-effective to swap diesel engines for battery or hybrid devices, therefore saving the vast cost of installing power lines above every section of track. Company's such as UK based Hitachi, Vivarail and Bombardier have committed to or are producing battery-electric trains. These trains will be either new units or conversion of existing units, to fulfil the aims of Network Rail's introduction of battery powered trains.https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4017372/hitachi- rolls-forward-plans-uk-battery- trainshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/10/01/bombardier- signs-100m-deal-make-uks-first-battery-powered-trains/ In 2015 a single Class 379 Electrostar, after electric lithium batteries were installed, began passenger operations on the Mayflower Line in Essex. The train can travel up to on energy stored in the batteries also recharging the batteries via the overhead-wires when on electrified sections of the line, at stations and via brake regeneration. The trial lasted one month from January to February.Battery train trial service launched - Global Rail News. Retrieved 2015-01-14. Network Rail refer to this prototype model and its possible future descendants as Independently Powered Electric Multiple Units (IPEMU). A month after the trial in March 2015, the introduction of battery-powered trains was proposed by Network Rail for consideration for the fifteen station 27 miles long diesel operated Wrexham, North Wales to Bidston, Birkenhead, Borderlands Line. The aim is to merge the line into the electric 3rd rail Merseyrail Wirral Line extending into the underground section of Liverpool's city centre, making Wrexham one of the branch terminals of the line. The line is diesel train operated unable to progress into the electric 3rd rail underground Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail tunnels & stations. If battery trains are introduced that run into the tunnels, the Borderlands line will be incorporated into the Wirral Line becoming an urban metro line between Liverpool and Wrexham. The diesel operated trains on the slow Borderlands line terminate at Bidston railway station in Birkenhead, with passengers having to change trains onto the Merseyrail electric network to proceed into Liverpool's centre. Network Rail proposed using dual battery powered/3rd rail pickup rolling stock without full electrification of the line, providing a cheaper method of incorporating the line in the Wirral Line. The trains will only terminate at Wrexham, while at the Liverpool end of the line trains will proceed around the loop of the electrified Liverpool city centre underground tunnels with thirteen station stops. As the train proceeds on the looped electrified line from Bidston and back, the train's batteries are charged. Class 777 Class 777, Stadler, to conduct battery-electric trials in Liverpool. On page 37 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that in 2020 a trial of new class 777 Merseyrail electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in view to incorporate two stretches of unelectrified track onto the Merseyrail network. The sections are on the Wirral Line from Ellesmere Port to Helsby interchange station and the Northern Line from Ormskirk to Preston interchange station. Class 230 Vivarail battery electric train Vivarail have produced the Class 230 train which is converted from redundant London Underground D-Stock trains. The second demonstrator unit, the two-car 230002, has been fitted for battery power in contrast to the diesel-electric power of the earlier 230001 demonstrator unit. Vivarail have developed a fast charger giving a 100 mile range with a 10 minutes recharging time.https://vivarail.co.uk/battery-trains-and-decarbonisation-of-the- national-network/ Power is provided by two lithium-ion batteries per car giving four per train, providing 106kWh, with an expected life of seven years for the batteries.https://www.railmagazine.com/news/network/vivarail-targets- summer-running-for-new-battery-unit In 2017, Vivarail battery trains were being considered for use on the Valley Lines network in South Wales. The trains would be battery powered, capable of being recharged via 25 kV OHLE. =United States= The Edison-Beach battery railcar was developed by Thomas Edison and Ralph H. Beach. The latter headed the Railway Storage Battery Car Company and the Electric Car & Locomotive Corp. Car No. 105 of the Alaska Railroad was an Edison-Beach car, and examples operated on the Central Vermont Railway running between Millers Falls, Northfield and West Townshend. A notable feature of the Edison-Beach cars was the Beach drive system.

The mineral nolanite is named in his honor. He was generally known as Tom Nolan. Early life Nolan was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts in 1901. He was educated at New Haven, Connecticut then studied Metallurgy at Yale University, graduating with a BS in 1921. He continued studying at Yale and received a PhD in Geology in 1924. After training for the Civil Service he joined the US Geological Survey, USGS career After Director William Embry Wrather retired because of illness and age in 1955, Assistant Director Thomas B. Nolan became the 's (USGS) seventh director in January 1956. During his 11 years as Assistant Director, Nolan had many times and for extended periods served as Acting Director so no transition period was needed. Nolan believed that geologists, because of the unique requirements imposed on them by their science, should expand their fields of interest from individual problems and \\"participate actively and authoritatively in the matters affecting the whole country.\\" Until September 1965, when he resumed his research in Great Basin geology, Nolan pushed, prodded, and led the Survey to a broadened and intensified commitment to basic research, to the advancement of geology in the public service, and to the prompt publication of Survey results. As Assistant Director, he had also served as the Interior Department representative on the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Research and Development, on the Scientific Advisory Committee on Specialized Personnel to the Selective Service Committee, and on the Advisory Board on Education of the National Academy of Sciences, and had been president of the Society of Economic Geologists and the Geological Society of America (1961Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., .). As Director, his professional responsibilities outside the Survey were still further extended to service as vice president and president of the Geological Society of America, as vice president of the International Union of Geological Sciences, and on committees advisory to university geology departments. In 1956, the Geological Survey began an evaluation of the effects of underground nuclear explosions at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada Test Site; that program was expanded to study the geologic and hydrologic conditions affecting the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the disposal of radioactive wastes. In December 1958, Director Nolan, speaking at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, remarked that the early work of the Geological Survey had been characterized by a transition from exploration of a geographical to an intellectual frontier, but demands by younger scientists for studies of the geography of outer space might soon inaugurate a new cycle in the history of the US Geological Survey. In 1959, the Survey compiled a photogeologic map of the Earth's satellite, the Moon, and began studies of tektites and impact craters. On May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy proposed as a goal \\"landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth\\" before the end of the decade, and in 1963, the US Geological Survey, in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, began to train astronauts in geology and to investigate and evaluate methods and equipment for geological and geophysical exploration of the Moon.USGS History He died in Washington D.

In the early 1860s, Anna Leonowens, a widow with two young children, was invited to Siam (now Thailand) by King Mongkut (Rama IV), who wanted her to teach his children and wives the English language and introduce them to British customs. Her experiences during the five years she spent in the country served as the basis for two memoirs, The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870) and Romance of the Harem (1872). Landon took Leonowens' first-person narratives and enhanced them with details about the Siamese people and their culture culled from other sources. The book has been translated into dozens of languages and has inspired at least six adaptations into various dramatic mediums: * Anna and the King of Siam (1946 film) * The King and I (1951 stage musical) * The King and I (1956 film musical) * Anna and the King (1972 TV series) * The King and I (1999 animated film musical) * Anna and the King (1999 film) At the time of its publication, The New York Times called it \\"an inviting escape into an unfamiliar, exotic past . . . calculated to transport us instantly.\\" The Atlantic Monthly described it as \\"enchanting\\" and added, \\"the author wears her scholarship with grace, and the amazing story she has to tell is recounted with humor and understanding\\". Anna and the King was also published as an Armed Services Edition, distributed to American troops during WWII. Radio adaptation Anna and the King of Siam was presented on Hallmark Playhouse 15 September 1949. The 30-minute adaptation starred Deborah Kerr.

Organization There were 301 seats contested to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly in 13 electoral districts starting on . The elections were proclaimed on November 20 by the Third Universal of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Universal proclaimed that the Constituent Assembly would convene on . The elections were conducted by the Electoral Bureau of the General Secretary of Internal Affairs directed by Mykhailo Kovenko. The Universal proclaimed that the Constituent Assembly's 301 deputies were to be elected by a direct universal, equal and secret vote on the basis of proportional representation of 1 deputy per 100,000 constituents. Male and female citizens aged 20 and over who have attained the right to vote were allowed to participate in the elections. Preparation Right before elections the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party tried to sabotage the elections through another coup-d'etat that was scheduled to take place on December 24 to establish the Soviet power in Ukraine. However, that attempt was effectively extinguished, all Bolshevik military formations were disarmed, and sent by train to the Soviet Russia including the 2nd Guard Corps led by Yevgenia Bosch that was stopped near Zhmerynka en route to Kiev in support of the mutiny. On December 30 the government of Russia (Sovnarkom) issued an ultimatum to reinstate legal rights of Bolshevik military formations in Ukraine, which was ignored. Results According to the election results, 171 of the 301 deputies were elected in regions where the Bolsheviks were not in power. Over 70 percent of the total votes cast were for Ukrainian political parties while only 10 percent went to the Bolsheviks. Following political turmoil, the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly never convened and the Central Council took on its responsibilities. The elections were paused due to invasion of Russia and the chaos that was spread as the result of it. The Central Rada announced that it will act as the legislative body until the Assembly will be convened.

Bounded by the Columbia Slough on the south, the Willamette River on the west, and the Columbia River on the north, the park forms the tip of the peninsula at the confluence of the rivers. Marine Terminal 6 of the Port of Portland lies immediately east of the park along the Columbia, while Terminal 5 is along the Willamette slightly south of the Columbia Slough. The park is at and rises to an elevation of above sea level. Sauvie Island is west of the park across the Willamette River. Hayden Island is slightly upstream of the park on the Columbia River opposite Marine Terminal 6. Description and history The city acquired the park site in 1984 from the Port of Portland, which had covered much of the peninsula with dredged material from the Columbia River to create places to build terminals. The site was formerly part of Pearcy Island, separated from the mainland by sloughs, one of which was called Pearcy Slough. Pearcy Island still appears on topographical maps at even though it is no longer an island. Pearcy Island and Pearcy Slough were named after Nathan Pearcy, who settled a donation land claim on the island in 1850.McArthur, p. 747 Development projects later altered the landforms in this vicinity. Hall Jackson Kelley, for whom the park is namedThe north tip of Pearcy Island had no name until 1926, when a group of Portland citizens persuaded the United States Board on Geographic Names to name it Kelley Point.McArthur, p. 527 The name honors Hall Jackson Kelley (1790‚Äì1874), a New England resident who during the first half of the 19th century promoted interest in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. During a brief visit to Oregon in 1834, Kelley tried unsuccessfully to establish a city at the confluence. Park amenities include a historical site, paved and unpaved paths, picnic tables, public art, restrooms, and a vista point. The park, operated by the Portland Parks & Recreation Department, is open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Kelley Point was once the site of a small lighthouse. Wildlife includes Bewick's wrens that frequent the park's black cottonwood forest. Caspian terns, osprey, double-crested cormorants, and gulls are common near the rivers. Sights from the vista point include ship traffic on both rivers. An informal Columbia Slough canoe launch lies near the park entrance along Kelley Point Park Road, west of Interstate 5 along North Marine Drive. The 40-Mile Loop hiking and biking trail runs by the entrance to the park.Houck, pp. 314‚Äì15 ReferencesWorks cited * Houck, Mike, and Cody, M.J., eds. (2000). Wild in the City.

His research on the Buchenwald concentration camp has focused on the rescue of children and youths inside the camp and has included some notable findings. Background Kenneth Alan Waltzer was born on December 23, 1942, in New York and graduated from Harpur College at Binghamton University. He then earned a PhD in history from Harvard University. Career Waltzer has been affiliated with MSU since 1971, when he was appointed to the faculty and went there to help build their residential college in public affairs. During his career, he has served as dean and associate dean of MSU's James Madison College, and as director of MSU's general education program in the arts and humanities. He was awarded a State of Michigan Excellence in Teaching Award in 1990 and MSU's Outstanding Undergraduate Teacher Award in 1998. Waltzer helped build MSU's Jewish Studies and study abroad program in Israel during the 1990s. After a hiatus during the Second Intifada due to security concerns, Waltzer helped persuade MSU to reinstate the study abroad program in Israel in 2006.United Press International (November 7, 2005). MSU reinstates Israel study program. Historical and genealogical research findings Waltzer's Buchenwald-related research at the International Tracing Service determined that Fyodor Michajlitschenko was the young man who rescued Israel Meir Lau from Buchenwald.Associated Press (June 26, 2008). Academics make startling finds as they sweep through untapped Nazi records. Michajlitschenko was posthumously awarded Righteous Among the Nations designation by Yad Vashem in 2009.Yad Vashem (2009). The Memory of Feodor‚Äôs Goodness: Feodor Mikhailichenko Waltzer was among the key figures who exposed fabrications in Angel at the Fence, the cancelled Holocaust memoir by Herman Rosenblat. Waltzer's Buchenwald research led him to raise questions about Rosenblat's story of his imprisonment at Schlieben, a sub-camp of Buchenwald. Other witnesses interviewed by Waltzer said Rosenblat's story \\"couldn‚Äôt possibly be true\\" and was \\"a figment of his imagination.\\" Waltzer determined that maps of the camp also debunked Rosenblat's claims. Waltzer and his colleagues also determined that Rosenblat's wife and her family were hidden as local townspeople posing as Polish Catholics at a farm near Breslau, some 211 miles away from Schlieben. She could not have been heaving apples daily over the Schlieben camp fence. Waltzer recently was the historical consultant for Kinderblock 66, a documentary about Buchenwald's kinderblock 66 and about the efforts of Czech Communist Antonin Kalina, part of the camp underground, to protect imprisoned children.Handelman, Jay (April 18, 2012).

Early life and priesthood  Generally said to have been a native of Norfolk,See, for example, Anthony a Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, 1691, Vol. I at 601. However, elsewhere he is recorded as a native of Herefordshire: Matthew Parker, Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae of 1572 (ed. Samuel Drake, London, 1729) and John Strype, Annals of the Reformation and Establishment of Religion in the Church of England during Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs Happy Reign, New Edition (The Clarendon Press, 1824), Vol. I, Part I, pp. 230, 371-372 Downham was probably born in 1511.He was aged 50 at his consecration in May 1561 (Parker, Antiquitate, p. 158), and his age at death in 1577 was recorded as 66 (\\"bis triginta et sex vixit\\") on a brass plate formerly affixed to his tomb (George Ormerod, History of the County Palatine and City of Chester, 1819, Vol. I, p. 164). He is first recorded as one of the Brothers of Penitence, a small Augustinian order based at Ashridge on the border of Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. When the order‚Äôs collegiate church fell victim to the Dissolution in 1539, he was pensioned and obtained admission to Exeter College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1541 and becoming a Fellow of Magdalen College in 1543.Patricia Joan Cox, \\"Reformation Responses in Tudor Cheshire c. 1500-1577\\" (PhD dissertation, Department of History, University of Warwick, December 2013), pp. 289-290; Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, ed. Joseph Foster, Oxford, 1891. At the time of the Dissolution the brethren at Ashridge were seventeen in number: A History of the County of Buckingham, Vol. I, ed. William Page (London, 1905), p. 387. Five years later, he was appointed Rector of Datchworth, but, probably on account of having married during the reign of Edward VI, he was deprived of the parish following Queen Mary‚Äôs accession. His wife‚Äôs death may have been the circumstance that allowed his appointment to the vicarage of Edlesborough, near Ashridge, in October 1554.Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 290, 292; William Downham (ID65611), Clergy of the Church of England Database (CCEd); C. S. Knighton, \\"Downham William (1510/11-1577)\\", ODNB. In November 1555 he resigned the Edlesborough living. A month earlier the queen‚Äôs sister, Princess Elizabeth, had returned to her childhood home at the Old Palace in Hatfield following a year‚Äôs detention, and it was probably at this point Downham became one of her chaplains and was appointed Rector of the nearby parish of Ayot St Peter.Knighton, ODNB; David Starkey, Elizabeth: Apprenticeship, Vintage Books, 2001, p. 187; CCEd records his resignation from Ayot St Peter occurring on 1 March 1559 but gives no date for his appointment there. In his service as chaplain he displayed some adroitness, ostensibly adhering to the doctrine and practices of the Roman Church while allowing Elizabeth to perceive him as a candidate for preferment within a Protestant foundation. In 1560, following her accession to the throne and the passing of the Act of Uniformity, Elizabeth made him Archdeacon of Brecon and a Canon of Westminster.Knighton, ODNB. As one of the \\"old flock of Hatfield\\" he also enjoyed the favour of William Cecil who in the same year repeatedly proposed him for advancement to a bishopric.Cox, Reformation Responses, p. 298; Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 265.  Appointment as Bishop of Chester  Such advancement came in 1561 when Downham was made Bishop of Chester, the queen later declaring the appointment was of \\"our own motion, for the good opinion we conceived of you in your service to us\\".Letter from the Queen to Downham dated 21 February 1568: Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 254-255. He was consecrated by Archbishop Thomas Young on 4 May 1561 and on the following day became a member of the ecclesiastical commission formed to strengthen Young‚Äôs hand in implementing the Elizabethan religious settlement in the northern province.Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 1, pp. 361-372; Knighton, ODNB. Later in the year he was, alongside Bishops Edmund Grindal and Richard Cox, one of the ecclesiastical commissioners who laid down the rules for dealing with ousted papist clergy, sparing them prosecution and imprisonment but placing restrictions on their movement and requiring security for their future quiet behaviour.Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 1, pp. 410-411.  Struggles  He was still in daily attendance on the queen in November 1561, by which date Archbishop Young had commenced a six-month metropolitan visitation of Chester diocese that automatically suspended Downham‚Äôs episcopal authority. By the time the suspension was lifted, nearly three years had elapsed since the expulsion of his predecessor, Cuthbert Scott. During this interval there had been no concerted enforcement of the Uniformity Act in the diocese, which was 120 miles in length and included the counties of Cheshire and Lancashire, a large part of North Yorkshire and most of Cumbria.Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 292, 298; K. S. Wark, \\"Elizabethan Recusancy in Cheshire\\", Chetham Society, Vol. XIX, 3rd Series (1971), p. 4. The holding of a metropolitan visitation of a diocese and inhibition of the bishop‚Äôs powers for its duration have been presented by some commentators as implicit criticism of the bishop; for an explanation of the process and its actual significance, see Cox at pp. 298, 317-318. For an outline map of the diocese see ibid at p. 129 (Figure 10). Situated in the extreme south-western corner of this tract, the city of Chester was unhappily placed for its oversight and, the diocese having no manorial endowments, Downham was dependent on the hospitality of local gentry when travelling beyond the city.Knighton, ODNB; Cox, Reformation Responses, p. 320. Large numbers of such gentry were Roman Catholic in sympathy (predominantly so in Lancashire) and Downham alienated others by early attempts to correct their dissolute lifestyles.Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 302-304. In July 1562 a special ecclesiastical commission for Chester diocese was established under Downham‚Äôs presidency, with power to impose fines and sentences of imprisonment for breach of church discipline. The queen later attributed such establishment to a request from Downham supported by his promise that it would preserve his diocese from \\"disorders\\".Calendar of State Papers of the Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth, Vol. 1, 1547-1580, HMSO, 1856 (CSPD), p. 203; letter from the Queen to Downham, 21 February 1568 (Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 255). Like other high commissions on which he had served, it was a secular court composed of both clergy and leading members of the laity such as the Earl of Derby, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and a cousin of the queen, and Sir John Southworth, High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1562 and MP for the county in the following year. Southworth was uncompromising in his attachment to Roman Catholicism and in 1566 his recusancy resulted in Downham bringing charges against him. Southworth refused to answer to Downham or to Archbishop Young, contending that he would \\"not find indifference at their hands\\", and the case was referred to the Privy Council.For Downham‚Äôs dealings with Southworth, see William A. Abram, A History of Blackburn Town and Parish (Blackburn, 1877), pp. 76-78. Southworth was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1562; Downham considered him one who \\"if he could be reclaimed others would follow in embracing the Queen‚Äôs Majesty‚Äôs most goodly proceeding\\" (John Harland, ed., The Lancashire Lieutenancy under the Tudors and Stuarts, Chetham Society, 1859, p. 75); in the 1580s he was accused of sheltering the Jesuit Edmund Campion and was imprisoned. Southworth was removed from the commission in 1567, in which year Christopher Goodman became a member.Wark, \\"Elizabethan Recusancy\\", p. 9; David Mills, \\"‚ÄòSome Precise Cittizins‚Äô: Puritan Objections to Chester‚Äôs Plays\\", Leeds Studies in English, New Series, No. 29 (1998), p. 220. Goodman had, with John Knox, been co-pastor of the English church in exile at Geneva during Queen Mary‚Äôs reign and afterwards was presented to the living of Aldford by Sir Edward Fitton. He was as extreme in his puritanism as Southworth had been in his papistry and proved a continuing thorn in Downham‚Äôs side, particularly during the Vestments Controversy; in 1569 he was suspended on Downham‚Äôs instruction and in 1571 he was disciplined by Archbishop Matthew Parker, to whom Downham had reported him.Mills, Leeds Studies, p. 223; Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 295, 307-308. In 1572 Goodman accused Downham of failing properly to support Archbishop Grindal‚Äôs attempt to block performance of the Chester Mystery Plays. Downham had made representations against the performance but it proceeded under the authority of the Earl of Derby: David Mills, Recycling the Cycle: The City of Chester and its Whitsun Plays, University of Toronto Press, 1988, p. 148; Cox, pp. 355-356. Struggles for influence within the commission undermined its effectiveness as an instrument of governance but, from its inception, Downham was as assiduous in attending its sessions as he was regular in his presence at proceedings of his consistory court.Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 304-305. In 1564 he compiled a perceptive and candid assessment of the magistracy on whom the enforcement of law was dependent within his diocese, concluding that, of twenty-five justices of the peace in Lancashire, only six could be trusted in religion and of these two were doubtful.Christopher Haigh, Reformation and Resistance in Tudor Lancashire, Cambridge University Press, 1975, pp. 212-213; Wark, \\"Elizabethan Recusancy\\", p. 8. Downham‚Äôs report on the magistrates is printed in \\"A Collection of Original Letters from the Bishops to the Privy Council, 1564\\", ed. M. Bateson, Camden Miscellany IX, pp. 73-78. His commitment to the Elizabethan religious settlement seems to have been absolute and he enjoyed the confidence of Archbishop Young, assisting at the consecration of Young‚Äôs suffragan, Robert Barnes, in 1567.John Strype, The Life and Acts of Matthew Parker, The Clarendon Press, 1821, Vol. I, p. 477. In the previous year he had been among five bishops on whom the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred at London.Anthony a Wood, Fasti Oxonienses, New Edition (ed. Philip Bliss), Part 1, 1815, p. 178.  Apparent loss of favour  On 3 February 1568, probably in response to intelligence foreshadowing the Rising of the North, the queen directed Lord Derby, Downham, and their fellow ecclesiastical commissioners to apprehend all persons who \\"under the pretence of religion draw sundry gentlemen from their allegiance\\".CSPD, p. 305. Derby, anticipating the direction, had already arrested those under suspicion. Perhaps embarrassed by this preemption, Elizabeth turned on Downham. In a letter to him dated 21 February, she referred to \\"credible reports of disorders and contempts\\" in his diocese, particularly in Lancashire, on which account she found \\"great lack in you, being sorry to have our former expectation in this sort deceived\\". She called on him to root out deprived clergy who were being secretly harboured by recusant gentry in the remoter parts of his diocese and to ensure that all parishes were provided with \\"honest and well learned curates\\".CSPD, p. 307; Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 254-255. Chester diocese contained 80 parishes, some of which had chapels of ease that were serviced by clergy additional to the parish incumbent. Many clergy were ejected or fled following Elizabeth‚Äôs succession and Downham‚Äôs natural anxiety to retain those remaining was increased by difficulty in recruiting replacements. Although no graduates were among the 179 candidates he ordained between 1562 and 1568, at least a third of incumbents appointed by him thereafter had graduated (Cox, pp. 338-339). His concern to recruit men who were able preachers is exemplified in his letter of 21 March 1573 to the Earl of Leicester (Add.MSS. 32091). The queen‚Äôs displeasure with Downham may have followed a complaint to the Privy Council by Goodman‚Äôs patron Sir Edward Fitton, occasioned by Downham summoning papist suspects to Chester for examination rather than sending them for trial at Lancaster assizes.Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol.1, Part 2, pp. 258-261; Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 313-314. Goodman is said to have been associated with the complaint but its timing is uncertain and may have followed discoveries made when Downham journeyed throughout his diocese in the summer of 1568.The Acts of the Privy Council of England (APC), New Series, Vol. VIII, HMSO, 1893, p. 317; Cox, pp. 307-309; The Victoria History of the County of Lancaster, Vol. 2 (ed. Farrer and Brownbill), Archibald Constable, 1908 (VHCL): William Arthur Shaw, \\"Ecclesiastical History since the Reformation\\", pp. 51-53. During the course of that year several prominent landowners, including Sir Richard Molyneux (High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1566) and Sir William Norris (High Sheriff in 1545), appeared before the ecclesiastical commission in Chester, recanted their Catholic sympathies, and entered into recognisances for their future conduct such that Downham \\"hoped he should never be troubled again with the like\\".Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 257-260. However, in 1570 Downham and Lord Derby were summoned to appear before the Privy Council to answer questions arising out of disorders in Lancashire, particularly in the Archdeaconry of Richmond. The queen was said to fear such disorders had \\"come to pass through (Downham‚Äôs) remissness in not looking diligently to the charge committed unto him\\", and his conduct was referred to Archbishop Parker for consideration by the church in convocation.APC, Vol. VII, p. 399 (Letter to Downham, 12 November 1570) and Vol. VIII, p. 5 (Letter to Archbishop Parker). The \\"disorders\\" for which Downham was required to account were refusals to comply with the laws \\"for the use of Common Prayer and other Ecclesiastical Orders\\". Strype‚Äôs biography of Parker contains an extensive account of the convocation to which the archbishop proposed to refer the complaint (April 1571) and makes no mention of it. Goodman‚Äôs part in engineering the queen‚Äôs concern is not apparent but in 1572 he was appointed Archdeacon of Richmond, his new patron the Earl of Leicester pressuring Downham into making the appointment.Patrick Collinson, Godly People, Essays on English Protestantism and Puritanism, The Hambledon Press, 1983, p. 67. Downham subsequently wrote to Leicester asking him to use his moderating influence on Goodman whom he described as \\"somewhat singular by fervent zeal of God‚Äôs truth\\": Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 316-317. Commentators have suggested that by 1572 Downham was \\"in complete disgrace for his continued failure to prosecute any kind of reform\\", having been subjected to \\"final shame\\" in 1570.Brett Usher, William Cecil and Episcopy, 1559-1577, Routledge, 2007, p. 31; Wark, \\"Elizabethan Recusancy\\", p. 13. Such remarks reflect the tendency of modern historians to dismiss him as \\"weak\\", \\"indolent\\" or \\"negligent\\" and either \\"sound asleep\\" or \\"papist\\" in his role as bishop.A. L. Rowse, The England of Elizabeth, 2nd Edition, University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p. 500; Haigh, Reformation and Resistance, pp. 210, 265; Wark, \\"Elizabethan Recusancy\\", p. 5; VHCL: Shaw, p. 55; Patrick Collinson, The Elizabethan Puritan Movement, Methuen, 1967, pp. 206-207. This portrayal contrasts with the 19th century assessment of Downham as \\"very rigid in enforcing conformity\\" and active in policing and sanctioning the conduct of his clergy.F. R. Raines in notes to \\"Remains Historical and Literary connected with the Counties of Lancaster and Chester\\", Chetham Society, Vol. VIII (1845). Downham‚Äôs practice in dealing with clergy of doubtful conformity is illustrated by the case of William Langley, Rector of Prestwich: see Raines‚Äôs notes to \\"A Description of the State, Civil and Ecclesiastical, of the County of Lancaster, c. 1590\\", Chetham Society, Vol. XCVI (1875), pp. 18-19. It is also substantially challenged by a recent reappraisal of the man and of events during his tenure of office.Cox, Reformation Responses, p. 371 and generally.  Last years of his episcopate  In June 1574 the Privy Council gave Downham and the Earl of Derby (son of the previous commissioner) a fresh charge to investigate disorders in Lancashire.APC, Vol. VIII, p. 258. The extent of the Council‚Äôs concern appears from its July letter of thanks to Derby for rooting out abuses in the county which was described as \\"the very sink of popery where more unlawful acts have been committed and more unlawful persons held secret than in other part of the realm\\".Letter to the Earl of Derby, 27 July 1574: APC, Vol. VIII, pp. 276-277. By its November letter, acknowledging Downham‚Äôs report on \\"proceedings against obstinate people\\" in Lancashire, the Council offered to provide any needful assistance requested and assured Downham and Derby that \\"by their diligence herein they shall deserve thanks at Her Majesty‚Äôs hands\\".APC, Vol. VIII, p. 317. In February 1576 Downham forwarded to the Council a return of recusants within his diocese, categorised according to whether they remained \\"obstinate\\" or, after examination by him, were considered \\"conformable\\". He died in the following year but the return is said to have provided terms of reference for a new ecclesiastical commission acting in conjunction with the Council of the North.\\"The Lancashire Lieutenancy under the Tudors and Stuarts - Part 1\\", ed. John Harland, Remains Historical and Literary connected with the Counties of Lancaster and Chester, Vol. XLIX (1858), pp. 67-75; VHCL: Alice Law, \\"Political History from the Reign of Henry VIII\\", p. 224. Downing was buried in the choir of Chester Cathedral where a brass plate on his tomb carried the date 3 December 1577, probably the day of his burial because his death is generally said to have occurred in November that year.Ormerod, History of the County Palatine and City of Chester, Vol. I, p. 164; Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, p. 601.  Legacy  Even a confederate of his opponent Goodman remembered Downham as \\"a mild, courteous and loving man, wishing well unto all\\".This description appears in Paul Rogers‚Äôs A Breviary or some few Collectiones of the Cittie of Chester, a compilation of papers left by his father, Archdeacon Robert Rogers, who, like Goodman, found an early patron in Sir Edward Fitton: see Mills, \\"Recycling the Cycle\\", pp. 52-54. In applying the Uniformity Act he tried to persuade rather than persecute. He considered the laity of his diocese to be inherently tractable, believed in the power of prayer as a unifying force, and regarded skilled preaching as the means of bringing \\"many obstinate and wilful people into conformity and obedience\\".Cox, Reformation Responses, pp. 310, 311, 320, 322, 368. Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 257-258. It has been suggested his conciliatory approach may have served to preserve order through most of his diocese during the Northern Rebellion,Cox, Reformation Responses, p. 368; F. A. Bailey, \\"The Churchwardens‚Äô Accounts of Prescot, 1523-1607\\" - Part 2, Transactions of the Historical Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, Vol. 95 (1943), p. 19. but the extent of outward conformity he was able to secure belied the underlying strength and proliferation of Roman Catholic sentiment that became manifest after his death.In the 1570s outwardly conforming families in Lancashire sent their sons to the English Colleges at Douai and Rome to be trained at Catholic missionaries. The return of these proselytisers at the end of the decade was marked by an upsurge in papist sentiment both in the county and nationally and new laws were introduced to combat the increase in recusancy. For which see VHCL: Shaw, pp. 54-56.  Personal life and family  An account of Downing‚Äôs financial circumstances during his time as bishop appears in his 1568 letter to William Cecil.Strype, Annals of the Reformation, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 265-266. He married for a second time, probably around 1565. The marriage probably diminished his favour with the queen, who strongly preferred her clergy to remain single.To Elizabeth \\"the marriage of the clergy was detestable; the marriage and especially the remarriage of her prelates approached incest\\": J. A. Froude, The History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Death of Elizabeth, Vol. IX, p. 383. For Downham‚Äôs second wife see Cox, Reformation Responses, p. 301. By his second wife he was father of Bishop George Downame, of the theologian John Downame, and of a daughter who became the first wife of Roger Bradshaw (1572-1625) of Pennington.Ormerod, History of the County Palatine and City of Chester, Vol. I, p. 146; Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, p. 601; \\"The Visitation of the County Palatine of Lancaster 1664-5\\", Chetham Society, Old Series, No. 84 (1872), p. 54.

The CSH organized the \\"Hands Across Harlem\\" event that encouraged Harlem residents to demonstrate peacefully against the plan. One focal point of dispute was the largest building in square feet in Harlem. Legislation was proposed requiring the owner to give the building back to the community.

The initial 1962 BART maps approved by voters included several lines beyond the core system marked as Possible Future Extensions. Some have since been completed: *The extension from Concord to Antioch was carried out in phases with service to North Concord / Martinez in 1995, Pittsburg / Bay Point in 1996, and the eBART spur which started service in 2018 *A line to Livermore was completed as far as Dublin/Pleasanton by 1997, with final completion of the envisioned corridor to be carried out by Valley Rail. *Service south of Fremont is expected to reach San Jose and Santa Clara (partially via the Caltrain right of way) by 2030. It was extended to Warm Springs in 2017 and Berryessa in 2020. *Extension from Daly City to the south was completed in phases as the Colma Station opened in 1996 and the line to Millbrae was completed in 2003 with a spur to San Francisco International Airport. The full Southern Pacific (now Caltrain) right of way is considered unlikely to ever see BART service upon electrification of the corridor. *The Marin Line via Geary was initially cancelled due to the county exiting the planning district over funding and engineering issues. There were two possible routes: (1) via Geary to Park Presidio, then across the Golden Gate Bridge via rails that would have been built into the truss supports under the roadway, then after tunneling through the Waldo Grade to Marin City, would have emerged from underground and followed the old train tracks north through the county; (2) alternatively, to tunnel from Fort Mason/Aquatic Park to downtown Sausalito and follow the right-of-way from the old train tracks. All of these engineering plans are available for public viewing at the UC Berkeley transportation library. An additional corridor not part of the 1962 plan completed since the agency's inception is the automated guideway transit spur line that connects BART to Oakland International Airport which opened in 2014. , the BART map has one route marked for Future Service, the second phase of the Silicon Valley BART extension into San Jose, shown as a thick, gray dashed line. ProposalsSan Jose subway extension (Phase 2) = Santa Clara Depot. The original plan for the Silicon Valley extension was to continue into downtown San Jose and Santa Clara via subway. However, in February 2009, projections of lower- than-expected sales-tax receipts from the funding measures forced the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority to scale back the extension, ending it at the Berryessa/North San Jos√© station and delaying tunneling under downtown San Jose to a future phase of construction (making it essentially a \\"Phase 2\\" of the project). The originally-planned complete extension from Fremont to Santa Clara had been projected to cost $6.1 billion, but the VTA estimates the extension to Berryessa (Phase 1 only) would cost just $2.3 billion. The plans for the downtown subway start with a portal before crossing under US 101, with subway stations at 28th Street/Little Portugal, Downtown San Jose station (The Downtown San Jose station was combined in 2005 from earlier plans for separate subway stations at Civic Plaza/San Jose State University and Market Street.), and Diridon/Arena. The line would exit to the surface after crossing under I-880 and terminate at a Santa Clara BART station co-located at the existing Santa Clara Depot. Separate construction plans by San Jose International Airport would bring a people-mover train to either the Santa Clara Depot or to Diridon Station. For the subway segment in San Jose, VTA plans to use a tunnel boring machine for most of the length in order to reduce disruptions to downtown during construction. Only the station locations would have cut and cover construction. This is different from how BART subways and stations were built in San Francisco and Oakland, which used the cut and cover method. The construction of the cut and cover stations in downtown San Jose would still cause major albeit temporary disruption, including closing several blocks of Santa Clara Street and severing the VTA light rail line at that street. The extension to downtown San Jose could open 2026, contingent on approval of funding. As of April 2018 the plan is to have a single-bore tunnel under Santa Clara Street with cut and cover construction at the station locations only. Utility relocation started and soil samples were taken in February 2019, with construction scheduled to begin in 2021. Funding and Electoral History (2000‚Äì2008) Since Santa Clara County is not among the member counties of the BART District (having opted out of the district at its inception, like neighboring San Mateo County), VTA is responsible for building the extension within Santa Clara County. VTA allocated initial funds for constructing BART using the proceeds from a sales tax referendum which was passed by Santa Clara County voters in 2000. In December 2002, VTA purchased a freight railroad corridor from Union Pacific Railroad which will serve as much of the necessary right-of-way for both the Warm Springs and San Jose extensions for $80 million. In 2004, the Federal Transit Administration decided to wait to fund the project, citing worries that BART did not have enough money to operate the extension. In addition, the San Jose extension project received a \\"not recommended\\" rating from the Federal Transit Administration placing the federal portion of the funding in jeopardy because of concerns about operation and maintenance funding. Santa Clara County voters passed Measure B in 2008, a -cent sales tax raise. Projections by an independent consultant recommended by the Federal Transit Administration predicted that the -cent sales tax would more than cover operation and maintenance of the proposed extension. San Jose voters passed Measure B in 2016, which allowed for final funding of the subway. =Livermore extension: I-580/Tri-Valley Corridor= A proposed extension will further service from Dublin/Pleasanton station east to Livermore, either via traditional BART infrastructure, diesel multiple unit technology similar to eBART, or enhanced bus service. It could possibly continue over the Altamont Pass into Tracy and the Central Valley along I-580 and/or go north through Dublin, San Ramon, Danville, and Alamo to the existing Walnut Creek station via the I-680 corridor. An existing diesel commuter rail line, the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE), currently operates through Livermore. The two systems are linked, though not directly, by a free shuttle bus which transfers passengers between the ACE Pleasanton station and the BART Dublin/Pleasanton station. A preferred alignment was selected July 1, 2010 and originally had the support of the Livermore City Council. This plan would have involved the construction of a station in downtown Livermore, and a second station on Vasco Road near Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. Both proposed stations would have provided nearby connections to Altamont Corridor Express service. However, in July 2011, the Livermore City Council reversed its position in response to a petition requesting that the alignment stay within or nearby the Interstate 580 right- of-way, and now favors stations be built at the Interstate 580 interchanges with Isabel Avenue and Greenville Road. BART's Environmental Impact Report Notice of Preparation, issued in September 2012, proposed a single station at I-580 and Isabel Avenue, with possible express bus services connecting to the Vasco Road ACE station and a park-and-ride lot at I-580 and Greenville Road. Land use plans and studies were being prepared by the city of Livermore in September 2015, and completion is envisioned in 2026. Additional funding for consulting and planning were allocated in late 2016, against the wishes of then BART District President Tom Radulovich. On July 31, 2017, BART released the Draft Environmental Impact Report of the project. The direct BART to ACE connection was studied in preparation for ACEforward projects. In 2017, citing lack of interest in the project from BART, the Livermore City Council proposed a newly established local entity to undertake planning and construction of the extension, which was also recommended by the California State Assembly Transportation Committee. The Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority was established that year \\"for purposes of planning, developing, and delivering cost-effective and responsive transit connectivity between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District‚Äôs rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail service in the Tri-Valley, that meets the goals and objectives of the community.\\" On May 24, 2018, the BART board voted against a full rapid transit BART build or a bus rapid transit system to extend service east from Dublin/Pleasanton station, thus granting the new authority oversight and funding for constructing a new service. Moneys previously allocated to BART to construct a Livermore extension were forfeited to the authority by July 1, 2018. =BART Metro Vision= Key components of the overall vision for BART's future, dubbed BART Metro Vision, include more capacity in stations, increased train frequency to allow for \\"show up and go\\" service at stations within the system's operational core, and increased performance reliability. The most recent report from BART Metro Vision also identifies improvements to its rolling stock, the Hayward Maintenance Complex, and the modernization of its train control system as key improvements for securing the system's long- term viability. =Second Transbay crossing= Part of BART's 50th anniversary service planning included a new separate Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay running parallel to and south of the existing tube. This would emerge at the Transbay Transit Center to provide connecting service to Caltrain and the planned California High-Speed Rail (CAHSR) system. The additional four-bore Transbay Tube would provide two additional tracks for BART trains, and two tracks for conventional/high-speed rail (the BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges, and operate under different sets of safety regulations). Transit advocacy groups in the Bay Area, such as SPUR, have long promoted larger-scale expansion of the BART system through various capital projects - one identified as a long term goal in the Metro Vision is the construction of a second, four-bore rail tunnel under San Francisco Bay, increasing connectivity and capacity of the system. The second crossing would likely route to the Transbay Transit Center for connections with conventional mainline rail services. In 2018, BART announced that a feasibility study for installing a second transbay crossing would commence the following year. By 2019, the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority had joined with BART to study a multi-modal crossing, which could also allow Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin routes to serve San Francisco directly. =eBART extension= Expansions of the DMU-serviced eBART system come at a lower cost-per-mile than conventional wide-gauge BART infrastructure. Service could extend to Oakley, Byron, or the Brentwood Transit Center in Brentwood. =Geary Subway= Part of the plan for the original system before Marin County's departure from the BART District was a line running under Geary Street and turning north to the Golden Gate Bridge. When Marin County pulled out of the transit district, some plans called for a subway only extending down Geary, but these too were soon scrapped. In 1995, the San Francisco Municipal Railway hired Merrill & Associates to study the possibility of building a new BART subway beneath Geary in conjunction with adding light rail on the surface. The estimated cost of construction as far as Park Presidio Boulevard was $1.4 billion in 1995 ($ adjusted for inflation). Projections from this study put BART ridership at 18,000 daily boardings, and the alignment would allow for a further extension to Marin. These plans were dropped, according to former Senator Quentin L. Kopp, due to merchant and resident opposition, citing potential blight similar to that caused by Market Street Subway construction two decades earlier. Ongoing studies will determine whether the corridor may one day be served by future BART service. It may be constructed as an extension of the second Transbay Tube. =wBART= The only branch of the original BART system that has not been extended since service commenced is the line ending at Richmond station. Possible alignments for an extension further north were examined in 1983, 1992, and 2017. Both newly constructed BART wide-gauge electrified rail and the use of existing freight rail rights of way and tracks with more readily available standard gauge trains were considered. Potential station locations include Hilltop Mall, Pinole, and Hercules Transit Center. The cost of an extension to Hercules Transit Center utilizing mainline BART technology was estimated at $3.6 billion in 2017 with a ridership of 21,980 by 2040. The extension to Hercules is controversial in that the main proponent Zachary Mallet wants to build it directly from the El Cerrito del Norte BART station while the city of Richmond is very opposed to this. Furthermore, the majority of the Hercules city council opposes the extension as they believe it will detract from their plan to develop Hercules station. =I-680 Corridor= Service in the Tri-Valley area had previously been considered with diesel multiple service originating at Walnut Creek and running as far east as Tracy. As part of BART's 50th anniversary and envisioning another fifty years of service, planners foresaw a new East Bay alignment originating at Warm Springs station and running via Interstate 680 to the Martinez Amtrak station. It would connect to the existing stations at Dublin / Pleasanton and Walnut Creek. =Menlo Park extension= In 1999, a short-lived proposal to extend BART from the Millbrae station (then under construction) to Menlo Park was advanced by the San Mateo County Economic Development Association (SAMCEDA). The proposed routing would have followed the Caltrain tracks to the Broadway station in Burlingame, and then would run along the median of Bayshore Freeway to Menlo Park, with stations in San Mateo, Belmont/San Carlos, Redwood City, and Menlo Park. Cost estimates ranged up to , drawing funding from a 1/2-cent sales tax increase in San Mateo County. BART leadership warned the timing was not appropriate for a push further south into San Mateo County, and SAMCEDA withdrew the proposal by the summer of 1999. Infill stations Infill stations are stations constructed on existing line segments between two existing stations. The West Dublin/Pleasanton and Embarcadero stations are the only infill stations currently in the BART system. The Doolittle Car Barn, initially slated to be opened as a full station along the Oakland Airport Connector, may be repurposed for passenger service at a later date. BART planners have studied additional stations for at least four other sites within the system: Albany, Calaveras, Irvington, and 30th Street Mission. Construction costs for a planned 30th Street Mission station in San Francisco, between the existing 24th Street Mission and Glen Park stations, were estimated at approximately $500 million in 2003. A proposal for a Jack London Square station in Oakland was rejected as being incompatible with existing track geometry; a one-station stub line at the foot of Broadway and the use of other transit modes also were studied. The City of Fremont re-evaluated the Irvington station's environmental impact report in 2017, and a station area plan was adopted by the Fremont City Council and approved by the BART Board of Directors in 2019. , estimates from the city anticipated construction to begin in 2022, with the Irvington station opening for service in 2026.

Life and works She was born in Paran√°, in the province of Entre R√≠os, Argentina, but as a girl she lived in Buenos Aires. On 10 August 1949, when she was eight years old, her mother, Leopoldina Lichtschein, also a writer and poet, died in a train accident. This tragic episode marked Bird's life, but also signaled her destiny as a writer. At the age of thirteen she won a poetry contest. At the age of sixteen, she had already published her first short story, and the following year she began to publish, in a professional way, poems and texts in important magazines, both for Argentina and the world. Apart from producing texts aimed at children and young people, she worked as the director of the magazine Vosotras, which she transformed into a well-known magazine for womanly publications. Bird was awarded several international prizes, such as the Santa Clara de As√≠s and the Premio Mundial Consagraci√≥n de la Literatura.

A cattle drover turned Wall Street banker and broker Daniel Drew at first loaned $2 million to the railroad, and then acquired control over it. He amassed a fortune by skillfully manipulating the Erie railroad shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Cornelius Vanderbilt, who set his mind on building a railroad empire, saw multiple business and financial opportunities in railways and decided in 1866 to corner the market on Erie by silently scooping the Erie railroad stock. After succeeding, Vanderbilt permitted Drew to stay on the board of directors in his former capacity as a treasurer.Myers, Gustavus. History of the Great American Fortunes. Vol.2.

Watered-down stocks Between 1866-1868, Daniel Drew conspired with James Fisk and Jay Gould, whom he brought on the board, to issue spurious Erie Railroad shares, thus \\"watering down\\" the stock, of which unsuspecting Cornelius Vanderbilt bought a large quantity.Browder, Clifford. The Money Game in Old New York: Daniel Drew and His Times. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1986. Vanderbilt lost more than $7 million in his attempt to gain control over Erie Railway Company, although Gould later returned most of the money under threat of litigation. As a result, Vanderbilt conceded control of the railroad to the trio. They were involved with the corrupt Tammany Hall political party machine, and made Boss Tweed a director of the Erie Railroad. Tweed (who later died in prison for embezzlement and fraud), in return arranged favorable state legislation in Albany for them, legalizing the newly issued shares. New York railroad row as seen by contemporaries Gustavus Myers, an American historian and muckraker, wrote in his survey of railroad fortunes in the U.S., But in 1870, Fisk and Gould betrayed Drew, again manipulating the Erie Railroad stock price and causing him to lose $1.5 million.White, Bouck.

He died in 1879, dependent on his son for support. Gould eventually gained the advantage in the conflict, but he had to relinquish control in 1872-73, following his loss of $1 million worth of Erie Railroad stock to the British confidence man Lord Gordon-Gordon. Public opinion was also hostile to Gould because of his involvement in the 1869 Black Friday stock market crash. In 1878, after all financial swindles and due to continuing mismanagement the Erie Railway Company declared bankruptcy and was reconstituted as the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway Company.

It is north of Kuujjuaq, between Aupaluk and Quaqtaq. The community is only accessible by air (Kangirsuk Airport) and, in late summer, by boat. The village used to be known also as Payne Bay and Bellin. Geography Kangirsuk is located above the tree line near the mouth of the Arnaud River on the north shore of Payne Bay, inland from the western coast of Ungava Bay. A rocky cliff to the north and a large, rocky hill to the west partially surround the village. =Climate=History Pamiok Island, Longhouse No. 2 In the 11th century the area was possibly visited by Vikings. Not far from the village on Pamiok Island, Thomas E. Lee, an archaeologist from Universit√© Laval, discovered a stone foundation of what is believed to be a Viking long house. Another archeological site, Hammer of Thor, is located on north shores of Payne River about west of the village. Inuit have hunted and fished along the Ungava Bay coast for centuries. Permanent European settlement did not occur until 1921 when the Revillon Fr√®res company set up a trading post here, named Payne River (now the Arnaud River) in memory of Frank F. Payne, who explored the region during the winter of 1885-1886. Four years later, the competing Hudson's Bay Company also set up a post. The Inuit remained nomadic however and only visited the site as a summer encampment because of the abundance of game. In 1945, the location was known as Payne Bay. In 1959, the federal day school was founded. From then on permanent settlement by Inuit finally began. In 1961, the federal government provided healthcare facilities, housing, and social services. That same year, the Quebec Government decided to give French names to places of the northern Quebec coast and changed the name of the post to Francis-Babel, in honour of Louis-Fran√ßois Babel (1826-1912). But this name did not take root, and was replaced a year later with Bellin, named after Jacques-Nicolas Bellin (1703-1772). It was subsequently known as Bellin (Payne) until 1980. That year, the name was changed to Kangiqsuk when the village was incorporated as a Northern Village Municipality (). Local authorities disagreed with this transliteration, and in 1982 it was corrected to Kangirsuk. Since 1996, the police services in Kangirsuk are provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force.

Specialists in 15th-century art attribute the painting to the school of Brussels painter, Rogier van der Weyden, or to an anonymous disciple of his school. Origin of the tradition Milk Grotto, Bethlehem, 2014 According to tradition, the Milk Grotto, not far from Bethlehem, is the site where the Holy Family took refuge during the Massacre of the Innocents, before their flight to Egypt. While there, the Virgin Mary nursed her holy Child. Some drops of milk sprinkled the walls, changing to white the color of the stone.Sudilovsky, Judith. \\"Bethlehem's Milk Grotto brings faith, hope and sometimes babies\\", Catholic News Service, December 11, 2007 The site is venerated by both Christians and Muslims. According to Franciscan, Brother Lawrence, an American who oversees the grotto and chapel for the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land, the grotto is at least 2,000 years old. Early Christians came to pray here, but the first structure was built around 385. Known in Arabic as ‚ÄúMagharet el Saiyidee‚Äù (The Grotto of Our Lady), the grotto, hollowed out of limestone, has become a place of pilgrimage for couples hoping to conceive a child. A second legend identifies this site as the location where the Three Kings visited the Holy Family, and presented their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the Divine Child. A tradition going back to the 7th century, located at this site the burial place of the innocent victims killed by Herod the Great after the birth of Jesus. The Devotion to Our Lady of the Milk requests husbands and wives to pray together the third of the joyful mysteries of the rosary, meditating on the Nativity of the Lord. There is also a Shrine of Our Lady of \\"La Leche y Buen Parto\\" (Spanish for ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Milk and Happy Delivery‚Äù) in St. Augustine, Florida. Original painting The tradition of milk dates back to the first centuries of Christianity. Those converting to Christianity were given a mixture of milk and honey to drink, which in the early churches of Egypt, Rome, and North Africa was solemnly blessed at the Easter and Pentecost vigils. Milk with honey symbolized the union of the two natures in Christ. The custom of giving milk with honey to the newly baptized did not last long, but this tradition is visible in artistic representations. Details The image is painted on a wooden canvas. It measures 37.2 cm by 65 cm. The woman in the painting, the Virgin Mary, is medium-sized, and has some color on her face, lose hair, rays around the head, and eyes gazing upon the Child in swaddling clothes. She has one of her breasts uncovered, with small drops of milk falling towards the Child's lips. He reclines in his mother's arms, reciprocating the gaze of the mother. The Virgin Mary is wearing a blue blouse (not black), and a dark red or crimson mantle. Behind her, a dark grove of trees looks like a mountain. The painting appeared next to a fountain, in the place where the future Dominican convent in San Juan would be founded, sometime between 1511 and 1522. According to tradition, during the English invasion of 1598, and Dutch invasion of 1625, the painting was hidden and later found. In 1714, a copy was placed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Cathedral of San Juan Bautista), in San Juan. Copy of the original painting, venerated today in Puerto Rico. During the Siege of Abercromby (1797), bishop Juan Bautista Zengotita gave orders for daily public prayer, to be held in parishes of the city. According to Cayetano Coll y Toste's legend, participants, mainly women, sang songs and litanies, and carried candles or torches in their hands. The painting of Our Lady of Bethlehem was carried through the city to ask God for help. According to this legend the invading army, frightened by such imposing sight, decided to withdraw and not attack the city. Today in the Caleta de San Juan, next to the ancient wall and facing the Bay of San Juan, there is a sculpture called \\"La Rogativa\\" or \\"The Public Petition,\\" which commemorates this chapter in the history of Puerto Rico. Painter Jos√© Campeche attributed the protection of the city to Our Lady of Bethlehem. A painting meant to be a votive offering gives witness to the fact that inhabitants began to consider Our Lady as the \\"Protectora de la ciudad\\", or \\"Guardian of the City.\\" He made many reproductions of the original Our Lady of Bethlehem, some of which are to be found in Old San Juan's National Gallery and the Museum of the Universidad de Puerto Rico in R√≠o Piedras. Juan Alejo de Arizmendi, the first Puerto Rican bishop, spread devotion to the painting. In 1806 he granted forty days of indulgence to those who said a Hail Mary in front of the image, praying to God for Church intentions. He asked to place a copy in Santos √Ångeles Custodios parish, in Yabucoa, and commended artist De La Espada to carve a wooden image that is located in the main altar of San Isidro Labrador's parish, in Sabana Grande. Towards 1864, priest Ven. Jer√≥nimo Usera y Alarc√≥n wrote a Noveen to Our Lady of Bethlehem. In the prologue he gave witness to the courage of the men and women who took part in the Siege of 1797, and called her Fellow Citizen of all Puerto Ricans. The original Our Lady of Bethlehem disappeared from San Jos√© Church of Old San Juan (the old St. Thomas Church of the Dominicans) in 1972. A reproduction was made in Belgium and presented to the people of Puerto Rico on January 3, 2012. At the same date, the Angelical Confraternity of Our Lady of Bethlehem was restored. Notable representations In the Catacombs of Priscilla, in Rome, a 2nd Century pictorial representation of the Virgin Mary may be found. Most likely it is a breastfeeding Virgin. There are other symbols referring to milk in the catacombs. In the church of the Chilandari Monastery in Mount Athos, Greece, there is a \\"Virgin of Milk\\" in Byzantine style of the 11th and 12th centuries. It is called Panagia Galaktotrophusa. During the 13th Century, in the town of Saydnaya, near Damascus, next to a wooden pictorial representation of the Virgin, there was an inscription in Latin: Hoc oleum ex ubere Genitris Dei Virginia Mariae emanavit in loco, qui Sardinia vocatur, ubi genitilitas est, ex imagine lignea, which means: \\"This oil flowed from the breast of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, sculpted in wood. It took in a place gentiles call Sardinia.\\" It was moved from Constantinople to Saydnaya, probably in the 11th century. Even after the 14th century, it still gave oil or milk. Templars distributed oil or milk among pilgrims in many countries. It is very likely that this famous shrine of Saydnaya, which was a pilgrimage place for Christians of the East and West, is the source (or one of the major sources) of this artistic theme. Representations of the Virgin Mary in Flanders and the Netherlands Responding to the devotion and worship of the Virgin in Europe during the Middle Ages, early Flemish painters produced numerous images of Mary. At the end of the 15th and 16th centuries, and up until the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), the representations of the \\"Virgin of Milk\\" were popular in Flanders. Rogier Van der Weyden, presumed creator or inspirer of Puerto Rican \\"Lady of Bethlehem\\", was a Flemish painter of fame and prestige in the 15th century. In 1435 he left his home town of Tournai to settle in Brussels, where he was appointed premier painter of the city. None of the paintings attributed to him are signed. Attraction for his art was not limited to the region of Brussels. He received orders from distant regions such as Italy, Savoy, cities along the Rhine, and Spain. No historical data has been found that certify how this Flemish painting arrived in the New World. It is possible that Spanish Dominican friars coming to Puerto Rico took it along with them on their trip their first convent in Old San Juan. It is also possible that the first Spanish settlers (Juan Ponce de Le√≥n with others), or even the first anonymous Franciscan friars who came to the New World, may have carried it on board.

The CP1600's design was based on the PDP-11, whose design also formed the basis of the Western Digital MCP-1600 and influenced others. Honeywell used the CP1600 in a number of process control computers and related systems, but its most widespread use was the CP1610 version in the Intellivision video game console. Description CP1600 Pin-out The CP1600's instruction set closely followed the PDP-11's, but was not entirely compatible. The instruction opcode was only 10 bits, with the remaining 6 marked \\"Reserved for future expansion\\". It appears that the extra 6 bits were intended to be used with co-processors, asserting the PCIT line which stalled the CPU until released. Instructions might be one to three words long depending on the addressing format being used. Unlike similar CPUs, the CP1600 did not support memory-memory indirect addressing (offsets), and looping was implemented in a different way which allowed it to run much faster. Like the PDP-11, the CP1600 used eight 16-bit \\"general purpose\\" processor registers, although they were not truly general purpose as in modern designs. Only R0 was truly general purpose and has been described as \\"the primary accumulator\\".Lowell Turner, \\"General Instruments CP1600\\", 10 July 2001 R1 through R3 were data counters, generally used for register-based addressing (\\"implied addressing\\"). R4 and R5 auto-incremented after being accessed, which made them useful for looping over collections of data. R6 was the stack pointer, R7 the program counter. Since both of these registers were visible to the programmer, they could be used to implement multiple stacks, or support more complex branching, among other things. There were no implicit stack instructions; when R6 was used in a \\"read\\" operation it decremented the address and then returned the data being pointed at, simulating a \`POP\`, and when it was used in a \\"write\\" it would post-increment (like R4/R5) and write, like a \`PUSH\`. Like the PDP-11, one of the CP1600's notable features was the use of memory-mapped I/O, meaning that devices were controlled by writing to certain locations in memory. Unlike the PDP-11's Unibus, however, the CP1600 multiplexed its data and address lines in order to reduce pin count and fit into a 40-pin DIP. This change meant that implementations had to use latches or buffers to be able to interface with the CPU as it changed the bus from indicating an address to data. This negatively affected I/O performance, and to address this problem GI designed the \\"Programmable Interface Controller\\" which was designed to work in concert with the CP1600 as a channel controller. The CP1600 was implemented in nMOS and required +12, +5, -3 V power supplies; most internal logic was implemented in TTL (5 V). Each micro state or processor cycle uses four internal time slots generated by two non-overlapping clocks. A 3.3 MHz two-phase clock produces a 600 nanosecond microcycle. A 5 MHz two-phase clock produces a 400 nanosecond microcycle. It is able to add two 16-bit internal registers in 2.4 microseconds, and memory to register add two 16-bit numbers in 3.2 microseconds.http://www.bitsavers.org/components/gi/CP1600/CP-1600_Microprocessor_Users_Manual_May75.pdf General Instrument provided cross-assemblers and simulators/debuggers compatible with 16-bit or larger minicomputers.http://www.bitsavers.org/components/gi/CP1600/CP-1600_Cross_Assembler_Simulator_Users_Manual_Nov74.pdf GI also provided a standalone CP1600 based microcomputer system in the GIC1600.http://www.bitsavers.org/components/gi/CP1600/GIC1600_Microcomputer_Users_Manuals_Sep75.pdf Uses The CP1610, used in the Intellivision, is a compatible member of the 1600 microprocessor family. It uses a 2 MHz two-phase clock producing a 1 microsecond processor cycle.http://intellivisionbrasil.com/docs/manuais- hardware/Service_GeneralInstrument_CP1610.pdf The CP1610 in the NTSC Intellivisions uses a 1.7897725 MHz two-phase clock. Although users of the CP1600 in the traditional computer role were relatively rare, over 3 million Intellivisions were produced from 1980 until the video game crash of 1983 led to the closing of the Intellivision production lines in 1984. Production of the CP1600 ended in 1985 when General Instrument spun off its microelectronics division to create Microchip Technology. By this point a number of 32-bit designs like the MC68000 were available that limited interest in a 16-bit design like the CP1600, and their main existing customer, the Intellivision, was no longer in production. Many other products were also end-of-lifed at the same time, and their primary product was the PIC.

The Bruins went on to win 45-25\\\\. Stevens was the quarterback for UCLA in the 1986 Rose Bowl in which the Bruins defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 45-28. Stevens was 16-26 for 169 yards and one touchdown. Stevens is currently the football color analyst on UCLA's flagship radio station. In 2001, Stevens was voted \\"Color Analyst of the Year\\" by the Southern California Broadcasters Association.

She was originally the ocean liner . The conversion was started in 1942 but was never completed, and the ship was never delivered to the Regia Marina. She began to be scrapped in 1946, a process completed by 1952. As MS AugustusAs Sparviero In 1936, a project to transform the 30,418 GRT ocean liner Augustus into an auxiliary carrier was prepared. The idea was initially abandoned but then resumed in 1942. The passenger ship Augustus was first renamed Falco and then to Sparviero. The superstructure was to be removed. She would have also been equipped with a single hangar with two lifts and fitted with a flight deck that ended before the bow. She would have had a narrow flight deck. Her air group was to be either 34 fighters or 16 fighters and 9 torpedo bombers. The propulsion plant was to remain unchanged, the diesel engines giving an estimated speed of under 20 knots. Wreck of Sparviero in Genoa, 1944 The conversion began in September 1942, the work undertaken by the Ansaldo Shipyard in Genoa. Apart from removing the superstructure little else was done before the Italian capitulation in September 1943. The hull was captured by the Germans and was sunk on 5 October 1944 to block access to the port of Genoa. The wreckage was recovered after the war and finally scrapped in 1951. Like Sparviero, the , a modification of the sister ship of Augustus, , was scuttled and scrapped before the conversion into the aircraft carrier was finished. These two ships were the last attempts to build aircraft carriers for the Italian Navy until 1981, when work began on .

In its basic design a tucker bag is a pouch or bag with a single entry typically closed with a drawstring, and may have been made of leather or oilskin. Swagman (1904 Australian postcard) \\"Sundowner\\" could be applied derogatively as meaning one who arrives at a station too late to do any useful work, but still expects a feed and top-up of the tuckerbag. The tucker bag should not be confused with the swag, also carried by outback travellers, whether on foot, horse or pushbike, which may have comprised blankets (usually blue, hence \\"bluey\\", another name for a swag), waterproof sheet, personal effects, and basic cooking implements such as a billy. The swag would generally be carried as a sausage-shaped roll slung over the shoulder, and the tucker bag in front. The term \\"tucker bag\\" appears in a number of traditional Australian songs and poems, including Waltzing Matilda \\"Whose is that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?\\", reflecting the tucker bag's place in Australian culture and history. Tucker box Bullockies and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles were not so constrained by the need for portability, so a greater quantity of food could be carried in a tucker box, as exemplified by the story of the Dog on the Tuckerbox. The contents would be similar, though: salt beef, tea, flour and sugar or golden syrup and perhaps tinned jam. Train crews' tucker boxes would contain more than food: a tin plate, pannikin (small pan or cup), eating utensils and toiletries. Most crews would not take meat with them but would buy it at the town where they ended their shift, since there were no refrigeration facilities on board. \\"Tucker box\\" has been a model of domestic chest freezer built in Australia under the Whirlpool brand name.

Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court decision that was a companion case to Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. that the Court decided on the same day. Like Sears, Compco held that state law that, in effect, duplicated the protections of the US patent laws was preempted by federal law.. Day-Brite's lighting fixture -- Drawing from Day-Brite's design patent Background Day-Brite obtained a design patent on a lighting fixture, a cross-ribbed reflector for fluorescent light tubes. Compco's predecessor copied the fixture and sold it in competition against Day-Brite. Day-Brite then sued for infringement of the design patent and unfair competition under Illinois state law, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The district court held the design patent invalid but ruled in Day-Brite's favor on the unfair competition claim.376 U.S. at 235. The court found that the overall appearance of Compco's fixture was \\"the same, to the eye of the ordinary observer, as the overall appearance\\" of Day-Brite's fixture, which embodied the design of the invalidated design patent; that the appearance of Day- Brite's design had \\"the capacity to identify [Day-Brite] in the trade, and does in fact so identify [it] to the trade\\"; that the concurrent sale of the two products was \\"likely to cause confusion in the trade\\"; and that \\"[a]ctual confusion has occurred.\\" Accordingly, the court ordered Compco to pay damages and enjoined its further sale of the fixture. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment. It found that \\"several choices of ribbing were apparently available to meet the functional needs of the product,\\" yet Compco \\"chose precisely the same design used by the plaintiff and followed it so closely as to make confusion likely.\\"376 U.S. at 236. The only evidence of confusion was testimony by a Day-Brite employee that a third party plant manager had installed some of Compco's fixtures and later mistakenly asked Day-Brite to service the fixtures, thinking they had been made by Day-Brite. There was evidence that Compco clearly labeled its fixtures and their containers with Compco's name. The Supreme Court characterized this evidence as showing that Compco sold an article that was an exact copy of another unpatented article, and that the conduct was ‚Äúlikely to produce, and did in this case produce, confusion as to the source of the article.‚Äù376 U.S. at 237. Ruling Justice Hugo L. Black In a unanimous ruling (although Justice Harlan separately concurred), the Court reversed. The Court reiterated its holding in the Stiffel case that: > [W]hen an article is unprotected by a patent or a copyright, state law may > not forbid others to copy that article. To forbid copying would interfere > with the federal policy, found in Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution > and in the implementing federal statutes, of allowing free access to copy > whatever the federal patent and copyright laws leave in the public domain. The Court held that the ‚Äúfindings‚Äù of the court of appeals about confusion, identification of the design with Day-Brite, lack of functionality of the design, and the like were immaterial because the absence of deception on Compco's part: > It is true that the trial court found that the configuration of Day-Brite's > fixture identified Day-Brite to the trade because the arrangement of the > ribbing had, like a trademark, acquired a \\"secondary meaning\\" by which that > particular design was associated with Day-Brite. But if the design is not > entitled to a design patent or other federal statutory protection, then it > can be copied at will. > > As we have said in Sears, while the federal patent laws prevent a State > from prohibiting the copying and selling of unpatented articles, they do not > stand in the way of state law, statutory or decisional, which requires those > who make and sell copies to take precautions to identify their products as > their own. A State, of course, has power to impose liability upon those who, > knowing that the public is relying upon an original manufacturer's > reputation for quality and integrity, deceive the public by palming off > their copies as the original. That an article copied from an unpatented > article could be made in some other way, that the design is \\"nonfunctional\\" > and not essential to the use of either article, that the configuration of > the article copied may have a \\"secondary meaning\\" which identifies the maker > to the trade, or that there may be \\"confusion\\" among purchasers as to which > article is which or as to who is the maker, may be relevant evidence in > applying a State's law requiring such precautions as labeling; however, and > regardless of the copier's motives, neither these facts nor any others can > furnish a basis for imposing liability for or prohibiting the actual acts of > copying and selling. And, of course, a State cannot hold a copier > accountable in damages for failure to label or otherwise to identify his > goods unless his failure is in violation of valid state statutory or > decisional law requiring the copier to label or take other precautions to > prevent confusion of customers as to the source of the goods.376 U.S. at > 238-39 (citation omitted). Subsequent developments Day-Brite is still in the fluorescent lighting fixture business, as a division of Philips.See and . This case and Sears are widely cited for the proposition that federal patent law preempts state law that seeks to provide an alternative protection scheme that duplicates or is inconsistent with the balances that Congress carefully struck between competition and protection in the patent laws. See, for example, Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.. In that case, referring to Sears and Compco, the Court said: > Thus our past decisions have made clear that state regulation of > intellectual property must yield to the extent that it clashes with the > balance struck by Congress in our patent laws. . . . Where it is clear how > the patent laws strike that balance in a particular circumstance, that is > not a judgment the States may second-guess.

Career In 2016, Ambinder was a Leadership Fellow at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communications and Journalism. Since 2017, he has taught investigative journalism, political journalism and national security journalism. He consults for Fortune 100 companies on corporate and strategic communication. Until December 31, 2011 Ambinder was the White House correspondent at the National Journal. He previously worked at ABC News and was chief political consultant to CBS News from 2008 to 2011. For years, he was the author of a political blog, The Hotline. Though presidential politics and Washington have been his primary areas of interest, he also writes about intelligence and national security, and has broken several stories, including details about the raid on Osama bin Laden. His first book, \\"The Command: Inside The President's Secret Army,\\" is an examination of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command. He has secured access to the protective details of the Secret Service, broken stories about computer failures that jeopardized America‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, probed Pakistan‚Äôs fragile intelligence services, and became an authority on national security topics ranging from the NSA and surveillance, to the government‚Äôs secret commando force, to its secretive continuity of government plans. He has written for The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, Vice, and numerous national magazines. He has been a consulting producer and on-air expert for documentaries about special operations forces, the Secret Service and government doomsday plans. He has been a guest on every national television news network in the U.S., on the BBC, on Al Jazeera International and was a regular analyst on politics for CBS News Radio. His online journalism has won him several awards and attracted a large Twitter following. He was nominated for an Emmy in 2005 and was part of a team that won a DuPont Silver Baton from Columbia University. Gawker reported that, in 2009, Ambinder struck a deal with Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines to provide positive remarks on Clinton in exchange for receiving an advance copy of a Clinton speech. Gawker based its report on a fragment of an email chain they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Both Ambinder and Reines said that the emails lacked critical context, which showed that Ambinder did not actually make any such deal with Reines. Ambinder later said he regretted how such incidents, even when misinterpreted, contributed to the fraying of trust between political journalists and the public, and decried the proliferation of transactional reporting in Washington. Personal In 2010 Ambinder wrote about his experience with bariatric surgery, which reduced his weight from 235 to 150 pounds. He is married to Michael Park, a corporate strategy consultant.

Even a biopsy of all these conditions may not result in a definitive diagnosis, as all three conditions may demonstrate spongiosis and crusting on the hands. Non-communicable inflammation of the skin of the hands is referred to as hand eczema. Hand eczema is widely prevalent and, as it is a very visible condition associated with severe itching or pain, has serious consequences for the affected person including a high psychological impact. Different disease patterns can be identified according to the course of the illness, appearance of symptoms, degree of severity, or catalysts. Prognosis is hard to predict for individual cases of chronic hand eczema and usually differs from patient to patient. Successful treatment depends on determining the causes of the condition, obtaining an accurate diagnosis, sustainable hand protection procedures and an early, extensive, and where appropriate internal treatment.  Signs and symptoms  Normally, skin inflammation connected with hand eczema is accompanied by blister formation and pronounced itching, but solid calluses and painful tearing may also occur. The quality of life of the affected person is seriously diminished, especially in the case of chronic forms of the illness, and psychological impact is often very high. This impact is enhanced by the high visibility of the illness on the hands, which may lead to feelings of shame and fear of rejection.  Causes  There are a number of different causes of skin inflammation of the hands, the interplay of which is also significant: environmental factors such as excessive water; contact with allergens or irritants; and genetic disposition. A single catalyst is seldom responsible for the development of hand eczema in patients. = Differences according to catalysts = Three main factors play an essential role in the development of chronic hand eczema: excessive contact with water and irritants (cumulative-toxic stress), contact with allergens, and atopic diathesis, which has a genetic component. Individual hand eczema types are identified and named according to the main catalysts involved, i.e. cumulative-toxic, contact- allergenic, or atopic hand eczema. Activities that are stressful for the skin or involve repeated, excessive contact with water or skin-irritating substances at work or home can cause damage to the skin's protective abilities and increase the chances of inflammation. This also applies to prolonged wearing of protective rubber gloves and similar materials, since sweating occurs within these gloves. Disturbance of the skin's protective barrier also facilitates penetration by allergenic substances and promotes the development of contact dermatitis. Contact allergies play a very important role in the development of hand eczema. If the hand is subjected to repeated contact with a substance that leads to an allergy, the skin reacts with signs of inflammation. Numerous people affected by hand eczema also experience skin inflammation on their feet. Often, a contact allergy to an ingredient in shoe leather treatment may be the catalyst. Contact allergies in certain types of employment are especially problematic, particularly if the work involves the handling of allergenic materials, e.g. masonry work or hairdressing. People allergic to Balsam of Peru may experience a flare-up of hand eczema if they use or consume products that use it as an ingredient. Severe and chronic eczema qualifies as one of the most frequent occupational illnesses. Patients should therefore be referred to an occupational-dermatological specialist as soon as possible. Patients with a history of neurodermitis, hay fever, or allergic asthma often develop hand eczema. These sicknesses reflect the individual's particular susceptibility or genetic predisposition to react over-sensitively to various environmental influences. This is described as atopy or atopy diathesis. Atopic diathesis is frequently accompanied by genetically conditioned problems with the skin's protective barriers, which causes a weakening of the skin's resistance against irritating substances and moisture, as well as easier penetration by allergens, which may lead to the development of contact allergies. = Differences according to prevailing signs of skin illness (morphology) = hyperkeratotic fissured hand eczema fingertip eczema The clinical appearance of various subtypes of hand eczema differs. The term dyshidrotic hand eczema is used to describe formations that mainly exhibit pronounced, itching blister formations, while callus and tear formations typically indicate hyperkeratotic fissured hand eczema. = Differences according to degree of severity and course = Independent of the triggering cause or the prevailing signs of skin illness, the selection and planning of treatment options is important, since different types of illness also differ in terms of their degree of severity and the course of the illness. While light hand eczema heals relatively quickly following dermatological therapy and patient participation, more pronounced hand eczema may persist over several weeks. Severe hand eczema is characterised by consistent or recurring, extended inflammation of the skin that severely affects the patient. Hand eczema is described as chronic if it lasts at least 3 months in spite of dermatological treatment, or if it recurs at least twice within a period of 12 months (relapsed) . Severe and chronic patterns of hand eczema are often resilient to treatment, making the condition extremely stressful for those affected. Diagnosis During diagnosis it is important to determine the type of hand eczema and plan specific treatment accordingly. An additional diagnosis of allergies will indicate whether contact allergies or atopy diathesis are the cause of the hand eczema. Discussion concerning frequency of contact with water, irritants, and allergens in private and professional environments will also help evaluate individual stresses on the patient's skin. The hands may also exhibit various other skin illnesses and potential fungal infection or psoriasis must be ruled out. Usually, taking the patient‚Äôs personal history into account will help provide an accurate diagnosis. Patch test Patch testing has been found to be helpful in the diagnosis of hand eczema. Treatment Hand eczema is a complex condition, and treatment should only be administered by a dermatologist with specialist knowledge. Treatment may be very costly. Treatment should follow certain basic principles, and chronic and severe cases of hand eczema in particular require complex treatment concepts. Besides skin care, hand protection, and external (topical) applications with preparations containing effective ingredients or light therapy, an internal (systemic) therapy may be considered. = Avoidance of catalysts, basic procedures, and skin protection = Of primary importance is the strict removal and avoidance of catalysts for the development of chronic hand eczema, such as skin-irritating damage, excessive contact with water, or proven allergenic substances. Treatment of every type of hand eczema and degree of severity must include sustainable replenishment of the natural oils and moisture contained in the skin with creams and salves free of fragrances and preservatives; this is an essential basic step. In addition, protection procedures developed especially for the individual's skin stresses must be applied, e.g. use of cotton or hypoallergenic plastic gloves. Depending on the individual's own needs, these procedures should continue after the hand eczema heals, since they will also have a preventative effect. = External treatment = External treatment should be oriented primarily according to the prevailing signs of illness. In the case of blister forming, drying treatments such as hand baths containing synthetic tannins or oily- moist preparations may hinder itching. If callus development exhibiting tear formation is present, the focus should be on softening the skin with preparations containing urea or salicylic acid. In order to reduce inflammation, creams and salves containing cortisone are often very effective. Topical corticosteroids are a standard treatment for hand eczema, but their efficacy in comparison to UV phototherapy is not clear. Severe and chronic cases seldom respond sufficiently and require long periods of treatment which can increase the risk of side effects occurring. In individual cases, and especially in the case of atopic hand eczema, the dermatologist may prefer to use cortisone-free, anti-inflammatory creams or salves, which include calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. Topical alitretinoin, or 9-cis-retinoic acid, has also been shown to improve hand eczema outcome. = Phototherapy = Phototherapy can be effective in the treatment of chronic hand eczema. However, not all dermatologists or dermatology clinics offer this form of therapy, and it involves extended periods of treatment for the patient. A period of four to six weeks should involve 3‚Äì4 radiation sessions. The most frequently applied form of light therapy is PUVA therapy. This first treats the hands with a cream that contains an ingredient that causes the skin to become light-sensitive, the hands are then irradiated with ultraviolet A light (UV-A). After two days of treatment, a pause of one day must occur. Due to possible risks such as premature skin aging or chronic light damage caused to the skin, phototherapy cannot be considered for the long term. = Systemic treatment = Besides skin care, skin protection, and an external treatment, severe and chronic cases of hand eczema often also require systemic treatment. Various preparations are available for this. For acute, severe episodes exhibiting blister formation, internal cortisone preparations, sometimes in combination with certain antibiotics, may be helpful in the short term. The active agent ciclosporin, which is approved for treatment of severely pronounced neurodermitis, may also be used for severe, atopic hand eczema. Other substances that suppress the immune system have also shown effectiveness in some cases. However, these substances are not approved for hand eczema. In the last couple of years an internal medicine has been approved for the first time for the treatment of chronic hand eczema. This involves a derivative of vitamin A, called alitretinoin, which is also naturally present in the human body. Alitretinoin can be used to treat all forms of severe chronic hand eczema which have not reacted to external cortisone preparations. The effectiveness of this form of treatment has been tested extensively in clinical study programs and proven prior to its approval. The trial results showed that two thirds of patients did not suffer a recurrence 6 months after application of the medication, and that re-treatment is effective if hand eczema reoccurs. The duration of alitretinoin treatment is 3 to 6 months. During treatment and one month prior to beginning and one month after completion, women of childbearing-age must use contraceptives and also test for pregnancy each month since, as with all derivatives of vitamin A, the substance involved is teratogenic. Side effects mainly include temporary headaches during the initial days of treatment, as well as a possible increase in blood fat and cholesterol values. Regular laboratory tests of blood values are recommended to monitor this.  Epidemiology  Hand eczema is a common condition: study data indicates a one-year prevalence of up to 10% in the general population. It is estimated that only 50‚Äì70% of people affected consult a doctor. The frequency of severe, chronic and recurrent forms of hand eczema is estimated at 5‚Äì7%. Approximately 2‚Äì4% of hand eczema patients also report that external (topical) therapy is insufficient. Several factors adversely affect the long-term prognosis, including the development of the condition prior to the 20th birthday, the severity of initial manifestations, and eczema during childhood. Women, especially those under 30, are more frequently affected than men.  References  External links  Category:Eczema ","title":"Hand eczema"},{"id":"20884211","text":"Al-Asadi v. Bush, No. 1:05-cv-02197, is a writ of habeas corpus filed on behalf of Guantanamo detainee Mohammed Ahmed Ali Al Asadi before US District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy. It was one of over 200 habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of detainees held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Military Commissions Act The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. Cited in other habeas petitions Kennedy's ruling, lifting a stay imposed upon habeas petitions in 2005, pending the resolution of Boumediene v. Bush, was cited in several other habeas petitions. Boumediene v. Bush On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system.. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of \\"enemy combatant\\". Re-initiation Al Asidi's petition was renewed, as a former captive seeking relief for his former detention. On July 3, 2008, US District Court Judge Thomas F. Hogan issued an order regarding former Guantanamo captives, who might seek relief for their former detentions. That order gave their attorneys until July 14 to respond with a brief status report, if they wanted to continue to proceed. Al Asadi's habeas petition was one of those on Justice Hogan's list. On July 9, 2008, Zachary Katznelson filed a statement summarizing the status of this petition, and several others. On July 14, 2008, Andrew I.

The aircraft had problems with the engine installation and only 144 were built, some without engines and were scrapped. Development The Courlis was an all-metal high-wing cantilever monoplane with twin booms supporting a tail unit. It was powered by a 190 hp (142 kW) Mathis G8R piston engine mounted in the rear fuselage in a pusher configuration. It had a fixed tricycle landing gear and had four seats in the enclosed cabin. The prototype, registered F-WBBF, first flew on 9 May 1946.Simpson 1991, page 362 Production was started and a total of 144 aircraft were completed with a number being exported to South America. Problems with the engine (insufficient power, cooling)Pegase n¬∞58, La formule des appareils bipoutres √† moteur propulsif, Jacques Noetinger resulted in the withdrawal of the engine's type certificate and some airframes were never fitted with an engine and scrapped. The company did test fit the aircraft with a 220 hp (164 kW) Mathis engine but production was ended. The aircraft flew for some years, owned by French private pilots, but by the mid-1950s, most had been withdrawn from service, with many being stored at Mitry-Mory airfield near Paris. In 1961 the design was revised as the SUC-11G Super Courlis with a 240 hp (179 kW) Continental O-470M engine, but was abandoned after a prototype was built.

They can be localised or generalised. This is also known as an 'autoeczematous response' and there must be an identifiable initial inflammatory or infectious skin problem which leads to the generalised eczema. Often intensely itchy, the red papules and pustules can also be associated with blisters and scales and are always remote from the primary lesion. It is most commonly a blistering rash with itchy vesicles on the sides of fingers and feet as a reaction to fungal infection on the feet, athlete's foot. Stasis dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, acute irritant contact eczema and infective dermatitis have been documented as possible triggers, but the exact cause and mechanism is not fully understood. Several other types of id reactions exist including erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, Sweet's syndrome and urticaria. Presentation Complications = Id reactions left untreated may become infected with bacteria. Causes Causes include infection with dermatophytosis, Mycobacterium, viruses, bacteria and parasites. Eczematous conditions including contact allergic dermatitis and stasis dermatitis as well as stitches and trauma have also been associated with id reactions. Radiation treatment of tinea capitis has been reported as triggering an id reaction.  Pathogenesis  Potential explanations include 1\\\\. Atypical immune recognition of autologous skin antigens 2\\\\. Stimulation of normal T cells by changing skin constituents 3\\\\. Lower threshold for skin irritation 4\\\\. Spreading of infectious antigens causing a secondary response 5\\\\. Hematogenous dissemination of cytokines from the primary site of inflammation Diagnosis Although there are a multitude of varying appearances, the id reaction often presents with symmetrical red patches of eczema with papules and vesicles, particularly on the outer sides of the arms, face and trunk which occur suddenly and are intensely itchy occur a few days to a week after the initial allergic or irritant dermatitis. Most commonly, athlete's foot can lead to localised vesicles on hands, bacterial infections to erythema nodosum and herpes simplex virus to erythema multiforme. The diagnosis is frequently made by treating the initial triggering skin problem and observing the improvement in the eczematous rash. Both the initial skin problem and the id reaction must be observed to make the diagnosis. Not all dyshidrotic rashes are id reactions, but id reactions are often dyshidrotic-like. Initial tests may include isolating a fungus by taking a swab and sending it for culture. Patch testing may be considered if there is suspicion of allergic contact dermatitis. A skin biopsy is rarely necessary, but if done mostly shows an interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, some lesions being spongiotic. Id reactions cannot be distinguished from other skin diseases by histopathology. However, they can be distinguished from other id reactions by histopathology. = Differential diagnosis = Other rashes that occur in a widespread distribution can look like an id reaction. These include atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrosis, photodermatitis, scabies and drug eruptions. Treatment Id reactions are frequently unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy, but clear when the focus of infection or infestation is treated.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . Therefore, the best treatment is to treat the provoking trigger. Sometimes medications are used to relieve symptoms.These include topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines. If opportunistic bacterial infection occurs, antibiotics may be required.  Prognosis  A full recovery is expected with treatment. Recurrent id reactions are frequently due to inadequate treatment of the primary infection or dermatitis and often the cause of recurrence is unknown.  Epidemiology  With no particular affinity to any particular ethnic group, seen in all age groups and equally amongst males and females, the precise prevalence is not known.  History  The suffix -id has its origins in Greek, referring to a father-son relationship. Josef Jadassohn (1863‚Äì1936), the German dermatologist that coined the term id, had observed a dermatophytosis causing a secondary allergic skin dermatitis. In 1928, Bloch recorded that the peak of the dermatophyte infection corresponded with the id reaction.

Harry Wiere (23 June 1906 in Berlin, German Empire - 15 January 1992), Herbert Wiere (27 February 1908 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary - 5 August 1999) and Sylvester Wiere (17 September 1909 in Prague, Austria-Hungary - 7 July 1970), known collectively as the Wiere Brothers or the Three Wiere Brothers, were a comedy team who appeared in 1930s and 1940s films, and as live performers from the 1920s to the late 1960s. History From left: Sylvester, Herbert, and Harry from their 1962 television show, Oh, Those Bells!. The Wiere Brothers were vaudeville performers who occasionally appeared in films and television. Their films include Hands Across the Border in 1944 with Roy Rogers, Road to Rio in 1947 with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and Double Trouble in 1967 as three detectives on the hunt for Elvis Presley. In 1962, the Wiere Brothers had their own television series called, Oh! Those Bells, that aired on CBS. The show was created by Jules White who had previously directed the Three Stooges, Buster Keaton and Andy Clyde in short-subject films for Columbia Pictures. Oh! Those Bells included a lot of slapstick comedy but only 13 episodes were aired. The team was still appearing on television in 1970 on shows such as The Merv Griffin Show and Laugh-In and were still touring the same year. But after Sylvester's death in July 1970, Harry and Herbert Wiere discontinued their act. Harry Wiere did make one appearance on the TV series Bionic Woman in 1976 as the Tipsy Man. One of their popular acts of the 1960s involved the three brothers playing the violin, guitar and bass fiddle, and Mildred Seymour, their accompanist, performing a classical piece on the grand piano. Herbert would try to do a serious number on the violin but would get frustrated with his brothers' hillbilly antics. With a shrug, Herbert would stop playing and decide to balance the violin on his chin. Harry would then notice Herbert's accomplishment and would take the guitar and balance it on his chin. This left Sylvester smiling blandly at the audience, still plucking his bass fiddle. When Sylvester sees Herbert and Harry balancing their instruments on their chins, he would do a long take, turning from his brothers to his huge bass fiddle and then back at them. Then, finally Sylvester would lift the bass fiddle in the air and balance it on his chin for the finale. The Wiere Brothers stage performances offered a blend of classical European musical tradition and the lively, often comic spirit of the American west. They appeared in four royal variety performances for the queen of England. Inga Wiere, a sister of Herbert, Harry and Sylvester Wiere, was married to dancer Jon Zerby. Together they were known as The Dancing Zerbys, a successful nightclub act in the 1940s and 1950s. Actress and dancer Kim Darby is their daughter.

Formed in early 1940 in Port Moresby to help defend the territory in the event of a Japanese invasion, its soldiers were primarily Papuan natives led by Australian officers and non-commissioned officers. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, the PIB served in many of the Allied campaigns in New Guinea; however, due to the nature of its role its sub-units mainly operated separately, attached to larger Australian and US Army units and formations. Slow in forming, the first members of the PIB were not officially posted in until March 1941. By 1942 it consisted of only three companies, all of which were under-strength and poorly equipped. It was subsequently employed on scouting, reconnaissance and surveillance patrols against the Japanese, where the natural bushcraft of its native soldiers could be used to their advantage. The PIB was sent forward in June 1942 to patrol the northern coast of Papua and was dispersed over a wide area. These small parties were the first to make contact with the Imperial Japanese forces upon their landing in Papua, before participating in the Kokoda Track campaign. As part of Maroubra Force, the PIB fought alongside the Australian 39th Battalion at Kokoda, Deniki, and Isurava as the Japanese forced them back along the Kokoda track, but was withdrawn before the campaign finally turned in favour of the Australians. Following the recapture of the northern beachheads of Buna, Gona and Sanananda, the Allies moved onto the offensive in New Guinea. The PIB took part in the advance to Salamaua in 1943, before fighting along the Markham, Ramu, and Sepik rivers during the Ramu Valley ‚Äì Finisterre Range campaign, and on the Huon peninsula, assisting in the capture of Finschhafen and Sattelberg, and pursuing the Japanese as they retreated along the northern coastline towards Saidor in 1943‚Äì1944. The battalion was temporarily withdrawn from operations to reorganise in 1944, and together with several New Guinea Infantry Battalions (NGIBs) that were subsequently raised by the Australian Army, the PIB was formed into the Pacific Islands Regiment (PIR) in November 1944. In 1945, it was deployed to Bougainville where the battalion's companies were spread across the fronts from Bonis to Buin during the final months of the war. Such was their effectiveness that the Japanese referred to the PIB as \\"Green Shadows\\" due to their ability to fade into and appear from the jungle unexpectedly, with its soldiers becoming noted for their ferocity and tenacity. After the end of the war the battalion was used to guard Japanese prisoners of war, before being disbanded in August 1946. In 1951, the PIR was reformed, drawing its lineage from the PIB and NGIBs. HistoryFormation= Following the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe on 3 September 1939, limited defensive preparations began in the Australian administered territories of Papua and New Guinea. In Papua, the raising of an all-volunteer unit of native soldiers led by Australian officers and non- commissioned officers (NCOs), known as the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB), was approved by the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, Sir Hubert Murray, on 19 April 1940. This was in contrast to the situation in New Guinea where the provisions of the League of Nations mandate under which German New Guinea had been entrusted to Australia in 1920 following its capture during the First World War had prevented the raising of armed forces there prior to hostilities. Meanwhile, the paternalistic concerns of the civilian administration regarding native welfare and unease about providing the indigenous population with arms and military training meant they were not enlisted into the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles (NGVR) which was also forming at that time, with recruiting for the NGVR limited to Europeans only. The territories of Papua and New Guinea Major Leonard Logan was appointed as commanding officer of the PIB on 27 May 1940 and it began forming at Port Moresby on 1 June. The unit's establishment was initially limited to one company of six officers and 137 men, although it was planned to increase to 252 men in 1941, and 294 in 1942. Logan had previously been the Headquarters Officer of the Royal Papuan Constabulary (RPC), while the battalion second-in- command and officer commanding A Company was Major William Watson, a miner and former artillery officer in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) who had lived in New Guinea for many years. Enlistments in the PIB began in June 1940, with the first 63 recruits being current or former members of the RPC, a connection which allowed the unit to claim a lineage to the Armed Native Constabulary, which had been formed in the late 19th-century to police the Protectorate of British New Guinea. Police Motu was adopted as the common language of the battalion. Rates of pay were equivalent to those of the constabulary, while service was for two years. Logan flew to Kokoda on 6 June to collect the first enlistments, and walked back to Port Moresby, arriving on 1 July. Three warrant officers from the Australian Instructional Corps (AIC) were temporarily posted to the battalion to fill the vacant company sergeant major and platoon commander positions. Meanwhile, after finalising the initial recruitment process and the issue of equipment at Konedobu, near Hanuabada village, from Port Moresby, the battalion was allocated a camp at the future site of Murray Barracks in Port Moresby, and began weapons training in late August 1940. Following three months of basic training the PIB took over responsibility for guarding key points around Port Moresby from the RPC, including the oil storage facilities, wireless station, military headquarters, power station and the telephone exchange, while also assisting in road construction and undertaking further training. Despite the worsening strategic situation as the war continued overseas, the pattern of life in Papua continued relatively unchanged from that of the pre-war years. Slow in forming, the first members of the PIB were not officially posted in until March 1941. At this time contingency plans for the defence of Papua and New Guinea envisioned the deployment of Australian forces to Rabaul and Port Moresby, while the defence of Lae and Salamaua would be left to the NGVR. =Initial preparations= As the war with Germany and Italy continued in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, Australian fears of Japanese intentions in the Pacific grew. However, with the bulk of Australian military and naval forces in the Middle East, defensive preparations remained limited. Two brigades from the 8th Division were dispatched to Singapore and then Malaya in February 1941, while a Militia battalion would be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island. Additionally, plans were made for an AIF battalion to garrison Rabaul on New Britain, and the 8th Division's third brigade‚Äîless the battalion at Rabaul‚Äîwas to be dispersed piecemeal in Timor and Ambon. In July 1941, the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Ireland to protect the airfield, while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers. The 2/22nd Battalion began arriving in Rabaul in March and April 1941, while additional units were added to the force. Designated Lark Force, it tasks included protecting the airfields at Lakunai and Vunakanau and the seaplane base in Simpson Harbour, as well as forming an \\"advanced observation line\\" to provide early warning of Japanese movements. The position was increasingly viewed as untenable, but the garrison was reinforced with four Lockheed Hudson bombers and ten obsolete CAC Wirraway reconnaissance aircraft from No. 24 Squadron RAAF, and by December it had grown to 1,400 men. The planned expansion of the PIB proceeded as scheduled, with the second and third companies forming in 1941. In May, the establishment of the battalion had been increased, and in April Logan requested another 100 men from the government. B Company was formed from a nucleus of 62 recruits which arrived from Buna on 12 May under the command of Captain Ernest Standfield, a former planter. While the chief argument for the formation of the battalion had been the value of the knowledge native soldiers would provide of local conditions, with the expansion of the unit many of the officers and NCOs posted into it were from Australian infantry, engineer and artillery units based in Port Moresby, rather than local expatriates. Indeed, with the main role of the unit envisioned to be scouting and reconnaissance‚Äîtasks in which it was felt the natural bushcraft of the natives could be utilised to their greatest potential‚Äîthe drawbacks of junior leaders without local experience was apparent. The terms of service of the new recruits included enlistment for three years, with pay at a rate of 10 shillings per month for the first year, 15 in the second, and one pound in the third, with lance corporals paid 25 shillings, corporals 30 shillings, and sergeants 40 shillings. Equipment provided included a waterproof cape, clasp knife and lanyard, two pairs of khaki shorts and shirts per year, two green sashes, sulus for working and sleeping, in addition to a mosquito net, blankets, plates and eating utensils, webbing, rifle, bayonet, and helmet. Rations were more generous than those given to the police, and included butter and jam. Members of the Papuan Infantry Battalion at Port Moresby, January 1941 The battalion would ultimately serve in many of the Allied campaigns in New Guinea; however, due to the nature of its role its sub-units would mainly operate separately, attached to larger Australian and US units and formations. As such, unlike the headquarters of standard Australian battalions, the PIB's headquarters was primarily employed as an administration and training company, and saw little action. One of the commanding officer's primary roles was to ensure members of the battalion were appropriately utilised and recognised for their service, and in this role regularly liaised with the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) and New Guinea Force. Headquarters Company also included the battalion Q Store. In addition to holding the usual equipment required of any Australian unit, due to the unique makeup of the PIB it had the added challenge of obtaining specific food and clothing required by native soldiers. The Signals Section was responsible for maintaining communications within the battalion and with other units in the Port Moresby area by field telephone, with Papuans and New Guineans attached to the section being taught all aspects of the maintenance and operation of the switchboard and line equipment. Although the War Establishment provided for a Regimental Medical Officer and medical orderlies (all Europeans), no permanent medical staff were posted to the unit until June 1943. Prior to this, orderlies were supplied by ANGAU on attachment, although there were occasions during subsequent operations when the men were without medical support, or were supported by medics from the US Army. Until August 1941 the PIB continued to be used guarding vulnerable points, constructing roads and working on the wharves, while further training also occurred during this time. However, in September the unit was allocated the task of defending the area from Napa Napa to Jolers Bay. Following a reconnaissance, A and B Companies moved into their allocated areas and began constructing roads for tactical movement and defensive positions. Although required to continue to provide guards at key installations, a period of intensive training followed. In August Logan sought an additional 107 recruits to continue the expansion of the battalion, with C Company being formed in November 1941. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Alan Hooper took over as officer commanding B Company, after Standfield and a number of other officers from the battalion, including Watson, were detached to various headquarters and units based in New Guinea. Watson was seconded to Base Headquarters as civilian recruiting officer, while Standfield was detailed to work on the supply line road from Bulldog to Wau, as defensive preparations continued. On 1 December, A Company was withdrawn from defence work and tasked with unloading cargo from shipping at the wharf in Port Moresby. =Outbreak of war in the Pacific= The Japanese began aerial reconnaissance over Rabaul soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and the compulsory evacuation of all remaining European women and children to Australia was ordered on 12 December. Following the surprise attack on the US fleet A Company, PIB was relieved of its duties unloading ships at the wharf to man defensive positions and mount a 24-hour watch. Meanwhile, scattered across the islands to the north, the 270 men of the 1st Independent Company were all that lay between Rabaul and the large Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands. Australian defences in Papua remained limited and were centred on Port Moresby, consisting of approximately 1,000 only partially trained Militia from the 49th Battalion, two six-inch coastal guns, a 3.7-inch anti-aircraft battery and a few Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, in addition to the locally recruited PIB which was still forming, and the part-time volunteer NGVR. These forces came under the operational command of the 8th Military District commanded by Major General Basil Morris. However, with the Japanese soon expected to attempt to seize Rabaul and Port Moresby the remainder of the 30th Brigade was brought forward, with the 39th and 53rd Battalions arriving in Port Moresby on 3 January. These units gradually took over the PIB's defensive duties, with the battalion being used in a pioneer role. Morris subsequently planned to spread the NGVR and PIB widely as part of a reconnaissance screen. The first air attacks on Rabaul began on 4 January 1942. Within days the Japanese had succeeded in destroying the bulk of the defending aircraft, while further attacks targeted shipping in the harbour and shore installations. Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan considered he would need an entire brigade to defend Rabaul, yet with an invasion imminent all he could do was redeploy some of his limited force, while the remaining aircraft were withdrawn and the airfields cratered. The Japanese South Seas Force of approximately 5,300 men under the command of Major General Tomitar≈ç Horii landed at Rabaul in the early hours of 23 January 1942. Outnumbered, Lark Force was quickly overrun in the ensuing fighting, with the Japanese completing the capture of the town within 24 hours. Australian losses were heavy, with 28 men killed and most of the defenders captured. The survivors withdrew into the interior, moving south across New Britain to the Open Bay and Wide Bay areas, and west, for eventual evacuation. In total more than 400 servicemen and civilians escaped. Many were less fortunate. A total of 160 wounded and sick Australian soldiers were captured and subsequently murdered by the Japanese at Tol Plantation. Later, the Japanese naval prison ship Montevideo Maru was sunk off the west coast of Luzon in the South China Sea on 1 July 1942 after she was torpedoed by the submarine USS Sturgeon, resulting in the loss of 1,035 lives, most of them Australian civilians and prisoners of war from Rabaul. =Japanese landings, March 1942= By 1942, the PIB consisted of only three understrength and poorly equipped companies. Total manning included approximately 300 indigenous Papuans. In late January, the PIB had moved from Hanuabada to the 9-Mile area, and were tasked with supplying rock from the quarry for airfield development and the construction of dispersal bays at 7-Mile Airstrip. The PIB subsequently conducted a number of small patrols from Redscar Bay to Rigo, and inland to the foot of the Owen Stanley Range, which served as an occasional relief from heavy labouring. These patrols consisted of a number of small reconnaissance parties which had been dispatched to Obu near Yule Island in the Gulf of Papua, as well as to Hisiu on the west coast, Rigo, and the Owen Stanley Range. These parties were detailed to be alert for possible infiltration by Japanese paratroops as well as to rescue downed Allied aircrew. Port Moresby was bombed by Japanese aircraft at 03:00 on the morning of 3 February, the first of many heavy air raids. Allied air defences were almost non-existent, and the raids significantly reduced civilian morale, while several PIB recruits deserted. Following the bombing of Port Moresby, in early February the civil administration in Papua was replaced by military control. ANGAU was formed to administer both Papua and New Guinea in a unified military government, following their hurried amalgamation. Watson was recalled soon after hostilities commenced, succeeding Logan as commanding officer of the PIB on 16 February after the later was evacuated from Papua due to illness and was forced to retire. The PIB was subsequently employed in scouting, reconnaissance and surveillance patrols against the Japanese. On 19 February, a platoon from A Company under the command of Lieutenant Harold Jesser was ordered by Morris to patrol the north coast of Papua between Buna and the Waria River, while other platoons would screen possible avenues of approach to Port Moresby, with a second patrol from A Company departing for Rigo on 20 February, and a third a week later. On 8 March 1942, approximately 3,000 Japanese naval troops landed unopposed at Lae forcing the NGVR detachment there to withdraw west towards Nadzab, while another battalion from the Japanese South Sea's Force landed further south at Salamaua the same day. After observing the landings another NGVR detachment skirmished with the Japanese and attempted to demolish the airfield before withdrawing across the Francisco River, destroying the bridge across the river mouth as they went. The Japanese then occupied Salamaua and, after leaving a section at the river, the men of the NGVR moved south to Mubo. The Japanese were now within of Port Moresby but were required to pause to consolidate their gains, allowing the Allies time to reinforce Australia. Being the only Allied force in the area until the arrival of Kanga Force at Wau in May, the NGVR subsequently monitored the Japanese bases which had been established in the Huon Gulf region, establishing observation posts overlooking the main approaches and reporting on Japanese movements. Meanwhile, elements of the US Fifth Air Force began arriving in Port Moresby, commencing bombing operations against Japanese positions at Lae, Salamaua and Rabaul, with the PIB tasked with search and rescue for downed airmen. On 11 March, Jesser and Corporal Kimani with a section of PIB were at Buna, having marched all night from Kokoda in response to advice that a Japanese landing was expected at Buna that day. They were in time to observe a Japanese seaplane fire on a launch belonging to the Anglican mission and a group of civilians, including the local bishop (Bishop Strong). The seaplane landed out to sea near Buna.. Jesser and Kimani engaged the aircraft with rifles, driving it off. On 21 March, the beleaguered garrison at Port Moresby was strengthened by the arrival of Kittyhawk fighters from No. 75 Squadron RAAF. Throughout March, April and May the PIB continued patrolling, while men not involved in these operations were employed at the quarry and the aerodrome in Port Moresby. No contact was made with the Japanese during this period. =Buna to Kokoda, June 1942 ‚Äì January 1943= Following their defeat during the Battle of the Coral Sea in early May the Japanese invasion fleet bound for Port Moresby had been forced to turn back, while on 4 June the Japanese were decisively beaten at Midway by the US Navy. Despite these setbacks though Japanese forces in Rabaul and Lae appeared to be preparing an attack against Port Moresby from northern Papua, via Buna and Kokoda. During this time the only Allied unit in the South West Pacific Area still actively engaging the Japanese was Kanga Force, made up of the NGVR and the 1st and 2/5th Independent Companies, fighting a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese around Lae and Salamaua. In June 1942 Morris tasked the PIB with reconnoitring the Awala‚ÄìTufi‚ÄìIoma area. To meet the Japanese threat the Allies planned to construct airstrips in the Buna‚ÄìDobodura area to facilitate operations against Rabaul and to secure it in order to forestall any advance from that direction. As the situation worsened, the PIB‚Äîwith a strength of just 30 officers and 280 men‚Äîwas sent forward to patrol the northern coast of Papua and was subsequently dispersed over a wide area. Along with the 39th Battalion (less one company), and supply and medical detachments, they formed part Maroubra Force. A map depicting locations along the Kokoda Track Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, the commanding officer of the 39th Battalion, Maroubra Force was tasked with delaying a Japanese advance from Awala to Kokoda, preventing movement towards Port Moresby through a gap in the Owen Stanley Range near Kokoda, and resisting any airborne landings in the area. A platoon from B Company, PIB under Lieutenant Arthur Smith departed Port Moresby on 7 June to patrol the Barena‚ÄìBuna area, with the remainder of the company following on 14 June under the command of Hooper, tasked with patrolling the Ioma, Mambare, Morobe, Waria River, and Garaina areas. A platoon from A Company under Lieutenant John Izatt was already in position at Waria River and was attached to B Company. On 24 June the battalion headquarters under Watson and C Company moved forward from Port Moresby to the Kokoda‚ÄìAwala area. Meanwhile, B Company, 39th Battalion was sent overland via the Kokoda Track to secure the Buna area and prepare to oppose any Japanese advance, while the PIB was already north of the Owen Stanley Range at the entrance of the Kokoda Track. Maroubra Force arrived at Kokoda on 15 July. Yet despite initial Allied patrols and engineer reconnaissance into the area, the Japanese had ultimately been able to move faster, seizing the initiative. As a result, these small parties would ultimately be the first to make contact with the Imperial Japanese forces upon their landing in Papua. Having already captured much of the northern part of New Guinea in early 1942, the Japanese landed on the north-east coast of Papua, establishing beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda. On the night of 21/22 July, 3,000 Japanese landed near Gona in an attempt to advance south overland through the mountains of the Owen Stanley Range to seize Port Moresby as part of a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States. Initially only limited Australian forces were available to oppose them, and after making rapid progress, the Japanese South Seas Force under Horii clashed with understrength Australian forces at Awala on 23 July, before forcing them back to Kokoda. During the PIB's first engagement Lieutenant John Chalk's platoon had participated in an ambush of the Japanese troops advancing towards Kokoda. Chalk and a scout party had moved to Sangara on the night of 22 July where they observed a Japanese force camped. The next morning he reported their arrival by runner and was ordered by Watson to engage them. That night, Chalk and his 40-man platoon ambushed Japanese forces from a hill overlooking the Gona‚ÄìSangara road, killing several before withdrawing into the jungle as they quickly responded with small arms and mortar fire. Meanwhile, elements of B Company, 39th Battalion under Captain Sam Templeton had begun arriving and they moved to cover the Papuan withdrawal. In the confusion some PIB soldiers at Awala deserted, although a few withdrew with the Australians. Watson then withdrew with his headquarters from Awala to Ongahambo, but was soon forced to fall back to Wairope. Meanwhile, Jesser's party on the northern flank was in danger of being cut- off. Slashing their way through the bush to Wairope, the following morning they found that Watson had ordered the wire footbridge destroyed and were forced to swim across the Kumusi River to escape. Watson then retired to Gorari, nearer to Kokoda while the bulk of the PIB and B Company, 39th Battalion remained on the west bank. The PIB was then joined by a platoon under Templeton, ambushing the Japanese the following day as they crossed the Kumusi in rubber boats. Forced to withdraw, the Japanese moved further along the river before crossing in an attempt to encircle them. Attacking the Australians and Papuans with mortars and heavy machine-guns, many PIB soldiers again withdrew into the bush. Some eventually met up with the main party and others moved back to Kokoda, yet many deserted. Elements of the PIB and B Company, 39th Battalion again clashed with the Japanese at Gorari on 25 July, killing or wounding 15. Yet reduced to only a few Australian officers and NCOs and a handful of Papuans, the force withdrew to Oivi with the 39th Battalion after losing six men missing. Concerned by the state of his men and with no Australian troops between Kokoda and C Company, 39th Battalion (which departed Illolo on the 23rd and was still moving up the track), Owen requested reinforcements be flown in. Hoping to halt the advance, the Australians and Papuans dug in at Oivi on the night of 26/27 July, yet the Japanese proved too strong and once again the defenders were driven back. Templeton was killed and Watson took command, withdrawing through Deniki on 27 July. At Deniki they joined up with the remainder of B Company, 39th Battalion now personally commanded by Owen who had come forward to take over. Moving back to Kokoda, they were also rejoined by a number of the men that had been cut-off at Oivi. Owen decided to attempt a defence of the Kokoda airstrip in the hope reinforcements would arrive in time to support him. Leaving around 40 troops at Deniki, he took the remaining 77 men and was deployed around Kokoda by midday on 28 July. Maroubra Force engaged the Japanese in the first unsuccessful defence of the Kokoda airstrip on the night of 28/29 July 1942. At 02:00 on 29 July the Japanese commenced a mortar barrage, supported by machine-gun fire, before charging up the steep slope at the northern end of the position. Owen was killed and Watson again took temporary command, leading a fighting withdrawal towards the village of Deniki, back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava. For his bravery and leadership, Watson was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Australian losses at Kokoda had consisted of two killed and seven or eight wounded; however, many more had become cut-off during the fighting and were missing. Meanwhile, Smith reported that the Japanese had landed at the mouth of the Kumusi River, while Izatt stated on 1 August that he had been forced to withdraw from Ioma after destroying the government station there. Running low on food he attempted to contact B Company, PIB under Hooper, operating in the Waria-Opi River area. PIB patrols operating in the Iomai‚ÄìWarioa‚ÄìAmbasi area were ordered by Watson to remain in location and attempt to maintain contact with the Japanese. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda forced the Australians to send the other two companies of the 39th Battalion, and the remaining battalions of the 30th Brigade‚Äîthe 49th and 53rd Battalions‚Äîoverland, rather than reinforcing by air. Meanwhile, the wounded would now have to be carried out by native porters and supplies air dropped. Major Allan Cameron‚Äîbrigade major of the 30th Brigade‚Äîtemporarily took command of Maroubra Force on 4 August and was ordered to recapture Kokoda. By the first week in August reinforcements had arrived in Deniki, including both A and C Company, 39th Battalion, while further forces were moving up the Kokoda Track. The Australian force now consisted of 31 officers and 443 other ranks of the 39th Battalion; eight Australians and 35 native troops of the PIB; and two officers and 12 native members of ANGAU; a total of 533 men. Although poorly equipped and short on supplies, Cameron planned to attack an estimated Japanese force of 300 to 400 men at Kokoda. The Australians attempted to retake Kokoda on 8 August, but with both sides suffering heavy casualties, the 39th Battalion and PIB fell back to Deniki. Although they beat off a number of Japanese attacks over the following week, on 14 August they were forced to commence withdrawing over the Owen Stanley Range to Isurava. Members of the PIB and Royal Papuan Constabulary being briefed before a patrol around Waiwai, south of Buna, in October 1942 At the height of the fighting Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell's I Corps headquarters arrived at Port Moresby, and he assumed command of New Guinea Force from Morris on 12 August 1942. Blamey subsequently ordered Major General Arthur Allen's veteran Australian 7th Division‚Äîrecently returned from fighting in the Middle East‚Äîto embark for New Guinea. The 18th Brigade was ordered to Milne Bay while the 21st and 25th Brigades would go to Port Moresby. The Japanese continued to commit men and supplies to the fighting along the Kokoda Track, with 13,500 men landed at Gona and Buna by August. Yet the Japanese did not press the Australians following their withdrawal from Deniki, and during the next 10 days the 39th Battalion and PIB were reinforced by the 53rd Battalion and the headquarters of the 30th Brigade under the command of Brigadier Selwyn Porter. By the 23 August the 21st Brigade had also arrived at Isurava, under the command of Brigadier Arnold Potts. These reinforcements proved pivotal in temporarily halting Japanese progress, but the Australians increasingly faced a major supply problem and the 39th Battalion was withdrawn to reduce the logistic burden. On the evening of 25 August 1942, the Japanese staged a landing at Milne Bay, on the eastern tip of New Guinea, to reduce the Allied airfields that had been established there. Despite initial success, the force was subsequently destroyed by the Australians with the survivors forced to evacuate by sea on 4‚Äì5 September. Meanwhile, during this time Horii's South Seas Detachment had continued to make strong progress along the Kokoda Track. After the Japanese resumed their advance on 26 August the Australians mounted a series of delaying actions before falling back to Eora Creek on 30 August, Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, and Efogi three days later. Although the outnumbered Australian opposition was becoming increasingly effective and the Japanese were beginning to experience the strain of an over extended supply line, the defenders were increasingly exhausted and reduced by disease and sickness as a result of their exertions and the harsh terrain. Potts handed over command to Porter on 10 September, who subsequently withdrew to Ioribaiwa, checking a Japanese attack there the following day. With the brigades of Allen's 7th Division now reinforcing Maroubra Force, the PIB was organised into teams of stretcher bearers and was assigned the task of evacuating sick and wounded Australian soldiers back along the Kokoda Track. On 14 September command of the forward areas was taken over by Brigadier Kenneth Eather. Heavy fighting continued around Ioribaiwa for the following week, before the Australians were again forced back, this time to Imita Ridge. By 17 September the Japanese were almost in sight of Port Moresby itself. However, following a heavy defeat at Guadalcanal, Horii was ordered onto the defensive and this proved to be the limit of the Japanese advance. By mid- September the PIB was withdrawn from the front, and moved back to Sogeri near Port Moresby for respite and to re-equip. A small detachment of two Australian sergeants and six Papuans remained at Uberi Village at the southern end of the Kokoda Track, from where they carried out patrols under the command of the 25th Brigade. The Japanese began to withdraw from Kokoda on 24 September to establish a defensive position on the north coast, but were closely followed by the Australians who recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. Further fighting continued into November and December as Australian and US forces assaulted the Japanese beachheads, in what later became known as the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona. After some of the costliest fighting of the war for the Australians, Gona was recaptured on 9 December 1942, and Buna on 3 January 1943. The Japanese began to abandon Sanananda on 13 January following an unsuccessful Australian assault the day before, while mopping up operations were completed on 22 January. =Northern Papua, July 1942 ‚Äì April 1943= At the same time elements of the PIB and 39th Battalion had been withdrawing along the Kokoda track, other members of the PIB had been cut-off in the Ambasi‚ÄìIoma area. One platoon attempted to escape south to Port Moresby but was dispersed or killed, including Smith who was executed by the Japanese after being captured. B Company, PIB had also been isolated when the Japanese landed in the Buna‚ÄìGona area in July, and had been ordered to maintain contact with the Japanese and send reports of their activities as they continued to patrol the Waria‚ÄìKumusi River region. In September Watson ordered the detachment in the Kumusi area to concentrate around Garaina‚ÄìMorobe‚ÄìMambare from where they would be reinforced. Moving via a route which avoided the Japanese, C Company and Battalion Headquarters transited Yule Island on 23 September, and after departing Kairuku, crossed the Owen Stanley Range to Garaina, moving then to Popoi on the Waria River, with some men continuing to Ioma. They joined B Company in October and were tasked with contacting the local people to maintain order following the departure of the civil administration, and with rescuing downed Allied airmen. Numbering just 150 men, the PIB attacked Japanese parties retreating to the north coast in November after their defeat at Oivi‚ÄìGorari. In January 1943, they intercepted Japanese forces north of Buna and, the following month, assisted in the destruction of Japanese remnants in Papua‚Äîkilling 200 and capturing three prisoners. By March 1943 the area between the Kumusi and Waria Rivers had largely been cleared of Japanese forces, with the only significant fighting being an ambush of 14 Japanese at Mogado near the mouth of the Kumusi. Coming under the command of the US 41st Division that month, the PIB advanced with the Americans. After reaching Morobe, they were ordered to return to Bisiatabu, near Port Moresby, for rest, reorganisation and further training, arriving there on 24 April. At this time elements of the battalion had been in action since July 1942; many had been among the first parties over the Owen Stanley Range in June, while the remainder had been in the group that had come forward in September. Due to the harsh conditions prevailing in wartime New Guinea this was a long time to be in action and the battalion was considered to be in need of a break. Although never numbering more than 300 men, the PIB was believed to have killed at least as many Japanese, losing 15 men killed and 35 wounded during the seven months of the Papuan campaign. After the battalion returned to Port Moresby in early 1943 the administrative requirements of the unit changed, and the headquarters was subsequently stationed at Bisiatabu, with the rifle companies in the future operating independently under different Australian or US divisions. The respite was short, as following the recapture of Buna and Sanananda, the Allies planned to move on Lae as part of a series of counter- offensive actions. The PIB was tasked to assist and was reinforced in preparation for these operations, with its strength increased to include a battalion headquarters, headquarter company‚Äîincluding a signals and a pioneer platoon‚Äîand three rifle companies. As a result, additional Australian and native personnel were required, and a depot company was added to the establishment to supply trained replacements. Depot Company included native recruits in training, recovering wounded native soldiers awaiting re-posting as reinforcements, and native soldiers employed on guard duties and camp construction. A period of training followed as the new native recruits were taught weapons handling, while the Australians learnt the language of the Papuans and New Guineans under their command, as well as native bush craft. On 1 May 1943, Battalion Headquarters and the Training Depot occupied a camp at Bisiatabu. A Company, PIB under the command of Captain Ernest Hitchcock was the first company to return to action. Departing on 30 May 1943, it came under the command of the US 41st Division for operations at Nassau Bay. B Company, PIB under Captain John Chalk left Bisiatabu on 18 June 1943, moving to Wau to be attached to the Australian 7th Division for operations in the Markham and Ramu Valleys. C Company, PIB under Captain Anthony Leutchford departed on 27 August, moving to Dobuduru to be attached to the Australian 9th Division for the landing at Lae. =Salamaua, June ‚Äì September 1943= Over the period 30 June to 4 July 1943, the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team made an unopposed landing at Nassau Bay and established a beachhead there as part of Operation Cartwheel. Australian support included a platoon from D Company, 2/6th Battalion to act as beach party to deploy lights at the landing zone, and a PIB company to hold the Japanese garrison in place at Cape Dinga on the southern flank. Prior to the landing, on the evening of 28 June A Company, PIB under the command of Hitchcock had moved from Buso to Cape Roon by canoe, from where the Japanese positions at Cape Dinga could be observed. Numbering five Australian officers, 18 Papuan and Australian NCOs, and 119 Papuan soldiers in three platoons, the company prepared to attack the Japanese garrison which was estimated at 300 men from III/102nd Battalion. Following several reconnaissance patrols, Hitchcock finalised plans for the assault. On the evening of 30 June they formed up in a creek just south of Cape Dinga. 5 Platoon under Lieutenant Charles Bishop was tasked with securing the heights, while 4 Platoon under Sergeant Bob MacIlwain would attack the two Bassis villages and capture the Japanese telescope located there. On 1 July a patrol moving along the beach to Nassau Bay killed three Japanese in foxholes. Bishop moved up the ridgeline but met heavy resistance, and the platoon was eventually forced to withdraw. Meanwhile, moving along the beach MacIlwain found one of the villages deserted and the other defended by a strong bunker position, which was then set on fire. The bodies of 26 Japanese were later recovered. With the position captured, Hitchcock moved north to Tabali Creek. After making contact with American forces, the Papuans continued attacking the Japanese on the northern coast of Cape Dinga, while blocking any attempt to escape inland. The Japanese at Nassau Bay subsequently withdrew, affording the Allied forces a supply point for the subsequent attack against Salamaua, while heavy artillery landed at Nassau Bay was able to shell the area in preparation. The US 3/162nd Battalion landed at Nassau Bay on 6 July. The PIB advanced along the coast ahead of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment and reached Lake Salus on 9 July before pushing on to Tambu Bay as they followed up the withdrawing Japanese. Hitchcock's men were the first to make contact with the Japanese at Tambu Bay and by 14 July they had been able to confirm that Tambu Bay and Dot Inlet were occupied by the Japanese who had fortified the area. A two-man reconnaissance team scouted to the mouth of the lagoon, south of Tambu Bay, and located a Japanese observation post on the northern side, while approximately 200 Japanese soldiers were seen to be dug-in at Boisi in anticipation of an Allied landing. The scouting was later confirmed to be highly accurate. The American advance on Tambu Bay commenced on 18 July, with two companies from the US 3/162nd Battalion moving north along the inland track, and another company moving along the coast; each using guides from the PIB. On 20 July a PIB platoon attacked a Japanese outpost south of Boisi which was holding up the advance of K Company, killing four and allowing the Americans to continue forward. The same day A Company, PIB received reinforcements, including one officer and six NCOs, all European, who arrived from Bisiatabu. PIB soldiers around Bisiatabu, July 1943 With Tambu Bay occupied, the US 2/162nd Battalion began landing there the same evening. Yet with a key ridgeline known as Roosevelt Ridge remaining in Japanese hands the area was not secure. A PIB platoon was sent up the western side on 22 July, while two US companies unsuccessfully attacked from the east, with another attempt later in the day also failing before they were pushed off the ridge two days later. During fighting on 26 July, A Company, PIB suffered its first fatality, with the death of an Australian corporal attached to I Company on Mount Tambu. From 22 to 24 July two PIB platoons held defensive positions near Boisi, while several sections guarded the track towards Mount Tambu to cut off any Japanese trying to withdraw. Further attempts by the Americans to capture the high ground in late July and early August also failed, despite the landing of artillery. Over 1‚Äì9 August the PIB conducted patrols, both independently and attached to the Americans. During this time Hitchcock had to be evacuated to hospital following an attack on Allied artillery positions by Japanese aircraft. On 5 August, 5 Platoon was attacked by Japanese on the ridge above Boisi, losing one killed. Later that night a further two men were wounded on Mount Tambu while attached to K Company. On 9 August a patrol from 4 Platoon clashed with a Japanese pillbox which they assaulted with grenades, losing one Papuan wounded. The Australian 15th and 42nd Battalions were then committed to the fighting, and the PIB provided guides as they moved into position. Further attempts by the Americans finally succeeded in capturing Roosevelt Ridge, after establishing a lodgement at the western end and reducing the remaining defences with artillery between 12‚Äì14 August. On 12 August a company-sized Japanese force from I/162nd Battalion was detected after leaving Salamaua and was believed to be moving against the Allied rear positions and artillery located around Tambu Bay. The raiding party were followed by an American force which succeeded in dispersing a small group south-east of Mount Tambu on the 13th. With the pursuit continuing, a PIB platoon was tasked with guarding a US artillery battery on the southern side of Tambu Bay on 12 August, and was reinforced by another platoon two days later. Clashes between patrolling Australian and US infantry and the Japanese continued over the following days and by 16 August the raiders had split into three groups. Attacking the Australian and US gunlines that morning the Japanese were repulsed, while the guns remained intact. That morning a Papuan platoon also clashed with the Japanese, killing three and a native guide just after midday, before establishing an ambush above the 1700 feature during the afternoon. A patrol encountered a large Japanese force on a narrow spur and the platoon was forced to withdraw before being surrounded, moving down the track towards Cochrane Beach where they were resupplied. They reoccupied the feature that night and dug-in. The following day they clashed with more Japanese patrols, ambushing them and forcing their withdrawal under the cover of artillery, which then compelled the Papuans to retire again. Hitchcock ordered the patrols continue, and the Papuans were sent back up the ridgeline, patrolling until relieved by US forces. With the raid having failed, the surviving Japanese attempted to withdraw to Mount Tambu but were pursued by Australian and US patrols, with the majority of the force being destroyed. Skirmishes occurred west of the 1700 feature, with the Papuans dispersing a force of approximately 20 Japanese on 18 August. By 20 August A Company, PIB occupied a line from Scout Ridge north of Boisi to the 1700 feature behind Salus, and the ridgeline just north of Salus Lakes, in an area which had been mostly cleared of the Japanese. They then began to move towards Boisi. During this time other members of the company were detached as scouts working with the Americans. After concentrating at Boisi, they rested for several days. Now under divisional control, the Papuans prepared to move towards Salamaua with orders to conduct reconnaissance and to cut off any Japanese withdrawing through the area. Setting out on 28 August a Papuan patrol under Lieutenant Dick Gore observed a Japanese force in Lokanu before moving inland to bypass them. Leaving some men at Charlie Hill, the remainder of the company continued south the next day before taking up positions along a creek east of Mount Tambu. The Papuans were then tasked with finding a Japanese artillery piece located on the ridgeline below Nuknuk which controlled the approaches from Komiatum towards Salamaua. The gun had been mounted on a section of railway track and was being concealed in a tunnel cut into the side of the ridge, preventing it from being targeted by Allied aircraft and counter-battery fire. A patrol from 4 Platoon was able to determine its approximate position after questioning the local people, and a small group of three Papuans under Lance Corporal Bengari then infiltrated Japanese lines to confirm its location. After pin-pointing the gun they returned to Komiatum. Bengari then guided an Australian company-sized patrol to the position and destroyed the gun and killed its crew using grenades, while the Australians fought the Japanese inside the tunnel. A heavy engagement developed as the Japanese attempted to reinforce the position, with the fighting continuing until dusk before they were forced to retreat. The Australians also withdrew, moving back to Bobdubi. A number of Papuan sections were still detached, operating with the Australian and US battalions in the area. Meanwhile, the remainder of the Company continued to patrol over 6‚Äì7 September without contact. Finally, by 8 September the Japanese began to withdraw from Salamaua. On 11 September the elements from A Company, PIB which had remained on Charlie Hill, cautiously moved into Salamaua which they found largely destroyed, with decaying food, rubbish and Japanese corpses strewn among the ruins. They subsequently withdrew. The Papuans were then tasked with clearing the beach from Kela Point, Malolo Mission, Buakap and Busama. Patrolling to the ridge overlooking the mission no Japanese were observed. However, on 13 September when the Papuans entered Malolo they were engaged by a Japanese machine-gun from long range, which was then destroyed by 1 Platoon. Company Headquarters was then set up in the village, and from there they patrolled along the beach through Busama, towards the swamps around Labu. Sweeping through the area, the main Japanese force was found to have withdrawn, while the Papuans moved as far as the mouth of the Markham River and then through the swamps to the foothills. Following the return of the Company's various detachments it concentrated at Malolo, before moving to a new camp at Boisi for a period of rest. By 27 September A Company had returned to Tambu Bay in preparation to leave for Lae. Losses during the Salamaua campaign amounted to two killed and 14 wounded. =Markham Valley‚ÄìLae, June ‚Äì October 1943= Australian units had been operating in the Markham Valley since the Japanese landing at Lae in March 1942. Initially these forces had been limited to the NGVR; however, they were later replaced by AIF units. The 57th/60th Battalion, 15th Brigade took over responsibility for the area and the road through the Watut Valley to Bulolo and Wau in June 1943. B Company, PIB under the command of Captain John Chalk, was subsequently attached to the battalion for scouting and patrolling, leaving Port Moresby on 26 June and flying to Wau, before moving to Bulolo and then down the track to the Wampit River where they established a base on 1 July. Allocated a large area of operations, B Company was tasked with patrolling the southern bank of the Markham River, from Wanton River to New Labu Island. Standing patrols and platoon outposts were established, with 6 Platoon at Oomsis and 8 Platoon at Bob's Camp, while additional detachments operated out of Ngaragooma and Deep Creek. Meanwhile, 7 Platoon was detached to the 57th/60th Battalion at Tsili Tsili. The first contact occurred on 9 July, when a party from 6 Platoon was fired on near Deep Creek. As the patrols continued the Papuans developed a detailed map of the area and Japanese movements, while continuing to observe Japanese dispositions on the northern bank. A 50-man patrol moved through to the Buang River in mid-July. On 24 July a Papuan soldier was killed by a bomb dropped by Japanese aircraft as they flew over the New Mari villages en route to Lae. The following day B Company suffered further losses after a patrol led by Sergeant Owen Reynolds was ambushed at close range near Deep Creek. A Papuan corporal took command after Reynolds was mortally wounded, withdrawing the patrol under heavy fire. On 1 August a party of engineers was escorted by 8 Platoon to the Markham River as part of a reconnaissance to identify possible crossing points for an assault on Nadzab. On 9 August, a patrol from 8 Platoon to New Labu Island was attacked by a group of Japanese and hostile villagers, with two Papuans and a number of Japanese killed. Although costly, the patrol confirmed the Japanese were unaware of Allied preparations to attack Nadzab. B Company continued patrolling the southern bank of the Markham River, reporting on troop movements and dispositions. On 24 August they came under command of New Guinea Force and were ordered to prepare for the crossing of the Markham and assault on Nadzab. The PIB subsequently manned staging camps and guard posts along the river, which were in place by 27 August. In early September they patrolled between Mount Ngaroneno and the mouth of the Watut River to ensure it was clear of Japanese forces. Meanwhile, a small party crossed the Markham in a rubber dingy, scouting towards the proposed drop zone. On 4 September, a force, including the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, and engineers from 2/6th Field Company married up with B Company, PIB, at Kirkland's Crossing after moving overland from Tsili Tsili, and began to prepare the airfield. With the campaign reaching a crucial point, a combined landing at Nadzab by US paratroopers and Australian artillery took place on 5 September. During the landing the Papuans picqueted the south bank of the Markham, and with the pioneers successfully establishing a beachhead they then crossed with the engineers. As the airdrop proceeded, the Papuans were tasked with assisting to secure the upper Markham Valley against any possible Japanese move to reinforce Lae from Madang. With Nadzab captured preparations began to allow the Australian 7th Division to fly in so as to complete the encirclement of Lae, following landings to its east by the 9th Division which had begun the day before. C-47s drop a battalion of the US 503rd Parachute Regiment at Nadzab, 5 September 1943. Moving forward to the Erap River, B Company, PIB set up camp and began patrolling the western approaches to Nadzab. During a patrol with US infantry on 13 September, one Australian and two Americans were killed when they were ambushed. A number of patrols subsequently clashed with the Japanese, with a patrol killing two Japanese after crossing the flooded Busu River near Boana, while another on 16 September killed five Japanese. 8 Platoon was then detached to the 2/14th Battalion at Camp Diddy and moved towards Boana with the aim of cutting off any Japanese withdrawing from Lae. 6 Platoon, which had originally been left to patrol the Nadzab‚ÄìLae area, was then recalled and moved up the Markham River, occupying Sasiang. On 19 September the 2/6th Independent Company prepared to attack Kaiapit, and a section of Papuans from 7 Platoon accompanied them to contact the local people and start to repair the airstrip once it had been secured for use in an emergency. The commandos assaulted Kaiapit late that afternoon, seizing an outpost following a number of bayonet charges, before digging-in that evening. The rest of B Company, PIB had remained at Sangan but was later ordered forward to a point from Kaipit with the reserve ammunition and to cover the wounded. In position just after dawn the next morning they clashed with a group of Japanese, killing five of them. During the day the Japanese counter-attacked the Australians but were driven out of Kaiapit with very heavy losses. Japanese casualties included 214 killed and a further 50 probably killed, while the Australians lost 14 killed and 23 wounded. B Company, PIB moved forward to Kaiapit on 21 September to join the commandos. With the Japanese remaining in the area its two platoons occupied a number of positions astride the track from Kaiapit to the Mission and on Mission Hill, while transport aircraft began to land on the hastily cleared airstrip with reinforcements. In the late afternoon a Papuan platoon attacked a Japanese squad. The survivors then attempted to withdraw, only to clash with another PIB platoon and were killed, with one Papuan wounded. That evening the Japanese counter-attacked the Papuan positions around the Mission, only to be driven back after heavy fighting which resulted in a number of civilian casualties after the village had been accidentally hit by stray small-arms fire. By first light on 22 September the Japanese had withdrawn from Kaiapit. Elsewhere, 8 Platoon‚Äîwhich was still detached‚Äîhad been involved with a number of other units in the pursuit of a large Japanese force of approximately 300 retreating from Lae, but had been unable to make contact before the Australian force was withdrawn to be retasked. With Kaiapit now secured the Papuans were given the task of patrolling ahead of the pursuing Australian force as they followed the Japanese into the Ramu Valley. The Australian 9th Division landing east of Lae. While operations were continuing in the Markham Valley to the north-west, C Company, PIB under the command of Leutchford had been operating with the 9th Division following its landing at Lae. The Papuans carried out scouting and reconnaissance patrols on the coastal plain to the east of the town and in the mountain ranges to the north, and later harassed retreating Japanese troops attempting to move through the Saruwaged Mountains, operating from Gawan and Musom in the south, Boana in the west, and Mount Salawaket in the north-east. Landing on Red Beach on 5 September, after leaving 10 Platoon to dig-in on the beach, the Papuan company moved west towards Lae. That morning Japanese bombers had attacked the beach, causing a large number of allied casualties. One of the Papuans from 10 Platoon subsequently died of his wounds. Meanwhile, the remainder of C Company married-up with the 2/4th Independent Company and moved to the Singaua Plantation. 9 Platoon then moved to the Busu River crossing, being attached to the 24th Brigade for the advance along the coastal route. At the same time 10 and 11 Platoons advanced in front of the 26th Brigade as it moved up the Burep River via the inland route. By 10 September the platoons were between the Busu and Burep Rivers, while one was below Musom village downstream. Over the next few days reconnaissance patrols clashed with the Japanese, killing a number of them. With the 7th and 9th Divisions converging on Lae the town fell to the Australians on 16 September. As Japanese forces attempted to escape a number were killed by PIB patrols during a series of clashes and ambushes up to 19 September. Although C Company was earmarked for the upcoming landing at Finschhafen, the need to cut-off the Japanese retreat meant 11 Platoon would remain behind at Gawan, north of Lae, while the remainder of the company redeployed. 11 Platoon was then tasked with patrolling to Mililunga and along the Boana track until relieved by A Company in late October. By 28 September A Company, PIB had completed their redeployment from Tambu Bay to Lae, establishing a headquarters at Old Yanga village. 1 Platoon moved north along the Busu to take over from 11 Platoon, C Company, while 5 Platoon was still operating around Labu Swamp. 4 Platoon patrolled to Gwabadik village and from there to Musom, then north towards Kemen. 3 Platoon moved to Sugarloaf to be attached to the 15th Battalion. Over the following days 4 and 5 Platoon had contacts with small groups of Japanese fleeing Lae. On the morning of 13 October a 4 Platoon patrol attacked a group of hungry Japanese in Kemen, killing eight soldiers and capturing two officers. On 15 October, 5 Platoon located Japanese equipment and other evidence of a group moving towards Markham Point; making contact the following day they killed five. On 17 October two sections from A Company were detached to the 29th/46th Battalion during mopping up operations between Mongi River and Finschhafen. While patrolling the area villagers informed them the Japanese were withdrawing towards Sattelberg. Patrols also continued in the lower Markham, and north of Lae another difficult patrol was conducted over a 10-day period from Bungalumba to Mount Saruwaket via a disused and overgrown track. They subsequently detected a group of Japanese that had crossed the range towards Iloko and Sio. By the end of November A Company, minus the sections on the Mongi River, was back at Old Yanga where they prepared to move to Finschhafen. Meanwhile, there were also 100 local recruits at Old Yanga, and this later became PIB Sub-Depot Lae. =Ramu Valley, October 1943 ‚Äì January 1945= While the Lae campaign continued, the 7th Division pursued the Japanese into the Ramu Valley as they retreated following the fighting at Kaiapit. The main Japanese force withdrew via a route to the north from Dumpu, over the Finisterres Ranges at Kankiryo Saddle, in the direction of Madang. Meanwhile, a small force had withdrawn directly down the Ramu Valley. B Company, PIB under command of Chalk was subsequently attached to the 21st Brigade which was tasked with harassing this group. During a number of patrols in September extended operations ranged as far north as the Annenberg villages before being involved in a minor skirmish with the Japanese at Naruapan. Unopposed, B Company continued up the Markham Valley, linking up with the 2/6th Independent Company at Marawasa. At Haus Sak Sak on the southern side of the Upper Ramu they set up camp, with the Papuans patrolling the area to the north. Company Headquarters then moved to Kaigulan on the north bank of the Ramu. On 3 October a patrol from 6 Platoon ran into a small group of Japanese at Bopi, capturing a prisoner. The headquarters then moved to Dumpu airstrip. On 13 October a platoon patrol of the foothills behind Kumbrarum located a Japanese gun that had been shelling the 31st Battalion, and it was later destroyed by an airstrike. 7 Platoon then patrolled up the bank of the Faria River to Guy's Post on the eastern side of Shaggy Ridge, while a section patrol continued to Mount Prothero, crossing the range at the top of the Mindjim River, moving through Japanese territory for seven days. On 22 October, 6 Platoon departed on seven day patrol of the headwaters of the Mene River. On their return a section with fifty carriers attached patrolled deep into the ranges near Kankiryo Ridge over 13 days, returning without making contact with the Japanese. By late October the 7th Division and its attachments, including the Papuans, had succeeded in driving the Japanese from the Ramu Valley and into the Finisterres; however, supply problems prevented further advances. During this time the remainder of the company had been resting at Kumbarum, awaiting the return of the other patrols. On 6 November they moved forward into the Yogi River region, to the west. 6 and 7 Platoons then crossed the Ramu, patrolling the area around Mount Otto on the edge of the Central Highlands. The 7th Division had been tasked with preventing Japanese penetration of the Ramu and Markham Valleys using screening patrols during October and November. On 9 November B Company, PIB was ordered to relieve the 2/6th Independent Company around Kesawai, and it subsequently crossed the Evapia River and commenced patrols in the area around the 5800 feature. One patrol clashed with a Japanese patrol of around 20 men, coming under heavy fire before repelling them. The company then took up defensive positions to guard the area from the Kesawai villages to the northern ridge of the 5800 feature. Continuing to patrol the area, information on Japanese activity was gained from the villages to the north, while a number of minor clashes with small Japanese groups occurred, resulting in one Papuan being wounded. On 26 November a three-man standing patrol on the perimeter near Kesawai killed one Japanese soldier and wounded another. On 30 November a platoon crossed the Ramu, patrolling into Waimeriba village. Members of the Papuan Infantry Battalion at Mass in the Ramu Valley, October 1943 From 1 December 1943, B Company, PIB came under command of the 25th Brigade and occupied positions on the banks of Evapia River prior to the arrival of the 7th Division. The Papuans sent out a clearing patrol north-east of Kesawai No. 1 which reported the area clear, while another patrol from the 5800 feature observed a large Japanese force to the north of the Taipa villages but avoided contact. Later a section from 7 Platoon killed a Japanese officer and wounded a soldier in an ambush. Meanwhile, there had been other signs of Japanese movement detected in the area, indicating the possibility of a major action against Allied forces in the Ramu Valley and Finisterres. Japanese forces were more active in the west, while the Australian positions in this area were dangerously dispersed, with a large distance between the Papuans around the 5800 feature and the 2/6th Independent Company to their left on the Solu River, with this gap considered to be vulnerable to infiltration. By 7 December B Company, PIB was located on a position astride the main track running north-south on the 5800 feature, with 7 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant Ed Bishop on the forward perimeter, on a spur to the north of the feature. After midnight on 7/8 December the booby traps in front of 7 Platoon exploded as a large Japanese force estimated at approximately two companies assaulted the forward Papuan section, guided by hostile natives. The Papuans stood-to defend their position, and succeeded in holding the attackers at bay for the next two hours for the loss of two men killed, while a runner broke through and alerted the platoon commander. The Japanese then attacked the platoon main defensive position from two sides. At 03:00 Chalk attempted to contact 7 Platoon by field telephone, but was unsuccessful. The fighting continued until around 0900, by which time 7 Platoon had run out of ammunition. Surrounded and with the telephone wires back to the company position cut there was no chance of resupply. The platoon was forced to withdraw with Bishop leading a breakout, during which heavy casualties were inflicted on the Japanese. However, with the men forced to move individually many became separated, while several were injured by their own booby-traps, and others were wounded by Japanese fire as they attempted to move back to Australian lines. After occupying the position, the Japanese fired a number of flares which signalled a line of carriers to bring up reinforcements and supplies. At 11:00 a Papuan lance corporal made it back to the company position and reported the situation, while later a sergeant and 10 native soldiers also returned. However, with most of 7 Platoon till missing, Chalk was ordered to withdraw B Company, PIB to the Evapia River. Part of a Japanese attempt to push the Australians off the hills and into the Ramu Valley, the attack was followed by moves against positions held by the 2/6th Independent Company on 8 December which forced a number to be withdrawn, while other elements were cut-off. However, in the days that followed the Australians regrouped, while reinforcements moved forward as the Japanese dug-in. On 9 December the Japanese held positions above Kesawai were heavily attacked by Allied aircraft. Meanwhile, many of the PIB survivors had started to make their way back; even still, by that evening of those that had been on the 5800 feature, Bishop, four Australian NCOs, and 12 Papuans remained missing. Over next few days a number of others made it through to the forward positions of the 2/25th Battalion around Kesawai, and by 11 December Bishop, two NCOs and one wounded Papuan had been located, accounting for the last of the missing. Total PIB casualties during the fighting had been three killed and two wounded. On 16 December the company moved again, crossing the Ramu River to establish a patrol base to cover the Kobon‚ÄìKoropa‚ÄìSoly River area. From this position the company continued to patrol until 3 January 1944. Following six months of active service it was withdrawn, returning to Bisiatabu near Port Moresby for rest. After leave, a period of training and regrouping followed. Meanwhile, the 7th Division cleared Shaggy Ridge on 23 January 1944. In June 1944 B Company, PIB‚Äîstill under the command of Chalk‚Äîreturned to Dumpu, relieving the carrier company of the Australian 11th Division. From mid August to 9 November patrols of the area were conducted from Dumpu, while others were also conducted from Annenberg towards the Kreram River to west, as well as downstream to Schillings Plantation. On 9 November a patrol under Lieutenant Thomas Bruce departed by canoe to investigate an island downstream near Anjetti. As they attempted to land they were engaged by a group of Japanese. Bruce was killed in the opening volley, and although the patrol managed to reach the safety of the river bank it was later discovered that six Papuans were also missing. Despite efforts to find them, their bodies were never recovered. Over the days that followed reinforcements were flown to Annenberg, while aircraft flew reconnaissance missions over Anjetti but were unable to locate the Japanese force. In late November the company, minus 6 Platoon, was ordered to return to Bisiatabu near Port Moresby. Meanwhile, 6 Platoon remained at Annenberg, continuing routine patrolling until early January 1945 when it was also withdrawn. =Finschhafen, September 1943 ‚Äì January 1944= While B Company was fighting in the Markham and Ramu Valley campaign, A and C Companies were involved in the capture of Finschafen and Sattelberg, before pursuing the Japanese along the northern coastline of the Huon Peninsula towards Saidor between September 1943 and January 1944. With the fall of Lae occurring more quickly than expected the 20th Brigade of the 9th Division had been retasked to capture Finschhafen in the next in the series of amphibious operations. From there they would begin the advance towards Sio, further around the coast on the northern side of the Huon Peninsula. C Company, PIB under Leutchford (minus 11 Platoon which remained at Lae until early November) was detailed to be part of the landing at Scarlet Beach. They would be tasked with patrolling and helping ANGAU recruit local carriers. However, Japanese strength had been significantly underestimated by the Allied command, and with more than 5,000 troops in the area Scarlet Beach was strongly defended. Following a naval bombardment, the landing went ahead before dawn at around 0500 on the morning of 22 September. Due to the darkness, a strong current, and faulty maps, a navigational error resulted in the first and second waves mistakenly landing at Siki Cove, approximately to the south, and avoiding the main Japanese defences as a result. The third wave landed correctly at Scarlet Beach and found itself heavily engaged. Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea 10 Platoon landed on the northern end of Siki Cove with the second wave of the 2/13th and 2/17th Battalions and was unopposed. Moving up the beach quickly to the palm trees they turned towards Katika to the south to attack Japanese positions defending the beach. They then came under fire from both Japanese and Australian troops and sustained several men wounded. 9 Platoon and Company Headquarters then landed with the third wave containing the 2/15th Battalion at Scarlet Beach. Strongly resisted by the Japanese who held their fire until the last moment, the Australian force landed under heavy machine-gun fire. The craft carrying the Papuans was hit, damaging the landing mechanism and jamming the ramp half-open, which forced them to disembark over the side into deep water. First out, Leutchford was shot almost immediately. Badly wounded, he soon fell unconscious. Still heavily engaged, he was supported in the water by a Papuan police sergeant attached to the company for the operation, and was then dragged ashore with the assistance of a nearby Australian soldier. Heavy fighting continued on the beach as the Australians and Papuans pushed the Japanese defenders back over the next half hour, by which time Leutchford had died of his wounds. Meanwhile, although a section had become separated and was forced to fight past a number of bunkers, 9 Platoon overran the Japanese trenches and dug-in. Several members were wounded in the fighting during this period. Despite the initial confusion caused by landing in the wrong place, the Australians eventually regained control of the scattered troops and disentangled the different units which had become intermingled on the beach. By daylight they had succeeded in securing the beach and the jungle fringe, mopping up the fixed Japanese defences behind it and then pushing through them, before beginning to consolidate the beachhead. At dawn C Company, PIB moved back to the beach to regroup, with Lieutenant Colin Rice assuming temporary command as the platoons prepared to set off towards their objectives. 10 Platoon cleared the beach north toward Bonga which was found to have been vacated, while 9 Platoon moved south, conducting a reconnaissance along the Sattelberg Road in the direction of Tareko. The following morning they moved up the road towards Jivevaneng, probing in front of the advancing Australians. Reaching the mission station 9 Platoon found it deserted, and it was subsequently occupied. An area of tactical importance due to its dominating position and the observation it provided, D Company, 2/17th Battalion pushed past the mission, and by 25 September was west before meeting resistance. Confronted by a strong Japanese force, the Australians were forced back to Jivevaneng, but repelled six strong attacks on their position over the following days before being relieved by two platoons from the 2/43rd Battalion under Captain Eric Grant. On 30 September Grant's understrength company and the Papuans from 9 Platoon were surrounded and cut-off but were able to hold off a number of attacks over the next four days. An attempt by two other Australian companies to break through failed before a PIB sergeant and a group of scouts from the main force was finally guided into the position by two Papuans that had been sent out to through Japanese lines. On 4 October they led the encircled force out carrying their wounded, just hours before a relief force finally pushed its way through. Meanwhile, Finschhafen had fallen two days earlier. During this time 10 Platoon had been working with the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion which was guarding the approach between the Song River and North Hill. To replace Leutchford, Dick Gore from A Company was promoted to captain and took over command of C Company. PIB patrols operated in a number of areas, with platoons scouting Japanese positions and providing guides to the Australian battalions. With demand for the Papuans high, the sections were scattered and command and control became difficult. On 12 October C Company, PIB came under the direct command of the 9th Division and was tasked with gathering information about the terrain and deep patrolling into the Bonga‚ÄìWarea and Wareo‚ÄìSattelberg‚ÄìMararuo areas. The Japanese counter-attack against Jivevaneng and Scarlet Beach on 16‚Äì17 October subsequently failed, and they were pushed back into the mountains towards Sattelberg and Wareo. A section from 10 Platoon occupying a guard position in front of the 2/17th Battalion was involved in the fighting on the morning on the 16th coming under heavy fire, although it was able to withdraw without loss. The Japanese then moved in reinforcements in an attempt to dislodge the Allied forces, threatening the area between Scarlet Beach and Siki Creek. On 18 October a Papuan patrol reported Japanese on the Song River. However, after heavy fighting the Japanese counter-attack finally ran out of steam. Meanwhile, the 2/17th Battalion had been holding on at Jivevaneng but were running low on supplies and their lines of communication had become cut. On 19 October a PIB patrol succeeded in moving across country from Tareko to Jivevaneng with supplies. Following the completion of its operations around Lae, 11 Platoon rejoined the remainder of C Company. Heavily tasked, on 23 October the company was ordered to support both the 20th Brigade and 22nd Battalion, and the 24th and 26th Brigades. PIB patrols attached to the 2/43rd Battalion reconnoitred the strategically important Bonga‚ÄìGusika track, as well as Pino Hill and the Exchange and Oriental features which dominated it. Strongly contested, control of the area change hands a number of times during the fighting, and the patrols observed Japanese movements over the next few days. Following the defeat of the Japanese counter-offensive the Australians were ordered to clear the area and secure the coastline north to Sio. The Japanese were subsequently observed using the area as an evacuation and supply route before the patrol withdrew. Elements of the PIB and 2/43rd Battalion then scouted Pino Hill in preparation for retaking the area. These patrols detected Japanese reinforcements landing by barge, prompting the Australians to resume their offensive in an attempt to capture the high ground around Sattelberg and advance to the Gusika‚ÄìWareo line, while Japanese supply lines were attacked. In early November an observation post was established, while PIB and 2/43rd Battalion patrols watched Japanese movements on the Gusik‚ÄìWareo track. Patrols also probed north, locating a number of Japanese units in the vicinity of Bonga and Pino Hill. A five-man PIB patrol disguised as local villagers set up an observation post north of Bonga between 9 and 11 November, from where they detected a sizable Japanese force. A similar four-man patrol later penetrated Japanese lines near Wareo and remained in position for two days. The observation post also continued to be manned. On 20 November a patrol along the coastal track encountered significant Japanese forces south of Bonga and was forced to withdraw. A Japanese counter-attack along the coast began on 22 November but was held by a company from the 2/43rd Battalion, while Sattelberg Mountain‚Äîwhich dominated the area‚Äîfinally fell on 25 November. In contrast to the previous operation at Lae which had been captured unexpectedly quickly, Finschhafen had taken over two months, despite predictions by GHQ that it would only take two weeks. Finally the Japanese began to retreat. Yet despite losing Sattelberg, they continued to hold positions on the high ground at Wareo and to its north. During difficult fighting the Australians pushed north and then west across the Huon Peninsula while the Japanese left rearguards to delay them. Combined patrols from the 2/43rd Battalion and the PIB moved north searching for the Japanese and found hundreds of abandoned trenches and about 40 dead, before encountering Japanese rearguard parties on the afternoon of the 24th. A group of Papuans was then involved in helping secure the supply line, escorting carriers with men from the 2/43rd Battalion to Pebu over 24‚Äì25 November. On the afternoon of 25 November an Australian warrant officer from the PIB and a Papuan soldier, along with two Australian signallers from the 2/43rd Battalion, were killed by a Japanese machine-gun whilst moving forward to repair a field telephone line cut by the retreating Japanese. Meanwhile, in an attempt to regain Pabu the Japanese reoccupied Pino Hill, only to be forced to abandon in the face of a deliberate attack by infantry from the 2/32nd Battalion supported by four Matilda tanks, and heavy preparatory fire from the artillery, with 9 Platoon, PIB attached as scouts. An advance to the Wareo- Gusika line then began, with 9 Platoon moving forward to occupy North Hill, while 10 Platoon supported the 26th Brigade by conducting probes to the Song River and Fior village to the north. The Song River was the main obstacle in the way of the Australian advance and prior to withdrawing the Japanese had destroyed the only bridge across it, requiring an alternative to be found. 10 Platoon then supported the 2/15th Battalion to capture Nongora, which finally fell on 2 December after heavy fighting. With the Japanese in full retreat towards Wareo, C Company PIB was tasked with cutting them off. Section from 10 Platoon worked with the 2/4th Commando Squadron, while 9 Platoon conducted harassing operations to the west near Joangeng. On 6 December 9 Platoon initiated a successful ambush north of Gusika, killing six Japanese. However, Gore's men had been in action for over three months and as a consequence C Company was ordered to be relieved by A Company, PIB before moving to the Kulungtufu‚ÄìHube area for rest. Meanwhile, commencing on 3 December, the Australian 4th Brigade began its advance up the coast from Gusika, leading the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. PIB soldiers around the Song River, March 1944 A Company, PIB departed Lae on 10 December via sea to Finschhafen. Establishing a base camp at Coconut Beach at the mouth of the Tunom River, the first patrols moved out on 16 December. Moving inland to a position on the Song River, members of 3 Platoon were involved in tracking a group of Japanese soldiers after a sentry from a nearby Australian battalion had been killed during the night. The Papuans accompanied an Australian patrol the next day which followed the Japanese through thick kunai grass up towards the Sowi River where they came under fire. Unsure of the size of the force the patrol went to the ground. Deciding to outflank the Japanese, they located and killed a group of six Japanese in a concealed position. Meanwhile, elements of 5 Platoon reached the Sanga River to the south of Aimoloa, while another patrol moved up the coast towards Lakona in front of the 24th Brigade. A Company, PIB forded the Masaweng River at the Mikos No. 1 on 22 December. During the crossing a PIB patrol had detected a number of Japanese soldiers entering an observation post that had been set up in a cliff overhang. A section under Corporal Tapioli moved forward to observe the position but he was seen by a Japanese soldier. Tapioli immediately killed the Japanese soldier and then charged the cave mouth followed by the rest of his men. All the Japanese were killed in the ensuing action and their bodies thrown into the river. By late December the 4th Brigade had advanced past Fortification Point, and was relieved by the 20th Brigade. Dead, wounded and starving Japanese were increasingly encountered by the Australians as they moved towards the Rai coast. 3 Platoon then conducted a long-range patrol, gathering information on retreating Japanese forces moving towards Zagahemi, during which they surprised and killed four on a track near Nompua. In the Kulungtufu area C Company, PIB under Gore commenced patrolling and later constructed a light aircraft strip which was completed Christmas. Over the following weeks a series of long patrols were conducted into the Cromwell Range and the region beyond, while a patrol from 9 Platoon moved over the headwaters of the Mongi River and the mountains to reach Indagen village. Numerous traces of the retreating Japanese forces were located; however, the only contact occurred in early January 1944. Setting out on 6 January a 40-man patrol under Sergeant Frederick Bendall was ambushed around noon and the Papuans dropped their rifles in the panic. Rapidly withdrawing they were chased by the Japanese. Stopping to drink at a creek the Papuans were attacked, and Bendall returned fire with his Owen gun, killing a Japanese soldier as the Papuans withdrew again. The chase continued and by late afternoon they were cornered. Almost unarmed they were forced to scale a cliff near a waterfall to escape. A thick mist provided some concealment; however, one of the Papuans fell during the climb and was believed to have died. With little food and water the patrol struggled across the mountains for six days before finally reaching Finschhafen. A number of patrols were then sent out looking for the missing men. However, following their return the patrols continued, with one resulting in four Japanese killed. C Company was withdrawn in early February, moving back to their old camp on the Song River. During the campaign the company lost ten men killed. =Saidor‚ÄìSio, January ‚Äì March 1944= A Company was now the only operational PIB sub-unit, continuing to support the 20th Brigade's pursuit of the Japanese as they withdrew towards Saidor. Initially under the command of Lieutenant Ernest Vickery after Hitchcock went on leave in November, the company was involved in heavy contact with the Japanese retreating from Fortification Point to Sio, and then along the Rai coast to Saidor. Papuan patrols had previously operated in support of Australian forces moving against Fortification Point prior to its capture in late December 1943, and afterwards had supported the continuing pursuit by deep patrolling on the flank to the west. On 24 December 3 Platoon left on a three-week patrol inland through Hompua to Zagahemi during which they killed three Japanese. The platoon was then attached to the 2/4th Commando Squadron, patrolling south of the Masaweng River. During this time a patrol from 5 Platoon killed another three Japanese. On 29 December, A Company Headquarters and the remainder of the company not on patrol moved to Anchorage Point by barge, before continuing north to Walingai and Kanomi. Meanwhile, 4 Platoon patrolled inland for four days, returning via the coast to Kanomi. As part of a series of amphibious assaults by US forces beginning at Torokina in Bougainville in early November 1943, Arawe in south-west New Britain in mid-December, and at Cape Gloucester at the western end of New Britain late that same month, on 2 January 1944 the US 126th Regiment landed at Saidor, some in front of the Australian 9th Division which was advancing along the New Guinea coast having been tasked with capturing Finschafen and securing the area north to Sio. As a result, the surviving elements of the Japanese 20th and 51st Divisions on the Huon Peninsula were compelled to withdraw over the Finisterre Range. Yet the Americans ultimately failed to seize the opportunity to destroy the withdrawing Japanese and despite a heavy toll from disease and starvation they succeeded in reaching Madang, with many Japanese surviving to continue fighting before they were finally cornered by the Australians during the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign in 1945. Meanwhile, during 4 Platoon's patrol they had been attacked by hostile natives before reaching Karako. On 4 January they clashed with the Japanese north of Walingi, killing four. The next day Company Headquarters moved to Sialum by barge. A Company, PIB started moving along the coast, while a four-man patrol from 4 Platoon tasked with probing inland moved in front of a platoon from D Company, 2/24th Battalion. This patrol located the bodies of number of Japanese who had starved to death, while a number of others in ill health were also killed in clashes, being indicative of the acute supply problems the Japanese were now experiencing. On 9 January Company Headquarters moved to Kelanoa Harbour, then coming under command of the 20th Brigade (less 4 Platoon). Moving rapidly, the Papuans supported a company of the 2/17th Battalion, crossing the Kapugara River on 13 January. After crossing the Goaling River the Papuans entered the village of Nambariwa, which had been a used previously by the Japanese. Six Japanese were killed, while the bodies of nine more were located in remains of the settlement. On 15 January the 20th Brigade captured Sio, completing the 9th Division's quick sweep up the coast against light Japanese resistance. The 9th Division was then relieved by the Australian 5th Division for the continuing pursuit of the Japanese as they withdrew. A Company Headquarters next moved to Sio, while on 18 January three Japanese were killed by a patrol behind the mission there. Meanwhile, the same day a patrol from 4 Platoon attached to the 2/48th Battalion killed four unarmed Japanese carrying rice. On 21 January the Papuans came under the command of the 8th Brigade, and continued scouting and patrol tasks. The following day a patrol sent to Lembangando Mission to investigate local reports of Japanese in the area successfully ambushed a group of up to 30 Japanese in the church there, with none believed to have survived. Another patrol pushed up to Vincke Point at the mouth of the Kwama River, before establishing a base upstream. The area was subsequently found to contain a large number of dead Japanese from previous heavy fighting there. PIB troops and their officer interrogate Japanese prisoners, March 1944 On 25 January A Company Headquarters relocated to Wasu, and from there patrols were sent further along the coast. Heavy contact occurred over this period, with the Papuans killing an average of 12 to 15 Japanese a day. Meanwhile, other patrols flanked the coast through the foothills inland from Sigawara to Ulap Mission. Moving via the villages of Singor and Malsanga, the Papuans arrived at the Timbi River on 30 January. The following day A Company, PIB and the forward Australian units moved forward to Crossingtown. However, with the advance now taking them ahead of their supply system and the arrival of more Australian troops increasing the logistic problem, the Papuans began to run short on food and were placed on reduced rations for a number of days until an airdrop could be organised. On 4 February, 5 Platoon linked up with the rest of A Company at Nemau. The 30th Battalion reached the next supply beach at Butubutu on 5 February. Having led the Australian advance up the coast to this point, the Papuans were then retasked with one platoon conducting a reconnaissance of the inland trails, while the infantry took over the lead on the right. A Company, PIB then moved to the Sowat and Urana Rivers, killing eight Japanese on the way. The Papuans took over the vanguard again ahead the Australians on 7 February, reaching Gali No.1. They were subsequently delayed by a Japanese rearguard between Roinji and Gali; however, this was soon overrun with six of the defenders being killed. On 10 February 1944 the Australians advancing along the coast linked up with American forces at Saidor. Hitchcock subsequently returned from leave, resuming command of A Company, PIB. On 12 February a patrol south of Gali killed four more Japanese. The following day the Papuans paused while the newly arrived 35th Battalion came forward, before the advance was resumed by the combined Australian and Papuan force. A large Japanese force located at Malamanai was planned to be assaulted by the 35th Battalion while the Papuans guarded their rear. Beginning at 09:00 on 14 February the inexperienced 35th Battalion was outflanked by the Japanese defenders who concentrated heavy fire on the Australians. Ordered to assist the Papuans moved into the bush on both sides of the roads and ambushed the Japanese on the flanks. Following heavy fighting the Australians and Papuans forced the Japanese to withdraw towards Saidor. Beginning on 16 February A Company, PIB supported the Australian effort to push the Japanese out of the hill villages of Ruange, Bwana Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Tapen, Gubutamon, and Wandiluk. By now the Japanese were starving, and many were attracted to the gardens located in the area as sources of food. When cornered they could be expected to defend their positions desperately as a result. During the period to 21 February large numbers of Japanese were killed in the area, including many by A Company, PIB. Private Matpi was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions. On 25 February PIB platoons operating in the mountains were order not to advance beyond Wandiluk as its part in the campaign began to come to an end. At Nokopo a PIB patrol chased a number of hungry Japanese out of the village gardens. Elsewhere, American forces captured Los Negros by the end of February, commencing construction of a large base area for further operations at Lorengau. On 3 March 1944 A Company, PIB was withdrawn and moved to the battalion rest camp established at the Song River. A Company had been deployed for over eight months and the conditions of the campaign and the rapid advance had taken a toll on it with a number men evacuated to hospital, while its casualties included one dead. Occupying a position adjacent to C Company, PIB at Kaligia, A Company was complete by 11 March, concluding its involvement in the actions along the Rai Coast. Meanwhile, an Advanced Battalion Headquarters had been established there under Watson following his arrival from Port Moresby, taking over command of A and C Companies. =Madang, April ‚Äì August 1944= 5 Platoon, A Company PIB on patrol, Hansa Bay 1944 As Australian forces continued their advance along the coast, they reached Bogadjim on 13 April 1944, before capturing Madang on the 24th, followed by Alexishafen two days later. The PIB was tasked with moving into the area to the south-west of Madang, with both A and C Companies commencing operations in the area to the east of the Adelbert Range in support of the Australian 5th Division. A Company left the Song River camp on 22 April, flying to Saidor, and then moved by barge to Bogadjim the following day, while C Company moved by sea to Madang on 25 April aboard the destroyer . On 27 April, C Company and the Advanced Battalion Headquarters married up with A Company at Siabob prior to commencing patrols. A Company was allocated an area south to the Amele River Mission where one of its platoons clashed with a small Japanese force, while C Company was to patrol west and south-west to the head of the Amaimon‚ÄìGogol River. A Company moved up the coast to Alexishafen on 2 May, and began operating north and west of Madang, with C Company taking over the south west. Advanced Battalion Headquarters was closed down on 9 May, and its personnel transferred to A and C Company. C Company spent the remainder of the month of May undertaking uneventful patrols around Amele. In the first week of June, A Company extended its patrols inland to Nagada and Sarang, while a section was detached to a company from the 37th/52nd Battalion operating on Kar Kar Island. C Company patrolled to Sanapi, extending its patrols west of Madang, while A Company moved up the coast to Dugumr Bay, reaching Bogia on 13 June. Moving further along the coast to Moresapa, company headquarters was established at Hansa Bay on the 16th. It was then tasked with patrolling the coastal region between the Ramu and Sepik Rivers. During these patrols the Papuans rescued eight survivors from a crashed US bomber, while a number of Chinese civilians, escaped Indian prisoners of war, and sick Japanese were also recovered, while several Japanese ambushed and killed in a minor clash. In June, a crashed C-47 Dakota was found and two of its crew rescued. Meanwhile, C Company undertook little activity in June as they prepared to redeploy. On 1 July 1944, they embarked on the Isaac I. Stevens to return to Port Moresby, followed by onward movement to Battalion Headquarters located at Bisiatabu. On 5 July, an A Company patrol in the Watam Lagoon area uncovered intelligence regarding a Japanese force approximately 100-strong located at Singarin. The Papuans then undertook a series of probes down the Ramu and Sepik Rivers, with one patrol reaching Schilling Plantation. Information from the local people indicated many of the Japanese were dying or were otherwise in poor condition, being short on food and only lightly armed. On 8 July, another patrol moved towards Bien village on the Sepik. Requiring canoes to travel down to the river mouth one of the patrols attempted to obtain them from nearby villages but was betrayed in fear of retribution. That evening their position was surrounded by Japanese. At dawn on 9 July around 20 Japanese supported by 30 armed Sepik villagers landed undetected and attacked the Papuan camp. A number of Papuans were alerted and returned fire, while those sleeping in the houses escaped into the swamp. After several hours the patrol re-assembled at Bien, and although a number of weapons had been lost, there were no casualties. The Japanese occupied the village but did not pursue the men in the swamp who eventually linked up and made their way through a maze of swamp and jungle, reaching a small village by the afternoon where they rested after coming through difficult terrain. The next day they reached the mouth of the Sepik, and later rejoined the rest of the party. Meanwhile, a section at Watam patrolled near the mouth of the Sepik, observing Japanese movements around Kopra Bank. A Company continued its patrols until 8 August, after which it was withdrawn to Alexishafen. They returned to Port Moresby on 28 August 1944. B Company then became the only PIB element in the area, being based on the Ramu River between Dumpu and Annenberg, until relieved by a newly raised New Guinean unit on 28 November 1944. =Formation of additional native units= In the latter half of 1943 the Australian government decided, with MacArthur's agreement, that the size of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries required to supply growing British and US forces in the Pacific. The size of the Army was reduced, though an offensive force of six infantry divisions (three AIF and three Militia) was maintained until the end of the war. In early 1944 all but two of the Army's divisions had been withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation. The Australian military's role in the South-West Pacific subsequently decreased during 1944 as US forces took over responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region. Meanwhile, as a result of the success of the PIB, in late 1943 New Guinea Force Headquarters decided to raise units of indigenous soldiers in New Guinea to bolster the forces available to it. The 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion (1 NGIB) was formed in March 1944, while the 2nd New Guinea Infantry Battalion (2 NGIB) was formed on 26 September 1944. Yet as manpower reductions continued these losses would be partly offset by raising more battalions of New Guinea natives, with plans to raise another four in the next 12 months. These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign, and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions that were disbanded during the year. In October 1944 it was decided it would be necessary to raise the Pacific Islands Regiment (PIR) to administer the three battalions of Papuan and New Guinean troops. Yet the Australian military had held strong misgivings about the establishment of the PIR, and it had only been undertaken out of necessity, with the effectiveness, discipline and reliability of native troops questioned in some quarters, while training them in the use of weapons was seen as potentially creating a problem for the post- war administration. The PIB, along with the 1st and 2nd New Guinea Infantry Battalions, were subsequently amalgamated to form the PIR in November 1944, and a depot battalion formed. The 3rd and 4th New Guinea Infantry Battalion joined the regiment in 1945, although 4 NGIB was soon disbanded, while the 5th New Guinea Infantry Battalion‚Äîalthough authorised‚Äîwas never raised. Each battalion had an establishment of about 77 Europeans and 550 native soldiers. By the time of the PIB's incorporation into the PIR it had a strength of 700 men. Headquarters PIR was raised on 14 February 1945 at Camp Diddy, near Nadzab. Previously the PIB had been under the administrative control of New Guinea Force, while they fought under local Australian operational commanders; however, ANGAU took over administrative responsibility for the battalion on 24 March 1944. The First Army took over operational control of the new regiment, while ANGAU retained administrative responsibly. =Reorganisation, 1944‚Äì1945= In February 1944 Watson had transferred a portion of his headquarters to the Song River, due to the distance between Port Moresby and A and C Company. Watson retired from the PIB in April 1944 and was replaced by Standfield, now a lieutenant colonel. With companies operating independently in the Ramu Valley, Madang and Sepik areas his position was mainly administrative. The companies of the battalion returned to Port Moresby between July and November after being temporarily withdrawn from operations, with some of its personnel later being transferred to the New Guinea Infantry Battalions which were in the process of being formed. A reorganisation followed, while the battalion conducted training at Bisiatabu, near Port Moresby. The decision in August 1944 to form 2 NGIB meant the PIB would lose its New Guinean soldiers to 1 and 2 NGIB, although this did not begin to take effect until late October. A total of 162 New Guineans were advised they would be transferred, yet out of loyalty to their battalion many were unhappy with being forced to leave and peacefully left their barracks to protest to ANGAU on 30 October, although without effect. The first 60 New Guineans marched out on 3 November. The Papuans were then allotted to C Company, and those New Guineans that remained were allocated to Depot Company, while recruitment began to rebuild the unit with teams sent to Kila, Boroko, Hanuabada, 12-Mile, 17-Mile, Ilolo, Dobuduru, and Milne Bay in eastern Papua. A number of Australians serving with the PIB were also transferred at this time, either to the NGIB battalions or other units, including Standfield. Lieutenant Colonel Sid Elliot-Smith, a former Resident Magistrate on Samarai Island with the Papuan Administration who had later served with ANGAU, would take over as commanding officer. The first Australian replacements for the PIB arrived in mid-November, while later that month the last of the New Guineans were ordered to prepare to move to Lae as reinforcements for 1 NGIB. On 12 December 1944, Standfield handed over command to Elliot-Smith. Meanwhile, further Australian replacements arrived in December after completing training with ANGAU. Depot Company, PIB was disbanded at Bisiatabu in January 1945, and D Company raised in its place as a fourth rifle company on the same scale as the other three companies. Depot Battalion, PIR had been established by November 1944, and it subsequently took over this role. At this time the European establishment of each platoon was reduced to just the platoon commander and platoon sergeant, removing the three section sergeants which had previously been provided for. The battalion had built a fine war record, and except for a two-month break, elements of the unit had been in action continuously since the Japanese landing at Buna in July 1942. However, with the transfer of the New Guineans to the NGIB there were barely enough Papuans to man a company, and those that remained were internally posted in equal numbers throughout the battalion in preparation for the arrival of new recruits to fill the vacancies. In the months that followed the strength of the battalion grew, and by April 1945 it was operational again. The PIB was next committed to the Bougainville Campaign, where its companies would be spread across the fronts from Bonis to Buin during the final months of the war. =Bougainville, May ‚Äì September 1945= On 22 November 1944, the Australian II Corps under Lieutenant General Stanley Savige took over responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville from the US XIV Corps, and throughout November and December Australian units relieved the Americans who were redeployed for subsequent operations in the Philippines. Although Japanese forces on Bougainville numbered around 40,000 men at this stage, Allied intelligence had estimated that there were only about 17,500 defenders on the island. As a result of this error, Australian planning staff believed they were opposed by a roughly equal-sized force and Savige decided he would pursue an aggressive offensive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville. The Australian force consisted of the 3rd Division and two independent brigades, the 11th Brigade and 23rd Brigade. The majority of the Japanese force was believed to be concentrated in the south and as a result the main effort of the Australian plan was focused upon driving towards Buin. Supporting operations were also conducted along two other fronts. In the north, it was planned that the Japanese would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained there while, in the centre, the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east‚Äìwest avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks and opening the way for a drive to the east coast. Some key locations in the Bougainville campaign. With the campaign continuing the PIB was committed to the fighting. On 15 May 1945, all four companies embarked at Port Moresby bound for Empress Augusta Bay on the west coast of Bougainville. Arriving on 18 May, they then sailed for Torokina. With the unit substantially rebuilt, for many the coming fighting would be their first experience of combat. PIB involvement in the campaign would again see the companies operating as individually attached to larger units and formations, with the battalion widely dispersed across the area of operations. A Company was tasked to support the 26th Battalion on the Bonis Peninsula in the northern sector, B Company would support the 7th and 27th Battalions in the central sector along the Numa Numa Trail, C Company to Mokolina in the south attached to the 2/8th Commando Squadron operating in the hills east of the Buin Road, while D Company would support the 15th Brigade near Tai Tai, also in the southern sector. Meanwhile, Battalion Headquarters was established on Torokina. With the PIB concentrated on Bougainville, by 1 June 1945 the battalion headquarters was established at McKenna Bridge, in the vicinity of Headquarters 3rd Division. By this time the Australians had gained the ascendency. In the north the 11th Brigade had pushed the Japanese back to the Bonis Peninsula, the 23rd Brigade was in control of the Numa Numa Trail in the central sector, while in the south the lead Australian battalions from the 3rd Division had advanced to within of Buin, and were threatening the main Japanese garden areas. As Australian strength on Bougainville increased Savige planned the destruction of the Japanese on the island, intending to concentrate his forces in the south for the final advance on Buin, while maintaining sufficient strength in the northern and central sectors to maintain pressure on the defenders. After landing on 18 May 1945, A Company, under Jesser who was by now a major, moved by barge from Torokina to Soroken Plantation in the northern sector (less 1 and 2 Platoon which remained behind). Attached to the 26th Battalion, the Papuans started patrolling, with 3 and 4 Platoon moving across the narrow peninsula towards Siara, north of Ruri Bay. A number of sharp patrol clashes and ambushes followed during which the Papuans inflicted a large number of casualties on the Japanese. On 3 June, 4 Platoon was patrolling in advance of D Company, 26th Battalion when it was ambushed and its platoon commander killed. By 9 June the platoons were back at Soraken Plantation, while on the 12th a patrol was sent north to Buoi Plantation, from Ratsua. 5 Platoon subsequently operated with the 31st/51st Battalion on the west coast. On 22 June a reconnaissance patrol moved north to Buoi in an attempt to locate barges used during an unsuccessful attempt Australian attempt to land behind Japanese lines at Porton Plantation, but was forced to withdraw after hitting a strong Japanese position. The next month was mostly a period of rest, although reconnaissance patrols were sent to Ratsua, Tanimbau Bay and Ruru Bay. On 10 July the company established a base area around Ratsua. While 4 and 5 Platoon were tasked with scouting the road west of Ruri Bay. At this time Major Raymond Oliver took over command from Jesser. On 29 July at patrol from 4 Platoon was engaged in heavy fighting with a force of approximately 30 Japanese in a strong defensive position, but was able to conduct a fighting withdrawal supported by 5 Platoon, after losing one man killed. Another heavy clash two days later west of Ruri Bay which saw A Company inflict heavy casualties on a Japanese force of about 20 men, forcing the survivors to flee. On 7 August a patrol from 5 Platoon was tasked with establishing a base on the road south of the junction of the Numa Numa beach roads. Moving south, the Papuans located a camp before clashing with several groups of Japanese, many of whom were killed. The platoon then withdrew without loss in what proved to be A Company's last action on Bougainville. Meanwhile, in late May 1945, B Company, PIB, under the command of Captain Leo Hunt, relieved troops from 1 NGIB, who had been patrolling continuously in the central sector since the start of the campaign. Operating with the newly arrived 7th Battalion which had been tasked with eliminating the forward Japanese positions as part of the renewed offensive, they faced the remnants of Japanese forces along the Numa Numa Trail and around Sisivie and Ibu on the track to Asitavi Point on the coast. Initially concentrated north of Keenan's Ridge on Arty Hill, over the period 23 May to 3 June a patrol from 7 Platoon was tasked with cutting the Japanese lines of communication on the Numa Numa Trail, killing 11 Japanese in a series of patrol clashes and ambushes over a 12-day period. A patrol from 8 Platoon departed on 8 June, rejoining the company which was now located on Hunt's Hill on the 15th after an uneventful patrol. From there B Company patrolled the rear of Wearne's Hill and the Numa Numa Trail. On 2 July, 7 Platoon clashed with a group of Japanese while patrolling around Wearne's Hill, killing 5 Japanese before calling down artillery as they withdrew. After a period of rest patrols began again on 22 July, with a clearing patrol from 8 Platoon locating two Japanese listening posts, killing seven. The following day 8 Platoon began a nine-day patrol, leaving Hunt Hill and establishing a base near Tokoa with D Company, 7th Battalion. Following up reports of Japanese in the area, 8 Platoon patrolled to Nasisipok on 24 July. Locating a Japanese position the Papuans killed nine before the platoon was forced to retire under heavy fire which wounded the platoon commander. Returning three days later the Japanese position was found to be deserted. During heavy fighting on Kaipu Ridge on 28 July, a PIB section was attached to an Australian platoon which moved behind the ridge to cut the line of communication of the small but well established Japanese force, which was finally overrun that afternoon by the infantry after a heavy artillery preparation. On 8 August, 6 and 8 Platoon patrolled behind Pearl Ridge to the Wakunai River, ambushing a Japanese water point and killing four. B Company, PIB was then withdrawn to Torokina. In the southern sector, as the Australian infantry advanced towards Buin supported by tanks and engineers, the 2/8th Commando Squadron had been operating in the mountains on the flank. Acting independently, the Squadron was later joined by soldiers from C Company, PIB commanded by Captain Gordon Smith. In May 1945 they were designated \\"Raffles Force\\" under the command of Major Norman Winning; however, operations proved disappointing. Winning was later critical of the performance of the PIB, believing that discipline among the Papuans had been poor due to the limited number of European platoon commanders and sergeants who also lacked combat experience and were not yet used to working with native soldiers, while the Papuans had also seemed to be fearful of artillery and would not accompany forward observation officers. There had also been friction and distrust between the Papuans and their Bougainvillean guides, with Winning alleging that the Papuans had secretly threatened the guides from Buka not to lead them to any difficult targets or into situations from which they could not quickly escape. When the 2/8th Commando Squadron moved to Kilipaijino in July the PIB remained at Morokaimoro in order to patrol the Buin and Commando Roads and operate against Japanese infiltration in the area. On 14 August‚Äîthe day prior to the cessation of hostilities on Bougainville‚Äîa patrol from 11 Platoon moving down the river trail to Hanung, between the Koroko and Mobiai Rivers, was ambushed by a Japanese force of approximately 60 men after being sent to the area to follow up reports of Japanese in the area wishing to surrender. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Papuans killed 12 Japanese for the loss of one killed and one wounded. Corporal Geai was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. PIB troops being inspected at Torokina, October 1945 Also operating in the southern sector, D Company, PIB under the command of Captain James Flucker, arrived in mid-May and were allocated an area of operations on the northern bank of the Hari River in support of the 15th Brigade. Setting up camp in an area still under heavy fire from the Japanese around Ruani, several Papuans were wounded before operations began. D Company was initially tasked with probing the defences near Anderson's Crossing, during which a patrol clashed with a Japanese squad, killing seven. On 26 May the company moved forward to the Hongorai River. Soon after two Papuans were wounded in an ambush, while another was killed by a booby trap. On 12 June, during a patrol along the Hongorai‚ÄìTaiati track, 12 Platoon observed a group of Japanese preparing a covering position, killing two, wounding one, and forcing the rest withdraw. Meanwhile, another patrol surprised a Japanese listening post south of the Mamagota‚ÄìBuin Road junction, killing three. By 18 June, the company was concentrated at Rusei, and began probing east along the Buin Road. On 25 June a patrol from 12 Platoon detected a group of Japanese building a bunker, and killed two after pursuing them through the bush. However, with the rains commencing, the swollen creeks and rivers in the area limited operations, with D Company resting in a position north of the Mivo River during this time. On 14 July a patrol operated with elements of the 42nd Battalion to establish a base east. Departing on 19 July, another patrol located a missing Australian patrol cut-off by the Japanese and the flooding Mivo. Several wounded Australians were helped across the river that evening, while the remainder were led out the next day with the Papuans killing four Japanese and wounding another. On 27 July, a patrol from 12 Platoon east of the Mivo located a Japanese ambush, killing five. On 1 August, another 12 Platoon patrol attacked a Japanese camp near the Mivo River, killing several defenders and forcing the rest to withdraw. On 3 August, a patrol from D Company killed 12 Japanese in an ambush east of the Mivo crossing on the Buin Road. On 9 August, 12 Platoon was involved in the company's last action of the campaign, killing 14 when they surprised a Japanese patrol west on the Aku‚ÄìShishigatero track. By mid- August, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease-fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations. Although in many parts of the island Japanese forces had been ravaged by deprivation, in places where they were still healthy and held strong positions they maintained formidable resistance. Recognised for their skills in the jungle, the Papuans, like the New Guineans elsewhere, had been used in reconnaissance patrols prior to attacks or to locate positions suitable for use by artillery forward observers. Yet at times there had been friction and distrust between the Australian and the Papuan troops. According to Regan and Griffin, during the campaign native soldiers were sometimes used to complete dangerous tasks that Australians had been reluctant to do, while PIB soldiers and their officers also expressed anger at Australian units not acting on their reports, resulting in them having to repeatedly reconnoitre the same area. Some Australian units also reported that on occasion Papuan or New Guinean guides had deliberately led them away from Japanese positions. PIB casualties during the fighting on Bougainville were six killed and 29 wounded, while Japanese losses at their hands were estimated at 382 killed, 43 wounded, and 105 captured. =Disbandment= By the end of the war the PIB had sustained casualties of 32 killed, 15 missing, 42 died and 25 wounded, consisting of 23 Europeans and 91 natives. Although the number of Papuans that served in the conflict was relatively small in comparison to the Australians or Americans, being used in scouting and patrolling and often attached to far larger formations or in support of Allied intelligence, Sinclair argues that they had filled an important role out of proportion to their size. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, three Military Crosses, one George Medal, three Distinguished Conduct Medals, 15 Military Medals, and three Mentioned in Despatches. The PIB was recorded as having killed 1,476 Japanese soldiers during the operations it was involved in. Such was their effectiveness the Japanese referred to the PIB as \\"Green Shadows\\" (Ryokuin) due to their ability to fade into and appear from the jungle unexpectedly, with its soldiers becoming noted for their ferocity and tenacity. Captured documents also referred to the PIB as \\"Savage Unit\\" (Yabanjin Tai) or \\"Savage Soldiers\\" (Yabanjin Hei). Despite initial disapproval from some prominent settlers prior to the war, the Papuan and New Guinean soldiers also came to be thought of highly by many senior Australian officers who considered them \\"...fighters skilled in stealth and surprise attack, men whose knowledge of the bush and experience in tribal warfare could advance the Allied cause.\\" Yet military discipline among the native soldiers was reportedly an issue at times, with some men known to have taken advantage of their positions, while there were also cases of rape, looting and theft, particularly when detached or otherwise unsupervised. Members of the PIB on parade On 18 September 1945 the battalion moved to Torokina, before relocating again to Fauro Island in December to guard Japanese prisoners of war. Completing this duty in March 1946 they moved to Blanche Bay, near Rabaul, to guard Japanese prisoners there. The battalion was disbanded in August 1946, with the last members leaving Rabaul on 21 June. The soldiers of the Pacific Islands Regiment mostly went back to their villages and resumed their pre-war lives, although many struggled to readjust to being civilians again. Some expressed resentment at being treated poorly after their wartime service, having expected material rewards and improvements in the quality of life of the native population after the war. Many former soldiers became farmers, while others joined the public service, or came to prominence in local government. Still others joined the Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary. Perhaps surprisingly though, relatively few played a part as leaders in the political change which began in Papua New Guinea in 1960s, including the first general elections in 1964. Yet the experience of the war forever altered PNG, helping to change the perceptions of many Papua New Guineans of relations between the races from that which had existed in pre-war colonial society, with many coming to view themselves as the equals of Europeans as a result. This was due at least in part to the attitudes displayed by many Australian and US servicemen during the war which had often been more egalitarian than those of the small resident European population that had generally held itself aloof. In the years immediately following the war the Australian Army considered re-establishing a military presence in Papua New Guinea, although there was some opposition among the colonial administration and white settlers to the raising of native units, echoing previous concerns. As an interim measure, the re-establishment of the NGVR was approved in July 1949, re-forming as a whites-only reserve unit of the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). However, in November 1950, after considerable debate, the raising of a locally recruited regular battalion was authorised. Consequently, in March 1951 the Pacific Islands Regiment was reformed, with an initial strength of one battalion. Yet due to the age requirements imposed most former members of the wartime regiment were ineligible to re-enlist, and only a few of the youngest members were accepted, although many of those that did later rose to seniority as non-commissioned officers and provided a core of experienced personnel. Drawing its lineage from the PIB and NGIBs, the PIR was awarded their Second World War battle honours in 1961. A second battalion was also authorised, subsequently being raised in 1965. The regiment remained a unit of the Australian Army until Papua New Guinea gained its independence in 1975. Renamed the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment in 1985, today the regiment continues to exist as part of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force.

The parish of Caragh includes the village of Caragh itself, surrounding townlands and Prosperous village which is situated about 3 km north-west from the village. The club is the result of an amalgamation which occurred in 1994 between √âire √ìg of Caragh and Corra Choill of Prosperous. The first record of any kind of success in the Caragh parish area involves the Clongorey Campaigners. RIC records from 1890 show that Clongorey Campaigners had 38 members with Dan Kelly, John Murphy, Pat Fullam and James Kelly listed as officers. Clongorey reached the Senior Hurling Championship final in 1891 and but were defeated by Maynooth. Their home ground is in donore just opposite the motor racing circuit Mondello Park.  History of Corra Choill  Hurling was introduced to Prosperous in the mid 70s. The team played under the name of Caragh and played their home games at St. Farnans Park. Caragh won its first league title in 1983 and in 1984 won their first Junior championship and were also successful in retaining their league title. The hurling club changed its name to Corra Choill hurling club in the mid 80s. The club won its first Intermediate Championship title as Corra Choill in 1988. Corra Choill moved to the playing pitches of the secondary school in the village in the 90s. The club had considerable underage success in the early 90s with the under 12 team falling to a defeat after a replay against Confey GAA in the Championship and the Under 13 team winning the league. The amalgamation of both clubs was somewhat controversial in Corra Choill. A portion of the club membership at the time was against it and tried to set up a separate club in Prosperous carrying out underage training at the primary school in Prosperous. Some adult and underage players left the club joining Coill Dubh GAA, Ardclough GAA and Clane GAA with some deciding to turn their backs on the game of hurling altogether. Some of those that left the game of hurling did eventually rejoin their new and old √âire √ìg Corra Choill teammates . Camogie in Prosperous and Caragh  It is not certain when camogie was first played in Prosperous. There is little doubt that camogie was played in Kildare soon after the sport was first organised in 1904. Although records are sparse Newbridge, Naas, Blacktrench, Prosperous and Ballymore applied unsuccessfully for affiliation to Kildare GAA board in 1921. Kildare sent delegates to the camogie congress of 1932, and a county board was formed in 1934 with Father Byrne C.C. of Caragh as President. Camogie was reorganised at a county convention in 1954, and has been played in Kildare continuously since. It was introduced to Caragh GAA in 1955. The team played in the colours grey and red. Caragh won the county championship in 1958 but were not able to field a team again until 1962. The Camogie team was reorganised by Betty Garry in 1962. They won the senior league in 1964 and senior championship and league in 1965 and again in 1966. They were defeated in the 1967 camogie county championship by Geraldines 5‚Äì0 to 4‚Äì2. Many of Clane GAA best players joined Prosperous in 1983 resulting in the side lapsing. The history of Camogie in Prosperous from 1967 to 1983 and again to present day is uncertain. But under the name of Prosperous camogie club they won the Championship in 1972, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981. League success was also enjoyed in 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1986. √âire √ìg The club won its First Intermediate in 1960 and enjoyed a great period of dominance in Kildare Senior Hurling Championship spanning from 1964 to 1977 winning 9 of the 11 finals they were in. On two occasions they were denied a five in a row by Ardclough GAA who won the Senior Championship themselves 4 times in the same period (Suncroft denied Ardclough a four in a row in 1974). The club won their second Intermediate championship in 1975. They were to endure a barren spell reaching the Championship final in 1984 and winning but losing in 1987 and 1990 to Coill Dubh on both occasions and again in 1992 this time losing to Castledermot GAA and suffering defeat once more to Coill Dubh in 1993. √âire √ìg Corra ChoillHurling= √âire √ìg Corra Choill won its first Intermediate Championship title in 1996.

It originated in Takeda, Fushimi, Kyoto. Background The song has long been sung by the people in the burakumin areas of Kyoto and Osaka in a slightly different form. During the 1960s, it was picked up as a theme song by the Buraku Liberation League, particularly its branch at Takeda. Burakumin (\\"hamlet people\\") were an outcast community at the bottom of the Japanese social order that had historically been the victims of severe discrimination and ostracism. These communities were often made up of those with occupations considered impure or tainted by death (e.g., executioners, undertakers, workers in slaughterhouses, butchers, or tanners). Professions such as these had severe social stigmas of kegare, or \\"defilement\\", attached to them. A burakumin neighborhood within metropolitan Tokyo was the last to be served by streetcar and is the site of butcher and leather shops to this day. In this lullaby, a young girl comforts herself by singing about her miserable situation. One day, she is forcibly sent away to work for a rich family at a village across the mountain. Every day as she works with a baby on her back, she is reminded of her family, looking at the silhouette of the mountains in the direction of her homeland. =Recordings= In 1969, the folk singing group () made this song popular, and their single, recorded in 1971, became a bestseller. The song has also an additional history in that NHK and other major Japanese broadcasting networks refrained from playing it because it is related to burakumin activities, but this ban was stopped during the 1990s. The song has been translated into Chinese by the Taiwanese lyricist Weng Bingrong () with the name \\"qidao\\" (). The meaning of the lyrics has been changed to being about taking care of everyone instead of the complaints of a babysitter of the Takeda hamlet in the original version. It also became famous in China and Taiwan since it was performed by Dave Wang (Wang Jie) and Wang Yunchan () in 1993 as well as in recordings by Li Pi-hua (ÊùéÁ¢ßËèØ) and Liu Wen- cheng (ÂäâÊñáÊ≠£). In this rendition, it was presented as a Japanese classic (). In 2001, singer Eri Sugai included a version of the song on her album Mai. In 2017, the folk supergroup Bendith included a Welsh language version on their Bendith EP.

Two palaces were built there, one by Esarhaddon for his son and crown prince, Ashurbanipal. Two temples were found at the site, one being the temple of Nergal, constructed by Sennacherib, and added to by Ashurbanipal. One of the gates in the northwest wall of Nineveh was named for Nergal and the road from that gate to Tarbisu was paved completely in stone by Sennacherib.

Its study in Europe dates to the work of Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century AD, which introduced Arabian and Indian ideas to the continent. It has continued to be studied in the modern era. Earliest records A portion of the Rhind papyrus. The earliest recorded use of combinatorial techniques comes from problem 79 of the Rhind papyrus, which dates to the 16th century BCE. The problem concerns a certain geometric series, and has similarities to Fibonacci's problem of counting the number of compositions of 1s and 2s that sum to a given total. In Greece, Plutarch wrote that Xenocrates of Chalcedon (396‚Äì314 BC) discovered the number of different syllables possible in the Greek language. This would have been the first attempt on record to solve a difficult problem in permutations and combinations. The claim, however, is implausible: this is one of the few mentions of combinatorics in Greece, and the number they found, 1.002 √ó 10 12, seems too round to be more than a guess. The Bhagavati Sutra had the first mention of a combinatorics problem; the problem asked how many possible combinations of tastes were possible from selecting tastes in ones, twos, threes, etc. from a selection of six different tastes (sweet, pungent, astringent, sour, salt, and bitter). The Bhagavati is also the first text to mention the choose function. In the second century BC, Pingala included an enumeration problem in the Chanda Sutra (also Chandahsutra) which asked how many ways a six-syllable meter could be made from short and long notes. Pingala found the number of meters that had n long notes and k short notes; this is equivalent to finding the binomial coefficients. The ideas of the Bhagavati were generalized by the Indian mathematician Mahavira in 850 AD, and Pingala's work on prosody was expanded by BhƒÅskara II and Hemacandra in 1100 AD. Bhaskara was the first known person to find the generalised choice function, although Brahmagupta may have known earlier. Hemacandra asked how many meters existed of a certain length if a long note was considered to be twice as long as a short note, which is equivalent to finding the Fibonacci numbers. hexagram The ancient Chinese book of divination I Ching describes a hexagram as a permutation with repetitions of six lines where each line can be one of two states: solid or dashed. In describing hexagrams in this fashion they determine that there are 2^6=64 possible hexagrams. A Chinese monk also may have counted the number of configurations to a game similar to Go around 700 AD. Although China had relatively few advancements in enumerative combinatorics, around 100 AD they solved the Lo Shu Square which is the combinatorial design problem of the normal magic square of order three. Magic squares remained an interest of China, and they began to generalize their original 3\\\\times3 square between 900 and 1300 AD. China corresponded with the Middle East about this problem in the 13th century. The Middle East also learned about binomial coefficients from Indian work and found the connection to polynomial expansion. The work of Hindus influenced Arabs as seen in the work of al-Khalil ibn Ahmad who considered the possible arrangements of letters to form syllables. His calculations show an understanding of permutations and combinations. In a passage from the work of Arab mathematician Umar al-Khayyami that dates to around 1100, it is corroborated that the Hindus had knowledge of binomial coefficients, but also that their methods reached the middle east. In Greece, Plutarch wrote that Xenocrates discovered the number of different syllables possible in the Greek language. While unlikely, this is one of the few mentions of Combinatorics in Greece. The number they found, 1.002 √ó 10 12, also seems too round to be more than a guess. Ab≈´ Bakr ibn Mu·∏•ammad ibn al ·∏§usayn Al-Karaji (c.953-1029) wrote on the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle. In a now lost work known only from subsequent quotation by al-Samaw'al, Al-Karaji introduced the idea of argument by mathematical induction. The philosopher and astronomer Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (c. 1140) counted the permutations with repetitions in vocalization of Divine Name.The short commentary on Exodus 3:13 He also established the symmetry of binomial coefficients, while a closed formula was obtained later by the talmudist and mathematician Levi ben Gerson (better known as Gersonides), in 1321.History of Combinatorics, chapter in a textbook. The arithmetical triangle‚Äî a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients‚Äî was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century, and would eventually become known as Pascal's triangle. Later, in Medieval England, campanology provided examples of what is now known as Hamiltonian cycles in certain Cayley graphs on permutations. Arthur T. White, ‚ÄùRinging the Cosets,‚Äù Amer. Math. Monthly 94 (1987), no. 8, 721-746; Arthur T. White, ‚ÄùFabian Stedman: The First Group Theorist?,‚Äù Amer. Math. Monthly 103 (1996), no. 9, 771-778. Combinatorics in the West Combinatorics came to Europe in the 13th century through mathematicians Leonardo Fibonacci and Jordanus de Nemore. Fibonacci's Liber Abaci introduced many of the Arabian and Indian ideas to Europe, including that of the Fibonacci numbers. Jordanus was the first person to arrange the binomial coefficients in a triangle, as he did in proposition 70 of De Arithmetica. This was also done in the Middle East in 1265, and China around 1300. Today, this triangle is known as Pascal's triangle. Pascal's contribution to the triangle that bears his name comes from his work on formal proofs about it, and the connections he made between Pascal's triangle and probability. From a letter Leibniz sent to Daniel Bernoulli we learn that Leibniz was formally studying the mathematical theory of partitions in the 17th century, although no formal work was published. Together with Leibniz, Pascal published De Arte Combinatoria in 1666 which was reprinted later.Leibniz's habilitation thesis De Arte Combinatoria was published as a book in 1666 and reprinted later Pascal and Leibniz are considered the founders of modern combinatorics. Both Pascal and Leibniz understood that the binomial expansion was equivalent to the choice function. The notion that algebra and combinatorics corresponded was expanded by De Moivre, who found the expansion of a multinomial. De Moivre also found the formula for derangements using the principle of principle of inclusion-exclusion, a method different from Nikolaus Bernoulli, who had found it previously. De Moivre also managed to approximate the binomial coefficients and factorial, and found a closed form for the Fibonacci numbers by inventing generating functions. In the 18th century, Euler worked on problems of combinatorics, and several problems of probability which are linked to combinatorics. Problems Euler worked on include the Knights tour, Graeco-Latin square, Eulerian numbers, and others. To solve the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem he invented graph theory, which also led to the formation of topology. Finally, he broke ground with partitions by the use of generating functions. Contemporary combinatorics In the 19th century, the subject of partially ordered sets and lattice theory originated in the work of Dedekind, Peirce, and Schr√∂der. However, it was Garrett Birkhoff's seminal work in his book Lattice Theory published in 1967, and the work of John von Neumann that truly established the subjects. In the 1930s, Hall (1936) and Weisner (1935) independently stated the general M√∂bius inversion formula. In 1964, Gian-Carlo Rota's On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory I. Theory of M√∂bius Functions introduced poset and lattice theory as theories in Combinatorics. Richard P. Stanley has had a big impact in contemporary combinatorics for his work in matroid theory, for introducing Zeta polynomials, for explicitly defining Eulerian posets, developing the theory of binomial posets along with Rota and Peter Doubilet, and more.

The ruins of the castle (Schloss) can still be visited and viewed, but are under private ownership. Location The ruins of M√ºnchenstein Castle are situated on a long, but narrow rock. There are only slender remains of the walls to be seen, these are directly above the centre of the village. The ruins of the castle (Schloss) can still be visited and viewed, but are under private ownership. History Up until the foundation and the erection of the Castle (Schloss), the small residential colony only had a few houses and was named Geckingen. The first historical records in written form was in 1196 and the colony was named as Kekingen.M√ºnchenstein Homepage The history of M√ºnchenstein Around the year 1260, the up-rising cavalier family M√ºnch acquired the village on the hills adjacent to the river Birs and established their estate there. The exact dates of the castle erection remains unclear, but most likely building began in the time between 1260 and 1270. The founders of the castle on the rock (Stein) were the father and son Hugo II M√ºnch and Hugo III M√ºnch. Then, under Hugo M√ºnch IV, the castle was expanded and extended and a ring wall was built around the village during the following 60 years. The cavalier M√ºnch named themselves henceforth M√ºnch von M√ºnchenstein. After 1279 the village Geckingen was called M√ºnchenstein. The M√ºnchs were not able to keep the village and castle for long as their own property. During 1280 they had to hand over the ownership to the Graf von Pfirt, who then lent it to the M√ºnchs in fief. In March 1324, after the death of the last Graf on Pfirt, Ulrich III, the castle and the village of M√ºnchenstein was inherited by the Herzog of Austria, as heiress Johanna von Pfirt (Jeanne de Ferrette) (1300-1351) was married to Herzog Albrecht II von Habsburg (1298-1358). In the year 1334, the castle was completed and was at its largest. A few years later, the castle was damaged by the Basel earthquake on 18 October 1356, but it was soon restored to its original condition. At this time Konrad VIII (1324-1378), son of Hartmann I M√ºnch von M√ºnchenstein resided in M√ºnchenstein castle. Konrad VIII (called \\"Hape\\") married Katharina, the hereditary daughter from L√∂wenburg, in 1340. Katharina M√ºnch von M√ºnchenstein-L√∂wenberg died in 1371 and Konrad VIII inherited governance of Muttenz and the three fortresses in the district Wartenburg. During the \\"Old Z√ºrich War\\" (Alemannic German: Alte Z√ºrichrieg), just before the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs on 26 August 1444, the Solothurner conquered the castle on 17 June 1444 and they kept it occupied. Not until the year 1469 did the M√ºnchs get their estate back. During 1470, Konrad M√ºnch von M√ºnchenstein had to sell the deeds to the city of Basel, but because he was the city reeve, he was allowed to live there in fief. During the first half of the 15th century, the dynasty of the M√ºnchs began to crumble, and because of the high fiefdom costs, they had to sell the estate to the city. The village and castle were reigned for 283 years by the city of Basel. This reign ended, however, after the French revolution and village and castle were sold to the municipality M√ºnchenstein, who themselves sold (passed on) the properties to the villagers. The castle was also sold and used as a stone quarry to build new houses. See also * List of castles in Switzerland Literature * Werner Meyer: Burgen von A bis Z. Burgenlexikon der Regio.

He owned three farms near Dublin and was involved in moving cattle between the west of Ireland and Dublin. In 1915 he was elected President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Leonard was an early pioneer of the car in Ireland. He suffered a serious accident in 1910 when he was injured by an explosion in an acetylene torch which he was using at his home. He was also injured in another accident at home while using explosives to remove a tree trunk in the grounds of his house. During the 1916 Easter Rising, Leonard, travelling with his son Mark, was told to stop at a road-block by rebels. He refused to do so and was shot at, leading to his son's arm being injured. After independence, Leonard was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin North constituency at the Dublin North by-election on 11 March 1925 caused by the resignation of Francis Cahill of Cumann na nGaedheal.

In the initial phases the services would have been heavy rail mostly along existing alignments. The later phase would have introduced tram-trains to allow street running. The project was backed by all the local authorities through which the system would have run, the authorities are: Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland and Stockton-On-Tees. Support was also forthcoming from the Department for Transport. The project has been cancelled due to lack of funding. Focus is now on Northern Rail franchise. Of the original \\"Tees Valley Metro\\" project, only the construction of a new station at James Cook University Hospital has come to fruition. Route The proposed initial routes would have used sections of the Tees Valley, Esk Valley and Durham Coast Lines. There were no current plans as to the interoperability of the continuing services and the new metro services. This would have been considered at the next stage of the process. Several new stations will be built along the routes in two stages. After stage two additional routes using street running may be considered. Detailed plans The project was planned to be delivered in two phases, with the first phase split into stages. =Phase 1= Initial work was proposed to be complete by December 2012 and would have included: * A reduction in journey time by around 5 minutes between Darlington and Saltburn. * An increase in services from 1‚Äì2 to four trains per hour on the Tees Valley Line between Darlington and Saltburn * Additional platforms at Darlington station on the eastern side of the station to reduce the need for local services to cross the East Coast Main Line. * Possible new platforms at Middlesbrough. * Refurbished Class 156 \\"Sprinters\\" rolling stock. * Relocation of Teesside Airport station to serve Durham Tees Valley Airport better. * A station at Wilton. * A new station at James Cook University Hospital (opened 2014). * Improvements to existing stations at Eaglescliffe, Thornaby and Hartlepool. These improvements were estimated to cost ¬£30 - 40 million. The second stage of Phase 1 was due to be completed in December 2014. *New stations at Teesside Park, Morton Park and Middlehaven. *New rolling stock, Class 172 Turbostar was put forward. *Refurbishment of other stations on Route 1 The cost of these improvements was estimated at ¬£50 - 60 million. =Phase 2= This phase included improvements to the Esk Valley Line between Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough, and on the Durham Coast Line between Middlesbrough and Hartlepool; new stations at Morton Palms, Middlehaven, The Ings and Nunthorpe Parkway were also proposed, and a further reduction in journey times between Darlington and Stockton. Current status This project has been officially shelved by central Government and Tees Valley Unlimited due to lack of and cut funding for the project by Government and lack of interest in the project from Network Rail. Rail services provided by Northern Rail with some work to try and marginally improve journey times is now the plan going forward. The Government, whilst not ensuring, has requested that new franchise holder from 2016 onwards must attempt to refurbish or replace 35 year old Pacer trains currently in use. The project had originally received approval from the Interim Regional Transport Board in September 2008, allowing more detailed plans and a public consultation to go ahead. Construction of the first phase was due to commence in 2010 and would have been completed by the end of 2013. Phase one would cost around ¬£80 million and Network Rail had already committed ¬£40 million for signalling improvements. The second phase would cost a further ¬£140 million and would have been in place by 2018. On 23 July 2009 the project received in-principle funding from the Department for Transport via the Regional Funding Allocation process. Each of the individual components is being treated as an individual project, eligible for fast track funding. Funding was expected for the two new platforms at Darlington, the reopening of platform 3 at Middlesbrough, the relocation of Teesside Airport station to within 350 m of the terminal building, improvements at Eaglescliffe, Thornaby and Hartlepool, including new lifts and footbridges, and the new station at James Cook University Hospital. Reports mentioned a possible new station between Middlesbrough and Redcar Central, proposed as a new station for Wilton International, reopening Grangetown Station or improving and bringing South Bank station fully into use, or relocating Redcar British Steel station As well as the infrastructure improvements the improved rolling stock and increased frequency for trains will be introduced. In 2014, a new railway station at the rear of James Cook University Hospital, was built and opened. Route of proposed 'Tees Valley Metro'. In May 2014, Thornaby Railway Station's ticket office was refurbished and extended.

Origins of the polity The origins of the princedom are intimately connected with the struggle between the Dutch and the Portuguese for mastery of the island. The united Sonbai (Sonba'i, Sonnebay) realm, the traditionally most prestigious polity among the Atoni people of West Timor, allied with the Portuguese in 1649-1655, and then with the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) in 1655-1658. After a series of defeats at the hands of the Portuguese Eurasians or Topasses in 1657-1658, Sonbai broke up in two parts. One group migrated to Kupang where the Dutch had their base, where they formed the Sonbai Kecil princedom. Another group, Sonbai Besar, stayed in the inland of West Timor under Portuguese surveillance.H. H√§gerdal (2007), 'Rebellions or Factionalism? Timorese Forms of Resistance in an Early Colonial Context', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 163-1, p. 18. Traditional rulership The Sonbai Besar congregation was headed by a ruler known to the Europeans as emperor (keizer, emperador). He was also known as Atupas (he who sleeps), Neno Anan (son of heaven) and Liurai (surpassing the earth). The other Atoni rulers related themselves to him in symbolic kinship terms, which was anchored through various origin stories. In accordance with Timorese custom, the ruler was an inactive, in a symbolical sense \\"female\\" (feto) figure. At his side was a \\"male\\" (mone) executive regent of the Kono family, called Uis Kono or Ama Kono. Because of this arrangement, the princedom was often known under the name Amakono. The Uis Kono in particular governed the north-eastern part of the realm, later known as Miomaffo. The central area, Mollo, was governed by co-regents of the Oematan family, and in Fatuleu further to the west a number of lesser lords dominated, among them Takaip. Under the major lords (usif) were the amaf naek (great fathers) who headed various districts, and under them the amaf (fathers) in the various villages.H.G. Schulte Nordholt (1971), The Political System of the Atoni of Timor. The Hague: M. Nijhoff. Defection from the Portuguese The relation between the Topasses and the Sonbai Besar princedom oscillated between cooperation and hostility, and did not entail a colonial rule in the conventional sense. The lords of the princedom delivered sandalwood to the coast where it was picked up by Portuguese and other vessels, and brought to Batavia or Macao. There were large-scale conflicts with the Topasses in 1711-1713 and 1722. In 1748 the Sonbai ruler Alfonso Salema and the Atoni kings of Amfoan and Amanuban rebelled and then fled to the Dutch in Kupang. Alfonso Salema brought with him a large part of his followers. This was a major catalyst for a full-scale confrontation between the VOC post in Kupang and the Topass leader Gaspar da Costa. In the Battle of Penfui in November 1749 the attacking Topass army was crushed by the VOC- affiliated forces of Kupang, and a large part of West Timor fell under Dutch influence.C.R. Boxer (1968), Fidalgos in the Far East 1550-1750. Hong Kong: Oxford University Press, pp. 250-1. Relations with the Dutch The relation between Sonbai Besar and its new Dutch suzerain turned to become conflict- ridden. Alfonso Salema was deposed and exiled by the VOC in 1752 on suspicion of treason, and in 1782 his grandson Alphonsus Adrianus established his authority in the inland independently of the Europeans. After his death in 1802 his son and successor Nai Sobe Sonbai II had great difficulties maintaining his position, and slowly had to assemble power anew under a long and troubled rule (1808-1867). There was an open state of warfare with the Dutch in Kupang in 1847-1850 and 1855-1857, without the colonial authorities being able to come to grips with the emperor. After his decease the Sonbai Besar realm began to dissolve, this time irreversibly. Miomaffo, Mollo and the lordships of Fatuleu made their own contracts with the Dutch colonial authorities. The last emperor, Nai Sobe Sonbai III (r. 1885-1906) was little more than a pretender. After an incident he was pursued and captured by a Dutch troop in early 1906. Nai Sobe Sonbai III was banished to Sumba and later died on Timor in 1922. In modern West Timor he is considered an anti-colonial hero and is honoured with a monument in central Kupang.F.H.

Such structures typically comprise three sections: in-run, a kicker, and a water surface for landing. They permit the practice of new skills with reduced risk, as the impact of a water landing is less dangerous than a comparable impact on compacted snow. History Water ramp training for snow ski aerials became an indispensable professional training tool when Bob Salerno, Frank Bare, Jr., Hans Ribi and Jeff Chumas built a ramp capable of breaking world records in 1978. This first world-class water ramp was built at Nordic Valley ski resort. Bare performed the first recorded double twisting triple back flip and triple twisting triple back flip in 1979 at Nordic Valley, and four years later he was the first to perform a quad flip on snow. As no comparable water ramps existed elsewhere, skiers from all over North America trained at Nordic Valley until an updated structure was completed in Lake Placid, New York in 1987. The state of Utah, in coordination with the US Ski Team, built their water ramp in 1993, in preparation for the 2002 Olympics. Now called the Utah Olympic Park, the facility hosts U.S., Australia and other national ski teams for Freestyles Aerial skiing and Mogul skiing, as well as various snowboarding and Freeskiing athletes. Additional modern water ramps are located at Torreilles France (Frenzy Palace Water Jump ), Mettmenstetten (JumpIn), Switzerland, Stity (Acrobat Park), Czech-Republic, Lac-Beauport, Quebec, Canada, and Minsk, Belarus (see for a full list). This last site in Belarus was completed in 2015 and is one of the first indoor water ramp facilities, allowing year-round training and climate control. Structures and equipment A water ramp is constructed by covering a structurally stable wood or steel frame with a stiff plastic whose surface is comparable to a hairbrush; skiers and snowboarders slide down this surface, which is denominated an \\"in-run\\". Users have nicknamed this section the green or white \\"meanies\\" for its ability to leave a \\"road rash\\" on anyone who falls on it. The sliding surface is regularly watered down by sprinklers or hoses to allow skis and snowboards to slide with reduced friction and limit dry spots. At the end of the in-run is the \\"kicker\\", an upward curve to permit the jumping necessary for the relevant sports. Pools built specifically for water ramps are larger than Olympic size to accommodate the different distances that athletes travel forward of the ramp. Heating is not provided, as aerialists need them only during the warmer months, because actual snow ramps can be used during winter. Participants typically wear wetsuits, dry suits, gloves, lifejackets, and helmets. The danger of hard landings on water can be reduced by aerating the water surface to create bubbles as large as , softening landings and lowering injuries. Additionally, these bubbles serve as a reference point for the athletes to help keep them oriented when performing acrobatics. Skis are typically reinforced to lengthen their life, but water impacts will invariably break or delaminate even reinforced skis. Most recently holes or slits have been placed on waterramp aerial skis to further reduce the impact on the athlete's body. Dangers As a training tool, the water ramp can be invaluable to preventing injuries on snow, but dangerous in itself. Novices typically fear falling on the in-run, and they are frequently unprepared for the compression that occurs at the end of the in-run and the beginning of the kicker. Awkward landings from high jumps can render skiers unconscious, making the presence of a lifeguard mandatory. Although the pool's bubbles do reduce impacts injuries to arms, legs, and backs can occur. More commonly for jumpers landing long or short in rotation, have their wind knocked out. For advanced athletes traveling faster on the double and triple kickers, the most dangerous part is at the take off. If the skier were to catch an edge on the final few meters of the ski surface they are particularly vulnerable and can hit their backs or heads on the jump creating tremendous impact. Fortunately these events are rare and can be mitigated by proper installation and frequent inspection of the kicker's ski surface. Further reading *Bennett, Jeff, et al. The Complete Snowboarder.

The argument is that a newly programmed general-purpose digital computer is a \\"new\\" machine and, accordingly, properly the subject of a US patent.The case most often cited for the argument is In re Bernhart, 417 F.2d 1395, 1400 (CCPA 1969), but a slightly earlier formulation of the argument occurs in In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1403 n.29 (CCPA 1969). Detail of player piano roll being operated by player piano, turning player piano into a \\"new and different machine\\" This legal argument was made in Gottschalk v. Benson in Benson's brief. The government then responded in its brief that this amounted to asserting that inserting a new piano roll into an existing player piano converted the old player piano into a new player piano.For a discussion of the use of the Old Piano Roll Blues in Benson and subsequent cases, see, for example, Chapter 8: Patent Protection of Software: Statutory Subject Matter in the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit; A. The Supreme Court Trilogy on Statutory Subject Matter, George Washington Law School. A discussion of the history and current status of the piano roll blues is found in Richard H. Stern, Alice v CLS Bank: US Business Method and Software Patents Marching towards Oblivion?, [2014] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 619, 620. After Benson, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals took the position that the reasoning of Benson did not apply to \\"machine\\" claims, such as a claim to a conventional digital computer programmed to carry out a new algorithm or computer program.In re Johnston, 502 F.2d 765 (CCPA 1974), reversed on obviousness grounds sub. nom. Dann v. Johnston, 450 U.S. 175 (1976). In dissenting from that judgment on the grounds that the Supreme Court in Benson did not limit the principle to method claims, Judge Rich spoke of \\"the legal doctrine that a new program makes an old general purpose digital computer into a new and different machine.\\" Id. at 773. He observed that the doctrine \\"partakes of the nature of a legal fiction when it comes to drafting claims.\\" Id. The argument appeared again two decades later in the majority opinion in In re Alappat,In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (\\"We have held that [] programming creates a new machine, because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software.\\"). and in his dissenting opinion in that case Chief Judge Archer discussed the figure of speech extensively, concluding: > Yet a player piano playing Chopin's scales does not become a \\"new machine\\" > when it spins a roll to play Brahms' lullaby. The distinction between the > piano before and after different rolls are inserted resides not in the > piano's changing quality as a \\"machine\\" but only in the changing melodies > being played by the one machine. The only invention by the creator of a roll > that is new because of its music is the new music.Judge Archer also said > that in making this argument the majority opinion \\"resurrects long-dead > precedent of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in direct conflict with > Supreme Court precedent and subsequent precedent of that court.\\" Despite a strong indication in the Supreme Court's Gottschalk v. Benson opinion that computer implementation of an otherwise patent-ineligible abstract idea (in that case a mathematical algorithm) was insufficient to transform the idea into patent-eligible subject matter, the Federal Circuit continued sporadically to assert the piano roll blues argument.See, e.g., In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc). A very recent example was in a dissenting opinion of Chief Judge Rader in 2013.CLS Bank Int'l v. Alice Corp., 717 F.3d 1269, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (opinion of Rader, J., concurring). The Supreme Court's opinion in the Alice caseAlice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 573 U.S. __ (2014). may have finally put a stop to the piano roll blues argument, since it states that simply saying \\"apply it with a computer\\" will not transform a patent-ineligible claim to an idea into a patent-eligible claim.Alice, slip opinion. at 10 (\\"We conclude that the method claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\\"), 13 (\\"These cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\\"). The expression apparently derives from a song popular in the 1950s‚Äî\\"The Old Piano Roll Blues\\" by Cy CobenMusic, Words, Sung (by Al Jolson). ‚Äî in the style of a Scott Joplin rag. As Judge Archer points out in his Alappat dissent, there is also an allusion to the decision of the Supreme Court in White-Smith v. Apollo, concerning copyright protection for piano rolls.

History  Kay S√∂hl and keyboardists Volker S√∂hl and Matthias Harder founded the band Temporal Temptation in 1990. That summer, the eventual founders of Sylvan first played live ‚Äî mostly hard rock sung in German, with only a little progressive rock. In Autumn 1990, the band changed its name to Chameleon as a symbol of changeability. The album artwork resembled early Marillion covers and it was never issued. In Summer 1991, Marko Heisig joined Chameleon as the lead singer and bassist. Between 1992 and 1994, their music turned gloomy and aggressive. In 1992, the first official demo tape of Chameleon was released. With Matthias Koops as lead singer, the second official demo tape was recorded. The title was Slaves and its track list was Time, Slaves, Mirror of a Lifetime, and Childhood Dreams. In 1995, guest musician Marco Gl√ºhmann joined the band, and a third and final demo tape was recorded. The track list was Beren and Luthien, Golden Cage, and Outro. All of these songs later appeared on the Deliverance album in some way. In 1997 the last live concert took place under the name Chameleon. The band then changed its name to Sylvan. Deliverance was recorded in 1998 and a second CD, Encounters, was released in 2000. Sylvan had utilized several bassists, but, in Spring 2000, Sebastian Harnack filled the role permanently. After releasing Encounters, the band toured in Germany and at several festivals in Europe and even in Mexico. Another highlight was the performance of Encounters / Das Rockballet together with the \\"New Dance Project\\". In October 2002, Sylvan released a third album, Artificial Paradise. Sylvan's fourth album, X-Rayed, sounds rougher and darker, another concept album, with each song telling a story of people coping with an emotional situation. The 2004 tour throughout Germany and Europe featured an appearance at the Rites of Spring Festival in Pennsylvania, USA, and the support of Marillion in Cologne. Sylvan then produced two albums, both released in April 2006. Posthumous Silence tells of a father who reads the diary of his apparently dead daughter and learns of her desperation. Presets had shorter and catchier songs with the intention to make Sylvan's music known to a wider range of rock fans. Shortly after finishing this work, founder and guitarist Kay S√∂hl left the band. He was replaced at the end of 2007 by Jan Petersen, who had been a guest guitarist during the Posthumous Silence live show.

Rabbitt was born in St. Louis and graduated from Christian Brothers College High School, a local Catholic school. He earned a B.S. in political science and an LL.B. from St. Louis University in Missouri and began to practice law in St. Louis. He married and had six children.American Legislative Leaders in the Midwest, 1911-1994 by Nancy Weatherly Sharp, James Sharp Roger, Gina Petonito, Kevin G. Atwater, Charles F. Ritter, Jon L. Wakelyn; Greenwood Press, 1997 Richard Rabbitt was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1960 and remained a member of the House until 1976. He served as majority floor leader from 1967 through 1972, when he became Speaker of the House. He remained Speaker until he resigned in 1976 to campaign as a candidate for Missouri Lieutenant Governor which he narrowly lost to Bill Phelps. Rabbitt's responsibilities as majority floor leader included establishing the time of meeting and order of business of the House of Representatives. As Speaker, Rabbitt presided over the house- assembly, appointed all the members of all committees, including the chairmen of the committees, assigned all bills to committees, and performed other miscellaneous duties. Fraud and Bribery Conviction In 1977, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri delivered a verdict which convicted Richard Rabbitt on eleven counts of violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1341 (1976), and four counts in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1951 (1976). Upon appeal in 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and dismissed 11 counts, but sustained one count of mail fraud and three of extortion. The four counts that were upheld were based on 2 factual charges: (1) that Rabbitt had requested indirect payment of $20,000 from an automobile dealers association in return for favorable treatment of legislation and (2) that Rabbitt had threatened to give unfavorable treatment to a bill addressing the trucking industry unless he received legal business. In his defense, with respect to the first charge, Rabbitt asserted that John Connaghan was the party that had actually received payment from the automobile dealers association and that Rabbitt had only received referrals fees from John Connaghan for cases referred to him. The court, however, decided that there was sufficient evidence to deliver a verdict finding that fees paid to Connaghan had then been paid over to Rabbitt.United States of America, Appellee, v.

The first wave of immigrants, mainly from Central and Eastern Europe, brought skills needed in the creation of the new state. Later groups to arrive were Armenian refugees, White Russians, and foreign students. Since the fall of Communism and Bulgaria's entry to the European Union, immigration has increased, with many arriving legally or illegally from less developed countries, and since 2011 the country has been on a migration route used by Syrian refugees. Late 19th century Following the Berlin Congress, the Russian Empire was forced to withdraw its troops from Bulgaria but left a large number of specialists and functionaries who assisted the formation of the Bulgarian army and state institutions. These included Russian officers and generals, such as general Leonid Sobolev, Bulgaria's prime minister 1882‚Äì1883, general Alexander Golovin, and functionaries like Sofia's first mayor Piotr Alabin. Almost all of them left Bulgaria after the break-up of relations with Russia in 1886. With the formation of the Principality of Bulgaria in 1878, foreign specialists, entrepreneurs, teachers, workers, and missionaries started arriving in Bulgaria and assisted the building of the new country after five centuries of foreign rule. They were notably from Austria-Hungary and Russia, as well as from Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, the US and other European nations, who assisted in the modernisation of all aspects of life in the new Bulgarian state. Notable ethnic groups among them were the Czechs and Slovaks, such as Konstantin Josef Jireƒçek, Hermann ≈†korpil, Karel ≈†korpil, Ji≈ô√≠ Pro≈°ek, Ivan Mrkviƒçka, Jaroslav Vƒõ≈°√≠n. Among the temporary or permanent settlers were ethnic Jews, Germans and Austrians, Hungarians, Serbs and Montenegrins (settled in a few villages in northeastern Bulgaria), Croats, Slovenes, Poles, Ukrainians and Rusyns, and others. Czechs, Slovaks, Rusyns and Germans of Protestant and Catholic denomination from Austria-Hungary founded or settled in villages in northern Bulgaria, such as Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province, Martvitsa (Slovak M≈ïtvica, now Podem), Gorna Mitropolia, Brashlyanitsa. The relative freedom of religion allowed Catholic workers and missionaries and Protestant missionaries, mostly from the United States and Great Britain, to establish missions and live for shorter or longer periods in Bulgaria. The first larger compact group of non-Bulgarian immigrants in contemporary Bulgarian history to settle in the country were the Armenian refugees fleeing the persecutions in the Ottoman Empire. Their settlement started in the 1890s and expanded during the time of the Armenian genocide. 20th century A large wave of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and other nationals of the Russian Empire settled temporarily or permanently in Bulgaria following the demise of Wrangel's army in Crimea in 1920. A smaller wave of new immigrants arrived in Bulgaria during the socialist regime (1944‚Äì1989), when large numbers of foreign students came to study in Bulgarian universities and many of them remained. Most of them married Bulgarian nationals and settled in the country. Also at that time, many Bulgarians married citizens of the then Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The fall of communism at the end of 1989 saw greater migration to Bulgaria, when large groups of Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Ukrainians, Turks, Vietnamese, Albanians, a number of Armenians from Armenia, some Africans, and an increasing number of EU nationals established themselves permanently in Bulgaria. 21st century The country's accession to the EU on January 1, 2007 has not yet led to a significant rise in immigrants, although there is a growth in the number of refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, Sub-Saharan Africa, Armenia and some Christian Palestinians. The slow procedures of granting asylum and refugee status, the low living standard compared to the EU average and the postponement of entry to the Schengen area contribute to the low number of refugees and asylum seekers. The recent decade saw a growth of private businesses opened by citizens of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, China, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the countries in the Middle East, notably Syria and Lebanon. Also during the last decade, Russian, Ukrainian, EU and US citizens purchased holiday properties along the Black sea coast, as well as in the interior. According to official data, the number of permanent foreign residents in Bulgaria as at 31.12.2008 is 66,806 and the vast majority of these come from Russia (21,309), Ukraine (5,350), the Republic of North Macedonia (4,375), Turkey (3,828) and Moldova (2.203). This number does not include immigrants who have already obtained Bulgarian citizenship or illegal immigrants. The number of immigrants in Bulgaria was expected to grow as a result of the accession of Bulgaria in the European Union in 2007. The number of people that were born outside Bulgaria pass from 21,510 in 1990 to 153,853 in 2017. Since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the number of Syrian refugees in Bulgaria grew. Together with the Syrian refugee families, many illegal migrants, mainly males, from countries like Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq entered illegally through the Bulgarian-Turkish border. In 2014 the Bulgarian government started to build a fence at the Bulgarian-Turkish border, which was completed in the year 2017.

It is a fictional story of the life of Miranda Wells and her marriage to Nicholas Van Ryn, set against an historical background of the Patroon system, Anti-Rent Wars, the Astor Place Riots, and steamboat racing on the Hudson River. The book focuses on Miranda Wells: her longing for her rich cousin Nicholas Van Ryn, her eventual marriage to him, and ultimate discovery of her husband's dark and twisted actions. The novel was subsequently adapted into a film called Dragonwyck, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and starring Gene Tierney, Walter Huston, Vincent Price, and Glenn Langan. Plot summary The story begins in May 1844 with Miranda Wells, the daughter of a humble farmer in Greenwich, Connecticut. Miranda's mother receives a letter from Nicholas Van Ryn, a rich relative and Patroon of a large manor called Dragonwyck near Hudson, New York. In the letter Van Ryn invites one of the Wells girls to Dragonwyck, to act as company for his daughter Katrine. After initial doubts, Miranda's parents allow her to go to Dragonwyck where she is instantly attracted to and intrigued by her rich, mysterious relative, Nicholas. Not everyone welcomes Miranda to Dragonwyck. Nicholas' corpulent and lazy wife, Johanna, sees Miranda as a threat, and tries to keep her from her husband. Soon, Miranda encounters Doctor Jeff Turner, a skilled physician and a passionate anti-renter who believes that rich Patroons, like the Van Ryns, should give up their large estates. Van Ryn and Turner instantly dislike each other, and because of his views, Miranda is baffled when Nicholas asks the doctor to attend to his wife, who has a cold. However, while Dr. Turner is at Dragonwyck, Johanna becomes violently ill and dies. As Dr. Turner leaves, wondering what caused such a sudden death, Nicholas asks Miranda to marry him. She accepts. Married life to Nicholas Van Ryn is far from what Miranda imagined. As the story moves on, Nicholas's true mental state and his thirst for power become evident. After their newborn son dies, the relationship between Miranda and her husband withers, and the bonds between Miranda and Dr. Turner strengthen. Miranda and Dr. Turner eventually discover that Nicholas poisoned his first wife, Johanna, with oleander. They confront him then try to escape, but Nicholas catches up with Miranda on a steamboat traveling down the Hudson River. The steamboat gets caught up in a race, catches fire, and crashes. Miranda is rescued by Nicholas, but he dies trying to save other passengers from the steamboat. After the ordeal, Miranda and Dr. Turner marry, leaving the Hudson Valley area forever, for a new life in California.  Other editions  Philippa Gregory wrote the foreword to the 2005 edition.

He defended Florida from an attack by British forces in 1740 and launched his own unsuccessful Invasion of Georgia during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Early life Montiano was born in the city of Bilbao, in the Basque Country of northern Spain. He was a relative of Agust√≠n de Montiano, a dramatist and noted historian who founded the Real Academia de la Historia in 1735 and became its first director. While still a young man, Montiano joined the Royal Spanish Army, and served for three years in the Aragon Regiment. From there he was transferred to Dari√©n in Panama. By 1719, he was a captain of grenadiers and was sent to Oran, in what is now Algeria, where he fought in the defence of the city against the Arabs. Governor of Florida On April 29, 1737, Montiano was named Governor of La Florida. Shortly after his taking office he wrote to the Governor of Cuba notifying him of a forthcoming British invasion, and requested supplies to ward off the danger. On March 15, 1738, Governor Montiano established Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mos√©,Aboard the Underground Railroad ‚Äì Fort Mose Site a fortified town for escaped African slaves from the Carolina Colony to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their serving in the militia and professing belief in \\"the True Faith\\", Roman Catholicism.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african- americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-was-americas-1st-black-town/ It became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America as well as a haven for escaped enslaved peoples from all the British colonies to the north. Here the freedmen would cultivate the ground and learn the Catholic religion. However, following the murder of some inhabitants at the fort by British Indian allies, Montiano ordered it abandoned and its inhabitants resettled in St. Augustine.Berlin, Ira. Many Thousands Gone, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 1998. p. 76 =War of Jenkins' Ear= Tensions between Great Britain and Spain had been on the rise for years, and on October 30, 1739 Great Britain declared war on Spain. The War of Jenkins' Ear was fought as part of a larger conflict, the War of Austrian Succession. The name comes from an incident involving one Robert Jenkins‚Äô ear. Jenkins was the captain of the brig Rebecca in 1731. By the Treaty of Seville, Britain was barred from trading with Spain's colonies in the new world. However, smugglers could make a nice profit if they managed to avoid the Spanish coast guard. Jenkins wasn't a skilled enough captain to avoid the guard, so his ship was boarded by Spanish sailors from La Isabela and he was punished by having his ear cut off. This war gave English Georgia, under the command of British General James Oglethorpe, an excuse to attack Spanish Florida in 1740. Spain and England had been disputing ownership of the area in and around Georgia for some time when Oglethorpe brought the first colonists to Savannah, where neither country had established a permanent settlement. =British siege= Castillo de San Marcos As part of the war, Oglethorpe set out from the newly created colony of Georgia and invaded Spanish-held land. After capturing the Spanish outposts of Fort San Diego, Fort Pupo, Fort Picolata and Fort Mose, he marched his troops toward St. Augustine. On June 13, 1740, Oglethorpe began the siege of St. Augustine by blockading the city including the Matanzas Inlet, and the Castillo de San Marcos. Governor Montiano in the meantime had prepared well the defenses of the Castillo and the Spanish colony, by having all the inhabitants of the city take refuge inside the fort, while he held the British at bay. Oglethorpe landed his troops on Anastasia Island across the inlet, where he placed troops and cannon batteries to fire on the city and the Castillo. He hoped that a sustained bombardment and blockade of St. Augustine would cause Montiano to surrender the city and fortress to the British. When asked for surrender, Montiano answered: \\"I will have the pleasure to meet you inside the castle...\\". The English guns fired on the Castillo, but were unable to breach the coquina walls which were at the farthest extent of the British cannon range. A small Spanish vessel managed to get through the blockade by evading the lone British ship guarding the Matanzas Inlet to the south of Anastasia Island and set sail for Havana, Cuba. On July 7, the courier which had been sent to Cuba returned to St. Augustine and told Montiano that six supply ships were at Mosquito Inlet, 68 miles farther down the coast. (Present-day Ponce de Leon Inlet). He also told Montiano that the British had withdrawn the vessel blocking Matanzas Inlet, and the way appeared clear to provision the city. However, an English deserter reported to the Spanish that Oglethorpe planned a night attack during the next six days of unusually high tides, for high water was needed to cross Matanzas Bay and assault the Castillo. Six days passed and no attack came, so Montiano sent five small vessels down the Matanzas River, out the Matanzas Inlet, and on to Mosquito Inlet to fetch the supplies. Just as the boats returned to the Matanzas Inlet, they met two British sloops that were taking soundings. The sloops opened fire and took up the chase. The fighting continued until twilight when the British sloops returned to their squadron. Their withdrawal gave the Spanish flotilla the opening they needed. They promptly entered the Matanzas Inlet, sailed up the river, and safely anchored at St. Augustine, allowing supplies to be brought to the Castillo without opposition. Oglethorpe had captured Fort Mose at the beginning of the war, but Montiano managed to recapture it at daybreak on June 26, after a battle that left 68 dead and 34 taken prisoner. The coquina walls of the Castillo withstood British bombardment without much damage. Fearing the approaching hurricane season, the British fleet decided to sail north for safer waters. With British morale low due to the broken blockade, the defeat of the British forces holding Fort Mose, the onset of hurricane season, a lack of naval support and knowledge that the city was now well-supplied, Oglethorpe raised the siege on July 20, 1740. On the morning of the 38th day of the siege the British withdrew their forces from the area. =Renewed hostilities= Fort Matanzas. Montiano began the construction of Fort Matanzas in the fall of 1740. Coquina stone was quarried at El Pi√±on, a small inlet south of Matanzas. Construction was difficult, for long piles had to be driven into the marsh to support rising stonework. Repeatedly, the British and their Indian allies tried to stop construction. On July 21, 1741, the British moved in to attack the Spanish. Two British ships, the sloop St. Philip and a schooner (a sailing vessel with two or more masts) sighted a Spanish sloop anchored inside the inlet of Matanzas. A Spanish galliot (a shallow-draft vessel propelled mainly by oars), which had gone unnoticed by the British, opened fire from long range but scored no hits. Darkness and fog soon halted the British attack. The next day the British again attacked. At 10 o'clock in the morning the St. Philip, now clear of the fog, moved in on the Spanish sloop. The sloop attempted to move away but ran aground on one of the many sandbars in the area. The British seized the opportunity and opened fire on the stranded ship. Several shots found their mark ‚Äì two Spanish crewmen were killed and two were wounded. The Spanish galliot again saved the day by opening fire on the British ships, preventing them from taking further action. The St. Philip and her accompanying sloop were forced to retreat back to the open sea. If the British had been able to defeat the galliot, they would have destroyed the Fort Matanzas construction. =Georgia invasion= On July 5, 1742, Governor Montiano mounted a counter-offensive with an army of about 5,000 men. He sailed to St. Simons Island, off the Georgia coast, through the firing guns of the British. The British had built two small forts on the island, Fort St. Simons and Fort Frederica. Oglethorpe abandoned Fort St. Simons after the Spanish forces had outflanked him, and retreated to Fort Frederica. Wasting no time, the Spanish took over Fort St. Simons the following day and soon began to scout out their opposition on foot. The two armies came face to face at the Battles of Gully Hole Creek and Bloody Marsh. Early on the morning of Wednesday, July 7, several Spanish scouts advanced northward toward Fort Frederica to assess the landscape and plan their attack. They met a body of British rangers at Gully Hole Creek at approximately nine o'clock, and the two units exchanged shots. Oglethorpe learned of the engagement, mounted a horse, and galloped to the scene, followed by reinforcements. He charged directly into the Spanish line, which scattered when the additional forces arrived. Oglethorpe posted a detachment to defend his position and returned to Frederica to prevent another Spanish landing on the northern coast and to recruit more men. During mid-afternoon of the same day, the Spanish sent more troops into the region, and the British forces fired upon them from behind the heavy cover of brush in the surrounding marshes. This ambush, coupled with mass confusion within the smoke-filled swamp, resulted in another Spanish defeat despite Oglethorpe's absence. This second engagement earned its name the Battle of Bloody Marsh from its location rather than from the number of casualties, which were minimal, especially on the English side. These defeats successfully repulsed the Spanish attempts to retake St. Simons Island. In September 1742, Oglethorpe tried once again to attack St. Augustine. By this time Fort Matanzas was completed and fired its cannon. The British retreated without firing a shot. The next April Oglethorpe returned for one last try. However, heavy surf kept him from approaching the inlet or landing men and arms on the beach. Neither side fired a shot. Governor of Panama In 1748, Montiano was named Governor of Panama, and promoted to Brigadier General and Field Marshal as a reward for his deeds in Florida. Four years later he married Gregoria Josefa Aguiar in Havana, Cuba, who later gave him a son. He remained Governor until 1758. At the end of his term as Governor, he was submitted to a residency trial, which found him an innocent and honorable person. Later life In 1759 he moved back to Spain, where he retired and settled in Madrid. He was promoted to Lieutenant General the same year. He died in that city in 1762, and was buried in the church of San Mart√≠n.

This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge.AEC no. UR-38, 1948 Quarterly Technical Report Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. Albert Stevens, the man who survived the highest known accumulated radiation dose in any human, 4-year-old Simeon Shaw sent from Australia to the U.S. for treatment, and Elmer Allen are some of the notable subjects of the Manhattan Project program led by Dr. Joseph Gilbert Hamilton. In Nashville, pregnant women were given radioactive mixtures. In Cincinnati, some 200 patients were irradiated over a period of 15 years. In Chicago, 102 people received injections of strontium and caesium solutions. In Massachusetts, 57 developmentally disabled children were fed oatmeal laced with radioactive tracers in an experiment sponsored by MIT and the Quaker Oats Company. In none of these cases were the subjects informed about the nature of the procedures, and thus could not have provided informed consent. In the book these stories are interwoven with details of more well-known radiation experiments and accidents. These include accounts of U.S. soldiers deliberately exposed to nuclear bomb blasts, families who lived downwind from atomic tests, radiation exposure in the Marshall Islands and the Japanese Lucky Dragon trawler caught in the fallout from a massive hydrogen bomb blast in 1954. The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993, when President Bill Clinton ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available records dealing with human radiation experiments. The resulting investigation was undertaken by the president‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, and it uncovered much of the material included in Welsome's book. The committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that \\"wrongs were committed\\" but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them. The final report came out on October 3, 1995, the same day as the verdict in the O.J. Simpson case, when much of the media's attention was directed elsewhere. Jonathan D. Moreno was a senior staff member of the committee. He wrote the 1999 book Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans, which covers some of the same ground as The Plutonium Files.

This laid the foundation for the Wentworth Estate and many of the opulent houses of the sparesly populated area, alongside its proximity to Windsor and Windsor Great Park as the British royal family's wealth and connections expanded enabling them to set up nearby grand homes. He inherited much of his fortune principally via his great-aunt Lydia Challoner and cousin Valentina Aynscombe. Ancestry, early life, education and family life Colonel Challoner was the only son of the Rev. Thomas Bisse (c.1754-d.13 November 1828), of Portnall Park, Virginia Water and Katherine Townsend (d.1815/16) daughter of Anne Smith, a daughter of merchant Robert Smith, of London and Mortlake.

Dr. Thomas Bisse (1675‚Äì1731) preacher at the Rolls Chapel, London, author of The Beauties of Holiness, 1716 and prebend then chancellor of Hereford, and hence was also nephew or son of Philip Bisse, FRS (elected 13 June 1706), Bishop of Hereford. However, his father is more likely to have been Thomas Bisse (d.1766) Drawing master of Christ's Hospital from 1754 to 1766, successor to Alexander Cozens, who mentions a son Thomas, a brother William, niece Joan, and late wife Susanna in his will.Prerogative Court of Canterbury PROB 11/916/349 (Bernard Lens II was also a Christ's Hospital Drawing Master).

He was son of Thomas Bisse of Lullington, Somerset, and grandson of Thomas Bisse, and great-grandson of Dr. Phillip Bisse (c.1540 ‚Äì October 1613) who had been Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford 1561‚Äì65, Archdeacon of Taunton, a benefactor of All Souls and had made the inaugural gift of 2,000 books to Wadham College Library. Their mother, Joyce Giles, died 8 September 1717, aged 80 (Historical Register Chronicle 1714‚Äì1738), via Musgrave). A cousin, Philip Bisse (c.1611‚Äì1642, killed by Irish), a grandson of Dr. Philip Bisse, the Wadham benefactor, was Archdeacon of Cloyne, and possibly he for whom the Bisse arms were registered in Ireland, 25 May 1637. =Half-brother= William Chaloner Bisse (1822‚Äì1849) was the Rev. Thomas Bisse's son by his second wife, Charlotte, whom he married in 1818, a daughter of Charles Price of Knightsbridge. His aunt Elizabeth Price married 24 June 1799 Jonathan Raine (1763‚Äì1831), of Lincoln's Inn and 33 Bedford Row, KC, a Yorkshire born, sometime MP for various Cornish constituencies, and eventually a Welsh judge. Charlotte was left ¬£1,000 per annum, as fixed by my marriage settlement when Thomas Bisse died in 1828. At the same time William was left five shares in the Stafford and Worcester Canal. He became an Ensign in the 73rd Regiment of Foot on 12 March 1841; was promoted to Lieutenant on 5 April 1844; and to Captain on 12 May 1848.

It was formerly considered the only member of the genus Urogale, but that genus was merged into Tupaia when the species was found to nest within the latter genus in a molecular phylogeny. The scientific name commemorates British colonial administrator and zoological collector Alfred Hart Everett. Range and habitat It is found, as its name suggests, in Mindanao, in the Philippines. It lives in rain forest and montane forest. Description It is the heaviest treeshrew, weighing about 355 g, and is terrestrial.Napier JR, Napier PH. (1968) A handbook of living primates. Morphology, ecology and behaviour of nonhuman primates. Academic, London The body is 17‚Äì20 cm, and the tail is 11‚Äì17 cm. It has a particularly elongated snout and a rounded, even-haired tail. The fur is brownish, but with orange or yellow underparts. It is diurnal in its habits, and it climbs well and runs fast on the ground. Diet Its diet is varied. It includes insects, lizards, young birds, bird's eggs, and fruit. Reproduction In the wild, it is thought to nest on the ground or on cliffs. Their breeding habits have been observed in captivity, where females have produced one or two young after a gestation period of 54‚Äì56 days.

It is made up of five parts, Part I (general provisions), Part II (real rights), Part III (claims), Part IV (relatives), and Part V (inheritance). History The South Korean Civil Code is the largest code among South Korean law. During the period of Japanese rule (1910-1945), Japanese civil code was used, but family law and succession law partially followed Korean customary rules. After the establishment of the South Korean government, the Committee of Law Compilation (Î≤ïÎ•†Ìé∏Ï∞¨ÏúÑÏõêÌöå) proceed to legislate civil code and other codes in 1948 and completed in 1953. The South Korean government supplied the draft to the legislature in 1954, which then passed the civil code into law in 1957 after some amendments, mostly relating to the family law. After it was enacted, the South Korean civil code has been modified seven times. Especially in family law, patriarchal system of family law was abolished in order to achieve the equality of the sexes in 1990. For example, in the area of child custody, both parents came to have equal rights, and the household registration system (Ìò∏Ï£ºÏ†ú, hojuje) was abolished as unconstitutional. ContentsPart 1: general provisions.= General provisions (ÎØºÎ≤ïÏ¥ùÏπô) is a basic principle applying to the substantive law, according to the \\"Pandekten system\\". In the section of source of law, customary law and sound reasoning are also considered as source of law (Article 1). \\"Trust and good faith rule\\" is also stated in article 2. General provisions consists of seven chapters: # Common provisions (source of law) # Persons #* capacity #* domicile #* absence and disappearance # Juristic persons #* incorporation #* organization #* dissolution #* penal provisions # Things # Juristic acts #* general provision #* declaration of intention #* agency #* nullity and voidance #* conditions and time # Period # Extinctive prescription =Part 2: property rights= Property rights (Î¨ºÍ∂åÎ≤ï) are influenced by Roman law and German law, but the \\"right to registered lease on deposit basis\\" (chonsegwon) has the most strong indigenous features. According to article 303, any person having chonsegwon is entitled to use it in conformity with its purposes and to take the profits from it by paying the deposit money and possessing the real property owned by another person. In customary rule, customary superficies, right of grave base are also applied except nine rights written in the real rights part. In real estate, effect of changes in real rights is only valid by registration. This is because the rights and relations of real estate can be clear by the registration which serves the security of real estate contract. Real rights consists of General Provisions (chapters 1 - 3) and Servitude (chapters 4 - 7): # Possessory right # Ownership (limitation of ownership, acquisition of ownership, joint ownership) # Superficies # Right to registered lease on deposit basis, ‚ÄòChonsegwon‚Äô, # Right of retention, # Pledge #* pledge of movables #* pledge of rights # Mortgage =Part 3: claims= Claims (Ï±ÑÍ∂åÎ≤ï) consists of contract, management of affairs, unjust enrichment and tort. Contract part covers formation of contract, offer and acceptance and the kinds of contracts, gift sale and exchange, etc. In tort part, torts and damages are defined. Korean definition of torts is stated in article 750; \\"any person who causes losses to or inflicts injuries on another person by an unlawful act, willfully or negligently shall be bound to make compensation for damages arising therefrom\\". Claims part consists of five chapters: # General provisions #* subject of claim #* effect of claim #* several obliges and obligors #* assignment of claim #* assumption of obligation #* extinction of claim #* debts and payable order #* debts payable to bearer # Contract #* general provisions #* gift #* sale #* effect of sale #* contract of exchange #* loan for consumption #* lease #* contract of employment #* contract for work #* advertisement for prize contest #* mandate #* bailment #* partnership #* life annuity #* compromise # Management of affairs # Unjust enrichment # Torts =Part 4: relatives= In South Korean law, the law on relatives (ÏπúÏ°±Î≤ï) and (ÏÉÅÏÜçÎ≤ï) inheritance law comprise what is usually referred to as \\"family law\\" in legal studies. The law on relatives define marriage, parents and children, adoption, and the like. The Head of family system (Ìò∏Ï£ºÏ†úÎèÑ, hojujedo) which gives benefit to the male member of family influenced the most part of South Korean family law before it was abolished by the Constitutional Court in 2005, because it was found to be against equality of sexes and human dignity. Therefore, in 2005, the modified civil code was enacted. # General provision # Scope of family members and surname and origin of surname of child # Marriage #* matrimonial engagement #* formation of marriage #* nullity and annulment of marriage #* effect of marriage #* divorce # Parents and children #* children of natural parent #* adoption #* parental authority # Guardianship #* duties of guardianship #* termination of guardianship # Family council # Support =Part 5.

He directed surveys of curriculum practices in several school systems, and wrote several books on the subject. Caswell joined the editorial advisory board of the World Book Encyclopedia in 1936, and became its chairman in 1948. In 1954, Caswell was appointed president of Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City, and served as its president until 1962. From 1962 until 1966 Caswell served as general chairman of editorial advisory boards for Field Enterprises Educational Corporation. Following his retirement as president at Teachers College, Caswell continued at the College, being appointed to the Marshall Field, Jr., Professorship of Education. He remained in that chair until 1967.The Presidents of Teachers College Early life and education Caswell was a descendant of Kansas homesteaders. He attended a rural high school in western Kansas and attended Kansas State University for two years before transferring to the University of Nebraska, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1922. Planning to go to law school, he took a temporary job teaching at the high school in Auburn, Nebraska. After he was appointed principal at the age of 21, he gave up his ambition to become a lawyer and devoted his full energies to teaching. After two years in Auburn, he was named superintendent of schools in Syracuse, Nebraska. In 1926 he enrolled in Teachers College, earning a master's degree the following year and a doctorate in 1929. Career in education In 1929, after receiving his Ph.D., Caswell joined the faculty of George Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee; now affiliated with Vanderbilt University, and rose to become a full professor before he returned to Teachers College nine years later to head its department of curriculum and teaching and to direct its division of instruction. He launched several studies of educational systems during this time, publishing his findings (\\"City School Surveys: An Interpretation and Appraisal\\" (1929); \\"Education in Middle School\\" (1942); \\"Program-Making in Small Elementary Schools\\" (1942); \\"American High School: Its Responsibility and Opportunity\\" (1946)). Caswell was a leader in the development of state courses of study in the 1930s, consulting on state curriculum programs in Alabama, Florida, Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kansas. President of Teachers College Caswell served as president of Teachers College from 1954 until 1962. During his presidency the college launched a twenty-year collaboration with schools in Afghanistan, and mounted a volunteer program for teachers to various nations in Africa (the college instituted the Teachers for East Africa program during his tenure). After leaving the presidency, Caswell served until 1967 as the College's Marshall Field Jr. professor of education. Education reform In the years after World War II, Dr. Caswell opposed efforts to develop a standard national curriculum for public schools, arguing instead for more differentiation in teaching methods. He called for strengthening university centers that influence curricula and teacher training. He was frequently outspoken on educational subjects and did not shun controversy. The provocative subject of his 1952 address as the annual installment of the Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture series was \\"The Great Reappraisal of Public Education\\".[ieeexplore.ieee.org \\"The Great Reappraisal of Public Education\\", H. L. Caswell of Columbia university gives 24th Steinmetz Memorial Lecture, IEEE News, May 24, 1952] In 1958, in a speech at a conference in Albany, he welcomed citizen interest in schools but opposed participation by people who were not educators in planning curricula: :What should be taught in American history should not be left up to historians and not to citizens' committees. Caswell also disputed campaigns to do away with some of the so-called frills in education, contending, for example, that driver training was worthwhile because it cut accidents and that the draft in World War II showed the nation that physical education was not a frill either. In the two decades before his retirement Caswell was a principal editorial adviser to World Book Encyclopedia, published by Field Enterprises. He also was a consultant to many state education departments and municipal school systems and held a number of high positions in national educational organizations, including the National Education Association and the American Council on Education.

He served as Horatio Nelson's personal chaplain at the Battle of Trafalgar, and had previously served as his private secretary. Scott was a close friend of Nelson, and was with him as he died aboard . Early life Scott was born on 23 July 1768, the son of Jane Comyn and Robert Scott, a lieutenant in the navy. He had two sisters. He was the nephew of Alexander Scott, a naval captain. Scott's father died in 1770, leading Scott to live with his uncle for the majority of his childhood. He was educated at Charterhouse, and after gaining a scholarship, he attended St John's College, Cambridge, graduating from there in 1792. He was ordained in 1793 and joined the navy that year as a chaplain. He was initially assigned to , which was part of the Mediterranean fleet under Admiral Samuel Hood. During his education he had become fluent in French, Spanish and Italian. Meeting Nelson Scott first met Nelson while in the Mediterranean. Nelson was at this time captain of the 64-gun . Scott was offered the position of Nelson's chaplain, but declined it, instead moving aboard the 98-gun , followed by the 100-gun , then under Sir Hyde Parker. He was present at Nelson's victory at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, this time aboard the 98-gun . After the battle was over, Scott helped to draw up the treaties subsequently presented to the Danish, and accompanied Nelson's party as an interpreter. After Parker's recall, Nelson asked for Scott to join him, but Scott could not bear to leave Parker and returned to England with him while Nelson remained in the Baltic. West Indies Scott was then assigned to the frigate which was sent to the West Indies, serving with Admiral John Thomas Duckworth. Duckworth used Scott's linguistic abilities to help in translating documents and to spy and eavesdrop whilst visiting foreign ports. On one occasion he brought Scott to dine with him and the French general Charles Leclerc, in order to try to ascertain the French intentions towards the Caribbean. In 1803, whilst aboard the Topaze, Scott was the victim of an accident that left him severely shaken. He was struck by lightning while sleeping in his cabin, the bolt also igniting some powder and cartridges that were stored above him. The explosion and electric shock knocked out several teeth, injured his jaw and affected his hearing and eyesight. He recovered, but was continually thereafter affected by his nerves. Nelson and Trafalgar Nelson arranged for Scott to be transferred to his flagship, , in 1804 as his foreign secretary. He had decided that Scott's gift for languages would make him a desirable addition to his staff. Also aboard the Victory was another man named Scott, this was John Scott, Nelson's personal secretary. Nelson solved the problem by terming Alexander Scott, now installed as his chaplain, as 'Doctor Scott'. Scott was not actually a Doctor at this point, the award of the Doctorate of Divinity from the University of Cambridge came after Trafalgar. Scott often spent his time aboard Victory reading newspapers and letters captured from foreign prizes to Nelson. Scott is prominently depicted in Arthur William Devis's The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805. Scott is to the immediate left of Nelson in the picture, rubbing Nelson's chest to relieve his pain. Scott initially went below at the start of the battle to be with the wounded as they were brought to the cockpit. He soon became overwhelmed with the sights and sounds, and began to head up to the deck for fresh air. On the way he passed a figure being carried below to the surgeon, and learnt that it was Nelson. He remained with Nelson during his last hours, supporting him and rubbing his chest. After Nelson had died and the surgeon, William Beatty was summoned, Scott was found to be still rubbing the chest. He accompanied the body back to England, was with Nelson during the lying in state at Greenwich Hospital and attended the funeral processions and the ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral. He later wrote of his friend: > Men are not always themselves and put on their behaviour with their clothes, > but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually > with him in his cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I > could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I > have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, > I am quite like a child. Nelson had hoped that if he were to die, that George Rose, then Vice-President of the Board of Trade, would help Scott with money. He also wished for his brother William Nelson to surrender his prebendal stall at Canterbury Cathedral to Scott, when William Nelson inherited. William however declined to. After Trafalgar Scott lived a peaceful life after the battle although he suffered from painful illness in later life. He became Chaplain to the Prince Regent in 1816 and then the incumbent of a government living at Catterick. In 1807, the 39-year-old Scott attracted his family's displeasure by eloping to marry the 17-year-old Mary Frances Ryder.Life of Rev Alexander John Scott The newly-weds moved into the vicarage at [Burnham on Crouch] where Scott assumed the curacy to supplement his income as Rector of nearby Southminster. They had a son who died shortly after birth named George, and two daughters, Horatia and Margaret. Mary died in 1811, having been weakened by the birth of their son. Scott's daughter Margaret became a best selling author under her married name of Margaret Gatty.Margaret Gatty She authored a memoir about his life Recollections of the Life of the Rev. A. J. Scott. He died at Ecclesfield, Yorkshire on 24 July 1840 at the age of 72, and was buried in the churchyard of the Church of St. Mary, Ecclesfield Scott was a collateral forebear of the Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott.Scott of the Antarctic, Reginald Pound, Coward-McCann Inc.

The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation is a British cancer research charity which raises money to fund the early detection and treatment of cancer, and clinical trials of anti-cancer drugs. Based in the North East of England, the Foundation was launched on 25 March 2008 in the name of Sir Bobby Robson, himself a cancer sufferer five times since 1992, and who died of the disease on 31 July 2009.  Activities  The initial goal of the Foundation was to raise ¬£500,000 to fund equipment for a cancer research centre being built in the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, to be named The Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre. Once this was secure, the Foundation would turn its attention to funding other cancer related projects in the North East of England. The Foundation raised ¬£260,000 in just over two weeks. By November 2008 it had raised over ¬£1 million, double the initial funding target of ¬£500,000 set in February, which itself was passed in just eight weeks. By 15 October 2009, just over 6 weeks after Sir Bobby's death and nearly 19 months after its launch, the charity had raised over ¬£2 million. It passed the ¬£2.5m mark in September 2010. The Foundation had its origins in a wish by Sir Bobby on the eve of his 75th birthday to leave behind a legacy for future cancer victims in the North East and give something back to the NHS in return for the care he had received in his own battles against cancer. In February 2007 Robson had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and had begun chemotherapy treatment to keep it under control. Robson had initially been reluctant to use his name to raise money, but did so invoking the Geordie idiom, \\"Shy bairns (children) get nothing\\". The foundation is a UK registered charity, and is based in Swalwell village, Tyne and Wear. The Foundation operates in an area stretching north to Northumbria, south to Sunderland, and west to Cumbria, and supports the activities of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The Foundation is registered with the Charity Commission as the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Charity The idea for the foundation came about after Sir Bobby was told by his doctor that an upcoming NHS cancer research centre had no funds in place for equipment. This centre was the Early Cancer Trials Unit in the Northern Centre for Cancer Care (NCCC), one of the largest cancer centres in the United Kingdom. The unit was to be part of the consolidation of the NCCC into a new ¬£80 million centre being built at the Freeman Hospital. Parts of the new NCCC site opened in October 2008, and it was due to be fully open by early 2009. The 28 December 2008 football match at St James' Park between Newcastle United and Liverpool was designated the Sir Bobby Robson day by the Newcastle United Supporters Club, celebrating the man and raising funds for the foundation. The Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre part of the NCCC was opened on 20 February 2008, staffed by academics from Newcastle University, and medics from the NHS Trust. Robson opened the centre two days after his 76th birthday, with a surprise 15-minute speech, having been expected to attend the ceremony but not speak. In front of guests including Fabio Capello, Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley, Robson vowed to carry on fundraising. By the time of the research centre's opening, the Foundation had raised ¬£1.2m. In addition to equipping the research centre, further fundraising by the Foundation had enabled the funding of two 3-year training posts to be supported by the centre, one being a research nursing position, and the other a fellowship doctor post. The Foundation has also funded other projects. This has included the commitment to purchase a Biomarker Generator, an ultra-compact cyclotron from Tennessee- based ABT Molecular Imaging. The first of its kind in Europe and second in the world, it was to be housed in a new clean-room facility built in the School of Chemistry at Newcastle University. It has also raised money for relevant equipment and building works at the Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital. On 24 January 2009 it was announced the famous Italia '90 World Cup semi-final loss against West Germany, in which Robson's England team were beaten 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw, would be replayed as the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match in aid of the Foundation. It was held on 26 July at St James' Park, and would feature players from the original World Cup squads and other special guests, with the winning team being awarded the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy. Sir Bobby died on 31 July 2009, shortly after attending the tribute match. At the time of his death, the Foundation had raised ¬£1.6m. Donations totalling ¬£156,000 were received by the Foundation in the 18 days following his death. The Foundation benefited from special commemorative kits and scarves produced for the Championship match between Newcastle United F.C. and Ipswich Town F.C., two of Sir Bobby's former clubs, held on 26 September 2009 at Ipswich's Portman Road ground. After the game, which Newcastle won 4-0, the shirts were signed by the players and auctioned individually on eBay. The auction raised ¬£31,187 for the Foundation, who pledged it to the building of a teenage cancer unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary. On 15 October 2009, coinciding with the Foundation reaching the ¬£2m mark, it was announced that Alan Shearer was to be the Foundation's new patron, after being asked by Sir Bobby's family to carry on his work. This was followed with the appointment of three further patrons during 2010. Steve Gibson, chairman of Middlesbrough F.C., Mick Mills, Robson's former captain at Ispwich Town F.C., and Niall Quinn, chairman of Sunderland F.C.. In November 2009 the Foundation was to launch a DVD titled a 'Knight To Remember', profiling Sir Bobby's life, including his last interviews and contributions from friends, family, and the world of football, with 75% of proceeds going to the Foundation. The DVD was to feature a version of Blaydon Races sung by Jimmy Nail, Kevin Whately and Tim Healy of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet fame, with an additional verse written in dedication of Sir Bobby. > And now a word for Bobby Robson, hero of the Toon; A football man, a > gentleman, who never let we doon; A friendly word, a cheery smile, and brave > right to the end; We're proud to say your one of wors, Sir Bob... Auf > Wiedersehen On 29 November 2009 the Foundation was to be presented with the John Fotheringham Award by the North East branch of the Football Writers' Association at their annual dinner. Marking the occasion of gaining the support of the East Coast train operating company, the express franchise for Scotland - Newcastle - London routes, in March 2011 Robson's widow Elsie and Alan Shearer named one of its locomotives Sir Bobby Robson. The Foundation has also been promoted by the local bus company Go North East, known for their individual branding of routes, who from June 2010 branded four buses used on the 30-minute frequency X25 express, which runs between Langley Park where Robson lived, and Newcastle City Centre (Eldon Square bus station), with Foundation information and an image of Robson. The 2015 Auction organised by Ipswich Town supporter Gina Long from Suffolk was another great success for the SBR Foundation In the 2016 New years Honours List, Gina Long was made an MBE for her charity work.

The students are divided among three houses with a principal for each house and a principal who oversees the entire school.http://www.opschools.org/ History and description of campus The main portion of the current high school building was completed in the late 1940s, and served from then until 1976 as the junior high school. In 1976, a large addition and renovation process doubled the size of the building and it became the high school. (The old junior high gym became the pool and added the gym adjacent to it. Also added is the three-story classroom addition and an auditorium adjacent to the original building.) (The former high school became a Middle School, which currently houses grades 6-8.) A common complaint regarding building design is that the narrowest staircase (capable of fitting only two people abreast) is in a central location; heavy between-period traffic often becomes congested in a bottleneck. The building had undergone only minimal refurbishment and changes since the late 1970s until the summer of 2008. =2008-2010 Renovations= In 2008 renovations began in the science wing, the auditorium, the locker rooms, and turned the stage in the cafeteria into the new weight room. The old weight room is now a technology room. The Freeman entrance was also renovated, adding a larger hallway to the exit as well as a handicap ramp. All the renovations were complete by September 2010.Orchard Park Bee September 2009 School District Orchard Park High School is part of the Orchard Park Central School District, which encompasses students from towns and villages including, Orchard Park, North Boston, Colden, West Falls, and Blasdell.https://www.niche.com/k12/d/orchard-park-central-school-district- ny/#map The school district is broken into 4 elementary schools: Ellicott, South Davis, Eggert, and Windom.https://www.opschools.org/domain/74 Curriculum Orchard Park High School offers courses in Art, Business, Math, Science, English, Social Studies, Physical Education, Foreign Language, Technology, Career and Technological Education, and Music.

In spring of 2014, the Drama Club presented Les Mis√©rables (musical) and received Kenny Awards for Outstanding Production, Rising Star, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and Best Orchestral Performance. The Drama Department also was nominated again in 2017 for their production of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods winning for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Scenic Design, whilst still being nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Technical Design and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/next/orchard-park-receives-top- honors-at-kenny-awards-2014 School spirit and traditions The school mascot is Opie the Quaker. The school colors are Maroon and White. =Homecoming Week= Like most schools, O.P.H.S. has a school spirit week on the week before homecoming, with themes such as neon day and school color day. On Friday of spirit week they have a pep rally and a Powder Puff game which features the junior girls versus the senior girls. On Saturday of that week there is a parade in the morning, the varsity football game in the afternoon, and the dance later that night. =Faculty Basketball Game= O.P.H.S. also holds an annual Faculty Basketball Game to boost school spirit and to fund raise for charity. Faculty members are drafted to play for one of four teams that correspond with grades 9-12, with the first selection given to the class that raised the most money that year. The event is best known for its electric atmosphere with participating teachers and staff taking on nicknames like \\"Crusher\\" to pump up the crowd. In 2008, legendary football coach Gene Tundo made a dramatic 10 point half-court shot in the waning moments to propel the underdog Freshmen over the Seniors. https://buffalonews.com/2008/03/04/baskets-for-a-cause-orchard-park-faculty- game-raises-money-for-brian-dux/https://buffalonews.com/2007/03/06/bad- basketball-for-a-good-cause-orchard-park-goes-all-out-in-faculty-game-to- raise-money-for-charity/ Notable alumni *Rick James, American singer- songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer. *Chuck Bullough, former NFL player, Syracuse Defensive Coordinator *Jim Burt (American football), NFL player *Jon Corto, Former NFL Special teams, Buffalo Bills *Brian Dux, BLL MVP *Dave Hollins, Former MLB third baseman, now Baltimore Orioles scout *John Koelmel, CEO of NOT First Niagara Bank *Larry Pfohl (Lex Luger), professional wrestler *Ron Pitts, former NFL player, Now NFL on FOX Sports broadcaster *William Sadler, Saturn Award winning Actor *Todd Schlopy, former NFL player, Buffalo Bills *Josh Thomas, Indianapolis Colts defensive end *Craig Wolfley, former NFL Player *Ron Wolfley, former NFL player, brother of Craig Wolfley.

The episode first aired on January 6, 2009 on the American Broadcasting Company, following the show's departure from NBC. It was immediately followed by the second episode of the season. The episode was written by Angela Nissel and directed by Michael Spiller who also has a small cameo appearance. This was the first Scrubs episode of the show to show moving footage over the credits, instead of its usual screenshots of scenes throughout the episode. Plot J.D. notices the Janitor cleaning gum off a wall and comments, \\"that's new\\"; the Janitor, assuming J.D. had noticed his new watch, thinks he wants a compliment back and comments on J.D.'s newly grown \\"pubescent Miami Vice beard\\". J.D. then conducts rounds with his new interns and doesn't like any of them. He thinks Katie is a teacher's pet, Denise has a terrible bedside manner, and Ed is lazy. He welcomes the new Chief of Medicine for Sacred Heart, Dr. Taylor Maddox, and is surprised at how attractive and nice she is. Later, during another session of rounds, J.D. leaves the interns alone in the ward to watch the patients and gives them specific instructions. When he returns, he finds that they allowed a patient to crash. He vows he is done teaching them and hands them over to Josephine. In the cafeteria, Dr. Cox tells J.D. that he was not too dissimilar from these new interns, and that it is his job to teach. He ends up giving the interns a second chance. Meanwhile, Dr. Cox is upset that he is once again going to have to be \\"that guy\\" who always stands up to the Chief of Medicine. Nevertheless, when he notices that Maddox is keeping a patient in the hospital only because he has incredible insurance, he begins arguing with her. After Keith calls Katie \\"Mini Elliot\\", Elliot obsesses that she is too self-involved. Carla tries to gently give her a reality check, but Elliot fails to see the signs that Keith is still hurt over their breakup. Ted shows her that he is still upset, and she realizes that she has indeed become too self-involved. Privately, she apologizes to Keith for breaking his heart. After Dr. Maddox sees the Janitor trip up J.D. with his mop, she angrily fires him. When he fails to take her seriously and returns to work the next day, she marches him outside and takes his keys. At the end of the episode a new, friendly janitor introduces himself, to J.D.'s delight. Dr. Kelso enjoys a muffin at Coffee Bucks and watches the hospital drama unfold. Ted tries to tell him off, but still does not have enough self-confidence to stand up to his hated ex-boss. Promotion Bill Lawrence has stated that since switching to ABC, he and Scrubs have received a better level of promotion. This includes the introduction of webisodes of Scrubs on ABC.com and commercial promotion. ABC also released the first five minutes of the episode prematurely to promote the show's debut on the network. Cultural references * In the episode's opening scene, J.D. approaches The Janitor and points at his \\"watch\\" and says \\"Huh, that's new.\\" J.D.'s finger was placed so that it was pointing directly at the ABC logo on the original broadcast, in a reference to Scrubs move from NBC to ABC. * In the sequence that plays during the ending credits, J.D. mentions that Dr. Shalhoub wins everything during medical awards season, which is a jab at the number of awards won by the TV Show Monk, in which Tony Shalhoub stars. Turk's comment that \\"the Nielsens certainly beg to differ\\" is a parallel to the show's performance with the Nielsen ratings. * Courteney Cox becomes the second Friends alumnus to appear on Scrubs, after Matthew Perry's appearance in the Season Four episode \\"My Unicorn\\".

Songs The song that is played when Dr. Taylor Maddox enters is \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" by EndeverafteR. Reception Seth Amitin gives a favorable review of the episode, saying \\"It's...unfair to point to an episode and ask it to represent the season, but...\\"My Jerks\\" is allowing us to do that. The episode is funny in ways that the show wasn't funny last year. It also mixes well with the dramatic while introducing a handful of new characters with relative ease. It's metonymical of Scrubs...Maybe Mr. Lawrence set up some lofty goals, but the first episode of the season follows through on [them].\\"Seth Amitin, \\"Scrubs: \\"My Jerks\\" Review,\\" IGN (January 5, 2009) The Staten Island Advance deemed \\"My Jerks\\" a \\"hit\\" which balanced its comedy with more serious scenes well.

Function  Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels represent the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from both functional and structural standpoints. Their diverse functions include regulating neurotransmitter release, heart rate, insulin secretion, neuronal excitability, epithelial electrolyte transport, smooth muscle contraction, and cell volume. KCNE5 encodes a membrane protein, KCNE5 (originally named KCNE1-L) that has sequence similarity to the KCNE1 gene product, a member of the potassium channel, voltage-gated, isk-related subfamily. The KCNE gene family comprises five genes in the human genome, each encoding a type I membrane protein. The KCNE subunits are potassium channel regulatory subunits that do not pass currents themselves but alter the properties of potassium channel pore-forming alpha subunits. KCNE5 is thus far the least-studied member of the KCNE family, but it is known to regulate a number of different Kv channel subtypes. KCNE5 co-assembles with KCNQ1, a Kv alpha subunit best known for its role in ventricular repolarization and in multiple epithelia. This co-assembly induces a +140 mV shift in voltage dependence of activation (when co-expressed in CHO cells) which would inhibit KCNQ1 activity across the normal physiological voltage range in most tissues. KCNE5 also inhibits activity of channels formed with KCNQ1 and KCNE1. While reportedly not affecting KCNQ2, KCNQ2/3 or KCNQ5 channel activity, KCNE5 inhibits KCNQ4 in CHO cells but not in oocytes. Although it has no known effects on hERG (Kv11.1) or Kv1.x family channel activity, KCNE5 inhibits Kv2.1 activity 50% and accelerates activation, slows deactivation and accelerates the recovery from closed state inactivation of channels formed by Kv2.1 and the 'silent' alpha subunit, Kv6.4. KCNE5 was previously reported to not regulate Kv4.2 or Kv4.3, but has been found to accelerate, and left-shift the voltage dependence of, inactivation of Kv4.3-KChIP2 channel complexes. Structure The KCNE family subunits are type I membrane proteins with an extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus. The transmembrane domain is alpha helical in KCNE1, 2 and 3 and predicted to also be helical in KCNE4 and KCNE5. The acknowledged role of members of the KCNE family is as Kv channel beta subunits, regulating the functional properties of Kv alpha subunits, with all three segments of the beta subunit contributing to binding, functional modulation and/or trafficking modulation to a greater or lesser degree. The high resolution structure of KCNE5 has not yet been determined, as of 2016. KCNE5 is an X-linked gene encoding a 143 residue protein in Homo sapiens. Tissue distribution Human KCNE5 transcripts are most highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, spinal cord and brain, and it is also detectable in placenta. In mice, Kcne5 transcript was detected in embryonic cranial nerve migrating crest cells, ganglia, somites and myoepicaridal layer. Clinical significance This intronless gene is deleted in AMME contiguous gene syndrome and is potentially involved in the cardiac and neurologic abnormalities found in the AMME contiguous gene syndrome. KCNE5 is expressed in the human placenta and its expression increases in preeclampsia, although causality has not been established for this phenomenon. Inherited sequence variants in human KCNE5 are associated with atrial fibrillation and Brugada syndrome. Atrial fibrillation is the most common chronic cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 2-3 million in the United States alone, predominantly in the aging population. A minority of cases are linked to ion channel gene mutations, whereas the majority are associated with structural heart defects. Brugada syndrome is a relatively rare but lethal ventricular arrhythmia most commonly linked to voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN5A mutations, but also associated with some Kv channel gene sequence variants. KCNE5 mutation L65F is associated with atrial fibrillation and upregulates KCNQ1-KCNE1 currents when co-expressed with these subunits. In contrast, a polymorphism in KCNE5 encoding a P33S substitution was found to be less common in atrial fibrillation patients than in control subjects, although these findings were at odds with those of other studies. KCNE5-Y81H was detected in a man with a type 1 Brugada pattern body-surface electrocardiogram, while KCNE5-D92E:E93X was detected in another case of Brugada and associated with premature sudden death in other male family members, but not females - significant because KCNE5 is an X-linked gene. These two gene variants did not affect KCNQ1-KCNE1 currents when co-expressed in CHO cells, but produced larger currents than wild-type KCNE5 when coexpressed with Kv4.3-KChIP2, giving a possible mechanism for Brugada syndrome, i.e., increased ventricular Ito density. A KCNE5 non-coding region gene variant, the G variant of the rs697829 A/G polymorphism, has also been reported to associate with prolonged QT interval and higher hazard ratio for death, compared to the G variant.

The football squad currently competes in the Ballarat Football League in the Ballarat region of Victoria, Australia. The Ballarat Football Netball Club was established on 20 May 1860, making it the 3rd oldest continually operating football club in Australia, behind Melbourne FC (May 1859), and Geelong FC (July 1859). Its first President and Captain was Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. Greenfield. It's senior best and fairest award is named after Alexander Greenfield. Ballarat played their home matches at City Oval in Ballarat for 88 years, then moved to their current location at Alfredton Recreation Reserve in 1994. Ballarat's senior guernsey is white with Red 'V'. Ballarat was a provincial member of the Victorian Football Association from 1878 until 1896, taking part in the Association's administration and competing regularly against Melbourne-based VFA clubs. The club was also a founding member of the Ballarat Football Association in 1893. Ballarat Football Netball Club's junior program has produced recent AFL players Drew Petrie, twins Nathan & Mitch Brown, brothers Brad & Matt Crouch and AFLW player Sophie Van De Heuvel.  Club identity  Guernsey = The senior jumper is white with a red V. The club senior team wore red & white vertical stripes between season 2010 and 2018, however reverted back to the traditional red V from season 2019. From season 2019 the junior 'Swans' division of the club have worn the red and white vertical stripes, and the junior 'Storm' division have worn red and white horizontal hoops. Both junior jumpers have historical significance as being designs worn by Ballarat FC during the 1800s. = Song = The club song is known as \\"Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White\\" and is to the tune of the Victory March, the fight song of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in South Bend, Indiana, USA. The words are: : Cheer, cheer the red and the white, : Honour the name by day and by night, : Lift that noble banner high, : Shake down the thunder from the sky. : Whether the odds be great or small, : Ballarat will go and win overall, : While her loyal sons are marching : Onwards to victory! = Mascot = The club's mascot is the angry swan. = Home ground = Since the 1994 season, Ballarat have played all their home games at the Alfredton Recreation Reserve, in Alfredton, Victoria, Australia. The venue has been home to Ballarat's home games since the club's relocation from City Oval in 1993. In the years 1906-1993, Ballarat played its home matches at the City Oval, in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. Whilst there, they were co-tenants with the Redan Football Club. The move to Alfredton by the club was a strategic one based on the growing population of the suburb, and the opportunity to join its junior division, who had been playing at Alfredton since 1984.

He stands and weighs , and bats and throws left handed. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees.  Minor league career  The Twins selected Parmelee with their first round (20th overall) pick in the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft after he hit .407 with 11 home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBIs) as a senior at Chino Hills High School in Chino Hills, California. As soon as the Twins signed Parmelee, he instantly became one of the organizations top power hitting prospects, and was projected to be a potential impact player in the middle of their lineup within the next few years. Parmelee began his professional career with the Twins' rookie league affiliate, the Gulf Coast Twins. After batting .279 with eight home runs in 45 games, he earned a promotion to the single-A Beloit Snappers. He returned to Beloit for the 2007 season, where he hit .239 with a team-leading 15 home runs in 128 games. He returned to Beloit again in 2008 due to a glut of outfielders in the Twins farm system. Although he missed a good part of the season due to a broken wrist and had the same .239 batting average, he nearly equaled his output from 2007, hitting 14 home runs in just 69 games while increasing his on-base percentage from .313 to .385 and his slugging percentage from .414 to .496. Parmelee began the 2009 season assigned to the Twins' advanced-A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle, with whom he batted .244 with five home runs and 28 RBIs in the first half of the season. He joined teammates Carlos Guti√©rrez, Chris Cates, and Ben Revere as All-stars for the Florida State League's Southern division, and won the home run derby held before the game. Parmelee started the 2010 season with Fort Myers, but was quickly promoted to the double-A New Britain Rock Cats. In his first season at that level, he batted .275 in 111 games, but his power numbers dipped, as he hit just six home runs. This led to Parmelee returning to New Britain for the 2011 season, where he improved his numbers to a .287 batting average with 13 homers in 142 games.  Major league career Minnesota Twins= 2011  After clubbing 74 home runs and driving in 370 runs over six years in the minor leagues, Parmelee received his first call to the majors in September 2011. He, Joe Benson and Liam Hendriks all started for the Twins in their big league debuts on September 6. He hit a single in his first major league at bat to lead off the second, but was stranded at third as the Twins were shut out by Chicago White Sox pitcher Jake Peavy. The following day, he collected his first two major league RBIs with a double to center off John Danks in the Twins' 5-4 victory over the White Sox. On September 17 against the Cleveland Indians, Parmelee went 3-for-3 and hit his first major league home run in the eighth inning off Josh Judy. He finished the year with a .355 average, four home runs and 14 RBI in 21 games.  2012  Parmelee with the Twins in 2013 With the Twins' regular first baseman, Justin Morneau, starting the season as the designated hitter, Parmelee opened the 2012 season with the Twins as their starting first baseman despite not yet having played at triple-A. Morneau was placed on the disabled list in April, but Parmelee struggled as well, batting just .179 and without a home run through mid-May and was optioned to the triple-A Rochester Red Wings on May 16 when Morneau was activated. Parmelee hit well in his first taste of the highest level of the minor leagues, batting .375 with four homers, and was brought back to the major leagues on June 7. He was returned to the minors on July 5, promoted briefly again while Morneau was on paternity leave in late July, then finally called up for good on August 29. Overall, he had hit .338 at Rochester with 17 home runs in just 64 games, good enough to lead the team. In his major league time, he finished with a .229 average, five home runs and 20 RBI in 64 games.  2013  With Morneau recovered, the Twins made Parmelee their starting right fielder on Opening Day of the 2013 season. In early May, Parmelee started sharing right field duties with Oswaldo Arcia. Ryan Doumit also got time in right field. Parmelee also got starts at first base filling in for Justin Morneau. At the All-Star break, Parmelee was optioned to Rochester. At the time, Parmelee was hitting .223 with 8 HR and 20 RBI. Playing first base and right field for Rochester, in 45 games, he hit .231 with 3 HR and 22 RBI. On September 9, Parmelee was recalled by the Twins after Rochester's season was over. Parmelee split first base duties with Chris Colabello to finish the season. In 101 games with Minnesota in 2013, Parmelee hit .228 with 8 HR and 24 RBI. 2014 Parmelee was outrighted off the Twins roster on March 27, 2014. He was re-added to the roster on May 9. Parmelee was designated for assignment on December 13 to clear a roster spot for Ervin Santana. =Baltimore Orioles= Parmelee signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles before the 2015 season. He was called up by the Orioles on June 16. In his first game with the team, against the Philadelphia Phillies later that day, he went 4-for-6, hitting 2 home runs as the Orioles beat the Phillies 19-3. The very next day, Parmelee went 1-for-3, hitting another home run and scoring two runs as the Orioles beat the Phillies. He was designated for assignment on July 31 to make room for newly acquired outfielder Gerardo Parra. =New York Yankees= On February 22, 2016, Parmelee signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees. He began the 2016 season with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. When Mark Teixeira went on the disabled list on June 4, the Yankees promoted Parmelee to the major leagues. In Parmelee's first start with the Yankees, on June 8, he hit two home runs, and a double, driving in 3 runs. He became the first Yankee to hit two home runs in his first start with the team since Roger Maris in 1960. The next day, he suffered a left hamstring strain, and was placed on the disabled list. He elected to become a free agent after the season. =Oakland Athletics= On November 30, 2016, Parmelee signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics that included an invitation to spring training. He played 41 games for the Triple-A Nashville Sounds before being placed on the disabled list on June 6. He was released by the Athletics on June 13. =Miami Marlins= On July 26, 2017, Parmelee signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On March 9, 2019, Parmelee signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

George Barkley Raikes (14 March 1873 ‚Äì 18 December 1966) was an English sportsman who played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Hampshire as well as representing the England national football team. Early days Raikes was born at Wymondham and was educated at Shrewsbury School. He kept goal for the school team between 1890 and 1892, before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford. At Oxford he won a blue in football in each of the four years from 1893 to 1896. Cricket career Raikes, a middle order batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler, played his early first-class cricket at Oxford University where he won his Blue in 1894 and 1895. He joined Hampshire in 1900 and performed well with the bat, making a two half centuries in his first three matches and also scoring a pair of 40s. His brother Ernest and nephew Thomas both played first-class cricket. The all-rounder was also a successful cricketer in the Minor Counties Championship, where he captained Norfolk. A Championship winning captain in 1905 and 1910, Raikes amassed 3419 runs at 30.80 for them and took 282 wickets at 15.86. Despite having not played first- class cricket for a decade, Raikes returned in 1912 for a match with an England XI against Australia. Football career A goalkeeper at football, he played at club level for Oxford University, Wymondham Town and Corinthian. Raikes was capped four times for England, making his international debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Wales in 1895. His three other appearances came in 1896, against Ireland, Wales and Scotland respectively. There is some dispute over whether or not Raikes captained England in their international against Ireland on 7 March 1896, with Gilbert Smith and Vaughan Lodge the others in the frame. The list provided by the F.A. does not include Raikes as an England captain however both the Irish Saturday Night and The Irish Times gave Raikes the captaincy. Career in the church After being ordained in 1897, he was a curate of Portsea, Portsmouth, the largest parish of the city until 1905 and then chaplain to the Duke of Portland. In 1920 he became Rector of Bergh Apton, remaining one until 1936. Before his death, at the age of 93, Raikes had been one of the oldest living first-class cricketers.

He started work on it in 1815, and completed it on the morning of the premiere of his opera Der Freisch√ºtz, 18 June 1821. He premiered it a week later, on 25 June, at his farewell Berlin concert. Background The Konzertst√ºck started out as a third piano concerto; however, because it is in one continuous movement (in four sections) and has an explicit program, Weber decided not to name it \\"concerto\\" but \\"Konzertst√ºck\\" (Concert Piece). The score calls for flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and trumpets in pairs, bass trombone, timpani, and strings. It takes about 17 minutes to perform and a brilliant technique is called for. Structure and Programme On the morning of the Der Freisch√ºtz premiere, Weber played the Konzertst√ºck through to his wife Caroline and his pupil Julius Benedict, and told them the program: :(F minor; Larghetto affetuoso): \\"A ch√¢telaine sits alone on her balcony, gazing off in the distance. Her knight has gone on a Crusade to the Holy Land. Years have passed, battles have been fought; is he still alive? Will she ever see him again?\\" :(F minor; Allegro passionato): \\"Her excited imagination summons a vision of her noble husband lying wounded and forsaken on the battlefield. Could she not fly to his side and die with him? She falls back, unconscious. Then from the distance comes the sound of a trumpet. There in the forest something flashes in the sunlight as it comes nearer and nearer\\" :(C major: Tempo di marcia): \\"Knights and squires, with the Crusaders' cross and banners waving, are acclaimed by the crowd. And there her husband is among them! She sinks into his arms.\\" :(F major, Presto gioioso): \\"Happiness without end! The woods and waves sing a song of love, while a thousand voices proclaim its victory\\". The theme of separation and joyous return, was one that Ludwig van Beethoven had explored in 1810 in his Piano Sonata No. 26 in E flat Les Adieux, Op. 81a. The 12-year- old Felix Mendelssohn almost certainly attended the premiere and the piece became a staple of his concert repertoire. He first played it at age 18, on 20 February 1827, in his first public concert, at which his A Midsummer Night's Dream Overture was premiered. Among the technical tricks in the piano-writing are three upward octave glissandi‚Äîone in the third movement, and two in the finale. Franz Liszt thoroughly revised the solo piano part to take into account the more expansive possibilities of the newer pianos of Liszt's day, as well as some newer limitations (octave glissandos) are pretty much impossible on the heavier pianos Liszt knew (and all concert grand pianos made since) (see S. 367a). Liszt also made a solo piano transcription of the Konzertst√ºck (S. 576a). The Konzertst√ºck has been recorded many times and is a favourite of the piano concerto repertoire.

The band went on hiatus in 2011. =Press (2007)= \\"Genuflect is wired for political and social agitation. Song after song (Genuflect) picks a target and unloads. The misleading politicking that set the stage for the war in Iraq, the sex scandals involving members of the clergy, the idea of terrorists killing in the name of God, and the social decay brought on by a culture overfed on celebrity news but starved of meaningful discussion are some of the topics raised on 'The End of the World' ... a relentlessly hard-sounding album.\\" -The Worcester Telegram and Gazette. \\"Genuflect...is less rap and more metal than Reveille, but stays true to the hardcore sound that gave Reveille its edge. Street-smart songs such as 'Potent' and 'Kill Shot' delve into societal ills like crime and drugs with genuine passion and explosiveness.

Just because of my language skills and the timing, so to speak, I got a lot of experience. I was thrown into a mix of things that normally desk assistants at my level would not have gotten.

Following his coverage of the June 2016 Tel Aviv shooting, an Israeli newspaper, The Jerusalem Post, criticized Mohyeldin for going \\"on a rambling, 35 second stream of consciousness in which he managed to squeeze in four mentions of 'the occupation' and three mentions of Israeli politics 'shifting to the right' or the 'extreme right,' while talking of Palestinian 'frustration' and Israeli oppression.\\" Personal life Mohyeldin married Tunisian model Kenza Fourati on April 26, 2016 in a private ceremony in Marietta, Georgia, where his parents currently reside.

This type of learning is used in studies regarding operant and classical conditioning. Operant conditioning involves the modification of a behavior by means of reinforcement or punishment. In this way, a discriminative stimulus will act as an indicator to when a behavior will persist and when it will not. Classical conditioning involves learning through association when two stimuli are paired together repeatedly. This conditioning demonstrates discrimination through specific micro-instances of reinforcement and non-reinforcement. This phenomenon is considered to be more advanced than learning styles such as generalization and yet simultaneously acts as a basic unit to learning as a whole. The complex and fundamental nature of discrimination learning allows for psychologists and researchers to perform more in-depth research that supports psychological advancements. Research on the basic principles underlying this learning style has their roots in neuropsychology sub-processes. Historical information  Karl Lashley, a psychologist who studied under John B. Watson, focused mainly on studying learning and discrimination. He published \\"Brain mechanisms and intelligence\\" in 1929. Lashey's research on two-alternative forced choice gave a foundation of study to psychologists like Kenneth Spence. Kenneth Spence expanded on the knowledge we had on two-choice discrimination learning. He made two major publications on the subject, The Nature of Discrimination Learning in Animals in 1936 and Continuous Versus Non-continuous Interpretations of Discrimination Learning in 1940. Spence's research discussed the theory that applying excitation and inhibition to a stimulus and having the likelihood of responding to that stimulus be the result of the net excitation strength (excitation minus inhibition). Ivan Pavlov is very influential when it comes to studying discrimination learning. His studies involving salivating dogs demonstrated an ability in the dogs to differentiate a stimulus that would elicit a reward and a stimulus that would not. This can be contrasted with the Little Albert studies where Albert's lack of discrimination between animals exhibited the psychological and learning phenomenon of generalization learning, which is discrimination learning's polar opposite. A book written on discrimination learning studied the behaviors and discriminatory habits of animals.  Examples  Discrimination learning can be studied in both humans and animals. Animals can use discrimination learning to help them survive, be trained for assisting humans in tasks, and much more. A dog might be trained to use discrimination learning to detect differences in complex odor compounds so that they are able to sniff out different drugs to assist police. Predator can also use discrimination learning to distinguish between two camouflaged prey. Discrimination learning teaches us more about what animals are capable of conceptual thought. Humans can use discrimination learning to detect danger, learn about differences, and more. One example of discrimination learning in humans would be a baby who reacts differently to their mother's voice than to a stranger's voice. Dog being Trained for Drug Detection in US Navy Discovering different abilities of animals or humans who are unable to communicate. Discrimination learning can be used to see what differences an animal will respond to. For example, since we are unable to have general two-way communication with dogs, we could show a dog two different stimuli that are the same in every way other than one, such as color. We could then use discrimination learning to see which colors a dog can discriminate between.  Famous studies  Some famous studies using discrimination learning include: * Natural concepts in pigeons by Hernstein RJ, Loveland DH, Cable C. A study in 1976 found that discrimination learning will occur when the stimuli is realistic but unfamiliar in the study using pigeons and fish. * Watanabe study in 1995 found that pigeons are able to detect physical similarities during a study that was reinforcing monet paintings and not picasso paintings.  Limitations  Discrimination learning has limitations. One limitation is the relative-validity effect. This effect states that organisms learn to give more attention to the stimuli that are of more importance to them. Another limitation is the blocking effect. This effect will occur if there is a discriminative stimulus, such as a cat hearing the sound of a bell ringing, that is presented by itself and then it is followed by a reinforcement, such as food for the cat. We would repeat this until the cat starts to salivate when the bell rings. If we then added a stimulus of a flash of light after the bell rings, and then followed it by a reinforcement (the cat food), it may result in little to no response to a second stimulus. Applications Discrimination learning is used almost every subfield of psychology as it is a basic form of learning that is at the core of human intelligence. Examples of this include but are not limited to, cognitive psychology, personality psychology, developmental psychology, etc. It was a classic topic in the psychology of learning from the 1920s to the 1970s, and was particularly investigated within: *comparative psychology, where a key issue was whether continuous or discontinuous learning processes were concerned in the acquisition of discriminations *human cognitive psychology *the experimental analysis of behaviour, where a key issue was whether discriminations could be trained without the necessity for the subject to make errors *developmental psychology, where a key issue was the changes that occur in the process of discrimination as a function of age *cross- cultural psychology, where a key issue was the role that the cultural appropriateness of the stimuli to be discriminated played in the rate of acquisition of effective discrimination *mathematical psychology, where attempts were made to formalise the distinctions being drawn in other branches of psychology. Discrimination learning can almost become an unconscious process for many people. It becomes integrated into daily routines. Examples of discrimination learning in everyday life can include grocery shopping, determining how to decipher between the types of bread or fruit, being able to tell similar stimuli apart, differentiating between different parts while listening to music, or perhaps deciphering the different notes and chords being played. While interest in the learning of discriminations has continued in many fields, from about 1980 onwards the phrase \\"discrimination learning\\" was used less often as the main description either of individual studies or of a field of investigation. Instead, investigations of the learning of discriminations have tended to be described in other terms such as pattern recognition or concept discrimination. This change partly reflects the increasing diversity of studies of discrimination, and partly the general expansion of the topic of cognition within psychology, so that learning is not now the central organizing topic that it was in the mid-20th century.

In the 1940s, he held the American and world records for the mile run. He was awarded the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States in 1943. Biography Gilbert LothairThe available references do not agree on his middle name. Most use \\"R\\" as the middle initial; \\"The Flying Parson\\" book identifies his middle name as Lothair. Dodds was born in Norcatur, Kansas, one of five children and the son of Rev. and Mrs. J. G. Dodds. His minister father was half English and half Irish; his mother was of German ancestry. The family moved to Falls City, Nebraska when Rev. Dodds became the minister at Falls City Brethren Church. Gil Dodds attended Falls City High School, where he became a distance runner, coached by Lloyd Hahn, a runner in the 1924 Summer Olympics who lived nearby. Dodds never lost a race in high school. In 1935, he entered two events at a track meet in Peru, Nebraska and won both, setting state records in the mile (4:49.6) and half-mile (2:09.5), breaking the old records by 13.4 and 4.5 seconds, respectively. He was the state champion in the mile race in 1935, 1936 and 1937 and held the state record at 4:28.1 when he graduated in 1937. As a junior in high school, he developed a hernia while playing tennis; for the rest of his running career, he wore a truss while running to protect himself. He attended Ashland University (class of 1941), Gordon Divinity School and Wheaton College and had a winning steak of 39 races. On November 25, 1940, Dodds took his first national championship when he won the NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship in East Lansing, Michigan. Dodds was the AAU indoor mile champion in 1942, 1944, and 1947. Outdoors he set the American mile record of 4:06.5 in 1943 in Boston, finishing second to Sweden's Gunder H√§gg. Dodds in 1944 On March 11, 1944, Dodds broke the world indoor record for the mile run at the annual Knights of Columbus track meet in Madison Square Garden, New York City. His time of 4:07.2 broke the old record by 0.1 second, which was jointly held by Glenn Cunningham, Charles Fenske and Leslie MacMitchell. One week later, Dodds lowered his own world indoor mile record to 4:06.4 at Chicago Stadium on March 18, 1944. Known as \\"The Flying Parson\\", he graduated from seminary in 1945 and retired from running to be a full-time minister. In 1947, he resumed running with the goal of making the 1948 Olympic team. In January 1948, he won his third Wanamaker Mile in 4:05.3, a career best time and the third time he had broken the world indoor record for the mile. One week before the Olympic Trials, he caught the mumps and injured his Achilles tendon and could not run the qualifying meet. He went on to work with the new \\"Youth for Christ\\" youth organization and became the track and cross country coach at Wheaton College (1945‚Äì1959). Ministry As part of his ministry, Dodds used a personal story to explain the Scripture verse Hebrews 12:1, \\"... let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily hinders our progress, and run with endurance the race that lies before us.\\" > ‚ÄúRunner Gil Dodds was once preparing for a race. After a series of > stretching exercises, Dodd ran several warm-up laps around the track. Just > before the race began, he quickly changed into some other track shoes.

They had four children; Jack, Michael, Jann, and Joel. Awards and honors Dodds was awarded the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States in 1943. He was inducted into the Nebraska High School Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.

Fashion Merchandising is a job that is done world- wide. This position requires well-developed quantitative skills, and natural ability to discover trends, meaning relationships and interrelationships among standard sales and stock figures. In the fashion industry, there are two different merchandising teams: the visual merchandising team, and the fashion merchandising team. The visual merchandising team are the people in charge of designing the layout, floor plan, and the displays of the store in order to increase sales. The fashion merchandising team are the people who are involved in the production of fashion designs and distribution of final products to the end consumer. Fashion merchandisers work with designers to ensure that designs will be affordable and desired by the target market. Fashion merchandising involves apparel, accessories, beauty, and housewares. The end goal of fashion merchandising in any of these departments is to earn a profit. Fashion merchandisers' decisions can considerably impact the success of the manufacturer, designer, or retailer for which they work.  Background  left During ancient times, individuals shopped in markets for goods. The ancients were attracted to rare fashions that brought variation and excitement into their lives. These markets have transformed into today's department, specialty, and discount retailers. For many years, business people in the fashion industry were convinced that they could persuade consumers to desire their particular products. Fashion executives had no interest in the needs and wants of consumers. However, fashion personnel realized that they would have to adapt fashion items to the demands of consumers.  Rights of merchandising  In modern merchandising, distribution responsibilities are absent, and focus is placed on planning and analysis. A separate team is tasked with distribution. Large organizations separate merchandisers by type. There are retail merchandisers and product merchandisers. Retail merchandisers manage store allocation and must maximize sales. Product merchandisers manage the flow of materials to suppliers and then the flow of product to stores. Product merchandisers then pass control of product to the retail merchandisers. Modern Structure Many large organizations have concluded that distribution requires highly detailed work and that it is necessary to have a team specifically for that purpose. This is due to the fine details of allocation, which require focus on aspects such as colour and sizes for a specific store. This approach not only minimizes costs but also extends to areas like better control of the overall process. Organizations that do not conduct distribution this way risk losing control of their stock at both the highest and lowest level. This is a result of the lack of uniformity and oversight. The distribution team specializes not only in managing distribution, but they are also focused on sales and profit. They employ detailed, accurate information about distribution points sourced from product planners. They possess the ability to manage dynamic stock demands. They partner with buyers and merchandisers for any necessary repeat buying. Though they are positioned to manage stock, they still operate within the limits of the buying plan, and merchandisers ensure they remain within this realm. Buyers provide guidelines for distribution such as the type of stores where product should be distributed; for example, a product may have only been acquired for the top 3 stores. The team also supports the goals of an organization through being instrumental in responding to trends. The nature of modern analysis has allowed many merchandisers to plan as much as four seasons ahead, and they are expected to apply the data. This further increases the demands placed on their roles and emphasizes the need to task out minor details that do not require their input or much of their supervision. Fashion merchandisers follow the five rights of merchandising, or 5Rs, to ensure that they properly meet the needs of consumers; thus, turning a profit. The five rights of merchandising include: * the right merchandise * at the right price * at the right time * in the right place * in the right quantities. By researching and answering the five rights of merchandising, fashion merchandisers can gain an understanding of what products consumers want, when and where they wish to make purchases, and what prices will have the highest demand. Both fashion retailers and manufacturers utilize the 5Rs.  Manufacturers  thumb Clothing manufacturers practice fashion merchandising differently than retailers. Manufacturer merchandisers forecast customers' preferences for silhouettes, sizes, colors, quantities, and costs each season. When making decisions, manufacturer merchandisers must keep retailers and end consumers in mind. Following the forecasting stage, manufacturer merchandisers meet with designers to develop products that consumers will purchase most. By referring to the five rights of merchandising, manufacturer merchandisers determine the best fabric, notions, product methods, and promotions for products. These decisions all contribute to final retail costs, which must be affordable to end consumers.  Retailers  Kleider Bauer Flagship In comparison to manufacturer merchandisers, retailer merchandisers also begin their process by forecasting industry and fashion trends with their target markets in mind. Sales are predicted in retail dollars and beginning of the month (BOM) stock. Similar to manufacturer merchandisers, retailer merchandisers must make all decisions regarding the final consumer. Decisions are made based on the past, present, and future of the economy, sales, industry and fashion trends, region and world events, and the fashion cycle. When selecting merchandise to offer, retailer merchandisers will consider their target markets' color, style, size, and cost preferences. Once accurate decisions are made, retailer merchandisers will order goods from vendors or produce private labels. Following shipment, ordered seasonal apparel assortments are strategically arranged on sales floors, or visually merchandised.  Education  Individuals interested in building a career in fashion merchandising should earn an associate's or bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising or a related field, such as marketing. Relevant courses include, but are not limited to, fashion, accounting, economics, textile and merchandising, psychology, marketing, and management. In addition to schooling, those aspiring to work as fashion merchandisers are required to do an internship with any retail company of their choice as well as work in the retail field. It is also suggested that one stays caught up in the latest fashion trends, which can be done by reading blogs, magazines, traveling, and shopping. A fashion merchandiser will not only be responsible for choosing the best clothes but for making the store appealing to the eye. The proper education is very important in order to be successful in this career. [1][2][3]  Careers  Fashion merchandising careers are as follows: * Buyer: Develop six-month buying plans and order assortments for each season. Travel to markets and trade shows to purchase the latest fashions for stores. * Account executive: The liaison between manufacturers and buyers. Handle several retail accounts, present manufactures' lines to buyers, and relay fashion and promotional information. * Store manager: Hiring, training, and overseeing employees as well as monitoring sales for a specific retail store. * Merchandise coordinator: Responsible for visual merchandising. A liaison between the manufacturer and retailer. * Showroom manager: Display fashion lines, present collections, and manage multiple retail accounts. Also, manage expenses and ensure profitability. * Merchandise planner: Assist a fashion company with meeting objectives through technologically and mathematically calculated solutions. Additionally, discover trends, develop financial plans, and determine merchandise reorders.

The station's turbine hall and other remaining buildings are Grade II listed. History The station was commissioned by the Newcastle Corporation to supply electricity to the Newcastle Corporation Tramways system, that was in the process of electrification, and to contain the organisation's offices. Construction of the station was initially delayed by a bricklayer's strike, but laying of the building's foundations commenced on 14 January 1900. The construction of the station was completed in 1904. The station generated electricity until 1936. The origins of this action dated from the 1920s. A Parliamentary report by Lord Weir led to The Electricity (Supply) Act 1926 (repealed 1989), which created the Central Electricity Board and the National Grid operating at 132 kV (50 Hz). Manors Power Station was deemed too small in generating capacity and its associated plant operated at 40 Hz, thus it suffered the same fate of many other municipal power stations and ceased generation. However, it was still retained for electrical function. The introduction of the Newcastle Corporation's trolleybus system, together with the commissioning of new electrically-driven cranes on the Corporation-owned Newcastle Quayside in the 1930s, turned the Manors site into the central control point for the many suburban substations used by the trolleybuses. These substations took the 6 kV AC distributed from Manors and transformed and rectified this to the 550 V DC used by the trolleybuses and rapidly diminishing tram fleet. Manors itself became a substation and supplied the city centre area with the DC power for the trolleybuses and Quayside cranes. The electrically-operated lifts used on the Tyne Bridge were supplied by Manors station. Operations The coal burned in the station's boilers was delivered to the station by rail from Trafalgar South Yard, on the East Coast Main Line at Argyle Street. From here the hoppered waggons were moved along a high timber and steel staith from which they could discharge the coal directly into bunkers above the boilers. From these bunkers it was fed by automatic weighing machines into automatic stokers. Circulating water used in the station's surface condensers was taken from the River Tyne, which was around from the station and at around below the level of the station's engines. A pump house was located on the river's quay wall, for pumping water up to the station. Two diameter pipes ran between the station and the pump house, one for sending water up to the station, the other for discharging it back into the river. Design and specification The station was designed by architect Benjamin Simpson. Its engine and boiler house are large ornate steel framed, brick clad buildings, decorated with stained glass and panelling. In the station's boiler house were eight Lancashire boilers, each long and in diameter. They were fitted with economisers and natural draught, working at a pressure of 160 psi. Flue gasses from the boilers were discharged through a tall brick built chimney. In the station's engine house were three marine-type reciprocating steam engines, fitted with Corliss valves, surface condensers and Edward air pumps. Two of the engines had a rating of 1,000 horsepower (HP), while the third had a rating of 2,000 HP. Each engine was directly connected to a DC dynamo, which produced electricity at a pressure of 500 Volts (V). From here electricity was provided for the Newcastle Corporation Tramways system via a large switch board at the station. The same switchboard also fed power to the arc lighting in the city. The technology being used at the station was considered to be obsolete at the time of opening and the original prime movers were replaced in 1908 by four Parsons turbo generators. Post-closure and present The station was used as an air-raid shelter during the Second World War. After cessation of its electrical function for the Corporation's trolleybus system in October 1966, the City Lighting department continued to use the building as a maintenance centre. The high turbine hall was stripped of its electrical plant and was used as an indoor car park. During the construction of the city's Metro system in the 1970s, a full size mock up Metro station was constructed in the turbine hall for training purposes. The building then passed into the ownership of Stagecoach, who used it as their regional headquarters. The building was then bought by Christian group City Church. It has been used as a meeting place by the group since October 1997, and has been renamed The CastleGate. The renovation began in May 2000, and was completed 18 months later, with the inaugural service on 3 November 2001. A overhead crane, capable of lifting up to , is still in place in the turbine hall. As well as this, old tiles, metal galleries where workers kept check on the turbines, and old stained glass windows depicting trams, have all been kept. The building was extended in 2002, with the construction of the Generator Studios office space. This was further expanded with the construction of Generator2. Construction work began in March 2008, with completion expected for 2009.

For that successor company, see Wyeth. Genetics Institute, Inc. was a biotechnology research and development company founded by Thomas Maniatis and Mark Ptashne, two Harvard molecular biologists, in 1980 in Massachusetts. Originally operating out of Ptashne's house in Boston, the company found more spacious quarters first in Boston and then Cambridge before expanding further. Gabriel Schmergel joined soon afterwards as CEO. Many leading scientists joined G.I. from academia and it proved to be a fertile source of patents for some time. Historical background One of the two largest national clusters of biotechnology in the U.S. (the other being the San Francisco Bay area), the greater Boston area has been the birthplace of many innovative corporations and non-profit research centers. Beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s, this biotech trend saw three early large for-profit corporations: Biogen (now Biogen Idec), Genzyme, and Genetics Institute. MIT's Whitehead Institute was one of the seminal non-profit research centers in this field locally, among many others. Aside from MIT, Harvard, Boston University and several teaching hospitals including Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's were important contributors to the local field's development. Products G.I.'s Products (or potential candidates for products) included forms of M-CSF, interleukin-3, interleukin-11 (Neumega), bone morphogenetic protein 2,recombinant human Factor IX, and recombinant human Factor VIII (Recombinate); as well as tissue plasminogen activator and erythropoetin that both involved costly, complex lawsuits over patent infringement with competitors. Toward the end of its independent existence, G.I. created a program to share \\"a library of several thousand genes and their related proteins that could be scanned for potential new drugs.\\" This program was based on a G.I. technology that allowed it to identify proteins secreted by cells and therefore more likely to be therapeutic in the body.

Service  Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory Under Colonel Justus Steinberger, organization for a three-year regiment began on 19 October 1861, with recruiting taking place within the territory as well as California. Company A, B, C and D were organized at Alcatraz Island, San Francisco, Cal., January to April, 1862. By May 1862, four companies had been mustered, with 17 officers and 317 men.Adj Gen Rept, Schedule A Ten companies would eventually be raised, being mustered in from the end of March until December 1862. The majority of the volunteers would muster in at Alcatraz Island, San Francisco, California, two others doing so at Fort Vancouver and one at Fort Steilacoom, Washington. The headquarters for the regiment was first at Fort Vancouver, and by July 1862 moved to Fort Walla Walla. The companies, and/or detachments thereof, were stationed throughout the territories of Washington and Idaho, and in Oregon. They were used for the protection of miners and settlers, emigrant parties and other travellers along the roads from the east, and participated with the 1st Oregon Cavalry in expeditions against Shoshone, Snake, and other hostile Indian groups. They were also used to protect the Nez Perce, an ally of the United States, against those encroaching on their lands. When the three years terms of service had expired for the earlier formed companies and the men were mustered out, the remaining three companies (Co E, H, and I) became the 1st Battalion on 7 March 1865. Co H would be consolidated with Co E in July, and was the last of the former Washington regiment to muster out of service in December. As the companies were detached and participated in individual operations, their service records are best if listed separately: Company A Organized 21 March 1862, they were stationed at Fort Walla Walla. Originally being recruited for a two-year term, some of the men were leaving or reenlisting in early 1864.Brig-Gen Alvord corrspd, 11 July 1864 Once replaced by a company of the 1st Oregon Infantry, they left to be mustered out around February 1865. Company B Organized 1 April 1862, they were stationed at Fort Colville until 25 May 1864, when ordered to Fort Walla Walla.Dist of Oregon, Special Order No 75 They remained here until receiving orders for their return to Fort Vancouver for discharge in the spring of 1865. Company C Organized 7 April 1862 and sent to Fort Colville for their term of service. They were mustered out at Fort Vancouver in April 1865. Company D Organized 12 April 1862, they were stationed at Fort Hoskins in Oregon by December 1862. Orders in March 1863 sent them to Fort Boise in Idaho Territory,Brig-Gen Alvord orders, 17 March 1863 where they remained stationed during their service. Company E Mustered in at Alcatraz, they were ordered on 19 October 1862 to Camp Lapwai (would fall within the bounds of the Idaho Territory when created the following March), near the Nez Perce Agency.District of Oregon, Special Order No 76 Here, they were to build their encampment in what became Fort Lapwai. By June 1864, they would be stationed at Fort Vancouver. Co H would be consolidated with them in July 1865, and they would be the last of the Washington Territory volunteers to be mustered out, doing so on 11 Dec 1865. Company F Mustered at Fort Vancouver, the company was stationed at Fort Dalles, Oregon in 1863 and 1864. The majority of the troops were mustered out in July 1865. Company G One of the three Washington companies encamped at Fort Boise, Idaho Territory in March 1863, previously being at Fort Steilacoom. Company H Mustered at Alcatraz, they first encamped at Fort Walla Walla. On 25 May 1864, they transferred to Fort Vancouver. On 22 July 1865, they would be consolidated with Company E. Company I Encamped at Ft Vancouver in December 1862, it transferred to Fort Boise in March 1863. With Company H, the 1st Oregon Cavalry and Nez Perce Scouts, they made an expedition to Snake River in early June, 1863 to clear the area of the Snake Indians, who had been attacking travellers here for several years. As a band of emigrants, and their US Army escort, were due to pass through the Emigrant Road in August, additional troops were called on for protection. The pass safely made, Company I returned to Fort Boise, where it remained until its mustering out on 20 November 1865. Company K Mustered in at Fort Steilacoom, where they were stationed during their enlistment.

It existed from 1658 to 1917, when it merged into a colonial creation, the zelfbesturend landschap Kupang. Migration to Kupang Sonbai Kecil was originally a breakaway group from the united Sonbai (Sonba'i, Sonnebay) realm that dominated large parts of West Timor. The creation of the princedom was connected with the colonial rivalries of 17th century Indonesia. Sonbai allied with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) against the Portuguese in 1655. The VOC had a post in Kupang in the far west since 1653 and was engaged in warfare with Portugal, whose dominions included Larantuka on Flores and Lifau on the north coast of Timor. Part of the conflict was rivalry over the white sandalwood (santalum album), a precious item that grew in certain quantities on Timor. After a series of defeats at the hands of the Portuguese in 1657-1658, a part of the Sonbai congregation migrated to the Dutch stronghold in Kupang together with another VOC-allied group, Amabi. Another part remained in the inland under Portuguese surveillance, and became the Sonbai Besar princedom. The Kupang area was inhabited by the Helong people, but the newcomers were settled close to the Dutch fort without serious conflict with the original inhabitants.H. H√§gerdal (2007), 'Rebellions or Factionalism? Timorese Forms of Resistance in an Early Colonial Context, 1650-1769', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 163-1, pp. 18, 22. Colonial cooperation The Sonbai Kecil, Helong and Amabi groups were later joined by two further groups from north-western Timor, Amfoan (1683) and Taebenu (1688). These five congregations posed as loyal allies to the VOC, while the rest of Timor largely fell under the influence of the Portuguese Eurasians or Topasses. Up to 1749, the five allies lived in a state of low- scale hostility with the neighboring clients of the Topasses, in particular the princedom Amarasi. Sonbai Kecil was headed by a ruler known in Dutch records as emperor (keizer). In the official Dutch ranking, he was second in rank after the Helong ruler. In the Timorese political tradition, however, he was a non-active, in a symbolic sense \\"female\\" (feto) figure who was not expected to handle the actual affairs of the princedom. Actual governance was done by two executive regents who were \\"male\\" (mone) in relation to the ruler. They belonged to the mutually related Saubaki and Loewis families and usually cooperated closely with the Dutch authorities. The seat of the ruler after c. 1740 was Bakunase, several kilometers south of the centre of Kupang, on the top of a steep hill overlooking the Kupang Bay. Political development after 1749 The Topass attacked Kupang in 1749, but were decisively defeated by the VOC forces and their allies in the Battle of Penfui. After this event, a number of Timorese princedoms submitted to the VOC, so that the state of semi- siege of the Kupang area vanished. In 1776-1782, an abortive attempt was made to merge Sonbai Kecil with its sister realm Sonbai Besar in the interior, which in the meantime had fallen under Dutch influence. This arrangement failed badly, since the young ruler Alphonsus Adrianus hastily left Kupang in 1782 after intrigues against his person. After this the two Sonbai congregations remained divided. A side-branch of the ruling family, Nisnoni (\\"golden teeth\\"), came to power. The first of the line, Baki Bena, was visited by Captain William Bligh of the Bounty Mutiny, during the latter's stay in Kupang in 1789.G. Miller (1996), To the Spice Islands and Beyond: Travels in Eastern Indonesia. Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press, p. 65. The Nisnonis headed their congregation throughout the 19th century although the significance of the princedom seems to have dwindled somewhat. The territory included an area south of Kupang, to the south coast, but the borders with the other small princedoms in the Kupang area were ill defined. The ruler Isu Nisnoni was killed by a sniper from Amabi in 1889, although the colonial authorities successfully prevented a confrontation between the two princedoms.Koloniaal Verslag 1889-90, p. 22. Colonial reorganization In the early years of the 20th century, the Dutch implemented a real colonial rule in West Timor, and shortly after this they rationalized local governance in Kupang. In 1917, Sonbai Kecil, Amabi, Amabi-Oefetto, Kupang-Helong, Taebenu and Funai were merged into a larger self-ruling territory (zelfbesturend landschap) called Kupang (not including the town itself). From 1918, it was headed by a raja of the Nisnoni family, Nicolaas Isu Nisnoni. Under him were five fettors or district rulers. In 1930, his sphere of power was increased with Fatuleu, a princedom further to the east. Kupang was occupied by the Japanese in early 1942, who led a hard regime. Towards the end of their rule, Nicolaas Isu Nisnoni stepped down in favor of his son Alfonsus Nisnoni (r. 1945-1955). Revolution and independence Shortly afterwards, the Dutch troops returned, at the same time as the Indonesian Revolution commenced. Alfonsus Nisnoni led the local branch of Persatoean Demokrasi Indonesia, an association which aimed at eventual independence for Indonesia. He still chose to cooperate with the Dutch authorities, and in 1947, the town area of Kupang (vierkante paal) was incorporated in the zelfbesturend landschap Kupang. After the achievement of Indonesian independence in 1949, the council of Timorese rajas (Dewan Raja-Raja) agreed to gradually abolish the traditional administrative functions of the rajas. President Sukarno paid a visit to West Timor in 1950 and was received by Alfonsus Nisnoni on arrival to Kupang. In 1955, the raja rule ended in Kupang, and the Nisnoni family withdrew to the role of adat (customary) leaders and local government officials.S. Farram (2003), From 'Timor Koepang' to 'Timor NTT'.

Our main source for Gaidoald's life is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, which in turn depends on the lost Historiola of Secundus of Non, Gaidoald's contemporary. Nothing is known of Gaidoald before his accession to the duchy, although he was probably already a powerful and influential man. No sources speak of his family relations, and all speculation is based on onomastics. The -oald element in his name (from Proto- Germanic *waldanƒÖ, to rule) was especially common among the Agilolfing family of neighbouring Bavaria, who were of Frankish origin. Paul describes as \\"a good man and a Catholic in religion\\".Paul the Deacon (1907), History of the Langobards (Historia Langobardorum), William Dudley Foulke, trans. (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania), IV, x. (.) This meant that he was neither a pagan nor an Arian. In the schism of the Three Chapters then affecting northern Italy, he probably adhered to the Three Chapters, as did Secundus of Non and Bishop Agnellus of Trent. The duchy of Trent was strategically important, since it lay on the main road to Austrasia and Bavaria. According to Paul the Deacon, Gaidoald was assigned to Trent by King Agilulf, who was Euin's brother-in-law, their wives being sisters. The women were Agilofings and their brother, Gundoald, was rewarded with the duchy of Asti when he fled Bavaria in 589. These known connections strengthen the supposition that Gaidoald was an Agilolfing related by marriage to the king. Despite his obvious closeness to the royal family, Gaidoald later joined a rebellion,Panagiotis Antonopoulos, Early Peril Lost Faith: Italy between Byzantines and Lombards in the Early Years of the Lombard Settlement, A.D. 568‚Äì608 (Lambert Academic Publishing, 2016), p. 50, reads it not as a rebellion but as a dispute between the dukes that was mediated by the king. the precise dating of which is uncertain, but certainly after 600.Jarnut and Brown place it in 601, Antonopoulos in 603 or even after. For reasons unknown, Gaidoald and Duke Gisulf II of Friuli broke with Agilulf‚Äî\\"refused contact\\" in Paul's words.Lieve Van Hoof and Peter Van Nuffelen (eds.), The Fragmentary Latin Histories of Late Antiquity (AD 300‚Äì620): Edition, Translation and Commentary (Cambridge University Press, 2020), pp. 238‚Äì239. They were probably acting in concert with the Byzantine exarch Kallinikos, who launched an attack on Agilulf in 601.T. S. Brown, Gentlemen and Officers: Imperial Administration and Aristocratic Power in Byzantine Italy, 554‚Äì800 (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 72. The king's daughter and son-in-law, Godescalc, duke of Parma, were captured and Kallinikos achieved several military victories over Agilulf's forces. Not long after,Jarnut places it later in 601 or in 602, Brown in 602 or 603. Gaidoald and Gisulf made peace with the king. In celebration of the peace, Agilulf had his son Adaloald baptised at Monza on 7 April 603 with Secundus acting as godfather. While nothing is known of Gaidoald after his reconciliation with Agilulf, it is probable that he lived beyond 612, since in that year Secundus died and his Historiola came to an end. In that event, the date of his death would likely not have been known to Paul. No dukes of Trent are known after Gaidoald until Alahis in the 680s.

Milyukovs were recorded in the ancient nobility books of Moscow, Orlov, Simbirsk, St. Petersburg, Tver, Yaroslavl, and Tula Governorates. In the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous Milyukovs were voivodes, falconers, stolniks (cup bearers), and gentleman of the bedchamber. Origins The House of Milyukov stems from a \\"foreigner\\" Semyon Melik, who was a voivode, that fought alongside Prince Dmitry Donskoy and died in the Battle of Kulikovo.http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/67574/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B From him on, his children became Melikoff (\\"from Melik\\"), later on the name underwent \\"Russification\\" to become Milyukov. Since some early Milyukovs had Turkic names, such as Murza and Sabur, and the fact that Malik () translates as (King), allows to deduct that Semyon Melik was from Azerbaijani nobility. And given the time span of his appearance in Muscovy, most likely from recently fallen kingdom of Cilicia. Side branches Starovo-Milyukov () is a cadet line founded by Semyon Ioanovich, one of Semyon Melik's grandchildren, nicknamed \\"Stary\\" (; lit. old). Yelizary Tashlykov Starovo-Milyukov was a voivode of Oreshek (1595). Ivan Ionavich was a voivode of Rzhev-Volodimirove (1618). In the 17th century, numerous Starovo-Milyukovs were stolniks and gentlemen of the bedchamber. It seems that the branch became extinct in a male line after the death of Vasily Yakovlevich ‚Äî lieutenant-governor of Orenburg province.http://www.hrono.info/biograf/bio_s/starovo_milyuk.html However, the female line still exists in modern-day descendants of the third cadet branch of princes Volkonsky and ancient aristocrats Bibikoffs.http://rurik.genealogia.ru/Rospisi/Volkon3.htm Melyukov () (originally Milyukov) is the second cadet branch, and broke off during the early 1860s (shortly after the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire). Like many other northern noblemen, the Milyukovs were seriously affected by the abolition, because serfs, who could take winter jobs in the cities, were much more valuable possessions than often frozen land. The Milyukovs were forced to go into business for themselves or go broke. They started a trading company and made their name as merchants of fine furs, supplying, among others, the Russian Imperial Family and several German ducal houses. As a matter of fact, the Milyukovs were so successful that they owned one of the first commercial steamships in Russia. Later, during the Revolution of 1918, many members participated as members of White Army, this branch altering the spelling of its name to Melyukov to escape prosecution by the Cheka. Prominent members of the Milyukov family Milyukov family had numerous notable members throughout the centuries. Below is the list of the most illustrious members of their time. During the early 16th century, the most prominent one was Mikhail Ioanovich, who was a Grand Falconer and a namestnik of Bely Gorod (1506). One of the more illustrious Milyukovs in the 17th century was Semyon (d. 1699), the Archbishop of Smolensk, who stringently opposed the rule of Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna believing that it is not woman's business to rule and that brothers Peter (later Peter I of Russia) and Ivan (later Ivan V of Russia) should take over. . In the 19th century, Nikolay Petrovich was a very noteworthy nobleman in Tver; his godfather was Alexander I himself. He is mostly famous for owning and later causing the death of Grigory Soroka. The most famous Milyukov in the 20th century was Pavel Milyukov, founder of the Constitutional Democratic party, a Duma representative, and later the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Russian Provisional Government, 1917. Family estates Ostrovki Manor The Milyukovs had several estates around Lake Moldino near Tver. The main manor was Poddub'ye, with two other manors, Vsekhsvyatskoye and Ostrovki to the north and south, respectively, belonging to various Milyukovs. According to early 19th century records, Poddub'ye Manor had eight houses and 651 male field serfs attached to it, while Vsekhsvyatskoye had 34 house serfs and 254 male field serfs. Ostrovki Manor had 19 house serfs with an unknown number of field serfs.http://www.putnik.ru/dosug/poddub/3.asp An interesting fact is that the House of Smirnoff (of Smirnoff Vodka fame) had a family manor right across the lake from Poddub'ye and, just like the Melyukov branch mentioned above, had to start in business shortly after the abolition of serfdom.http://www.putnik.ru/dosug/mold.asp References Category:Russian noble families ","title":"Milyukov"},{"id":"20886269","text":"Gerhard \\"Gerd\\" Wiltfang (27 April 1946 in Stuhr, Lower Saxony - 1 July 1997 in Thedinghausen) was a German equestrian and Olympic champion.

The measure amended the Oregon Constitution and was passed by the voters. Background Section 43 of Article I of the Oregon Constitution (the Bill of Rights) establishes rights of crime victims in adult criminal and juvenile delinquency cases. Section 43 establishes the right to be reasonably protected from the accused throughout the adult criminal and juvenile delinquency process and the right to have decisions by the court about the pretrial release of the accused based upon the principles of reasonable protection of the victim and the public, and the likelihood that the accused will appear for trial. Currently, victims cannot enforce effectively any of the rights established in section 43 because section 43 provides that assertion of a victim's rights cannot invalidate a court ruling or suspend a case and because district attorneys are the only parties to a case that have authority to assert the victim's section 43 rights. Thus, victims cannot appear in court to assert their section 43 rights and cannot appeal from or otherwise challenge a ruling of a court denying any of their section 43 rights. The constitution prevents the legislature from providing victims such procedural rights by statute. Measure 52 amended section 43 of Oregon's Bill of Rights whereby victims could individually seek remedies for violations of section 43 \\"by due course of law.\\" Victims of crime could challenge a ruling of a court denying the victim a right secured for the victim by section 43. To effectuate their rights under section 43, the change allows victims to seek a delay in an adult criminal or juvenile delinquency case. Victims can pursue remedies in the criminal or juvenile delinquency case if one is pending, or, if no such case is pending, could initiate a case of their own. If the victim and the district attorney agreed, the district attorney can enforce the victim's section 43 rights. The measure authorizes the legislature to enact statutes providing the details of victims' remedial processes, including reasonable limitations on the time allowed for filing claims and the circumstances in which appeals are allowed. The measure continues the current provision of section 43 that prevents a recovery of money damages for violation of a victim's rights, and the current provision that prevents an assertion of a victim's rights from invalidating an accusatory instrument, conviction or adjudication, or from terminating any criminal or juvenile delinquency case at any point after the case begins. The measure also provides that no claim for a right established in section 43 shall suspend a criminal or juvenile delinquency case if suspension would violate a right of a defendant or alleged youth offender guaranteed by the Oregon Constitution or United States Constitution. Estimate of Financial Impact The direct financial impact to state and local governments is indeterminate because of the uncertainty of how many victims choose to bring an enforcement action to protect rights guaranteed under section 43, Article I of the Oregon Constitution, but denied by the court, district attorney or other public agency. The cost of this measure could increase the number of pretrial release hearings and increase the number of criminal defendants held and the length of incarceration before, during or after trials. Current provisions of the constitution establish a victim's right to be reasonably protected from the defendant during the criminal justice process, including pretrial detention of a criminal defendant. Current constitutional provisions require that there shall be no bail for a defendant accused of a violent felony where the defendant is a danger to the victim or others. Few of these criminal defendants awaiting trial are currently released, so the number of cases affected by this measure may be minimal. The measure authorizes the legislature to enact laws providing detailed procedures for claims by victims, including the establishment of reasonable limitations on the time allowed victims to assert their rights and prescribing procedures for appeal. Legislation providing such procedures and limitations could change the direct costs of this measure.

It was designed by Kaberry and Chard architects in the Art Deco/Art Nouveau/Spanish Mission style and built from 1929 to 1930 by W. H. Hones for George Conson. It is also known as Roxy Theatre and Big Red. The property is owned by Leeton Shire Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 February 2006.  History  The Roxy opened 7 April 1930 and was built for Riverina Theatre entrepreneur George Conson. The architects for the theatre were the noted firm of Kaberry and Chard. The popularity of the Roxy as a theatre name, imported from America's most famous movie theatre, reflects the importance and worldwide influence of movies and the glamorous American lifestyle depicted in Hollywood films, embraced by Australian society during the 1920s and 1930s inter-war period. The original Roxy Theatre, built in New York in 1927, was the world's largest showcase cinema from this era of theatrical movie palaces. It was established by and named after the master cinema showman himself, Samuel \\"Roxy\\" Rothapfel. \\"Roxy\\" as a name thus became synonymous with showmanship and dramatic cinema palaces from the boom time era of movies, wherever American cinema, Pop culture, and the theatrical American movie lifestyle became influential, admired and replicated. The theatre was built by Mr W. H. Jones (sometimes J. H. Jones), with a seating capacity of 1091 on two levels. The Roxy was built in a modified Spanish Mission Style, with large red neon signs that were visible from a great distance at night, owing to the theatre's location on top of a hill. As a result, the Roxy was nick-named \\"Big Red\\" . These lights were installed in 1933 when a full sized concert stage was constructed to mark its official opening. Australia's celebrated soprano singer, Miss Gladys Moncrieff , was engaged to sing in October 1933, as part of these opening celebrations. In 1977 the theatre's future was threatened with redevelopment. A meeting was called on 2 June 1977 by the Leeton and District Community Advancement Fund where the theatre's future was discussed including unanimously agreeing that the theatre should be retained as a Civic type building and also should be saved as a picture theatre. On 23 June 1977 the matter on the theatre was discussed further at the Leeton and District Community Advancement Fund's Annual General meeting with extensive investigations made and convinced of the buildings soundness and viability. The theatre was purchased by the community after a massive fund raising drive. $27,000 was raised by the Save The Roxy Committee and it was purchased for $75,000. Ownership was vested in Leeton Shire Council. The theatre was progressively upgraded to provide a larger stage area and new dressing rooms, with a present seating capacity of 880 people (414 downstairs and 474 in the upstairs lounge area). It is run by a small part-time staff and a voluntary management committee. In addition to showing regular films, the Roxy is now the venue for eisteddfods, discos, high school speech nights and the musical society's annual production. It has been restored to its original 1930s style.Pennay, 1996, 5  Description  The Roxy is a fine example of an Inter-war cinema designed in a modified Art Deco architectural style with Art Nouveau and Spanish Mission elements. The building is constructed of brick walls, with the primary facade rendered, the roof clad in corrugated iron and timber floors. The theatre has a full size concert stage with the original two levels of seating, a foyer and ticket box area and an integrated shop at the west side. Large red neon lettering for \\"Roxy\\" is mounted above the roof parapet in three directions, plus extensive neon lighting on the front facade. = Condition = As at 18 May 2005, the theatre is in good condition, although some maintenance required.

Dating from 1929, the Roxy Theatre also demonstrates and records the early introduction of American Pop culture into country NSW by the early Hollywood movies shown for the first time in this cinema, by the building function, original theatrical design and its name, which were all modelled on the world's largest showcase movie palace of the time, the original Roxy Theatre in New York of 1927. This early introduction of American Pop culture in the form of Hollywood movies and picture theatres, as represented by the Leeton Roxy Theatre, provided a major new form of entertainment, communication and society to NSW communities, as well as having a significant influence on Australian tastes of the time in architecture, fashion and design generally, language, music and behaviour. Built in 1929‚Äì1933, the Roxy Theatre is a fine example of an Art Deco cinema with Spanish Mission and Art Nouveau elements, which has survived remarkably intact. Of the hundreds of cinemas that once existed in country towns throughout NSW from the height of its popularity and influence, the Roxy now represents one of only eleven surviving country cinemas in the State that retain their original integrity. Designed by the major theatre architects of the time, Kaberry and Chard, the Roxy also illustrates one of only three surviving examples of their collection of work in NSW cinemas. The Roxy Theatre is also especially rare in NSW for retaining its original theatre interiors and spaces on two levels. Roxy Community Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 February 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre represents a rare surviving example of a country cinema from the heyday era of movies, which demonstrates the importance of \\"cinema going\\" during the first half of the 20th century in NSW towns before the advent of television. The scale of the theatre constructed to seat over 1000 patrons on two levels, the central location and landmark building design all illustrate the popularity and social importance of the cinema during this era when going to the cinema was second only to sport as the most popular leisure activity. In its style, era, function and name, the Roxy also demonstrates the early introduction of American Pop culture into country NSW, which in addition to providing a major new form of entertainment, communication and society, had a significant influence of popular Australian tastes of the Inter-war period, ranging from architecture, fashions and design generally to food, drink, language, music and behaviour. As became popular for cinemas of this boom time era of movies, the theatre name and dramatic Art Deco/Spanish Mission style of the building were all modelled on America's \\"Roxy Theatre\\" in Broadway, New York. This was America's most famous theatre and the world's largest showcase movie palace of the time. It was built in 1927, now demolished. The original Roxy was established by and named after the master cinema showman himself, Samuel \\"Roxy\\" Rothapfel. \\"Roxy\\" as a name thus became synonymous with showmanship and dramatic cinema palaces from the boom time era of movies wherever American cinema and the theatrical American movie lifestyle became influential, admired and replicated in local Pop culture, leisure activities, fashions and architectural styles. The construction of the cinema during the Inter-war period demonstrates a period of growth for Leeton following the incorporation of the town as a shire. The building has formed part of the town fabric for 66 of the 84 years of the town's existence, with the cinema continuing to serve the community for 75 years. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is associated with Gladys Moncrieff OBE, who was the most famous soprano in Australia since the retirement of Florence Austral for the period of the 1930s to the end of the 1940s. The building symbolises those lost country theatres in NSW in which Moncrieff appeared, in this case for a six-day concert in 1933 to celebrate the addition of the stage. The theatre is also associated with the major theatre architects, Kaberry and Chard, which illustrates one of their original designs largely intact. From a large body of work in NSW cinemas from this period, the Roxy is one of only three of their works which has survived with original integrity. Further research may also demonstrate associations with further personalities of significance in the history of entertainment, movie making or theatres in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre represents a rare surviving example of the work of the major theatre architects, Kaberry and Chard. It is a fine example of a country picture theatre from the Inter-War period, designed in a modified Art Deco architectural style with Art Nouvou and Spanish Mission elements, which has survived remarkably intact, internally and externally. It demonstrates an intact example of a two level theatre interior, retaining its original design, which provides a rare opportunity to experience a country picture theatre of this era. The scale of the Theatre, its dramatic facade and the prominent red neon signs are a major part of the Leeton landscape. Together with the nearby Walter Burley-Griffin designed water towers, the Roxy is a landmark building of the district. Its location at the crest of a hill makes the theatre visible for many kilometres into the countryside at night, particularly with its red neons aglow. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Roxy is valued by several generations of the Leeton and surrounding community as a key centre for social interaction, community events and entertainment for over 75 years. The theatre has been an essential part of the social and cultural fabric of the Leeton community for most of the town's period of existence. The Roxy was the first country cinema in NSW to be purchased by the community to save it from demolition in the 1970s, illustrating an advanced social value for these buildings and community activism for heritage, without which most cinemas from this era, including the original New York Roxy of 1927, have been lost. The money was raised in 1977 for the $75,000 purchase of the Cinema from a major fundraising drive and significant donations from the community of $27,000. The local nickname for the theatre. \\"Big Red\\", also indicates the emotional attachment the community holds for the building. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the Roxy is virtually intact from its construction in 1930 and 1933 additions, it offers potential for further research into the design, operation and cultural aspects of early theatres from the time when \\"talky\\" pictures were first introduced. This resource includes the associated memorabilia in the form of pictorial records of works and artists and a small collection of early cinema items. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Roxy is rare in the State as one of only three surviving intact country cinemas designed by the major theatre architects of Kaberry and Chard, of an original collection of 57 theatres commissioned from these architects throughout NSW. The Jadda Centre at Junee and the Montreal Theatre at Tumut are the other two surviving examples. The Jadda Centre was listed on the State Heritage Register in 2004. Only the Leeton Roxy and the Junee Jadda Centre retain the splayed false decorative walls each site of the stage opening, which is a distinctive and theatrical feature of the architects, Kaberry and Chard. Only Tumut has an original proscenium. The Roxy is also one of only eleven surviving intact country cinemas in NSW, where there had once been 351 cinemas in 289 country towns throughout NSW (in 1951). By 2003 less than 10 per cent \\"exist\\" as spaces recognisable as original theatres (that is, only 31). Only 11 of those exist with some form of obviously decorative interior and theatrical exterior. The Junee theatre is one of those eleven or one of only 3.1 per cent of the body of country cinemas that existed in 1951, comprising picture theatres built in the heyday of the silent and sound movies. The Roxy is a rare surviving example in NSW of an Inter-War cinema that retains the two levels. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre represents a rare surviving example of a 1930s country cinema from the heyday era of movies, which demonstrates the importance of \\"cinema going\\" during the first half of the 20th century in NSW towns before the advent of television. It also represents the early introduction of American Pop culture into country NSW, which had a major impact on Australian leisure activities, society, communication and fashions in architecture, clothing, music, behaviour and language.

He took many other pictures of life in the mining boom town of Tombstone, Arizona and the surrounding region. He recognized the value of his photographs to illustrate periodicals of the day and took his camera to the scenes of important events where he deliberately recorded them and resold pictures to editors nationwide. He was an eyewitness on October 26, 1881 to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which took place outside his photography studio. He took pictures of a number of Tombstone residents including Tombstone founder Ed Schieffelin, pioneer surgeon Dr. George E. Goodfellow, Wyatt Earp's wife Josephine, and others. He served as Cochise County Sheriff from 1895 to 1897. Most of his negatives were destroyed by two fires that burned his studio to the ground. His widow, photographer Mary E. \\"Mollie\\" Fly, donated his remaining images to the Smithsonian Museum before she died in 1925. His photographs are legendary and highly prized.  Early life  His parents were originally from Andrew County, Missouri. Shortly after Camillus' birth, his family migrated to California, eventually settling in Napa County. He became a farmer and on September 29, 1879, he married Mary (\\"Mollie\\") (n√©e McKie) Goodrich in San Francisco. Both were skillful photographers. She had previously been married to Samuel D. Goodrich but divorced him after two years of marriage. They left California and arrived in the booming mining town of Tombstone, Arizona Territory in December 1879.  Life in Tombstone  An image of the photography studio of C. S. and Mollie Fly burning in 1912, taken by Mollie Fly. In Tombstone they immediately opened a temporary photography studio inside of a tent. In July, 1880, they completed construction on a 12-room boarding house at 312 Fremont Street in Tombstone that housed their photography studio and gallery in the back, called the \\"Fly Gallery\\". Mollie Fly actively managed Fly's Gallery when her husband was away. She was one of the few female photographers of the era, taking pictures of anyone who could pay the studio price of 35 cents. It's unknown how they divided photographic duties between them, although all known photographs are attributed to him.

Mary (\\"Mollie\\") (n√©e McKie) Goodrich Fly was a photographer before she married C.S. Fly in San Francisco. They arrived in Tombstone, Arizona Territory in December 1879. Fly had a brother Webster who was also a photographer. Webster lived with Buck and Mary on June 4, 1880 through at least June 1882.US Census June 4, 1880. Tombstone, ArizonaCochise County Census 1882 In June 1880, Fly partnered with C. A. Halstead in a studio at the Harshaw mining camp near the Mexican border. Veteran journalist Thomas Gardiner, publisher of The Arizona Quarterly Illustrated, was seeking contributions and welcomed Fly's photographs. The premier July 1880 issue featured two of Fly's photographs as engravings. On October 26, 1881, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurred in an alley adjacent to his studio and boarding house. During the shootout, Ike Clanton ran away from the gunfight, telling Wyatt Earp that he was unarmed, and hid in their studio. Fly, armed with a Henry rifle, disarmed Billy Clanton as he lay dying against the house next door. On November 6, 1894, Fly was elected Cochise County sheriff, and served through January 1897.Ritchie, Jamie Cochise County Sheriff‚Äôs Office: The Beginning page 2 Fly and Mollie temporarily raised a girl named Kitty, though it's not known whether she was adopted or was from another relationship. Mollie ran the boarding house and studio while her husband traveled around the region taking photographs. = Pictures of Geronimo = \\"Scene in Geronimo's camp, the Apache outlaw and murderer. Taken before the surrender to Gen. Crook, March 27, 1886, in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico, escaped March 30, 1886.\\" \\"Geronimo poses with members of his tribe and General George Crook's staff during peace negotiations on March 27, 1886.\\" In March, 1886, Department of Arizona General George Crook received word that the Apache leader Geronimo would meet him in Ca√±on de los Embudos, in the Sierra Madre Mountains about from Fort Bowie. Fly learned of the meeting and on March 20, 1886, took his equipment and attached himself to the military column. During the three days of negotiations, Fly took about 15 exposures on 8 by 10 inch glass negatives. One of the pictures of Geronimo with two of his sons standing alongside was made at Geronimo's request. Fly's images are the only existing photographs of Geronimo's surrender. He coolly posed his subjects, asking them to move and turn their heads and faces, to improve his composition. John Bourke described how Fly took the historic photographs: The Mayor of Tucson, C. M. Strauss, was present. He later wrote that: Geronimo, who was camped on the Mexican side of the border, agreed to the surrender terms. A soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered as soon as they crossed the border. Geronimo and 25 of his followers slipped away during the night, costing Crook his command. = Earthquake study = A modern reconstruction of Fly's photography studio in Tombstone, Arizona. Fly became a heavy drinker and Molly briefly left him in Tombstone in 1887, taking Kitty with her to Florence. On May 3, 1887, a large earthquake struck Bavispe in Sonora, Mexico, destroying most of the adobe houses in Bavispe and killing 42 of the town's 700 residents. Tombstone Dr. George E. Goodfellow was fascinated by the earth movement and studied the earthquake's effects. He obtained a commission from the U.S. government to travel to the earthquake area, and on his second trip in July 1887 he brought C.S. Fly with him to help study and record the effects. They traveled over through the Sierra Madre mountains recording observations, mostly on foot. Goodfellow used Fly's images of the effects of the earthquake, the damaged and ruined buildings, and survivors to illustrate his report. As the Tombstone mines played out or flooded, Fly traveled to Fort Huachuca and Bisbee to take photographs of soldiers on their payday. On December 17, 1887 he toured Arizona with his camera and photographs. When the Tombstone economy further deteriorated, Fly made extended trips to Bisbee and Phoenix where he operated temporary studios. The Tombstone Epitaph noted his departure: \\"Mr. C.S. Fly, the well known photographer, leaves today for Florence, Phoenix and other points in the Territory ‚Ä¶ During his absence, Mrs. Fly also an accomplished photographic artist, will conduct the gallery in this city as usual.\\" In November, 1893, they moved to Phoenix and opened a studio there. When the business failed, Fly returned to Tombstone in 1894, and Fly accepted the Democratic nomination for Sheriff. = Role as photojournalist = George Warren first appeared in Souvenir of Bisbee published in 1900. Fly's caption was, \\"Discoverer of the Copper Queen Mine.\\" More than a century before the idea of photojournalism was born, Fly apparently recognized the value of his images as illustrations and furnished high-quality prints to editors of journals, magazines, and newspapers. He sent 16 of his photographs of Geronimo and his Apache band to the popular publication Harper's Weekly, which published six of them in their April 24, 1886 issue, giving Fly nationwide exposure. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26th, are only the known photographs taken of an American Indian while still at war with the United States. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he wasn't content to remain in his portrait studio, and took his camera to the scenes of important events, where he deliberately recorded them as candidly as his limited technology allowed. Fly capitalized on the popularity of the images and hired assistants to fill orders for 50 cents each, or $4.00 per dozen. Fly gained national attention again in 1888 when Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper published four more of his images taken during his trip to Mexico with Goodfellow. In 1891, Charles Scribner's Sons of New York published On the Border with Crook by Captain John G. Bourke, who had accompanied Crook on the expedition. It included the image of Geronimo's warriors lined up on a hill, but using the new halftone process, the first time a Fly photograph was printed using this technique. Though his drinking was becoming more and more heavy, he was elected as the Cochise County Sheriff in 1894 and served for two years. He chose not to run for Sheriff a second time in 1896. The town of Tombstone continued to suffer from a poor economy and he and Mollie relocated to the more prosperous industrial copper mining town of Bisbee. He produced pictures to illustrate the Copper King Mining Company's brochure in 1898.

Though Camillus and his wife had been separated for years, she was at his bedside when he died at Bisbee on October 12, 1901. She made arrangements to have his body returned to Tombstone, where it was buried in the new Tombstone Cemetery. Fly's Peak, the second highest named summit of the Chiricahua Mountains, is named in his honor.  Molly Fly continues business  Mary Fly continued to run the Tombstone gallery on her own after her husband's death and in 1905, she published a collection of her husband's Indian campaign photographs entitled Scenes in Geronimo's Camp: The Apache Outlaw and Murderer. Coral Henry, a young girl who the Flys cared for after her parents died, described Mollie as \\"about five feet of pure dignity, very plainly dressed, but in manner Queen Victoria had nothing on her.\\" In 1912, the boarding house burned to the ground for the second time. A replica has since been built. The fire prompted Mary to retire and she moved to Los Angeles. Before she died, she donated her husband's collection of images to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She died in 1925.  In popular culture  Geronimo, son, and two warriors.

Note: While Strawberry is not labeled on the map, the search for Strawberry Utah centers on the location for Strawberry. Most of the inhabitants live along the Strawberry River between the Strawberry River pinnacles and Starvation Reservoir west of the city of Duchesne, the county seat of Duchesne County. History 1880-1905 In the 1880s Elaterite was discovered in Skytzy, Lake, and Sam's canyon, side canyons of Strawberry. In 1893 Judge J.T. McConnell of Salt Lake City, secured a lease through Major Myton, the (Uintah) Indian Agent, and the same lease was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Judge McConnell joined Raven mining company in 1899 and was granted two years to prospect and register all mining claims and a 10-year lease to mine the properties.Salt Lake Herald, 1899-12-31, Page 20 In 1901 Raven had filed on 640 acres in Lake and Sam's canyons. A road was constructed from the old Fort Duchesne road at Rabbit gulch south and into the main canyon where the west end of liberty bridge sits today. The road followed Strawberry canyon up and forked at Skytzy canyon and then continued on to the mines in Sam's Canyon. Raven Mining company started commercial mining in 1899. The mines functioned for 30+ years and the minors lived around the mine sites and were mostly seasonal. In 1900 A.M. Murdock of Heber City, approached Major Myton of the Uintah Indian reservation to purchase grazing permits for his cattle. He was given grazing permits in the upper Strawberry river area. Dave Murdock, brother of A.M. Murdock, had secured a contract to provide beef to the Ute tribe at Fort Duchesne. In the fall of 1904 they brought the herd out of the high grazing areas and made it to the river bottoms which is now covered by Starvation reservoir. Very heavy snows stranded the heard. With no feed the entire heard died. Dave Murdock named the area \\"Starvation Flats\\" from this experience.\\"Highlights from Interview with Orson Mott\\", Interviewed by JP Tanner 1995 1905-1910 In 1905 the Uintah Indian reservation was opened by the federal government to homesteaders. The land in the river bottoms of the Strawberry river was very desirable because of the semi-arid nature of the Uintah Basin. The first pioneers into the area started clearing the river bottoms of the thick underbrush of cottonwood and willows. Around 1911 two communities had developed, one in the flats between the main canyon and Rabbit Gulch, that had been known as \\"Starvation\\", five miles west of Duchesne and \\"Upper Strawberry\\" that sits in a wider part of the canyon four miles further west. Although both communities were located on the Strawberry river and only four miles apart. Looking west on the old \\"Riverside\\" Riverside School, Main part built in 1912 1911‚Äìpresent, Upper Strawberry Although the farm land was very limited the community grew. The residents that did not own their own land worked as farm hands, ranch help, and miners. A.M. Murdock had a large cattle ranch in the upper part of the community that employed a number of people. R.M. Pope owned a number of Elaterite mines in Dry canyon and Sam's Canyon that employed a number of workers also. January 1, 1921, The residents in Upper Strawberry decided to change the name of the community to better identify themselves to the area residents. The name chosen was Riverside.Duchesne Record Feb 3, 1921 News from correspondents: Riverside The School Civic club presented a petition to the school board requesting the name of the school be changed from Strawberry No. 2 to Riverside.Duchesne Record Feb 10, 1921 News from correspondents: Riverside The school building acted as the community center and hosted church meetings, frequent dances, and activities. In the fall of 1920 the community had become frustrated with not getting bridges built across the river.Duchesne Record Feb 27, 1921 News from correspondents: Riverside They solicited the help of R.M. Pope and A.M. Murdock, who both had business interests in the area, for financial help in building the bridges. Six volunteers from the community agreed to work for half wages and the two bridges were built and completed within a couple months. This allowed for auto travel all the way through the community. Eventually the mines closed down and the big farms sold out. In the 1930s the CCC came in and replaced the original bridges with heavier cable support bridges. As the roads improved and the commute to the community of Duchesne became reasonable the Riverside School closed down. The community eventually lost its identity as Riverside and became a bedroom community of Duchesne. In 1952 high waters along the river flooded the canyon and washed out the CCC bridges and a couple of houses. The community spent the summer completely isolated until the county built new bridges in the fall. 1952 also brought the first power lines into the canyon. Before that some of the farmers used wind turbines and batteries for lighting. Phone service was brought in by Uintah Basin telephone in 1978. Pressurized irrigation water services were built for the lower end of the canyon in 2004. When you here someone say \\"I live in Strawberry\\", the old community of Riverside is where they live. Looking across Starvation now covered by the reservoir 1911-1970, Starvation/Lower Strawberry The community of Starvation was named after Starvation flats, a wide area of the valley where Rabbit Gulch and the Strawberry river met. The community became a very good place to gather sheep in the spring for shearing. In the spring of 1911 some 60,000 sheep were sheared in new corrals that had been built.The Duchesne Courier April 10, 1931 Page 1 \\"Duchesne 20 years Ago\\" Starvation also had the advantage of the main road into Heber ran through the middle of the community. In April 1915 a post office was established in Starvation and called Strawberry. The first post mistress was Mrs. Vaughn Jolley.The Duchesne Courier March 13, 1915 The first school in Starvation was built around 1911 and called the Strawberry school. On July 26, 1922 the school house burned to the ground from the sparks left by campersMyton Free Press July 27, 1922: School House Burns Bishop Ivie rebuilt the Strawberry school and had it back up and running by Sept 28 1923.The Duchesne Courier Sept 28, 1923: Local Happenings A small cemetery was built to service the residents on a plateau south-west of the community. In 1924 the school board closed down the school and bused the students into Duchesne School. Victory Highway was built through the middle of the community but in 1970 all the land was bought by the Bureau of Reclamation to make way for Starvation Reservoir. US-40 was re-routed to the south past the cemetery and over the freedom bridge that passes over the canyon were the most southern end of the community was. The community is now gone and any remnants are under water. Geography Strawberry sits in the river bottom of an ancient sea bed. The cliffs lining the canyon walls are made of sedimentary layers of shell. Strawberry is surrounding by Oil and Gas wells. Elaterite bubbles up like tar from the ground in areas along the river. In one location in the canyon natural gases bubble up into a spring and the associated foam can be lit on fire. Some of the springs in the area are saturated with alkaline and can be observed by the white deposits on the cliff ledges of the canyon walls.

The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, it formed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31\\\\. The tropical storm moved rapidly west-northwestward, steadily intensifying to a hurricane. It acquired peak winds of and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3, including Eleuthera and Harbour Island, causing severe damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure. Winds over affected many islands in its path, especially those that encountered its center, and many wharves were ruined. Subsequently, it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter, Florida, early on September 4 with winds of . The hurricane moved across the state, passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating. In Florida, the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations, and numerous trees were prostrated in citrus groves. The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction, and Stuart, Jupiter, and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged. Inland, the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain, causing a dam to collapse near Tampa. The storm caused $3 million in damage (1933 USD) after damaging or destroying 6,848 homes. Unusually, the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing winds struck South Texas; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession. Meteorological history The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27, although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west-northwest. On August 31, a nearby ship reported gale-force winds, which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Based on continuity, it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day. Moving quickly to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico. Early on September 2, a ship called the Gulfwing reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status. After passing north of the Turks and Caicos islands, the hurricane struck Eleuthera and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3, the latter at 1100 UTC. A station on the latter island reported a pressure of during the 30 minute passage of the eye. Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm, it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Interpolation suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status, or Category 3 status, on September 2. The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August, which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas. This hurricane instead maintained a general west-northwest track. After moving through the northern Bahamas, the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter, Florida, at 0500 UTC on September 4\\\\. A station there reported a pressure of during a 40-minute period of the eye's passage; this suggested a landfall strength of . At the time, the radius of maximum winds was , which was smaller than average. After landfall, the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state. It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5\\\\. A few hours later while continuing to the northwest, it made another landfall near Rosewood‚Äîa ghost town in Levy County, east of Cedar Key‚Äîwith winds of about . Turning to the north, the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia, dissipating on September 7 near Augusta. Preparations and impact Rainfall map for the hurricane in the southeastern United States On September 2, a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End, Grand Bahama, to Daytona Beach, Florida. While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne, Florida, with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville. Later that day, storm warnings, were issued from Key West to Cedar Key. About 2,500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee. By evening on September 3, high tides sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings; structures on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a \\"solid front\\" of plywood. Along the coast, observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land. The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas. Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around . Winds reached at Governor's Harbour, on Eleuthera, and on the Abaco Islands. The storm was farther away from Nassau, where winds reached . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on Abaco, washing away a dock. Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island, including to several roofs, the walls of government buildings, and the water system. The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses, leaving 100 people homeless. A road on Eleuthera was destroyed. Several islands sustained damage to farms, including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island. Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells, only five houses were destroyed, although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs. Collectively between North Point, James Cistern, and Gregory Town on Eleuthera, the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others. On Grand Bahama, where a storm surge was reported, half of the houses were destroyed, as were 13 boats and two planes, and most docks were wrecked. When the storm moved ashore in Florida, winds reached an estimated in Jupiter; these occurred after the eye passed. In West Palm Beach, anemometers measured at least winds with gusts to ; barometers ranged from . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Winds were not as strong farther from the center; winds were observed in Miami to the south, Titusville to the north, and Tampa on the west coast. Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of , and pressures dipped to . Inland, winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at in Clermont. At West Palm Beach, the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed. In Martin and St. Lucie counties, the storm was considered among the worst on record. The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations. At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged 75% of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper. At Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant. A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm. Winds leveled his nearby home. According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia. The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged. While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally. In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100 at the time. Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines. In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway. In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce. Crop damage was worst along the Indian River Lagoon; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses, and statewide, 16% of the citrus crop, or 4 million boxes, were destroyed. Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown. Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465 houses and destroyed another 383, causing over $3 million in damage. One person, an African American farm worker, was killed when his shack blew down in Gomez, a brakeman died after seven railcars derailed, and a child was killed by airborne debris. High rainfall caused flooding across Florida, notably near Tampa where waters reached deep. High rainfall of over caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break northeast of Tampa along the Hillsborough River. The break resulted in severe local damage, flooding portions of Sulphur Springs. Workers attempted to save the dam with sandbags, and after the break, most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood. Over 50 homes were flooded, forcing about 150 people to evacuate. Outside Florida, the storm produced winds of in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, respectively. In the latter city, the storm spawned a tornado, which caused about $10,000 in property damage. Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts, reaching over . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina. Aftermath In the Bahamas after the storm, a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to Eleuthera. After the storm, the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart. Of the 7,900 families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325 required assistance from the American Red Cross. Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.

Most common is the n-channel native transistor. Historically, native transistors were referred to as MOSFETs without specially grown oxide, only natural thin oxide film formed over silicon during processing of other layers. A native MOSFET is a transistor with nearly zero threshold voltage. Native n-channel transistors have a niche applications in low-voltage operational amplifiers and in low-voltage digital memory, where it functions as the weak pull-down. It is also used in low- voltage interface circuits. In most CMOS processes, native N-channel MOSFETs are fabricated on the \\"native\\" slightly p-doped silicon that comprises the bulk region, whereas a non-native N-channel MOSFET is fabricated in a p-well, which has a higher concentration of positive charges due to the increased presence of holes. The lower concentration of positive charges in the channel of a native device means that less voltage at the gate terminal is required to repel these positive charges and form a depletion region under the gate with a conducting channel, which translates to the native device having a smaller threshold voltage. The main disadvantages of the native transistor are the larger size due to additional doping mask, and sometimes lower transconductance. Native silicon has a lower conductivity than silicon in an n-well or p-well, as most MOSFETs are, and therefore must be larger to achieve equivalent conductance. Typical minimal size of the native N-channel MOSFET (NMOS) gate is 2-3 times longer and wider than standard threshold voltage transistor. The cost of chips including native transistors is also increased because of the additional doping operations.

The book was written by Ed Greenwood and was published by TSR. The module featured cover art by Jeff Easley and interior art by Scott Rosema. Contents According to John Selzer, the module is the \\"fourth of the FOR accessory line put out by TSR for the Forgotten Realms setting. The book explores the Harpers, a secretive force for good in the Realms. Along the way, quite a bit of Realm history is revealed, including notes on powerful people and organizations\\". The 128-page book begins with a two-page prologue written from the perspective of a number of fictional characters including Storm Silverhand, Danilo Thann, and Elminster. Page 5 is an introduction by Ed Greenwood explaining that this book is about the fictional Harpers organization, and thus begins with a story about them. Pages 6‚Äì18, The Code of the Harpers, explains what a Harper is and what they do; they are a secretive organization, making them hard to define, most are bards or rangers, and most seek to thwart evil when they can, in their own small ways. Page 19, Harper Runes, displays a number of runes used by Harpers to send messages to one another. Pages 20‚Äì36, The History of the Harpers, is as detailed a history of the organization as possible, stating that their origins go back to the ancient days of Myth Drannor. Pages 37‚Äì39, The Harpers Today, details the activities of the Harpers as of the writing of the book (1367 Dalereckoning). Pages 40‚Äì41, Master Harpers, describes the abilities of some of the most powerful members of the organization, who have been granted special blessings from a deity (usually Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel√ªne, Silvanus, or Tymora). Pages 42‚Äì52, The Senior Harpers, describes several powerful members of the organization: Alustriel Silverhand, Belhuar Thantarth, Cylyria Dragonbreast, Dove Falconhand, Elminster, Khelben \\"Blackstaff\\" Arunsun, Laeral Silverhand, Obslin Minstrelwish, and Storm Silverhand. Pages 53‚Äì61, Harper Heroes, details a number of characters previously featured in published Forgotten Realms novels, such as Artus Cimber, Brenna Graycloak, Myrmeen Lhal, Arilyn Moonblade, Olive Ruskettle, Danilo Thann, and Finder Wyvernspur. Pages 62‚Äì71, Some Selected Harpers, details the game statistics for a number of non-player character Harpers, such as Mintiper Moonsilver, and a partial roll of Harpers found in major cities throughout the Realms. Pages 73‚Äì81, The High Heralds, details those who were once part of the Harpers and are still their allies. Pages 82‚Äì84, Harper Allies, described a few characters who are not Harpers but are considered friends, including The Simbul. Pages 85‚Äì99, Harper Haunts, described a number of locations frequented by Harpers. Pages 100-101, Harper Magic: Spells, details the spells of the Harpers, including one very powerful spell. Pages 102-116, Harper Magic: Magical Items, presents numerous magical items likely to be found in the possession of a Harper. Pages 118-120, Foes of the Harpers, described some of the enemies made by the Harpers, including the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Cult of the Dragon, and more. Pages 121-122, Joining the Harpers, explains the ways by which prospective members may seek to join the organization. Pages 123-126, Harper Ballads, presents a selection of ballads and tunes sung by the Harpers. Page 127 ends the book with a description and monster statistics of the spectral harpist, a type of undead, of which Sylun√© is one. Reception John Selzer reviewed the module in White Wolf Magazine No. 40. He rated the book 4 out of 5 for appearance, complexity, and playability, and 5 out of 5 for concepts and value.

The measure amended the Oregon Constitution and was narrowly passed by the voters after an automatically triggered recount was taken. Background In November 2000 voters amended the Oregon Constitution by approving the ballot Measure 3, the Oregon Property Protection Act of 2000. The amendment imposed several restrictions on the ability of state and local governments to civilly forfeit property. This measure modified some of the restrictions on civil forfeiture of property. At the time this measure was put forward, Oregon's constitution required that a person's property may be forfeited only if the person is convicted of a crime. In addition, the forfeiting agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that the property was an instrumentality of that crime, or proceeds of that crime. This measure would allow civil forfeiture of instrumentalities and proceeds of other crimes that are similar to the crime that a person is convicted of committing, even though the person is not convicted of committing those other crimes. The measure required notice to the person and opportunity to challenge the seizure and forfeiture. This measure also specified circumstances in which property may be forfeited without a criminal conviction. The measure would allow forfeiture if the person took the property with intent to defeat forfeiture, the person knew or should have known that the property constituted proceeds or instrumentality of criminal conduct, or the person acquiesced in the criminal conduct. It also modified the standard of proof in civil forfeiture proceedings, requiring proof by preponderance of evidence to forfeit personal property, and proof by clear and convincing evidence to forfeit real property. The measure made an exception for cash, weapons or negotiable instruments found in close proximity to controlled substances or instrumentalities of criminal conduct, providing that claimant must prove by preponderance of evidence that the property is not subject to forfeiture. The measure removed the prohibition on using forfeited property for law enforcement purposes, and removes the cap on the amount of property that may be applied against the costs of the forfeiture proceeding. This measure made it so that forfeiture of animals were not subject to the Oregon Property Protection Act of 2000 and made various other housekeeping amendments to the act. Estimate of Financial Impact The direct financial impact of the measure to state and local governments was indeterminate due to the inability to accurately predict the number of civil forfeitures that may occur. If the frequency of civil forfeitures increases, then the amount of money going to the state and local jurisdictions would increase correspondingly. Any assets forfeited under the measure were distributed as follows: to the satisfaction of any foreclosed liens, security interests and contracts in the order of their priority; to the state or any of its political subdivisions for actual and reasonable expenses; and to the state or any of its political subdivisions for drug treatment programs. The measure would increase the revenue to the state and its political subdivisions, but the extent of the increase was unknown.

Located within the Ken-Khana kingdom, Bane was the birthplace of chief Jim Wiwa and forms the immediate eastern coastal boundaries between Rivers State and Akwa Ibom State. The main boundary that demarcates these two States is the Imo River on whose coastlines the town is conspicuously located. Bane's immediate neighbours on the other side of the Imo River are the Opobo and the Nkoro (Rivers State) and the Anaang (Akwa Ibom State). Geography Bane covers an area of approximately 10 square kilometres. Its topographical layout stands at about 100 meters above sea level. According to the Ordnance Survey Map of Rivers State (1980), Bane is positioned approximately on Latitude 4¬∞ 14 North and Longitude 3¬∞ 4 East. Bounded on the north are Eweh and Kwawa; Bere and Duburo on the east; and Buan and Kono to the west with the southern peripheries covered by the Imo River. By the 1973 National population census figures, the population of nine villages of Bane, excluding Kenwigbara, stood at about 8,500; one of the highest in the district. Governance Bane Town consists of ten autonomous villages - Bara, Deewii, De, Gbor, Kenwigbara, Laba, Luumene, Mae, Maa-or, and Nyorzorgor; each village under the traditional leadership of a \\"Mene\\" (Chief). According to oral tradition, the historical intricacies surrounding the founding of Bane conceded the founding of the town to Gbene-Onye Sasabaa; a traditional honour that conferred on him the royal title of \\"T·∫Ω-ere Bue\\" and \\"Mene Bue\\" Bane. By this historical tradition, the Gbene-Onye's Family of Bara is the only family that can produce the paramount king (Mene Bue) for Bane Town. Language The spoken language of the Bane people is Khana. However, Baneans speak a distinct aspect of the dialects of the Khana language. This distinct aspect of the Khana language is not only interesting, fascinating, and unique in usage, manner, and style but also stands Baneans out among other Khana language speakers. For example, Baneans use a consistent ‚ÄúI‚Äù - ikpotor (legs), ikpote (stick), ikpobari (piece of fish) as against the other dialectical variations - akpotor, ekpotor (legs), akpote, ekpote (stick), akpobari, ekpobari (piece of fish). Economy The location of Bane is significant. The land on which Bane is situated and the surrounding rivers ‚Äì Imo and Niger ‚Äì provide food, drinkable water, and other needed natural resources. Bane people practice an agro-based economy. Their traditional occupations are fishing and farming. Baneans specialise in breeding livestock, fishing, and food and cash crop production. They cultivate and grow akpakporo (cassava), zia (yam), ad·Ω≤ (cocoyam), tuu (three-leave yam), kpaakpaa (maize), nia-ee (fruited pumpkin) amongst others. They also breed pee (goats) and naa-na pee (sheep) naturally, a free-style breeding process that allows goats and sheep to roam and feed on their own in morning and return to their pens in the evening. Fishing is done with gb√≤ (nets), ilo (hooks), and other fishing traps such as gbee, gana, k·Ω≤r·Ω≤, and kpor. Basically, they have a fresh-salt water (tormaa-maala) system which makes their fishes salty and very tasty. Religion Bane is a secular community governed by both traditional and Christian religious beliefs and nuances. Ancestral and deity shrines (Lo√≤) and churches (Tor-Bari) can be found throughout the community. The Supreme Being, ancestors, gods, goddesses, land and water in the community are deified especially through yearly festivals such as De Bari (marking first-fruits harvest, dedicated to the Supreme Being), De Dua (New Yam Festival), and Tor- zi√° and Christian celebrations like Easter and Christmas. Cultural festivals Bane‚Äôs yearly festivals are held during yam harvest periods and at the beginning of every farming season. These festivals and celebrations are widely communal and remarkably family reunion moments-oriented. To mark the Dua Festival, yams are harvested and honoured (in form of libations) before powerful deities and in families. Masquerades like Mi√£, T·Ω≤·Ω≤bee, Zim, Waalu, and Ikina, among others, are showcased to mark these events. Aside the Bari, Dua, and Tor-zia festivals, other festivals and celebrations are also held in the community. Some of these festivals and celebrations held to commemorate the founding of the town, to pay homage to a particular ancestral land, or ancestors, gods, goddesses, deities or spirits, or taking of titles and for entertainment.

The University's student communications division made the decision to sell the station, despite public outcry, because of declining student participation and the desire to establish an endowment fund for VU's other student media. Nashville Public Radio, which had long been exploring the possibility of making WPLN-FM a full-time news and talk outlet, decided to purchase WFCL for $3.35 million in order to air the station's classical music library. The FCC approved the purchase and license transfer on March 18, 2014, and the transaction was consummated on May 22, 2014. On August 12, 2020, Nashville Public Radio announced its plans to move classical music programs to an HD subchannel of WPLN-FM 90.3 and relaunch WFCL in the fall with a local music format, which station officials claim would generate additional financial resources for the group.

It is the holder of Australian Financial Services Licence, and was listed on the ASX in July 2001. History On 14 January 2008, City Pacific launched a $1.4 billion scrip bid for Gold Coast operator MFS Limited (now Octaviar), however the bid failed. Redemptions and distributions have been frozen since early 2008, and the First Mortgage Fund has been declared illiquid by CP. The chairman of the board of directors is Phillip Graeme Downie (FCA). Recent events On 3 August 2009, receivers and managers were appointed to the company following a court decision that awarded control of a mortgage fund, the companies principal source of income as its manager, to rival Balmain Trilogy. This followed City Pacific freezing redemptions on the fund and unitholders voicing their anger at the companies management fees for controlling the fund. In October 2008, Phil Sullivan, a former bankrupt, left the fund partly as a result of death threats made against him. On 16 June 2018, Mr Sullivan (allegedly) entered into another Bankruptcy agreement with his administrators.

Dorothy Sarnoff (May 25, 1914 - December 20, 2008) was an American operatic soprano, musical theatre actress, and self-help guru. She had an active performing career from the late 1930s through the 1950s, during which time she sang in several operas with the New York City Opera and created several roles on Broadway, most notably Lady Thiang in the original 1951 cast of Rodgers and Hammerstein‚Äôs The King and I. After her performing career ended she launched a second highly successful career as an image consultant to business executives, politicians, and other public figures. Her personal client list included many notable figures, including U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, best-selling author Danielle Steel, and designer Paloma Picasso. She wrote a number of self-help books. BiographyBirth and education= Sarnoff was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the Berkeley Institute in 1931 and attended Cornell University, where she studied English and public speaking. As a participant in the school's glee club, she developed an interest in singing, and traveled to France for vocal training after receiving her bachelor's degree in 1935.Grimes, William. \\"Dorothy Sarnoff, a Pioneer of the Self-Help Movement, Dies at 94\\", The New York Times, December 27, 2008. Accessed December 29, 2008. =Opera and Broadway= Back in the United States, Sarnoff performed with the NBC Symphony Orchestra and the St. Louis Municipal Opera. She sang the role of Miss Pinkerton in the 1939 world premiere at New York City's Radio City Music Hall of the one-act radio opera The Old Maid and the Thief by Gian Carlo Menotti. She reached the finals of the Auditions of the Air talent competition run by the Metropolitan Opera, which helped her land a contract with the Philadelphia Opera Company (POC). She made her debut with the POC on January 13, 1942 as Antonia in Les contes d'Hoffmann. She sang several more roles with the company over the next three months, including Mim√¨ in La boh√®me, Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus, and Gracieuse in the world premiere of Deems Taylor's Ramuntcho. She later sang Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust with the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company in 1946.Free Library of Philadelphia, Folder: Philadelphia Opera Company [1940-43] and Bound: Phila. LaScala Opera Company: Programme: 782.1 P5324p 1945/46 - 1946/47 In October 1942 Sarnoff made her Broadway debut in the title role of Rosalinda, the New Opera Company‚Äôs long-running English-language version of Die Fledermaus that had been adapted by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Sarnoff appeared in more than 500 performances of the production. In 1945 she made her debut with the New York City Opera portraying the title role in Puccini's Tosca. She sang several more roles with the company over the next three seasons, including Marguerite, Mim√¨, Nedda in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, and Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen. Sarnoff returned to Broadway in 1948 as Maria the short-lived musical Magdalena. The production was notably the first work by composer Heitor Villa-Lobos to be mounted on Broadway. The year 1951 proved to be a banner year for Sarnoff when she portrayed Lady Thiang in the original Broadway cast of Rodgers and Hammerstein‚Äôs The King and I. As the king's head wife she introduced the classic song \\"Something Wonderful\\" and the song \\"Western People Funny\\". Apparently actor Yul Brynner, who played the King of Siam, taught her how to tense her abdominal muscles as a means of dealing with nervousness. Her last role on Broadway was Jessica Farrow, a plantation owner‚Äôs daughter, in My Darlin' Aida, a 1952 musical based on the Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida that transplanted the stories setting from ancient Egypt to Memphis, Tennessee during the American Civil War. The production starred Elaine Malbin in the title role and closed after just 89 performances. =Speech instruction= While having dinner with a publisher in the mid-1960s, she bemoaned the focus in women's magazines on beauty and clothing and was encouraged to pursue the subject of vocal quality. She started a program called \\"Speech Cosmetics\\", charging $25 for a sequence of six classes at the Alexander's department store in which women could learn to become better public speakers. A first semester was offered in October 1965 and a second semester in January 1966 featured both afternoon and evening sessions. The curriculum focused on helping women learn to improve the defects in their speech while emphasizing and highlighting what's attractive. The key phrase she used throughout the course was \\"sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful of rye\\", which contains what she described as the worst elements in the New York dialect, the \\"ng\\" sound and the mispronunciation of single vowels as diphthongs.Carey, Bernadette. \\"A Course to Improve Blemished Diphthongs\\", The New York Times, January 12, 1966. Accessed January 3, 2008. The program relocated to Manhattan's St. Moritz Hotel, with correspondingly higher prices for the course. This evolved into Speech Dynamics, which aimed to develop all aspects of personal presentation. Individual customers were paying $1,000 for her coaching sessions by the mid-1970s and she was receiving $2,000 per lecture. Her firm was purchased by Ogilvy & Mather in 1974, after the advertising agency sent two of its executives for training. Ogilvy & Mather proceeded to aggressively promote Sarnoff. Sarnoff taught Jimmy Carter to \\"lower the wattage of his smile\\". Speech Dynamics started with participants making a four-minute speech to Sarnoff focusing on their positive qualities. After listening to a recording of their speech, they would then identify the aspects of their speech that they would want to change and improve. Sarnoff would help address awkward mannerisms and eye movements and help improve posture and makeup. Her copyrighted mantra ‚Äî \\"I'm glad I'm here\\" ‚Äî was aimed at helping clients project the vibes of joy, concern and authority. as described by The New York Times in its obituary. Sarnoff \\"managed to combine the high tone of a traditional finishing school with the brand-building ethos of corporate consultancy\\". Her clients included Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin, whom she helped to soften his demeanor; President Jimmy Carter, whom she instructed to tone down his smile; and United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, whom she assisted to cut down on his blinking. She emphasized to her clients promoting books that they should mention the title of their work at least five to seven times in every interview. She wrote several books, including 1970's Speech Can Change Your Life, Make the Most of Your Best in 1981 and Never be Nervous Again in 1987. Marriages In 1957, she married Milton H. Raymond, an advertising executive. Her first marriage, to Dr. Shepard G. Aronson, ended in divorce. Both unions were childless and she left no immediate survivors. Death Sarnoff died at age 94 on December 20, 2008 in her Manhattan home.

The preserve, managed by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations, is notable for its rugged terrain. Rocky Woods offers of trails and former woods roads available for hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, dog walking, catch and release fishing, snowshoeing and cross country skiing. The preserve is part of a larger area of protected open space including the abutting Fork Factory Brook preserve, also managed by The Trustees of Reservations. Terrain Rocky Woods contains rugged, granite hills and knolls with occasional scenic vistas, boulder caves, rock formations, narrow ravines and defiles, glacial erratics, and local boulders. Six pondlets (originally constructed as fire suppression pump ponds) are located on the property: Chickering Pond, Echo Pond, Notch Pond, June Pond, Little Chickering Pond, and part of an unnamed sixth pond. The rugged, rocky terrain of Rocky Woods was formed via glacial action during the last ice age through glacial plucking and scouring. History During the colonial 18th century, Rocky Woods had been divided into common land woodlots. A network of logging roads, paved with asphalt shingle scraps, were cut through the property in the 19th century and used to transport granite quarried on site. The property was originally preserved by Dr. Joel Goldthwait in the 1920s, who donated the original parcels to The Trustees of the Reservations in 1942. Additional land acquired by other donors from 1946 through 1983 through more than ten gifts. Rocky Woods reservation in Medfield once had a rope tow ski area near Chickering Pond. The area had one steep slope that was just a bit too steep for beginners. Also, the area faced southwest, receiving much sunshine, which melted the snow quite often. Today, the area is growing in but is still visible, and totally open to the public at Rocky Woods. The old rope tow lift line clearing is still visible today, located just north of the north end of Chickering Pond. Recreation A network of trails span the property and connect with the abutting Fork Factory Brook reservation. The property contains a number of scenic vistas; most prominent is Cedar Hill, , which offers views to the east from eastern red cedar clad ledges. Dog walking is permitted on selected trails with designated on- and off-leash zones. Swimming is prohibited. Preserve amenities include picnic tables and pavilion, off- street parking lots, and restrooms. A visitor center also offers canoe rentals, fishing gear, snowshoe rentals and small concessions on weekends.

The fifth known storm of the 1941 Atlantic hurricane season, it was first observed to the north of the Virgin Islands on October 3\\\\. The storm tracked generally westward, reaching peak winds of before passing through the Bahamas.These wind speeds correspond to a Category 3 hurricane on the modern- day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, which did not exist at the time of this storm. After weakening somewhat, the storm later passed across southern Florida with winds of . The hurricane then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm, but regained hurricane intensity and made another landfall along the Florida Panhandle. Turning northeast, it crossed Georgia and South Carolina, and entered the Atlantic Ocean on October 8. In advance of the storm, preparations were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck particularly hard. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted US$675,000 ($ 2011 USD) in damage. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia. Meteorological history On October 3, the first indications of a tropical system were observed to the north of the Virgin Islands. A tropical storm is estimated to have been present late that day, though observations were very sparse near the cyclone. The next day, morning observations confirmed the presence of a circulation center, and soon afterward the cyclone underwent rapid intensification: it became a hurricane late that day, and 24 hours later, on October 5, the storm reached a peak of ‚Äîequivalent to a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Shortly afterward, the smaller-than-average, fast-moving cyclone tracked over Cat Island in the Bahamas, where a weather station indicated a pressure of inside the eye. The measurement coincided with light winds of , meaning it was not in the exact center of the eye, so a recent reanalysis found the central pressure to be somewhat lower, at . After striking Cat Island, the cyclone began a weakening trend and passed south of New Providence, seat of the Bahamian capital Nassau, early on October 6\\\\. At the time, the storm was still found to be a compact, well-developed hurricane. Later that day, it made landfall south of Miami in South Florida;Barnes, p. 162 observers reported that the small eye produced calm conditions at Goulds, near Homestead. The storm contained peak winds of ‚Äîequivalent to low-end Category 2 status‚Äîand a radius of maximum wind just from the center. Originally, the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) listed winds of at landfall in South Florida, but reanalysis determined that these winds occurred somewhat earlier, over the eastern Bahamas. Maintaining a small size, the hurricane moved through the Everglades, passing between Everglades City and Fort Myers. The storm entered the Gulf of Mexico as a strong tropical storm and broadly curved toward the northwest, tracking offshore along the west coast of Florida. It remained over open waters and recovered its intensity until the following day, when it made landfall at Carrabelle with winds of , equivalent to a high-end Category 1 hurricane, and a measured central pressure of . The cyclone still exhibited a small radius of outermost closed isobar but had reduced its forward speed. Turning north and then northeast, the storm moved beyond Tallahassee and entered Georgia. It weakened as it progressed inland, and after passing through South Carolina, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on October 8 with winds of . While over water, the storm re-intensified, reaching peak winds of on October 9\\\\. The cyclone kept its intensity for two more days as it moved toward the southeast, executed a small loop, and turned generally toward the east-northeast, passing south of Bermuda on the night of October 11. The storm became extratropical on October 12, fully dissipating the next day. Preparations During the days before the storm's arrival in Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40 tropical cyclone- related advisories. Extensive preparations that resulted in a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials‚Äîincluding bread and butter‚Äîas people prepared for the storm. Evacuations were recommended from Homestead to Key West, and three Coast Guard planes dropped warnings to boats near the Florida coast. The Civilian Conservation Corps also evacuated 150 of its workers from West Summerland Key to Key West. Local chapters of the American Red Cross organized first-aid stations and shelters; transportation was provided to those who were unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm. The state also opened all of the school buildings in Dade County as emergency shelters. ImpactBahamas= In the Bahamas, where considerable property damage was reported, the storm killed three people. Winds in Nassau reached . City streets were filled with debris, including a schooner, four sloops, and numerous other boats deposited by the winds on Nassau's Bay Street. The winds knocked down trees and power lines, resulting in fires and extensive power outages. Along the coast, boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed against seawalls. No casualties occurred in the city. A schooner, the Goodwill II, sank during the storm. Properties and gardens received significant damage. On Cat Island, the storm produced of rainfall. Two men, Christopher Whymss and Salathiel Johnson, drowned near Andros Island after trying to reach shore from a drowning schooner. One man, Samuel Seymour, was killed on Cat Island after his home was toppled by the wind, and several other injuries were reported on the island. \\"Most homes, all churches, and most public buildings\\" on Cat Island were also destroyed by the storm. The storm also downed telephone lines and destroyed crops. As a result, the Duke of Windsor, governor-general of the Bahamas, cabled to the Red Cross for assistance, and a ship carrying \\"food, clothing, building materials and seeds\\" was quickly dispatched to Cat Island. According to a survey conducted a few days after the hurricane, 300 families on Cat Island were left homeless as were 120 families on Watlings Island. To aid these families, the Duke of Windsor announced on October 7 that he would establish a relief fund for those affected by the storm. =United States= Map of Florida marking the area first affected On making landfall, the storm generated high winds at the Fowey Rocks Light, although they were below hurricane force. A peak wind gust of was reported at Dinner Key with sustained winds up to . Unusually little rain fell in association with the storm; of precipitation was reported in Miami, while locations closer to the center of the cyclone received less than .Kleinberg, p. 70 The light rainfall was evident throughout southeastern Florida, except for the Florida Keys, where thunderstorms enhanced the precipitation. This aspect of the storm was considered highly unusual, as most tropical cyclones are characterized by heavy rainfall. According to one study, the unusual precipitation patterns can be attributed to one of two possible conditions: \\"the air might have been too dry\\", or \\"the horizontal convergence of air might have been insufficient to produce a large enough transport of moisture upwards\\". The intense winds blew salt water several miles inland; due to the lack of rainfall, the salt burned vegetation throughout the region. The high winds brought down trees and utility poles and shattered some windows in Dade County. No deaths were reported in the region, although minor damage was inflicted on communication lines and homes and several injuries were reported. Several communities lost electricity. Some hospitals were left without power, forcing the delivery of six babies by candlelight. The storm injured seven people in the Miami area, including five firefighters who were injured \\"as they fought a blaze fanned by the high winds\\" of the hurricane. As the hurricane tracked inland, it passed over the Everglades, producing winds of at Everglades City. Along the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee, winds gusted to ; barometric pressure there fell to . Storm surge in the region triggered foot-deep flooding of some streets in local towns. Docks and fishing equipment suffered extensive damage in the region. As the hurricane passed offshore, winds reached near Tampa Bay. The storm also grounded a fishing schooner from Cuba off the coast of Collier County, Florida. Although no one was injured, members of the schooner crew were detained by immigration authorities. A Cuban schooner washed ashore by the storm. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane made another landfall at Carrabelle on the Florida Panhandle. Winds in the region were estimated at , and tides ran at up to above normal. In Tallahassee, the winds downed trees and power lines and scattered debris, rendering roads impassable. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that \\"at the height of the wind several hundred Tallahasseeans were seen rushing into their yard to gather pecans which were knocked down by the swaying trees\\".Barnes, p. 163 The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region; replacement automobiles were sparse, as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army.Two months after the storm, in December 1941, the United States entered World War II and new vehicles became unavailable, forcing residents to resort to horse-drawn carriages for transportation. See Barnes, p. 163 Despite a lack of electricity due to the winds, the Tallahassee Democrat managed to publish 6,000 copies of a special storm edition. Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks; however, upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary. Considerable crop and property damage was reported; total losses in the state were estimated at US$675,000 ($ in today's terms). Seven injuries were reported, and five men drowned in the storm tide at a fishing net drying yard in Panacea, Florida. Initially, there were reports of 20 missing fishermen. 34 Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle when 10 boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided. The fishermen's supply of food was destroyed by salt water, but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries. After their rescue, they reported that five men had drowned in a small boat nearby. The storm was still producing high wind gusts as it tracked into Georgia, killing one person and leaving a trail of considerable damage as far north as Albany. The single death in Georgia was a 16-year-old girl, Frances Hester, of Pavo, Georgia, who died after tripping over an electrical wire downed by the storm. Up to of rain fell within the state. The storm passed through South Carolina with little damage. Throughout parts of the southeastern United States, rainfall associated with the hurricane was unusually light and unevenly distributed along its track.

A contingent of some 3000 troops from the British and Indian \\"Suakin Field Force\\" led by Major General Sir John Carstairs McNeill VC, GCVO, KCB, KCMG (under the overall command of General Gerald Graham) was attacked by a Mahdist force under the leadership of Osman Digna. The Mahdists were heavily defeated, losing some 1000 of their 2000 fighters as compared to the loss of 70 British and Indian soldiers plus over 100 casualties. Background The sacking of Khartoum and the killing of General Gordon and the massacre of thousands of civilians at the hands of Mahdist warriors in January 1885, together with the failure of the relief effort of General Wolseley's Nile Expedition, prompted the British government to revive plans to build a railway between the port of Suakin on the Red Sea and Berber on the River Nile some 300 miles north of Khartoum, to provide a supply route for Wolseley's force in further actions against Khartoum. In order to provide protection from Osman Digna's Mahdist tribesmen who were well established in the coastal area, and to supervise the construction of this new railway, a second Suakin Field Force of some 13,000 men was assembled under General Graham who had commanded the first Suakin expedition the previous year. The force arrived in Suakin on 12 March 1885. PreludeSuakin Field Force= Graham's Suakin Field Force consisted of a combination of British and Indian troops totalling some 13,000 men.

The expedition successfully achieved its objectives (at a cost of two officers and a handful of men) and returned to Suakin the same night.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.12-13 =Tofrek Expedition, 22 March 1885= Graham's next objective was to attack Osman Digna's headquarters at Tamai, some 12 miles southwest of Suakin ‚Äì a distance too great to be covered in a single day's march. It was therefore decided to establish two supply depots en route, in the form of zeribas to store the equipment, water and rations to support the main assault, Graham assigning responsibility for this task to Maj. Gen. Sir John McNeill V.C. K.C.B. K.C.M.G.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.17 McNeill was instructed to leave Suakin at dawn on 22 March with a force of approximately 3000 men including:Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

[Note: Later in the morning a squadron of the 20th Hussars under Major Frank Graves was sent out from Suakin by General Graham to report to McNeill, presumably to render assistance, but without any specific instructions or information.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.64] Tools, materials, water, provisions, Gardner guns and ammunition were to be carried by some 1500 transport animals (camels, mules etc.). Part of the force was to march out the full 8 miles to construct the larger No. 2 zeriba, while the rest stopped at the 5 mile point to construct the No. 1 zeriba. Small garrisons were to remain in both zeribas while the bulk of the force was to return to camp the same evening. However, on the morning of 22 March, General Graham personally made a last-minute change to the plan. Instead of taking the Kassala Road, a well established track leading southward out of Suakin and thence diverting southwest along a route that Graham had taken the year before (1884) when he fought against Osman Digna at the Battle of Tamai, he instructed McNeill to head southwestwards out of Suakin into virgin country.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.31 McNeill and his troops quickly found themselves struggling through a dense jungle of mimosa bushes whose low-level branches covered in sharp thorns slowed progress and caused havoc among both troops and transport animals.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.45 Some 6 miles out of Suakin, McNeill came across an open area of about half a mile square from where he telegraphed back to Suakin proposing that he stop and build a zeriba within the clearing. The reply instructed him to do as he proposed and that in the circumstances, the plan to build a second zeriba at the 8 mile point should be cancelled.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.50 =Tofrek Zeriba= \\"Zeriba\\" or \\"zareba' is a native word meaning \\"an improvised stockade; especially, one made of thorn bushes\\". This is exactly what was to be constructed. Mimosa trees had to be cut down, arranged in line to form the walls of the enclosure, stacked up to a height and density to afford protection to the garrison enclosed within it, their trunks being tied together prevent them from being dragged away by the enemy.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.62 Additional protection was provided by a cordon of entrenchments with sandbag parapets around the inside perimeter of the stockade. Construction of the zeriba was the responsibility of the Royal Engineers and Madras Sappers with British and Indian troops assisting in the work of cutting the trees and dragging them into position.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.61 Others were tasked with unloading water and stores and with protecting the working parties from enemy attack. Those that could be spared were ordered to rest within the protection of the zeriba, few having had much opportunity to sleep during the preceding night. alt=Sketch map showing disposition of troops etc. during Battle of Tofrek 22nd March 1885 The diagram at right illustrates the disposition of troops etc. immediately before and during the battle. Indian troops were positioned along the northern, southern and western perimeters of the (unfinished) zeriba. The two redoubts were manned by British troops ‚Äì the Royal Marine Light Infantry in the completed northern redoubt and half of the Berkshire battalion in the uncompleted southern one. Working parties of engineers and others were completing the zeriba's walls. Outside the zeriba, on the eastern side, the other half the Berkshire battalion guarded the camels and mules, preventing them from straying into the bush as they awaited the march back to Suakin. By 2:00pm, the northeastern redoubt was largely complete, and work was concentrated on the southern one. With their rifles piled inside the redoubt, parties of men were at work out on the western edge of the clearing out in front of the Sikh lines, felling trees to complete the redoubt.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.65 It was expected that the southern redoubt would have been completed by 3:00pm, when the second half of the Berkshire battalion would withdraw inside it while the transport returned to Suakin under the protection of the Cavalry, Engineers, Indian battalions and others.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.66 Battle Around 2:45 pm scouting Lancers reported to McNeill that the enemy was gathering south and west of the zeriba and advancing towards it. McNeill immediately ordered all working parties to retreat back into the zeriba and to take up their arms, when at the same moment the Cavalry galloped into the clearing with large numbers of Arabs hard on their heels.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.68 The main attack came from the south and west of the zeriba. The British and Indian troops held their ground except for the Bengal contingent lined up on the south side, who were thrown into disorder by the Cavalry and Arabs charging through their lines. After firing a few scattered volleys, the Bengalese turned and fled for cover inside the zeriba. Large numbers of Arabs who had forced entry into the southern redoubt were quickly dispatched by the half- battalion of Berkshires defending it, 112 bodies later being counted inside the enclosure. Meanwhile, the Arabs succeeded in stampeding the transport animals towards the central square and the northern redoubt, thereby gaining cover for themselves as they attacked from the eastern side. An eyewitness recalled: \\"Everything seemed to come at once: camels, transport of all kinds, water carts, ammunition mules, 17th Native Infantry, Madras Sappers, sick- bearers, Transport Corps, Cavalry and Arabs fighting in the midst. All these passed close to me, and went out on the other side of the zeriba, carrying away with them a number of the Marines and Officers who eventually got together and returned. The dust raised by this crowd was so great that I couldn't see anything beyond our zeriba for a minute or two, and it was impossible to see who was standing or what was likely to happen. The men behaved splendidly and stood quite still. It was the highest test of discipline I shall ever see.\\"Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.77 The Arabs lingered for another hour threatening further action, but at 4:15 they finally withdrew leaving large numbers of their dead and wounded behind.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.79 Further isolated attacks were made by injured Arabs and by some feigning death, it being reported that \\"when our men sought to afford aid to some of the enemy who could not walk, the latter crawled towards them with their spears between their teeth, striving even yet to slay a Kaffir.\\"Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.88 Aftermath It was estimated that over 1000 Mahdists died out of an attacking force in excess of 2000. The tally of dead and wounded amongst the British and Indian troops was more accurately estimated as follows: * Killed: 4 officers, 66 men, plus 34 \\"followers\\"; * Injured: 8 officers, 125 men, plus 18 \\"followers\\"; * Missing: 1 officer, 35 men, plus 122 \\"followers\\".Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.335. Several of the missing, including large numbers of \\"followers\\" (camel drivers etc.) were subsequently found, however the above figures for dead and wounded were almost certainly underestimates since they were produced immediately after the battle and therefore did not include those who subsequently died of their injuries, or those among the missing who were later found dead or injured. The following day the British buried their dead to the northern and western sides of the zeriba, while the Indians cremated theirs according to their custom.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. p.89. The bulk of the force then returned to Suakin bringing the wounded with them. The zeriba remained garrisoned until 6 April after which it was abandoned. On 1 May, a reconnaissance party passed by the site to find that the zeriba had been burned and destroyed by the enemy, ending its short and rather purposeless existence.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. pp.343‚Äì344. Within two months, the Gladstone government, in pursuing its anti-imperialist policies, took the opportunity provided by the Panjdeh crisis to abandon both the railway and Britain's military campaign in Sudan. General Graham and his Suakin Field Force were evacuated from the port city on 17 May 1885. =Post Mortem= The book \\"The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885\\" by William Galloway was written shortly after the battle. It appears that the writer's intention was to correct several erroneous statements that appeared in both official and press reports of the battle. Galloway was particularly critical of General Graham's planning of the Tofrek expedition on three counts:Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ. Naval And Military Press Ltd. pp.24‚Äì25. # Compared to the earlier expedition to Hashin which Graham commanded himself, which had been protected by four squadrons of British cavalry and a regiment of Bengal cavalry acting as scouts, the Tofrek expedition which he delegated to the command of General McNeill had only one squadron of Lancers plus a company of Mounted Infantry to provide warning of enemy activity; # Whereas Graham had the protection of a battery of Royal Horse Artillery able to shell the enemy at long range, no artillery was assigned to McNeill's force; # Whereas the ratio of men to transport animals had been over 5:1 in the earlier expedition, it was no more than 2:1 for the later one, resulting in much greater difficulties in keeping control of the animals. Galloway was even more critical of Graham for his last-minute change to McNeill's marching orders when he instructed the column to march southwestwards into uncharted territory instead of following the established track towards Tamai as originally planned, and which Graham himself had used when attacking Tamai the year before. In consequence McNeill and his troops found themselves struggling through a jungle of mimosa bushes with long low-lying branches covered in sharp thorns which made progress both slow and difficult while affording the enemy excellent cover for the surprise attack that they launched later in the day. Galloway also claimed that intelligence reports that the enemy was planning a major attack on the 22nd March were not passed on to McNeill before he left Suakin.Galloway W., The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885, Reprint of 1887 Original Edition, publ.

He lived in Greenfield. In 1854 he was elected to the Missouri State Senate. He resigned in 1855 to accept a captain position with the First U.S. Army Cavalry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. After serving only four months, he resigned the captain position due to illness and returned to Greenfield. In 1856 he argued to allow \\"squatter sovereignty\\" to solve the Bleeding Kansas problem (the argument was that Missourians should be allowed to vote deciding whether Kansas should be a slave state and they could do that by claiming land in Kansas). In 1857 he was a publisher of the Greenfield Southwest newspaper. In 1858 Coffee ran again for the Missouri Senate but lost in the Democratic primary to B.H. Cravens. He ran for the Missouri House of Representatives and was elected Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives in his first term. In 1860 he lost a Democratic primary for Missouri Secretary of State and returned to law practice. =Missouri militia= With the beginning of the American Civil War, Coffee raised a regiment in Dade County and was commissioned as a colonel in the Confederate Army. After Sterling Price retreated from Missouri, Coffee stayed in the state. He harassed Union troops in skirmishes around Neosho, Missouri. One of his most famous skirmishes was the Battle of Lone Jack. Coffee's troops were routed by Union troops on August 12, 1863 at Pineville when 60-70 of his men were killed. In October 1863 Coffee's troops captured the Union garrison in his hometown of Greenfield and burned the courthouse. Among the destroyed records was his land deed, which caused him to lose his land claim in Missouri. After the Pineville conflict, Coffee was passed over for promotion for General Joseph O. Shelby, who was given command of Missouri forces. Coffee left for Arkansas, where he attempted unsuccessfully to recruit a new regiment. In late 1864 or early 1865, he moved to Waco, Texas with his large family. Post-Civil War After the surrender of the Confederates, Coffee refused a request by Shelby to continue the fight under the flag of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. He formally surrendered to George Armstrong Custer on July 26, 1865 in Austin, Texas. He died in Georgetown, Texas.

Circa 1904 Algemeen Handelsblad, an Amsterdam newspaper, sent a correspondent to investigate the Bah√° º√≠s in Persia. The first Bah√° º√≠s to settle in the Netherlands were a couple of families -- the Tijssens and Greevens, both of whom left Germany for the Netherlands in 1937 as business practices were affected by Nazi policies. Following World War II the Bah√° º√≠s established a committee to oversee introducing the religion across Europe and so the permanent growth of the community in the Netherlands begins with Bah√° º√≠ pioneers arriving in 1946. Following their arrival and conversions of some citizens the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Amsterdam was elected in 1948. In 1957, with 110 Bah√° º√≠s and nine spiritual assemblies, the Bah√° º√≠ community in the Netherlands first elected its own National Spiritual Assembly. In 1997 there were about 1500 Bah√° º√≠s in The Netherlands. In 2005 the Netherlands had 34 local spiritual assemblies.  First Contact  First newspaper coverage = The first mentions relating to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the Netherlands were in Dutch newspapers which covered some of the events relating to the B√°b√≠ movement, which the Bah√° º√≠ Faith regards as a precursor religion. The Opregte Haarlemsche Courant covered the attempt on the life of Nasser-al-Din Shah, by some B√°b√≠s, on October 11, 1852 - a couple months after the incident. The incident was reported a few days later by the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant and then by Dagblad van 's Gravenhage, all of which had borrowed the stories told of the event from London or Paris based newspapers. The accounts presented to the Dutch public, however, were generally untrue and described that the Babis being a communist organization, sanctioning the sharing of wives, believing in the transmigration of souls, and were in open violent revolt. During a second assassination attempt on the same Shah in 1896 by a group not associated with the B√°b√≠s, as recognized in Persia at the time, western newspapers continued to blame the Babis for some years afterwards. = Dutchmen in Persia = In 1879, on the developing trade relations initiated by some Dutch business men, Dutchman Johan Colligan entered into partnership with two Bah√° º√≠s, Haji Siyyid Muhammad-Hasan and Haji Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn, who were known as the King and Beloved of Martyrs. These two Bah√° º√≠s were arrested and executed because the Im√°m-Jum'ih at the time owed them a large sum of money for business relations and instead of paying them would confiscate their property. Their execution was committed despite Johan Colligan's testifying to their innocence. In 1890 Colligan was also witness to a riot against Bah√° º√≠ farmers near Isfahan which also revealed several British diplomats attempting to avert or redress the riot. Another Dutchman, C.F. Prins, witnessed and attempted to give relief to those Bah√° º√≠ who suffered in another riot in Yazd against them in 1891. In the same year, Dutchman Henri Dunlop had trade relations in Shiraz with Afn√°n-i-Kabir, brother to the wife of the B√°b, and acquired several Bah√° º√≠ manuscripts which he offered to professor Edward Granville Browne and later to professor Michael Jan de Goeje of Leiden University who published the first Dutch academic article on the Babis/Bah√° º√≠s in October 1893. The portrait of the Babis from these accounts and articles communicated to the Dutch public was different than the early reports, and was of being prone to engage with foreigners, being monogamous, and seeking out civil authorities for protection from Muslim mobs. Later in 1904, Maurits Wagenvoort went as a correspondent for the Algemeen Handelsblad newspaper specifically to investigate the Bah√° º√≠s in Persia and had numerous interviews with Bah√° º√≠s.  History in the Netherlands  Before World War II = The first interests in the religiosity of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the Netherlands come in 1912-1917 when the Theosophy Publishing Society in Amsterdam translated and issued a few booklets and brochures about the religion. The first Bah√° º√≠ to enter the Netherlands came in December 1913 when Daniel Jenkyn, from England, travelled through the Netherlands. It is also known that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son and successor to the founder of the religion, wrote a letter to Julia C. Isbr√ºcker, the chairperson of the Esperanto movement in The Hague.Dwight Barstow Collection - Table of Contents of Copies of  ªAbdu'L-BAHA TABLETS & other stuff of the Barstow Collection In 1920, two Persian Bah√° º√≠s, Ahmad Yazdani and Hand of the Cause Ibn-i-Asdaq, brought a letter from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to the Central Organisation for Durable Peace in The Hague. The first Dutch Bah√° º√≠ appears to have been Hajo Mesdag, who became a Bah√° º√≠ in Egypt after meeting Martha Root and reading John Esslemont's book titled Bah√° ºu'llah and the New Era, and visited Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, in Haifa in 1925. A brochure of the French Bah√° º√≠ community mentions that the first Dutch Bah√° º√≠ was a Vanda Haack (or Van der Haack), about whom little is known sofar.La Foi Bah√° º√≠e en France, 1998 Later in the early 1930s Louise Drake Wright, a travelling American Bah√° º√≠, visited the country on the instructions of Shoghi Effendi on three separate occasions: the summer of 1932 (Amsterdam); March‚ÄìJune 1933 (Amsterdam and The Hague); January‚ÄìApril 1934 (The Hague). During this time she met with women's and peace groups, Quakers, Theosophists, Esperantists, and female leaders of thought such as the founder of the Netherland Girl Guides, and libraries in Amsterdam and The Hague. The earliest Bah√° º√≠ family in the Netherlands were the Tijssens: Emma Margaret Tijssen was a German Bah√° º√≠ who had come to The Hague in 1937 with her husband. They were soon joined in the autumn of 1937 by two other Bah√° º√≠s, Max and Inez Greeven. Mr. Greeven was an American businessman who had become a Bah√° º√≠ in New York City in 1927 and moved to Germany in 1930; the family's move to The Hague in 1937 was due to business restrictions in Germany; the Greevens remained in the Netherlands until 1940. = After World War II = In 1946 the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States formed the Bah√° º√≠ European Teaching Committee to teach the religion in Europe. This endeavour oversaw the arrival of a number of Bah√° º√≠ pioneers. In June of that year, the committee asked Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek, a Dutch woman who had spent World War II in the United States and became a Bah√° º√≠ during that time, to return to the Netherlands to pioneer. She arrived in October 1946 and set up her home in Amsterdam. In January 1947 and by 29 May 1947 she was having meetings at her home. In January 1947, her sister Mrs. Straub also joined the religion. Straub remained in Rotterdam and concentrated on carrying out work translating Bah√° º√≠ literature. Sombeek soon undertook widespread travels across Europe living in various places. Another pioneer was John Carr√© who set sail from New York for the Netherlands on 12 March 1947, followed by Charlotte Stirratt on 26 March 1947. Carr√© stayed in nearby Bussum but soon moved to Madrid. Stirrat landed in Rotterdam and stayed to help with the work there for three weeks, then moved to Amsterdam. Jan Piet de Borst of Wassenaar was the first to officially register in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, converting to the religion in Bussum on 3 August 1947; another Dutchman, Hans Slim of Wassenaar, converted on 20 August 1947. The third Dutch Bah√° º√≠ was Miss Josephine Caroline Diebold, an elderly resident of Amsterdam who converted on 21 March 1948; the fourth Bah√° º√≠ was Denise Sohet from near Wassenaar; and the fifth and sixth Bah√° º√≠s were Amsterdam residents Miss Frieda van Houten and H. Bernard Dieperink, who both joined the religion on 4 April 1948. Also, by 2 September 1948, Eleanor Gregory Hollibaugh, another Bah√° º√≠ arrived in the Netherlands as a pioneer. With this mixture of pioneers and Dutch converts the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Amsterdam in 1948. At this time there were 11 Bah√° º√≠s in the Netherlands. Edward L. Bode, an engineer, and his wife, Mary Hotchkiss Bode, arrived in Amsterdam in late March 1949 and lived in various places until in early 1969 they left for Madeira. The first Bah√° º√≠s in Rotterdam was Louis Gustave L√∂hlefink who joined the religion on 8 February 1953. The first Bah√° º√≠s in the West Frisian Islands of the Netherlands were two German pioneers, Geertrui Ankersmit and Ursula von Brunn, who landed on the islands in October 1953; they were followed in November 1953 by Elsa Maria Grossman. All three were named as Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h for the Frisian Islands for their service to the religion. = Growth = National Bah√° º√≠ Centre in The Hague The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of The Hague was formed in April 1952. The members of that institution included Elisabeth Charlotte (Lottie) Tobias who would later serve on the regional spiritual assembly of the Benelux countries and the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the Netherlands; she served on that institution from 1962 until 1986 and was continuously elected as secretary. Also in 1952 was the second visit of a Hand of the Cause in the person of Dhikru'llah Khadem as part of a European tour. 1954 saw a conference of Bah√° º√≠s from the Benelux countries. In 1955 the national Bah√° º√≠ Centre in The Hague was purchased. The fifth (mainland) community of Bah√° º√≠s in the country was Zandvoort, with Mr. and Mrs. Adelman who became Bah√° º√≠s in October 1956. The first Bah√° º√≠ of Leiden was Walter Italiaander, who enrolled some years after 1958. The second Leiden Bah√° º√≠, Annemarie Niessink, later married one of the Persian Bah√° º√≠s in the country, Masu'd Mazgani. By 1959, there were 63 Bah√° º√≠s in the Netherlands and an appeal was made by the Hands of the Cause -- a group of Bah√° º√≠s who are considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion -- to the Persian Bah√° º√≠ community for the settlement of Bah√° º√≠ families in the Netherlands. Some 38 Persian Bah√° º√≠s responded, mostly families, and it was then possible to establish spiritual assemblies in Arnhem, Delft, Haarlem, Leiden, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. From 1957 the regional spiritual assembly of the Benelux Countries (that is the Netherlands along with Belgium and Luxembourg) operated until 1962 when the population of Dutch Bah√° º√≠s reached 110 and with nine spiritual assemblies and the community first elected its own National Spiritual Assembly (with Hand of the Cause Hasan Balyuzi in attendance.) 1961 saw the first Bah√° º√≠ summer school - it was attended by 200 Bah√° º√≠s and interested people representing fifteen countries with presentations by Guy Murchie and Hand of the Cause Adelbert M√ºhlschlegel. In 1962 World Religion Day was celebrated consecutively in Amhem, Haarlem and Delft. When the national assembly was elected the first members were Gert van der Garde, Bob van Lith, Mas'ud Mazgani, Arnold van Ogtrop, Gieny Sijsling, Jan Sijsling, Lottie Tobias, Gunter Vieten en Chris Westenbroek. The administrative structure of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith went through a change between 1957 and 1963 when the position of head of the religion passed from Shoghi Effendi to the Universal House of Justice though it also led to a period of minor division in the religion. The Universal House of Justice wrote an extensive letter responding to requests for clarification from the National Assembly of the Netherlands in 1965. It covered questions about the election of, the station of, and authority of, the Universal House of Justice and asked that this letter be re-printed widely for Bah√° º√≠s to read around the world. Since 1962 the Benelux countries, though having each their own national assembly, had continued to pool resources for a shared summer school. In 1965 Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Q√°sim Faizi especially offered workshops and lectures on a variety of topics. Early 1968 saw the first coverage of the religion in the Netherlands by television. The 1969 Netherlands Summer School, held in Ellecom, had then member of the Universal House of Justice David Hofman and Hand of the Cause Jal√°l Khazeh. 1976 saw a variety of activities - it was the first entry to province of Zeeland and a regional conference gathered 250 Dutch Bah√° º√≠s and talks by Adib Taherzadeh. In 1977 Dr. Ahmad Taeed was one of three Bah√° º√≠ visitors to the North American Bah√° º√≠ Temple who were profiled in the August issue of Bah√° º√≠ News. He discusses his experience pioneering to the Netherlands and the growth of the community from his perspective of being an elected member of the National Spiritual Assembly of The Netherlands since 1967.  Modern community  Bah√° º√≠ Conference Centre De Poort, Groesbeek Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In the Netherlands in 1979 more than 100 children from many Dutch Bah√° º√≠ communities as well as local non-Bah√° º√≠ children gathered in Lelystad for the first national Bah√° º√≠ children's conference in the Netherlands as an observance of the International Year of the Child. Also in 1979, at the invitation of the publisher, a national weekly magazine, Actuele Onderwerpen (AO) was written by a member of the national assembly to profile the religion. This issue was ranked forth out of 52 in a year-end reader interest survey conducted by the publisher.AO '79 - Het denkbeeld van de Bah√° º√≠s In 1980 four hundred-fifty Bah√° º√≠s including more than 120 children and youth participated in the Dutch winter school at Oostkapelle. The government of the Netherlands took a stand and spoke out about the persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran in 1980 when it rose in support of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. This resolution was passed September 10, 1980. The concern was repeated by the European Parliament and again the government of the Netherlands spoke specifically to the issue. The topic continued to get attention in the fall of 1983 with coverage in de Volkskrant and NRC Handelsblad, and the feminist magazine Opzij (see Mona Mahmudnizhad.) The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1985 the Dutch Bah√° º√≠ community purchased Conference Centre De Poort, Groesbeek, formerly a Jesuit Philosophicum built in 1929 to act as an institutional center for the religion.De Poort - Geschiedenis van De Poort In 1988 the national assembly of the Netherlands sought to respond to racial tensions with immigrant populations and the Dutch people in a few ways. They organized a public conference on the theme of \\"The Multi-Ethnic Society of the Future \\" and also several articles appeared in Bah√° º√≠ publications. Also in 1988 twenty-eight Bah√° º√≠s from 10 countries took an active part in the 73rd Universal Esperanto Congress at the De Doelen Center in Rotterdam. In 1989 the national center at De Poort hosted two conferences - nearly 200 people representing almost all European communities for the first European Bah√° º√≠ Women's Conference and more than 100 people from 15 countries attended a European Bah√° º√≠ Youth Conference. In 1999 the Dutch Bah√° º√≠ community helped coordinated the Bah√° º√≠ presence at the Hague Appeal for Peace. In 2007 the Bah√° º√≠ community of the Netherlands has given a golden tile from the Shrine of the B√°b to a museum that specializes in roof tiles, the Dutch Roof Tile Museum in Alem. It is the only one among the 3,000 tiles in its collection that is gilded -- covered with a glaze -- with real gold. In 2005, 2006 and 2008 the Tahirih Institute of the Netherlands has held conventions with colloquia and Dr. Aziz Navidi Memorial Lectures named after a prominent Bah√° º√≠ lawyer, and Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h for Monaco, renowned for his courage and skill in defending persecuted Bah√° º√≠s. = Demographics = In 1973 there were 365 Bah√° º√≠s and 16 spiritual assemblies; in 1979, there were 525 Bah√° º√≠s with 27 spiritual assemblies. In 1997 there were about 1500 Bah√° º√≠s in The Netherlands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 6688 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Also in 2005 the Netherlands had 34 local spiritual assemblies.  Dutch colonies  The first Bah√° º√≠ on Surinam was American Leonora Stirling Holsapple; in October 1927 she gave a lecture about the religion in the Loge Concordia centre in the capital Paramaribo. On 22 October 1927 an article appeared in the evening newspaper De West covering the event. Between 1964 and 1973 Dutch overseas pioneers established a Bah√° º√≠ Spiritual Assembly in Suriname at Paramaribo. Piet van der Borst and Hendrik Buys left the Netherlands to pioneer in Indonesia in 1949.

It was located in an area corresponding generally to the present-day northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Origins It was founded in 1582 by Spanish and Portuguese settlers when Philip II, King of Spain and its colonies, encouraged the colonization of Northern New Spain, and authorized the creation of a 'realm' which would have the name of Nuevo Reyno de Le√≥n (New Kingdom of Le√≥n), after the former Kingdom of Le√≥n in Spain. Philip granted Luis de Carabajal y Cueva the title of first governor and captain-general of this new province in New Spain. The foundation of this realm was a crucial event which potentially helped the subsequent Spanish settlements in Texas. Language The official language of the settlers was the Spanish language though some settlers spoke the Leonese language from the Kingdom of Le√≥n in Spain,Men√©ndez Pidal, El Dialecto Leon√©s.1906 which evolved with Spanish in the New World. History Map of the former provinces of New Spain, depicting the New Kingdom of Le√≥n (highlighted green). Though the New Kingdom of Le√≥n was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, it remained functionally autonomous during much of its history, due to the long distance between its main cities; however, it quickly developed a shared culture with its neighbor provinces. This fact led to its becoming in 1776 part of the semi-autonomous Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas, which split in 1786 into three commands, one of them being the Eastern Internal Provinces (Provincias Internas de Oriente) consisting of the New Kingdom of Le√≥n and the provinces of Coahuila, Tejas, and Nuevo Santander; subsequently it remained part of the comandancy until 1821 when it and the rest of Mexico became an independent republic. Today When Mexico declared the independence from Spain, the territory of the Nuevo Reyno de Le√≥n became the \\"Estado Libre y Soberano de Nuevo Le√≥n\\", or 'Free and Sovereign State of New Le√≥n.'

He was a \\"plantsman with the soul of a poet and the vision of a philosopher\\".As an editor described him in a foreword to an article by Douglas Cook in \\"New Zealand Gardener\\" magazine of 1 January 1948 Biography Douglas Cook was the second son of William Cook (Aberdeen, Scotland 1855) and Jessie Miller (Glasgow, Scotland 1853). William arrived in Auckland, New Zealand at 8 September 1879 and started working as an accountant with the Bank of New Zealand. Jessie arrived 19 August 1881. They married three weeks later. The first son John Arthur was born 9 September 1882. The family changed home often. At 28 October 1884 Douglas was born in New Plymouth. A daughter named Sheila Mary Melot was born in Auckland at 25 December 1891. Douglas had a difficult relation with his father and left home when he was 17 years old to go working as a \\"cowboy\\" in Hawke's Bay region. One year later he bought a peach orchard in the neighbourhood of Hastings. The money he needed he borrowed from his father. He bought the orchard of James Nelson Williams, the grandfather of H. B. (Bill) Williams, who would play such an important role in the history of Eastwoodhill 60 years later. Douglas had bad luck. Two times frost destroyed most of the crops. He had to find another job. In a ballot he acquired a part of the Ngatapa settlement, large. He called his new property \\"Eastwoodhill\\", after the house where his mother grew up near Glasgow. He would live there all the rest of his life, and create a large arboretum, with more than 2,000 different taxa of trees and shrubs. In the early years after his arrival at Ngatapa, the farm was substantially enlarged. But in later years he sold parts of the property again, to gain money for buying trees. In 1965 Douglas Cook sold Eastwoodhill to H. B. (Bill) Williams, who bought the arboretum with the purpose to preserve it for the future. During World War I Cook fought in Asia, Africa and Europe as a trooper of the Wellington Mounted Rifles and as a gunner in the N.Z. Field Artillery.Berry 1997, p. 11 William Douglas Cook married Claire Bourne at 20 October 1930. They adopted a son, named Sholto. The marriage did not succeed and Douglas and Claire separated in 1937.Clapperton 1992, p. 3 Cook died in 1967, at the age of 83 years, a \\"plantsman with the soul of a poet and the vision of a philosopher\\".Editorial introduction to an article by Cook in the New Zealand Gardener Magazine of 1 January 1948, as cited by Berry 1997, p. 62 Eastwoodhill When Douglas Cook arrived at his newly bought land in 1910, he started planting immediately. In this first plantings \\"he followed a utilitarian approach ‚Äì some mixed eucalyptus and Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata) for firewood, and of mixed orchard including apple, pear and plum trees for household use\\".Berry 1997, p. 9 He built a small cabin to live in. This was replaced by a larger dwelling in 1914. In that same year he left for voluntary service in World War I. Just before his departure an order of a hundred trees and shrubs and a hundred rhododendrons and azaleas arrived and it was a rush to get these planted.Clapperton 1992, p. 2 In the First World War Douglas Cook served in Gallipoli, Egypt and France. In France he lost the sight of his right eye in 1916. He spent some time in England to recuperate. During that time he visited some beautiful gardens, especially the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. After returning to New Zealand in 1917 (with a plant of both the red and variegated cabbage tree, that Arthur William Hill of Kew gave him) he started creating his own park. Now that he had learned to admire the beauty of trees, he started planting on a large scale. For instance in 1920 about 2,500 trees and shrubs were ordered for the garden. Bulbs and perennials were ordered too, including tulips, hyacinths, lilies and gladioli.Berry 1997, p. 15 In the subsequent years plantings continued. The garden was extended. From 1927 onward, when Bill Crooks got engaged, the creation of the \\"Parks\\" started: * In 1927 the first plantings of \\"Corner Park\\" were made. * From 1934 \\"Cabin Park\\" was planted. * At the end of World War II \\"Douglas Park\\" was included in the plantings. * In 1952, Douglas Cook, then being 71 years old, sold of his property. The money was used for making ponds throughout the arboretum and for the development of \\"Pear Park\\", \\"The Circus\\", \\"Orchard Hill\\" and \\"Glen Douglas\\".Gundry, Sheridan ‚Äì The colourful story of Eastwoodhill, in: An 2007, p. 10 At the end of his life, Douglas Cook had established an arboretum of international importance. Since then, new plantings contributed to what now has become the National Arboretum of New Zealand. Not an ordinary farmer Douglas Cook wrote, in 1963: \\"I never was a farmer. That was only a means of living in the country and being my own boss. I never could stand taking orders and loved roaming the hills\\".cited by Clapperton 1992, p. 2 He spend most of his money on plants, rather than investing it in his farm. And apart from that he was a nudist, and used to work only in a pair of boots and a sun hat. Bob Berry, who got involved in the development of Eastwoodhill in the 1950s (and still is involved in it up till now) remembers his \\"puckish sense of humour\\".Berry 1997, p. 72 William Douglas Cook might be called \\"a passionate man, not because of his somewhat mercurial personal relationships, but he certainly showed an undeviating passion for planting trees over a lifetime\\".Mortimer 1997, p. 46 His passion really took form after he took possession of the 260 ha property of Eastwoodhill in 1910. \\"After just six weeks a garden was shaping up, and by the end of the first year he had filled sixteen pages of his notebook with details of plantings\\". Cook went back to Britain again in 1922 and 1924, to get new inspiration for his dream of establishing a park of his own. After the second World War there was another impetus to Douglas Cook for collecting as much different trees as possible at Eastwoodhill. He was afraid that Europe would be destroyed in a new (nuclear) war and saw his plantings as a repository for good garden material.Clapperton 1992, p. 5Berry 1997, p. 31f Mortimer states that there \\"is a fair amount of information about what he bought (‚Ä¶), but not much about where he put them or what their fate was. He was essentially a collector (and a muddler), buying one of everything he hadn't got\\".Mortimer 1997, p. 47 Pukeiti Douglas Cook had a passion for rhododendrons, and \\"rhodos\\" didn't fare well at Eastwoodhill, in the late 1940s. That brought him back to Taranaki. He knew that rhododendrons flourished in that region. He and Russell Matthews grasped the idea of creating a rhododendron garden at the slopes of Mt. Taranaki. In March 1950Berry 1997, p. 34; Jellyman a.o. 1976, p. 7 states 1951 they found a good spot at a good height above sea level, and with enough rainfall throughout the year. Douglas Cook bought the of land called Pukeiti, and offered the site to the New Zealand Rhododendron Association. Having a lack of finances, this organisation declined his offer. In October 1951 he formed The Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust (by then a group of 24 like-minded peopleSmith 2007, p. 8), to which he donated the land. In 1952 a further was given to the Trust anonymously. Membership of the Trust grew steadily, volunteers worked, donations of money, plants and materials flowed in, and Pukeiti, as the gardens have become known, flourished.Jellyman a.o. 1976, p. 5 The gardens now cover , holding 2,000 different specimen of rhododendrons and membership has reached 3,000. Writer William Douglas Cook was a prolific writer of letters. He also published a number of articles in gardening journals and year books etc. In the period 1948‚Äì1951 he published quite a few articles on Eastwoodhill in the New Zealand Gardenerand one in The Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society, as well as some articles on different topics. In 1960 and 1964 he published articles on rhododendrons in New Zealand and on Pukeiti in The Rhododendron and Camellia Year Book.

It is endemic to California, where its range includes far southern San Benito County, far western Fresno County, and far eastern Monterey County. The species is categorized as a strict serpentine endemic, meaning that it is almost always found growing on serpentine soils; however, at least 10 populations of the species are known to occur on greywacke substrates. Most of the habitat of the species is associated with the New Idria Serpentine Mass, Laguna Mountain Serpentine Mass, Hepsedam Peak Serpentine Mass, Panther Peak Serpentine Mass, Mustang Ridge Serpentine Mass, and numerous smaller serpentine masses between. These masses are surrounded by non-serpentine rocks of the Franciscan Formation, including greywacke which some populations of Camissonia benitensis occur. Serpentine is an ultramafic rock. It weathers to produce soils with characteristically low levels of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, and high levels of magnesium and heavy metals including nickel and chromium. A major, consistent chemical feature of serpentine soil is a bioavailable calcium:magnesium ratio much less than 1. Most nonserpentine soils have a ratio far greater than 1 (more calcium and much less magnesium). The extreme chemical characteristics of serpentine soils give rise to uniquely adapted and rare serpentine endemic plant species such as C. benitensis. Like Camissonia benitensis, the previously ranked strict serpentine endemic Layia discoidea also has several populations that occur on greywacke and chert outcrops and talus around the New Idria Serpentine Mass. Additionally, the strict serpentine endemic Quercus durata var. durata also occurs on greywacke in the vicinity of Condon Peak adjacent to the New Idria Serpentine Mass. The occurrence of these strict serpentine endemics on graywacke suggests that greywacke has physical and or chemical characteristics similar to serpentine and may serve as a habitat analog. Description Camissonia benitensis was discovered by Peter H. Raven on a serpentine stream terrace adjacent to Clear Creek (New Idria serpentine mass; Bureau of Land Management Clear Creek Management Area) in 1960 and scientifically described by him in 1969. The plant's specific epithet, \\"benitensis\\", commemorates its discovery in San Benito County. It is a diminutive annual herb that rarely grows larger than 10 centimeters in field conditions, but can become multi- branched and exceed 30 centimeters in diameter within a horticultural setting. Its reddish stems bear plentiful linear leaves less than 1 centimeter long and minutely toothed along the edges. Plants bear four-petaled yellow flowers approximately 6 millimeters in diameter. Camissonia benitensis seeds at and near the soil surface germinate with the first rains in fall or winter (November 1 - January 31). The plants grow through late fall, winter, and early spring (germination with first rainfall to April) and flowering in April and May. The species is fully self-pollinating.USFWS. Camissonia benitensis Five-year Review. August 2009.Taylor, D. W. (1990). Ecology and life history of the San Benito evening primrose. Bureau of Land Management, California State Office. The fruit is a long, cylindrical capsule approximately 2 to 3 centimeters in length that matures May through July, becoming dry at full maturity with plant senescence. The fruits typically either do not open or only open part way near the tip and do not disperse most of the seed at maturity. It has been observed that most fruits fully open and seeds disperse with rain drop impact on the dry fruits - either during infrequent summer rain storms or with the first rains in fall. The seeds are about 1 millimeter long and 0.5 millimeter wide - the size of sand grains. They are black to brown in color and have a smooth seed coat. The seeds have a demonstrated longevity of at least 20 years in the soil seed bank. Long-distance seed dispersal likely occurs as seeds in mud stuck to animals or vehicles. Camissonia benitensis bears a close resemblance to Camissonia contorta.USFWS. Determination of threatened status for Camissonia benitensis. Federal Register February 12, 1985. The two species are virtually indistinguishable with the naked eye when plants are small (under 6 centimeters), as is common in their native habitat, where they occur together. Camissonia strigulosa also grows in this range but is distinguishable by its smaller flowers and prostrate habit. They dichotomous keys in The Jepson Manual first edition are not detailed enough to make certain positive identifications. One key characteristic that can help distinguish the three species is the morphology of the trichomes on the distal inflorescences. C. contorta has trichomes that look like transparent glassy rods. C. strigulosa has white linear or lance-shaped blades. C. benitensis has both kinds of trichomes. This key characteristic was lacking in Jepson Manual first edition, but is now included in Jepson Manual second edition. A Camissonia which resembles either C. contorta or C. benitensis growing on serpentine soil in upland geologic transition zone habitat or serpentine stream terrace habitat within serpentine masses is virtually always C. benitensis. A Camissonia resembling either of the two species on serpentine stream terraces outside of serpentine masses or mixed alluvium stream terraces could be either C. contorta or C. benitensis. C. strigulosa is the common Camissonia species found growing on nonserpentine alluvial stream and river deposits within the range of C. benitensis.  Range and habitat  Based upon the original discovery of C. benitensis on a serpentine alluvial stream terrace adjacent to Clear Creek, it was long believed that its only habitat type consisted of serpentine alluvial terraces adjacent to perennial streams and rivers, a very rare type of habitat. Until 2010 few populations of the species had been found in any other habitat. In 2010 numerous additional populations were discovered on other land forms including ancient serpentine alluvium deposits (upland hills), serpentine landslides originating from tectonic masses (upland), and serpentine soils on the periphery of large tectonic serpentine (ultramafic) masses (upland). These recently discovered habitat types are collectively called the \\"geologic transition zone.\\" This habitat type is now know to constitute the majority of the habitat area and contains most of the known populations of the species. Populations found near Priest Valley in 2010 extended the previously known range 15 kilometers to the southeast. Common features of the stream terrace are friable serpentine soils that are stable due to very low gradient or no slope and high percentage of coarser substrate particles including sand, gravel, and cobbles. The plant communities in the area include chaparral and woodland with gaps in between where there are microclimates. C. benitensis occurs in these gaps. Typical woody vegetation in the area includes Quercus douglasii (blue oak), Juniperus californica (California juniper), Quercus berberidifolia (scrub oak), Quercus durata (leather oak), Arctostaphylos glauca (bigberry manzanita) and Ceanothus cuneatus (buckbrush). Gaps between the woody vegetation have sparse herbaceous plant cover. C. benitensis is generally a poor competitor with other plant species, both native and exotic. Dense woody vegetation (closed shrub gaps) appears to be detrimental to C. benitensis due to shading effects. Some areas of geologic transition zone habitat have been partially invaded by invasive annual grasses such as Bromus madritensis. These infestations are usually sparse due to the extreme physical and chemical characteristics of the serpentine soils and the low level of tolerance of Bromus madritensis to those soil characteristics. Wildfire generally has a positive effect on C. benitensis by removing native and invasive vegetation. Prescribed fire is utilized by the Bureau of Land Management to control Centaurea solstitialis which once threatened to invade stream terrace habitat occupied by San Benito evening primrose near the confluence of Clear Creek and San Benito River. Some areas of geologic transition zone habitat on private land are grazed by cattle which like wildfire, is beneficial to C. benitensis by removing competing vegetation, particularly invasive annual grasses. The current (2017) known range for Camissonia benitensis is as follows: *The northern limit is approximately 0.6 airline mile east-northeast of Sampson Peak (Lat. 36.411366, Lon. -120.693837) and approximately 2 miles north-northeast of Hernandez Reservoir near Johnson Canyon (Lat. 36.422851, Lon. -120.852683) *The southern limit is California State Route 198 (Lat. 36.201109, Lon. -120.734844) between Mustang Ridge and Priest Valley with an estimated actual (true) range being approximately 2.6 miles further southeast (Lat. 36.169849, Lon. -120.710444). *The eastern limit is the headwaters of White Creek (Lat. 36.298640, Lon. -120.563787) approximately 2.7 miles southwest of Wright Mountain *The western limit is Coalinga Road (Lat. 36.378507, Lon. -120.908748) approximately 0.7 mile west of the mouth of Lorenzo Vasquez canyon Population dynamics C. benitensis plant numbers fluctuate widely from year to year, up to two orders of magnitude, largely independently of total season rainfall and other climate factors including temperature. Cold winters have been documented to result in high seedling mortality due to the effects of soil frost heave (cyclical night freezing - day thawing) in the loose, sandy soil. C. benitensis evening primrose is well-buffered from extinction by very large soil seed bank 100 - 1000 times that of the number of plants seen with a population in any given year. Seed in the soil seed bank has been documented by direct seed longevity test to be viable for at least 20 years and indirectly determined by inferred burial duration (under leaf litter of shrubs) to be viable for up to 105 years. Members of Onagraceae are well-known to have very large, long-lived soil seed banks. Conservation The town of New Idria was founded in 1848 with the discovery of cinnabar (mercury ore) within the New Idria serpentine mass (BLM Clear Creek Management Area). Numerous European prospectors and cattle ranchers settled throughout the area thereafter. Historic impacts to San Benito evening primrose have included logging and mining (gravel, magnesite, chromite, cinnabar, and chrysotile asbestos). The relatively level stream terraces were historically favored by settlers for home sites and to stage industrial activities. A proposed mineral withdrawal for the New Idria serpentine mass will greatly limit any future mining in the area. In more recent decades, the BLM Clear Creek Management Area became a popular motorized off-road vehicle (ORV) recreation area. C. benitensis was federally listed as Threatened in 1985. The primary threat cited by the Fish and Wildlife Service was off-road vehicle impacts to habitat. At the time, only nine populations of the species were known with most occurring on serpentine alluvial stream terraces within one of the highest ORV use areas at Clear Creek Management Area, Clear Creek Canyon. Nearly all of the stream terrace habitat in Clear Creek Canyon has since been fenced to exclude human impacts. A formal route designation in 2005 has further reduced ORV impacts. The Clear Creek Management Area was under a temporary Emergency Closure instituted on May 1, 2008 when the Environmental Protection Agency reported that natural occurrences of chrysotile asbestos in the soil was above safe limits for people. Clear Creek Management Area reopened to the public on March 14, 2014 with entry by permit only. Vehicle travel is open only to highway-licensed vehicles on the public touring route that includes Clear Creek Road (R1), Spanish Lake Road (R11), KCAC Road (R5), Sawmill Creek Road - south segment (T158), and San Benito Mountain Peak Road (R13). The main entry points on R1 (at Jade Mill Campground) and R11 (Idria Reservoir) are gated. Individuals may acquire an entry permit for up to 5 days of entry per year. The remainder of the routes formally designated in 2005 remain closed.  Synopsis  Discovery of the geologic transition zone habitat and numerous additional populations has greatly improved the outlook for C. benitensis. Most of the geologic transition zone habitat has not been subject to high levels of human impacts, unlike much of the stream terrace habitat. As of July 2017, there are more than 600 known populations of C. benitensis. Only 10 populations were known when the species was federally listed in 1985. 60 populations were known by 2009 with most being within alluvial terrace habitat. 600 populations have since been found since 2010 with most of those being within the newly discovered geologic transition zone habitat. The known range is now several times larger than when the species was Federally listed. Most of the potential geologic transition habitat on both public (BLM and State land) and private land has now been surveyed.

Hatch, born on October 14, 1799, in Craven County, North Carolina, married Elizabeth Vail Blount on May 8, 1822. The family, which eventually included three sons and three daughters, moved to Alabama in 1840. Alfred Hatch established several large plantations, including Elm Ridge near Greensboro, and enslaved a total of 200 people to work them. He purchased Arcola in the early 1850s from his brother Lemuel D. Hatch during a period of financial difficulty. Elizabeth Hatch died before the end of the Civil War and Alfred remarried to Victoria Jones Walker. They had one daughter together in 1873. Alfred Hatch died on January 30, 1879, leaving most of the estate to his second wife, creating a rift between her and the children of his first wife. Architecture The Hatch Place is a rare Alabama example of a temple-form house in the Greek Revival style. The house is a three-story brick structure, with massing suggestive of a pseudoperipteral building. The front facade features a monumental tetrastyle Doric portico across the front, with a full-width cantilevered balcony under the portico on the second level. A Tudor arch window is centered in the pediment over the portico. The plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 6, 1988, due to its architectural and historical significance.

Its primary purpose is to provide a more consistent temperature to the gun barrel preventing distortions due to thermal expansion caused by the temperature differences around the barrel when firing.Tucker p. 360-361 Thermal sleeves were originally simply insulators. They would prevent ambient conditions such as bright sunlight or winds from heating or cooling one side of a barrel more than the other which would cause a thermal distortion (bending or drooping), reducing accuracy. More modern variants contain concentric inner and outer insulating sleeves with a gap in between. Versions have been created which are detachable from a given barrel so that they can be re-used with a replacement barrel. Proposals exist for types that have advanced external thermal and radar profiles, reducing their thermal and radar signatures making the barrel and thereby the tank harder to detect.US Patent 5400691 , Rigid thermal sleeve for a gun barrel, Retrieved on 29 December 2008 The canvas-covered thermal sleeve on a Chieftain tank One of the earliest guns to use a thermal sleeve was the Royal Ordnance L11 used on the Chieftain tank.

Between 1938 and 1952 he had illustrated a lot of Astounding issues, including making five covers. In World War II he illustrated Army Air Corps technical manuals and discussed doing a comic strip with Isaac Asimov. After the war, he worked for the New York Journal American and The Denver Post and then moved to Los Angeles. He asked to show his work to 20th Century Fox and got a snotty rejection letter.

Names It is called taram√£√ßu or uitsi in the Kwaza language of Rond√¥nia, Brazil. Description Dinoponera gigantea is one of the world's largest species of ant. The females of the species are larger than males, with lengths ranging from . The females are coal-black in color, while the much smaller males are dark red. Distribution Dinoponera gigantea is present only in South America. It has been found on the coast of Guyana, in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Par√° including Marajo Island, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Maranh√£o as well as the Loreto Province in Peru. Dinoponera gigantea is reported to be common in un-flooded forests in the vicinity of Bel√©m, Par√°. It is probable that Dinoponera gigantea is found in French Guiana, Surinam, Venezuela and southeastern Colombia because these regions are adjacent to known Dinoponera gigantea localities and have similar lowland rainforest habitat. Nesting D. gigantea colonies have as many as eight entrances to their underground chambers, each being in diameter. The entrances are, as is typical for ants, surrounded by the soil removed to make the nest, but, in contrast with other species, no mound is formed. Nests have been found to be about deep, with chambers approximately in height and in width. At least in some instances, the species is polydomous, with a single colony occupying and maintaining more than one nest at a time. Some instances of this were recorded in Fourcassie and Oliveira's 2002 study, which found colonies using multiple nests, the entrances of which were apart. Foraging Activity outside the nest is highest at sunrise and sunset, though it is likely that some activity occurs at night. Individuals search for food alone, generally within about of the nest. Items brought back range from 10 to 400 milligrams, and are of wide variety, including both plant and animal matter. Food items include fruits of vismia plants, inga seeds, and various small animals such as spiders, crickets, and snails. A relatively small number, around 10%, of foraging trips turn out to be successful. Successful foraging trips are typically thirty to sixty minutes in duration, but may run as long as three hours. Territorialism Neighboring colonies of D. gigantea have distinct foraging areas. On the occasion that ants from different colonies meet on the border of these areas, the individuals face each other, locking their mandibles. The two then repeatedly poke each other's head with their antennae while kicking with the forelegs. At some point, one of the ants gains a dominant position, eventually biting the other on the top of the head and pressing the gaster against the loser's body. The entire encounter can last up to half an hour. In Fourcassie and Oliveira's study, both ants were invariably found to be uninjured.

Peppas is a leading scientist of modern drug delivery. He has helped to set the fundamentals and rational design of drug delivery systems and biomaterials over the past 39 years. He was the first to set the theories and equations that led to the design of a wide range of new systems. For example, using biomedical engineering principles and new biomedical transport theories, Peppas developed the equations that describe Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion of drugs, peptides and proteins in controlled release devices. The \\"Peppas equation\\" has become the standard method of analysis of pharmaceutical formulations or systems. His earliest work also led to the development of a number of swelling-controlled release devices for the release of small molecular weight drugs. Using the modeling similarities of phase erosion and state erosion, he developed a unified model for all drug delivery systems. Similarly, he developed the theoretical framework for the analysis of transport through crosslinked biomaterials (the Peppas-Reinhart theory), ionic hydrogels (the Brannon-Peppas theory), and gel-tissue interactions via tethers (the Huang-Peppas theoryY Huang, W Leobandung, A Foss and N.A Peppas, Molecular aspects of muco- and bioadhesion: tethered structures and site- specific surfaces, J. Control. Release 65, 63‚Äì71 (2000) and the Sahlin-Peppas equationJ.J. Sahlin and N.A. Peppas, Enhanced hydrogel adhesion by polymer interdiffusion: Use of linear poly(ethylene glycol) as an adhesion promoter, J. Biomat Sci, Polym Ed, 8, 421-436 (1997)). For the profound impact of these theories and analyses, Peppas has been recognized as the most cited and highly published author in \\"drug delivery\\", \\"biomaterials and drug delivery\\", and \\"intelligent materials\\". He is listed as a Highly Cited ResearcherSM of Thomson Scientific and the Institute of Scientific Information. He has also ranked as the most cited chemical and biomedical engineer with 106,026 citations and an H-index of 152. Applications of his theories and mathematical models have had a profound effect in the field. Peppas and his students originated the novel muco- and bioadhesive systems that interact molecularly with the mucus and tissue and have been able to prolong bioavailability of proteins and peptides in the blood. As a result of his work, a number of biomedical polymers and commercial delivery devices have been launched. Peppas was the first to develop novel toxic-free poly(vinyl alcohol) gels by the freezing-thawing technique in 1975. These gels became very successful articular cartilage replacement systems.N.A. Peppas: \\"Hydrogels for Synthetic Articular Cartilage Applications,\\" SPE Techn. Papers (NATEC), 62-63 (1977) In 1978, he developed the same systems for in situ replacement of vocal cords. In 1979 his group pioneered the use of hydrogels in drug delivery applications, including epidermal bioadhesive systems and systems for the release of theophylline, proxyphylline, diltiazem, and oxprenolol. Peppas' lab has developed new technologies of oral delivery systems for insulin and other proteins. These devices release insulin orally, \\"protecting\\" the insulin throughout its transport in the stomach, upper small intestine, and, eventually, blood, and bypassing diabetics' need for several daily injections. The same technology has been used for the transmucosal (oral, buccal) delivery of calcitonin (for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women) and interferon-alpha (for cancer therapy), and is being investigated for interferon-beta release for multiple sclerotic patients. Peppas was one of the pioneers of intelligent biomaterials, and medical devices. Using intelligent polymersN.A. Peppas and LS. Flosenzier (1986) Life Support Syst., 4 (Suppl. 2) 395 as early as 1980, Peppas and his group were the first to use such pH- sensitive and temperature-sensitive systems for modulated release of streptokinase and other fibrinolytic enzymes. Peppas has founded three companies: Mimetic Solutions, Appian Labs and CoraDyn Biosystems for the commercialization of various pharmaceutical products and medical devices. He is the author of 1,450 publications, and numerous proceedings papers and abstracts, with more than 80,000 citations and an H-index of 135. He is the coauthor or coeditor of 37 books, including the three-volume Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharmacy (CRC Press, 1987), the monograph Pulsatile Drug Delivery (WSGS, Stuttgart, 1993), two books on Biopolymers (Springer, 1994), the monograph Molecular and Cellular Foundations of Biomaterials (Academic Press, 2004), the book Intelligent Therapeutics: Biomimetic Systems and Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery (Elsevier, 2004), the monograph Nanotechnology in Therapeutics (Horizon Press, 2007) and the book Chronobiology and Drug Delivery (Elsevier, 2007).

The -story wood-framed main house was built in the Gothic Revival style in the late 1850s. The plantation historic district includes six other contributing buildings, in addition to the main house. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on December 19, 1991 and subsequently to the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1992, due to its architectural and historical significance. History Fairhope Plantation was built for Joseph Selden, a native of Virginia. He was born on June 4, 1831, and grew up at Westover Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia. Selden married Elizabeth Collier Minge, of Weynoke Plantation, Virginia, near Faunsdale, in 1854. Elizabeth was born on May 30, 1833. Her family was also originally from Charles City County. Joseph and Elizabeth established Fairhope on property given to them by Elizabeth's family. The main house was built by Theophilus Gilliam Fowler, a local builder. Construction began in 1857 and was completed by 1861. The 1860 United States Census of Perry County indicates that Joseph Selden owned 80 slaves in that year. Selden organized Selden's Battery, an artillery unit, at his own expense during the American Civil War. The unit saw action in several major engagements, including the battles of Kennesaw Mountain, Franklin and Nashville. Elizabeth Selden died following childbirth in 1868, Joseph died in a hotel fire in 1900. Fairhope continued to be owned by Selden descendants and operated as a farm for another century after their deaths. Architecture The inspiration for the main house at Fairhope Plantation is thought by architectural historians to be an enlarged adaptation of a design by Alexander Jackson Davis, published in Andrew Jackson Downing's Cottage Residences in 1842. The house features numerous Gothic Revival details, including intricate bargeboards on the eaves and gables, hood moldings over the doors and windows, octagonal brick chimneys, and central gables topped by finials on all four sides. Additionally, it has a one-story cast-iron veranda around three sides of the ground floor. It is one of only about twenty Gothic Revival residential structures remaining in Alabama.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810‚Äì1930, pages 89-90 . Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . Other historic Gothic Revival residences in the area include Waldwic in Gallion and Ashe Cottage in Demopolis.

It is commonly known as the myrtle ebony, black myrtle, grey plum or grey persimmon.  Description  Diospyros pentamera is a small to large rainforest tree, from 6 to 40 metres in height at maturity, and 60 centimetres in width at the base. It grows in various types of rainforests, but grows best in volcanic soils in fire free areas with high rainfall. The leaves are 5 to 9 centimetres long, not toothed. Fragrant white flowers form in spring. The mid-sized edible berry matures around December to February and is eaten by many rainforest birds, including Brown Cuckoo Dove, Wompoo Fruit Dove, Rose-crowned Fruit Dove, Topknot Pigeon, Currawong, Regent Bowerbird and Australasian Figbird. Germination of fresh seed is quick, but occasionally unreliable. This tree is easily identified in the rainforest by the dark rough bark, which resembles the bark of Ironbark trees.

He believes he may have found this ideal woman in Aurora's cousin Lucy, but he quickly realizes that, while she is pure and innocent, he is not in love with her and begins to fall in love with Aurora, of whom he had originally taken little notice. When for a walk, Aurora, Talbot and Lucy meet John Mellish, an old school friend of Talbot's. John falls instantly in love with Aurora and the two men soon realize that they are both rivals for Aurora's affection; although, Aurora has shown little interest in John. Talbot proposes to Aurora, but she rejects him. John also proposes and is rejected. Talbot goes to say goodbye to Archibald, but instead finds Aurora in a faint. When he revives her, he ends up proposing again and this time they become engaged. He later finds that prior to having fainted Aurora was reading a newspaper which contained an article about an English jockey named Conyers who had died in a horse-racing accident in Germany. Talbot eventually learns that soon after arriving at the Parisian finishing school, Aurora ran away and when he questions her about the fifteen months of her life prior to returning to Felden Woods, she refuses to account for her actions and will only tell him that her father knows what happened to her and that it broke his heart. Unable to bear the shame that this secret will likely bring to his family, Talbot ends his engagement with Aurora even though he is still in love with her. Following the end of the engagement, Aurora endures a months-long illness, during which time John stays near the family as he has come to be a favorite of Mr. Floyd's and despite knowing that Aurora doesn't love him, he once again proposes to her. Aurora tells John the reason Talbot ended their engagement; although, she doesn't disclose the nature of her secret and when John again asks her to be his wife, she accepts his proposal, they are married and Aurora moves to John's home, Mellish Park. Aurora meets the repulsive Steeve Hargraves, who was once the favorite groomer to John's father. Twenty years previous, Hargraves suffered a brain injury in a hunting accident and since that time, he has worked at various jobs around the stables although most of the other stable hands are wary of him due to his uneven temper. Aurora has John fire Hargraves following an incident of cruelty involving Aurora's cherished dog. When a new trainer is needed at Mellish Park, John gets a recommendation from a friend and Aurora becomes hysterical when she hears that the man's name is James Conyers. When John questions her as to her reaction, she will only tell him that Conyers once worked for her father and that he knows something of her secret; despite this, she agrees to have him come to Mellish Park. Conyers arrives and takes up residence in a lodge house on the Mellish property. He hires Hargraves to look after the lodge, fully knowing the resentment Hargraves has for Aurora and tells Hargraves not to worry about Aurora trying to have him removed again. Suspicious of the connection between Aurora and Conyers, both Mrs. Powell and Hargraves eavesdrop on a private conversation between the two and hear Aurora offer Conyers ¬£2000. One week after his arrival at Mellish Park, Conyers is found dead in the woods having been shot in the back. It is revealed that Aurora and Conyers had been married after Aurora ran away from the Parisian school, thus making her marriage to John not legal; although, at the time she had wed John, Aurora had believed that Conyers had died in the horse racing accident in Germany. Unable to face the man she has grown to love and bring more shame and disgrace to him, Aurora runs away from Mellish Park and goes to Talbot and Lucy (who have been married) in London seeking Talbot's advice. The next morning Talbot fortuitously runs into John who has stopped in London on his way to see Aurora's father and Talbot reunites the two lovers. Following Talbot's advice, Aurora and John are legally married as soon as possible and return to Mellish Park only to find that, through Mrs. Powell's machinations, rumors that implicate Aurora in the murder of Conyers have spread around the village and surrounding area. Eventually, a distance grows between John and Aurora as Aurora believes that the shame she has caused him has made John stop loving her and John; although, still in love with Auroras, has doubts about her innocence. On the night of John and Aurora's return to Mellish Park, but unknown to her, the murder weapon was found; a pistol of John's that he had been cleaning the morning of the murder along with other guns. He had stepped out for a moment and returned to find Aurora putting the weapons back in order as she was accustomed to do. Talbot convinces John that anyone could have taken the pistol and John and Aurora are reunited once again. A detective from Scotland Yard comes to Mellish Park to investigate and finds clues which point to Hargraves as the murderer, but he is unable to find proof. Out walking one night by the lodge where Conyers was staying, Talbot sees a dim light inside and goes to investigate. He finds Hargraves who has returned to the lodge to retrieve the ¬£2000 that he took from Conyers after murdering him. After a struggle, Hargraves is subdued and, after confessing his crime, is eventually hanged.

Football career Prince was born in Liverpool but was raised in Southampton and played his club football on Southampton Common, while working in the Merchant Navy. He was signed by Southern League Southampton as an amateur in 1907 and made his first team debut away to New Brompton on 17 October 1908. In the next match, against Millwall he scored in a 4‚Äì1 victory at The Dell, but made only one further appearance that season, followed by two further appearances at the end of the 1909‚Äì10 season, scoring in both matches. He was the first-choice centre-forward at the start of the next season, scoring in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Portsmouth on 10 September 1910, before losing his place to Sid Kimpton. Described as a \\"sharp-shooting centre- forward, keen and enthusiastic \\" but with a genial nature, \\"there was none more zealous in the interests of the team\\". He was known as \\"Peewee\\" to his teammates. He finally became established in the side, playing at inside left in December 1911, taking over from Andrew Gibson, but after a run of nine games in which he scored twice, Prince lost his place back to Gibson. In March 1912 Gibson was suspended (along with Henry Hamilton) for a \\"serious breach of club discipline\\", as a result of which both players were placed on the transfer list. This led to Prince's restoration to the team which he marked by scoring four goals in three matches. In the 1912‚Äì13 season, Prince only missed eight matches scoring eleven league goals, making him the club's top scorer for the season. In the following season, he continued to be a regular starter but was pushed out onto the wing in more of a supporting role to Len Andrews and Arthur Dominy, and his scoring ability faded before he lost his place in January 1914 to Bill Smith, who in turn was replaced by Arthur Hollins. In the summer of 1914, Prince was released by Southampton and joined Boscombe in the Hampshire League. The outbreak of World War I interrupted his career but he turned out occasionally for Boscombe during the wartime period until returning to Southampton in 1917, where he played for his former club in the wartime leagues. At the cessation of hostilities, Prince re-joined Southampton in August 1919 and made four further appearances. in place of Bert Fenwick in the Saints' final Southern League. Prince was now playing at half back and his final appearance was in a 2‚Äì6 defeat at The Dell by Northampton Town on 25 October 1919. Although he was not to make further appearances in the first team, Prince continued to play for the reserves, gaining Hampshire League and Senior Cup medals, as well as gaining representative honours with Hampshire. He returned to Boscombe in November 1920, before retiring the following summer. Life outside football Prince was employed by the Cunard Line for 32 years and in 1930 he moved to New York City as Assistant Catering Officer, servicing the trans-Atlantic ocean liners from Southampton, including RMS Aquitania and RMS Queen Mary. Prince retired in 1952, and continued to live in Rutherford, New Jersey, where he died in December 1973 at Bergen Pines Hospital in nearby Paramus.Staff. \\"Percy Prince\\", The New York Times, 5 December 1973.

Langebaan is situated 120 km north of Cape Town, just off the R27, about 28 km from Vredenburg and 20 km from Saldanha Bay. The Lagoon stretches for 17 km from Saldanha Bay, past Langebaan to Geelbek in the South. In places it is up to 4 km wide. History Langebaan seen from across the Langebaan Lagoon The Langebaan Lagoon was formed by the rising and falling of sea levels during pre-historic times. This is unlike most lagoons which form where fresh water rivers enter the sea. As a result, Langebaan Lagoon is purely a salt water lagoon. Satellite image of Saldanha Bay, with Langebaan Lagoon to the right (south) As far back as 500 000 years ago, early Homo sapiens were probably present in the area, living in groups and hunting small game, displacing carnivores, such as lions, from their kills and gathering plant foods. They made fire as protection and for cooking and probably made simple shelters from branches. They used animal skins for warmth and clothing, and also made wooden and stone tools, as evidence of these found here proves. The area is rich in historical events from the first inhabitants, the Khoikhoi and San, to the arrival of the Europeans. The first European to set foot on land was Vasco da Gama at St Helena Bay on the West Coast Peninsula in 1497. Ant√≥nio de Saldanha, after whom the bay is named, did not enter those waters at all. Juris van Spilbergen mistakenly named it in 1601 as Saldanha Bay; he thought that he had reached Cape Town ‚Äì originally named Agoada de Saldanha. Although the Dutch were the first to claim ownership of the area, the French were frequent visitors. Foreign nations would claim ownership by planting a post in the ground and formally declaring ownership. One of these ‚Äòposts‚Äô may be seen today near Geelbek claiming the land on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. Such a marker was also found by Gert Hendrik van Wyk on Schaapeneiland. European settlement was very limited because of the lack of water for 8 months of the year. Many stirring events have occurred in the region over the centuries including two sea battles and a visit by the Confederate States of America‚Äôs, Alabama, in 1863, the most feared warship of its day. Even the 5 islands in the area, which are administered by the West Coast National Park, have a history of their own, including battles for ownership, use as smallpox quarantine hospitals, exploits for guano, sealing centres and other activities. The French used Schaapeneiland (close to Langebaan beach) as a storage place for whale oil and seal hides, calling it \\"Isle √† la Biche\\". More recently, the whaling station was situated at Donkergat and is still visible from the town. A reminder of Langebaan's whaling history is the harpoon gun outside the Municipal Buildings. The town Langebaan was founded in 1922 and used as a whaling station until the 1960s. Langebaan today Bird-watchers visit the area to view the over 300 species of birds found in the lagoon waters of the West Coast National Park. The park is most busy during the spring flower season (August to September) when the wild flowers are in bloom. Whales can be spotted during October and November. The white sand beaches surrounding the clear waters of the Langebaan Lagoon are one of the main attractions of Langebaan. The mild climate and protected waters of the lagoon make Langebaan popular for sailing, kayaking, kitesurfing and fishing, and the town offers numerous holiday facilities for water sport enthusiasts. To protect its culture as a fishing, holiday and retirement village, the town allows no industries. Club Mykonos Resort hosts a number of annual events, festivals and exhibitions. Able to accommodate large numbers, the well-known artists are regular performers at this venue. Popular competitions and fund raising events are hosted at the resort. Large-scale sporting events such as triathlons, the downwind dash, cycling, car gymkhanas and more are held here. A monthly craft market as well as art exhibitions through the year, showcase the talents of local artists. Community events includes the church bazaar and the annual Langebaan Mussel Festival, which takes place on the first weekend of October. Langebaan prides itself on supporting local communities and has a wealth of local retailers which support the community, from independent shops to franchises including the excellent Zebro's in Oosterwal Street.

History  On August 3, 1931, Rev. Peter Semkoff officially petitioned Theophilus, Archbishop of Chicago, the local bishop of the Russian Metropolia, for his permission to establish a new parish in the Gage Park area of Chicago (2410 W 53rd St. Chicago, IL 60632), to be eventually known as St. Peter and St. Paul Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church. The first membership meeting was held on September 30, 1931, and on December 1, 1931, property for a new church was purchased on the northwest corner of Western Ave. and 53rd St. The first liturgy in the new church was celebrated on Palm Sunday, April 20, 1932. The majority of parish founders were Carpatho-Russians formerly belonging to St. Mary's Greek Catholic Church under papal jurisdiction. The desire to control parish property and retain what was then perceived as nasa Ruska Vira (\\"our Russian Faith\\") were primary reasons for affiliating with the Metropolia. After being spiritually served for over 50 years by V. Rev. Peter Semkoff and his son, V. Rev. Nicholas Semkoff, this once tight-knit ethnic enclave of southwest side Chicago parishioners vacated their original temple and continued their parish life in a new church on County Line Rd. in Burr Ridge, Illinois. The new location was determined by the demographics of the parish members, who now reside as far north as Racine, Wisconsin, and as far south as Bourbonnais, IL. The first service in the new church was held on February 15, 1998. The parish now serves an English-speaking congregation representing many ethnic roots.

As an isopropyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms. It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol and ethyl methyl ether. It is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of industrial and household chemicals and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants, and detergents. Names Isopropyl alcohol Isopropyl alcohol is also known as 2-propanol, sec-propyl alcohol, IPA, or isopropanol. IUPAC considers isopropanol an incorrect name as the hydrocarbon isopropane does not exist.  Properties  Isopropyl alcohol is miscible in water, ethanol, ether, and chloroform. It dissolves ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, many oils, alkaloids, gums and natural resins. Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer. Isopropyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water, which gives a boiling point of and a composition of 87.7 wt% (91 vol%) isopropyl alcohol. Water-isopropyl alcohol mixtures have depressed melting points. It has a slightly bitter taste, and is not safe to drink. Isopropyl alcohol becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature and freezes at . Isopropyl alcohol has a maximal absorbance at 205 nm in an ultraviolet-visible spectrum. Reactions Isopropyl alcohol can be oxidized to acetone, which is the corresponding ketone. This can be achieved using oxidizing agents such as chromic acid, or by dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol over a heated copper catalyst: :(CH3)2CHOH ‚Üí (CH3)2CO + H2 Isopropyl alcohol is often used as both solvent and hydride source in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction and other transfer hydrogenation reactions. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to 2-bromopropane using phosphorus tribromide, or dehydrated to propene by heating with sulfuric acid. Like most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals such as potassium to form alkoxides that can be called isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminium (initiated by a trace of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminium isopropoxide.  History  In 1920, Standard Oil first produced isopropyl alcohol by hydrating propene. Its major use at the time was not rubbing alcohol but for oxidation to acetone, whose first major use was in World War I for the preparation of cordite, a smokeless, low explosive propellant. Production In 1994, 1.5 million tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan. It is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction or by hydrogenating acetone. There are two routes for the hydration process and both processes require that the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope, and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by weight water.CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 44th ed. pp 2143‚Äì2184 Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by azeotropic distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents. =Biological= Small amounts of isopropyl alcohol are produced in the body in diabetic ketoacidosis. =Indirect hydration= Indirect hydration reacts propene with sulfuric acid to form a mixture of sulfate esters. This process can use low- quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows Markovnikov's rule. Subsequent hydrolysis of these esters by steam produces isopropyl alcohol, by distillation. Diisopropyl ether is a significant by-product of this process; it is recycled back to the process and hydrolyzed to give the desired product. : CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ H2O (CH3)2CHOH =Direct hydration= Direct hydration reacts propene and water, either in gas or liquid phase, at high pressures in the presence of solid or supported acidic catalysts. This type of process usually requires higher- purity propylene (> 90%). Direct hydration is more commonly used in Europe. =Hydrogenation of acetone= Isopropyl alcohol may be prepared via the hydrogenation of acetone, however this approach involves an extra step compared to the above methods, as acetone is itself normally prepared from propene via the cumene process. It may remain economical depending on the value of the products. A known issue is the formation of MIBK and other self- condensation products. Raney nickel was one of the original industrial catalysts, modern catalysts are often supported bimetallic materials. This is an efficient process and easy Uses One of the small scale uses of isopropanol is in cloud chambers. Isopropanol has ideal physical and chemical properties to form a supersaturated layer of vapor which can be condensed by particles of radiation. In 1990, 45,000 metric tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were used in the United States, mostly as a solvent for coatings or for industrial processes. In that year, 5400 metric tonnes were used for household purposes and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol is popular in particular for pharmaceutical applications, due to its low toxicity. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the cumene process is more significant. =Solvent= Isopropyl alcohol dissolves a wide range of non-polar compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were used worldwide in 2011.Market Study Soviet. Ceresana. April 2012 Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used for cleaning eyeglasses, electrical contacts, audio or video tape heads, DVD and other optical disc lenses, removing thermal paste from heatsinks on CPUs and other IC packages, etc. =Intermediate= Isopropyl alcohol is esterified to give isopropyl acetate, another solvent. It reacts with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to give sodium isopropylxanthate, a herbicide and an ore flotation reagent. Isopropyl alcohol reacts with titanium tetrachloride and aluminium metal to give titanium and aluminium isopropoxides, respectively, the former a catalyst, and the latter a chemical reagent. This compound may serve as a chemical reagent in itself, by acting as a dihydrogen donor in transfer hydrogenation. =Medical= Rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting pads typically contain a 60‚Äì70% solution of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in water. Water is required to open up membrane pores of bacteria, which acts as a gateway for isopropyl alcohol. A 75% solution in water may be used as a hand sanitizer. Isopropyl alcohol is used as a water-drying aid for the prevention of otitis externa, better known as swimmer's ear.Otitis Externa (Swimmers Ear). Medical College of Wisconsin =Early uses as an anesthetic= Although isopropyl alcohol can be used for anesthesia, its many negative attributes or drawbacks prohibit this use. Isopropyl alcohol can also be used similarly to ether as a solvent or as an anesthetic by inhaling the fumes or orally. Early uses included using the solvent as general anesthetic for small mammals and rodents by scientists and some veterinarians. However, it was soon discontinued, as many complications arose, including respiratory irritation, internal bleeding, and visual and hearing problems. In rare cases, respiratory failure leading to death in animals was observed. =Automotive= Isopropyl alcohol is a major ingredient in \\"gas dryer\\" fuel additives. In significant quantities, water is a problem in fuel tanks, as it separates from gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at low temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline, but the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it no longer accumulates in the supply lines and freezes but is consumed with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock deicer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove brake fluid traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads and cause poor braking. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol and water are also commonly used in homemade windshield washer fluid. =Laboratory= As a biological specimen preservative, isopropyl alcohol provides a comparatively non-toxic alternative to formaldehyde and other synthetic preservatives. Isopropyl alcohol solutions of 70‚Äì99% are used to preserve specimens. Isopropyl alcohol is often used in DNA extraction. A lab worker adds it to a DNA solution to precipitate the DNA, which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol. Safety Isopropyl alcohol vapor is denser than air and is flammable, with a flammability range of between 2 and 12.7% in air. It should be kept away from heat and open flame. Distillation of isopropyl alcohol over magnesium has been reported to form peroxides, which may explode upon concentration. Isopropyl alcohol is a skin irritant. Wearing protective gloves is recommended. Toxicology Isopropyl alcohol and its metabolite, acetone, act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption. Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, CNS depression, nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, hypothermia, low blood pressure, shock, respiratory depression, and coma. Overdoses may cause a fruity odor on the breath as a result of its metabolism to acetone. Isopropyl alcohol does not cause an anion gap acidosis but it produces an osmolal gap between the calculated and measured osmolalities of serum, as do the other alcohols. Isopropyl alcohol is oxidized to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, and has a biological half-life in humans between 2.5 and 8.0 hours. Unlike methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, the metabolites of isopropyl alcohol are considerably less toxic, and treatment is largely supportive. Furthermore, there is no indication for the use of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, unless co-ingestion with methanol or ethylene glycol is suspected. In forensic pathology, people who have died as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis usually have blood concentrations of isopropyl alcohol of tens of mg/dL, while those by fatal isopropyl alcohol ingestion usually have blood concentrations of hundreds of mg/dL.

The scheme came into force on 1995 in 199 districts in India and extended to another 130 districts later.A NREGS Worksite In Kerala, the scheme was implemented in Palakkad and Waynad districts initially on 5 February 2006 and it was extended to all the 14 districts in the State on 1 April 2008. Kerala is a tiny state in India with very high unemployment - most of them are educated - in the country. Around five lakh people among them are estimated to have willingness to do physical labour. NREGS is a substantial boost in income and purchasing power. The scheme now provides Rs 164 (National wage rate is Rs 60/- only) per person for a stipulated quantity of manual labour offered as registered worker in the local governments in Kerala. Another Worksite A Pond constructed in Pallam Grama Panchayat Features of the scheme ‚Ä¢ Local governments are given a central role in the planning and implementation of NREGA ( National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005) and are the sole agencies responsible for implementation of local development projects under the scheme in Kerala ‚Ä¢ Engineering support is put in place. In addition to one diploma/degree holder working on contract at the level of the Village Panchayat, there is a system of accredited engineers. Such engineers are drawn from amongst retired engineers, staff working in Engineering Colleges, Polytechnics/ ITIs, engineers working in NGOs etc. These engineers are paid for their work, at rates fixed by Government. The engineer from a government department or agency, willing to help the Village Panchayat over and above his normal work, is allowed and paid at 50% of the rate applicable to others. ‚Ä¢ Technical Sanction of the work is given not by individual engineers, but by a Technical Committee of engineers which includes a government engineer, a retired engineer and an engineer working in an academic institution for the purposes of transparency. ‚Ä¢ An appellate system has been put in place at the district level to facilitate speedy sorting out of disputes. ‚Ä¢ To mobilize the workers and the public and to assist the local governments in carrying out its duties, Village Panchayats have been given the freedom to identify one public servant of their choice having the time and inclination to do social work from any government department are posted on working arrangement as NREGS co- coordinators. ‚Ä¢ Kudumbasree is given in the implementation of the programme. Under Kudumbasree every family below poverty line is organized into a Neighbourhood Group (NHG) at the local level consisting of 15 to 40 families with each family being represented only by a woman. The NHGs are federated into an Area Development Society (ADS) at the level of the Ward of the Village Panchayat (a Village Panchayat Ward in Kerala has a population of around 15000 to 20000). The ADSs in a Village Panchayat are federated into a registered body called the Community Development Society (CDS). Each NHG, ADS and CDS has five volunteers carrying out different functional roles. ‚Ä¢ The ADS has been entrusted with the task of organizing public works under NREGS. Muster Rolls and other records are maintained by the ADS, implements are provided to labourers by them and the transparency and monitoring requirements are also carried out by them. Welfare amenities to the workers are also provided by the ADS. Since ADS is an organization of the poor and is basically a woman's group, there has been greater sensitivity and community participation in the implementation process. ‚Ä¢ The estimates are summarized in the local language so as to be understood by ordinary people. At the beginning of every work, the nature of work, expected out turn and the likely wages are explained to the workers' groups. ‚Ä¢ Since Kerala has limited public land, the eco-restoration works are selected for in degraded forest lands. Village Panchayats would implement the programme in forest areas with the technical supervision being done by field level officials of the Forest Department representing a new kind of relationship between a Panchayat Raj Institution and a government department. ‚Ä¢ The road works has been limited to 100% of the total expenditure and to give special priority to integrated watershed development works. Major advantages Compared to the earlier wage employment programmes such as NREGA, RLEGP, JRY, EAS, SGRY, IRDP, SGSY there are significant achievements under NREGS due to the combination of transparent processes and procedures, local action and constant vigilance. The implementation of NREGA has been comparatively corruption free. The factors contributing to this situation include: - ¬ß A clear political decision was conveyed to the Panchayats that the scheme has to be implemented strictly as per the laws in force. The argument for an asset focused programme ignoring the processes and conforming to the procedures on paper, was rejected. The argument that Kerala would lose out as the demand for unskilled labour is very limited and as the wages are much higher than the statutory minimum wages in more than 90% of the State, it would be better to go for public works, was rejected. ¬ß The work is organized through the Kudumbashree system and the poor have a stake in the work right at the beginning. ¬ß The technocratic power to accord Technical Sanction, measure works and recommend payments has been made more spread out and accountable through the Committee system. In case of difference of opinion the appellate system would be resorted to. ¬ß Special emphasis has been given to the rights of workers and they have been made fully aware of their entitlements. ¬ß All the payments are made only through the individual bank accounts of workers. This is the ultimate preventer of corruption. Yet there are apprehensions that once material purchase starts, corruption would come in, in some form or the other. The state is earnestly put in a system which deters corruption.  Systems and procedures  NREGS can give rise to a new work culture. The workers were hitherto controlled by contractors and their middlemen who knew how to extract work. When NREGS began the out-turn was very poor as the workers could not be supervised properly. But soon the workers themselves realized that they would be losing collectively and a new internal dynamics evolved with peer pressure forcing workers to put in their maximum effort. At the same time a kind of social responsibility also became evident as more capable workers became more than willing to put in extra effort to make up for those who genuinely could not do hard work beyond a point, like the women and the elderly. Public works have gained respectability. Hitherto they were seen as highjacked either by a contractor or a local leader. Now the workers see it as their right. They tend to distinguish between wages provided by a contractor and wages directly given by the Panchayat. The latter is almost equated with a salary. This has motivated a large section of people who were hitherto unwilling to work into join the work force. There was an interesting instance of a penurious descendant of the erstwhile Kollengode royal family in Palakkad taking an active part in NREGS and even motivating her relatives to join on the logic that self-help and access to legally entitled emoluments from a public source is better than charity from relatives Integration with other activities A strong natural resource management focus has been given to NREGS. Bharathapuzha River rejuvenation with action plans emanating from the Village Panchayat as building blocks was taken up as a mega project under the scheme. Attempt is on to integrate NREGS and People's Plan. Village Panchayats get more than Rs.1 crore on an average under People's Plan. If intelligently dovetailed it is expected that substantial improvement in quality of assets can be attained. In order to overcome the problem of shortage of technical staff, it has been decided to rope in voluntary services of reputed non-government organizations. Using the excellent network of Kudumbashree it has been decided in the State Employment Guarantee Council to develop a cadre of bare-foot technical volunteers from among the poor women. In order to develop the skills of the workers it has been decided to set up Labour Banks. A pilot has been launched in one Village Panchayat. The Labour Banks would be supported under People's Plan to take up other public works and even private works. It is well-nigh impossible to identify works in the plantation areas as well as in the coastal areas. It has been decided to seek the expert support from Government of India to come out with a shelf of projects which can be taken up in such geographical areas. An innovative form of training has been developed by Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) where there is a shift from the cascading model to a \\"ripple\\" model, according to which outstanding Panchayats become the master trainers and the neighbouring Panchayats formally learn from the experience of the best performers. Monitoring has been strengthened with the decision of the State Employment Guarantee Council to put in a system of State level and District level quality Monitors by identifying persons with reputation for integrity and competence. The State level Monitors would be of two categories ‚Äì outstanding individuals whose views are widely respected by society and senior Technical Experts capable of giving authoritative feed back on the quality of implementation. Further the State Employment Guarantee Council has decided to request a team consisting of eminent experts to conduct an independent assessment of Kerala's performance and offer suggestions for improvement.  A good beginning  Though there were several teething problems it is clear that the policy focus on natural resource management and corruption-free implementation and the administrative measures introduced to operationalise the policy especially the involvement of the Kudumbasree network have resulted in a strong foundation being laid and opened up space for pro-poor innovations. NREGS has suddenly increased purchasing power of the poor and there is visible local economic development. This is particularly true of Wayanad which was ridden with farmer suicides. The peasants have managed to get substantial relief from NREGS by getting over their inhibition in working as labourers in richer farmer's lands by moving on to the now-respectable public works.NCAER-PIF study on evaluating performance of National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,New Delhi, NCAER,2009 A recent study conducted by Chathukulam and Gireesan, of Centre for Rural Management ( CRM) indicated that major defects identified during previous wage employment programmes were absent in the NREGS in the State and provision of equal wages to men and women, non-involvement of contractors, very limited use of machinery, adherence to wage- material ratio etc. were followed and the absence of muster roll manipulations was absent in the execution of the program in the initial two districts of Palakkad and Wayanad.Impact Assessment of NREGS in Kerala Evaluation of Systems and Processes by Jos Chathukulam and Gireesan, Centre for Rural Management(CRM), Kottayam, April, 2008 ReferencesExternal links * Government orders on NREGS in Kerala * A webpage on Status of NREGA in Kerala * Impact assessment of NREGS in Kerala : Evaluation of systems and processes by Dr Jos Chathukulam and Dr Gireesan * Implementation of NREGS : Experience in Kerala by S M Vijayanand and V N Jitendran * Government of Kerala ‚Äì Order on implementation of the scheme in forest areas in Kerala * Status of NREGA in India * NREGA : Ship without rudder by Dr Jean Dreaze * NREG implementation poor in state * A critique of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005  See also  * National Rural Employment Guarantee Act * Local Governance in Kerala Category:Local government in Kerala Category:Rural development in India Category:Government welfare schemes in Kerala ","title":"National Rural Employment Generation Scheme"},{"id":"20888332","text":"Masuren was a 2,385 ton cargo ship which was built in 1935.

The department has a long history within the state, and its law enforcement personnel have a reputation of being some of the best in the country. Besides its support of the California Attorney General, the department is frequently mentioned in the newsmedia for (among other activities): * Its assistance to federal law enforcement agencies, for example, CA DOJ Special Agents working alongside their federal counterparts on cases and while federalized on several different task forces. * Its forensic laboratory work that processes evidence from multiple agencies throughout the state. * Its statistics, for example, on weapons sales in California.Thompson, Don.

Daily News of Los Angeles, December 10, 2007. Special agents alt= The sworn law enforcement personnel of CA DOJ (primarily assigned to the Division of Law Enforcement), consists of approximately 400 law enforcement officers (Special Agents). They make up a group a criminal investigators with varied backgrounds in law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This small, but elite, group of sworn peace officers are generally better educated and more experienced than many of their law-enforcement counterparts, and are often called upon for their expertise and ability to coordinate joint activities between local, state, and federal agencies throughout the state. Special Agents are a force multiplier, assisting agencies with expertise, equipment and personnel. Whether running a narcotic task force, investigating a murder, uncovering political corruption, bringing human traffickers to justice, or disrupting violent gangs, CA DOJ Special Agents consistently conduct a variety of law enforcement investigative activities at multiple levels. Additionally, CA DOJ Special Agents are often federally deputized/cross-sworn as federal agents in order to allow them to complete cases outside of California or to participate in federal task forces. They are also frequently chosen by their peer agencies as the lead group in multi-jurisdictional cases.

Accessed 2017 Dec 30. =History= While the California Office of the Attorney General was created in 1850, the law enforcement and criminal investigative capabilities of the CA DOJ were not fully established until the early 20th century. However, the mission of CA DOJ Special Agents mirrors that of the original California Rangers; the first statewide criminal investigative and law enforcement agency created on May 17, 1853. Although the California Rangers were quickly disbanded following their success in bringing the violent Five Joaquins gang to justice, their special law enforcement capabilities and statewide investigative mission have been primarily transferred to the Special Agents of CA DOJ.California Department of Justice.

The division is not only the largest within the department, but also one of the largest statewide investigative law enforcement agencies in the United States. Its staff consists of sworn law enforcement officers (Special Agents), criminalists/forensic scientists, analysts, and other professional personnel. The primary mission of the Division of Law Enforcement is to enhance public safety by conducting criminal investigations, regulatory oversight, and forensic analysis of evidence for criminal proceedings. The division also assists local, state and federal agencies by providing services in specialized areas including: * Investigation of complex crimes * Collection and analysis of evidence * Training and education * Enforcing state gambling and firearm laws and regulations * Computer forensic training Investigative Bureaus=California Bureau of Investigation= The California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), was established in 1918 as the California Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (CBCII). CBCII, along with the disbanded California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) which was created in 1927 (the remainder of BNE merged with CBI in 2012), provided the state with its initial criminal investigative law enforcement capabilities and is considered the direct predecessor to the modern day CBI‚Äîthe oldest, continuously operating, law enforcement investigative bureau/agency within CA DOJ, and the state. The CBI provides statewide expert investigative services through special agents combating multi-jurisdictional criminal organizations, and also operates several programs including a Special Operations Unit (SOU) primarily handling violent gang and murder investigations assisting local agencies, a Special Investigations Team (SIT) handling high-profile criminal and civil investigations, an Electronics Crime Unit handling cyber-based and/or electronic crimes including hacking and fraud, the state task force program, LA CLEAR, and the state anti-terrorism program.

The BOF conducts a variety of operations, including undercover investigations for violations of state firearms laws, training local law-enforcement officials on firearms law and regulations, inspecting licensed firearms dealers, lending safety assistance to gun show promoters, locating and arresting felons in possession of firearms, and testifying as expert witnesses. The BOF also works closely with its federal counterparts in the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). =Bureau of Gambling Control= The California Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) \\"regulates legal gambling activities.\\" The BGC investigates casinos and card clubs throughout California for violations of California's gaming laws. Violation of state gaming laws by casinos and clubs as well as their employees and customers are the focus of most BGC investigations. They also investigate complex thefts, robberies, scams and other crimes related to the casinos and clubs. =Bureau of Forensic Services= The California Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) is the scientific arm of the department, whose mission is to serve the people of California on behalf of the Attorney General's Office with state of the art forensic services throughout the state. Forensic scientists collect, analyze, and compare physical evidence from suspected crimes via some of the most well- equipped and accredited forensic science laboratories in the country. =Division of California Justice Information Services= The Division of California Justice Information (CJIS) \\"facilitates the exchange of criminal justice intelligence among law enforcement agencies\\" =Division of Criminal Law=Overview The Division of Criminal Law \\"represent[s] the People of the State of California in criminal cases.\\" DCL Sections and Investigative Bureaus=Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud & Elder Abuse= The California Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud & Elder Abuse (BMFEA) protects California's most vulnerable citizens and helps to safeguard the state's Medi- Cal program. The Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse works aggressively to investigate and prosecute those who rob taxpayers of millions of dollars each year and divert scarce health care resources from the needy. The BMFEA is funded via an $18.6 million federal grant program. The Bureau conducts statewide investigations and prosecutes fraud relating to the activities of medical providers receiving funding under the Medi-Cal system. The section also reviews and prosecutes reports of elder abuse and neglect of patients housed in federally funded nursing home facilities. =Appeals, Writs and Trials Section= The Appeals, Writs and Trials Section handles post- conviction proceedings. This involves prosecuting felony criminal appeals in state court, responding to petitions for writs of habeas corpus in state and federal courts, and prosecuting death penalty appeals. Deputies also handle criminal investigations, conduct evidentiary hearings, appear in local courts to litigate recusal motions, and prosecute felonies in cases in which the local county district attorney has been recused or otherwise removed from the case. Deputies appear regularly in the California Court of Appeal, California Supreme Court, United States District Court, and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and occasionally in the United States Supreme Court. =Correctional Writs & Appeals Section= The Correctional Writs & Appeals Section represents the state in civil rights actions involving state prisoners. This section also represents the Department of Corrections, Board of Prison Terms, Youth Authority and the Department of Mental Health and their employees in cases regarding policies, practices or conditions of confinement of inmates. =Office of Native American Affairs= The Office of Native American Affairs serves as liaison and addresses justice-related issues for California's Indian citizens who reside on reservations, rancherias and in urban communities for the overall improvement of the quality of life for Indian people. =Financial Fraud and Special Prosecutions Unit= The Financial Fraud and Special Prosecutions Unit investigates and prosecutes complex criminal cases occurring in California, primarily related to financial, securities, mortgage, and environmental fraud; public corruption, including violations of California's Political Reform Act; ‚Äúunderground economy‚Äù offenses, including tax and revenue fraud and counterfeiting; transnational organized crime; human trafficking; and crimes within the scope of the Attorney General's Bureau of Children's Justice.

Castle Interior view of Brdo Castle Brdo Castle (), also known as the Kersnik Manor (), is located in the settlement. A castle was first mentioned at Brdo in the 15th century but was destroyed in the peasant uprising of 1515. The current structure is a 16th-century castle that was built by the Counts of Lamberg. A plaque above the entry is dated 1552 and bears the Lamberg coat of arms and a German inscription: \\"The noble Hans von Lamberg, owner of ƒårnelo and Menge≈°, started building this castle, and then by God's will it was completed by his son Andreas von Lamberg of ƒårnelo and Jablje.\\" Ownership of the castle changed several times in the 17th century. In 1622 the Lambergs pledged it to Anton Peƒçoviƒç, and two years later to J. Jo≈æef Taller. It was damaged in the peasant uprising of 1635. It was then inherited by J. Ludvik, Count of Hohenwart and subsequently sold to F. Ernest, Baron of Apfaltrer. The Apfaltrers owned the castle until the mid-18th century. After the death of the last Apfaltrer, the castle was inherited by F. Bernard, Count of Lamberg, and then by his son F. Adam. In 1803 his successor Janez Nepomuk sold the castle to Janez Burger. It was then inherited by his daughter Ivana Burger H√∂ffern, who remained the owner until 1879. From 1867 until the Second World War it housed the local court (with offices on the second floor in the northern part), revenue offices, and prison (located in the cellar in the southern part).Castles in Slovenia site The Slovene writer and politician Janko Kersnik was born at the castle in 1852 and was also its owner from 1883 until his death in 1897. Ownership then passed to Kersnik's mother Berta H√∂ffern Kersnik, and then to his son Anton Kersnik in 1911. In 1941 the German authorities arrested inhabitants and sent them to Serbia, expropriated the castle and headquartered a German police and military unit in it. The castle was burned down by the Partisans in 1943. After the end of the Second World War the authorities refused permission to its owners to restore the castle. The building was therefore left without a roof, and it rapidly began to deteriorate and only the exterior walls now remain. In 1994 a conservation program was adopted for the ruins. The current owner of the structure is Kersnik's grandson Franc Kersnik. On southwest watchtower there is a relief with portrait of Janko Kersnik.

LARP Alliance, Inc. assisted in providing a number of real LARPers hired onto the movie project, arriving from all over the world, to be extras. LARPs represented by those real LARPers include the [IFGS], [NERO], Maelstrom, Dagorhir, Adventures Unlimited / Realms of Conflict, Eidolon, Apocalarp, Amtgard, and more. Adrianne Grady, Rick McCoy, and the LARP Alliance have also assisted other productions including the movie Lloyd the Conqueror, Tosh.0 show and G4, WebTV, History Channel, Spike TV, Boing BoingTV, the band A Hawk and A Hacksaw's \\"Cervantine\\" music video, and Sony PlayStation: God of War II.Sony PlayStation: Gods of War 2 via Darkon LARPBoingBoingTV: LARP SpecialG4 TV: LARP Focus LARPMedia.com was developed and implemented for the community by the LARP Alliance to showcase LARP-related media such as movies, episodics, music videos, and other productions. Their work has included assisting LARPers with their on-camera presence, alerting them to media opportunities such as television shows, documentaries, music videos, and movies, and connecting LARPs and LARPers with legal advisors. They have also brought together LARP- artisans (costumers, weapon and propmakers) with media project directors. Additionally, the LARP Alliance assists in the enhancement of the LARP community's visual and audio presentation within itself and to the general public by use of special videos and photography. Events * Xatrian Crux - a multi-genre sci-fi-based event whose system is designed to allow characters from any LARP to come in and play. * ERIAL Battle Royale - a medieval/fantasy event based on the movie Role Models and its fantasy game called LAIRE which is a LARP promotional tool aimed at the general public and current LARP community. * LARP Con - similar in concept to Intercon LARP conventions, with a World Con model in mind, and held on the west coast. LARP Con creators, Adrianne Grady and Rick McCoy, brought the LARP Con project to Ira Ham in a partnership agreement that developed Wyrd Con, the first west coast LARP convention. * LARP Quest - a company developed as a side project within LARP Alliance to provide a series of mini line course LARP events designed to be incorporated into various environments and events for entertainment and/or education. LARP Quest has assisted Mattel, Theatre Unleashed, and other companies. Other Programs and Projects *LARP Meetups are held monthly to discuss and brainstorm over LARP concepts and the overall state of LARP in the world. The LARP Alliance is behind a number of large and small game rules revisions and creations currently in use across the US (Realms of Conflict, Live Effects games, Eidolon, and others). *Fighter Practices - Showcasing new acting/fighting/rules techniques at LARP Alliance events and conventions including (World Con, Wyrd Con, Gen Con, Comic Con, and Strategicon) - Fighter practices are held in multiple regions to spotlight various LARP styles (such as IFGS, NERO, Adventures Unlimited, Dagorhir, and many others), and give equal opportunity to all current and potential LARPers. *LARP Space - The first online multi-genre and multi-LARP community of its kind - global outreach *Support numerous Charities *Multi-LARP and multi-genre events & Maintaining a public LARP Events Calendar (globally inclusive) *Workshops/Classes/Training - Weapon-building (in a variety of styles), Role- play and character development, Costuming and Prop-making *Provide ideas/concepts on rules, business, and more to LARPs and LARPers (Assisted Adventures Unlimited, Live Effects, and others) *Bi-Monthly globally inclusive newsletter and articles throughout the LARP community *Promoting LARPs via websites and articles (assisting in the rapid growth of all SoCal LARPs) *Spotlight - LARPer of the Year, LARPer of the Month *Transportation assistance to and from events & Player-Share Program *LARP Album - \\"The Gallivanter's Rhapsody\\" - LARP Alliance is the director and distributor of this compilation album and first of its kind. The LARP Album is a multi-genre collection of original LARP-inspired songs and comical audio pieces (in conjunction with Knollwit Studio) contributed to by various LARP organizations and artists. It spotlights a variety of IC (In-Character) and OOC (Out-Of- Character) pieces (similar in concept to a \\"Best Of\\" Album). In-game tools The Adventurer's Guild (aka The Academy) is an in-game and in-character assistant directed at newbies (new LARPers or those new to a specific game system). This traveling unit provides game rules instructions and character skill practice, teaches strategy/battle prep, all while keeping players in- character and giving them each specific character plot. Other contributions They have contributed hundreds of weapons and props/sets/effects to LARP functions and players in order to showcase new product and provide gear to those who have none. They often are known to contribute other items and labor such as food, cooking and construction labor, and talent (musicians, actors, dancers, etc.) to enhance the atmosphere of the games.

Annals of Mathematics, Vol. 102, No. 6 (1975) pp. 159‚Äì182. proved that the value of this norm for all q \\\\ge 2 is :\\\\\\\\mathcal F\\\\_{q,p} = \\\\left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\\\\right)^{n/2}. Thus we have the Babenko‚ÄìBeckner inequality that :\\\\\\\\mathcal Ff\\\\_q \\\\le \\\\left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\\\\right)^{n/2} \\\\f\\\\_p.

Then the operator :C:a+bx \\\\rightarrow a + \\\\omega bx maps L^p(d u) to L^q(d u) with norm 1; that is, :\\\\left[\\\\inta+\\\\omega bx^q d u(x)\\\\right]^{1/q} \\\\le \\\\left[\\\\inta+bx^p d u(x)\\\\right]^{1/p}, or more explicitly, :\\\\left[\\\\frac {a+\\\\omega b^q + a-\\\\omega b^q} 2 \\\\right]^{1/q} \\\\le \\\\left[\\\\frac {a+b^p + a-b^p} 2 \\\\right]^{1/p} for any complex a, b. (See Beckner's paper for the proof of his \\"two-point lemma\\".) =A sequence of Bernoulli trials= The measure d u that was introduced above is actually a fair Bernoulli trial with mean 0 and variance 1. Consider the sum of a sequence of n such Bernoulli trials, independent and normalized so that the standard deviation remains 1. We obtain the measure d u_n(x) which is the n-fold convolution of d u(\\\\sqrt n x) with itself. The next step is to extend the operator C defined on the two-point space above to an operator defined on the (n + 1)-point space of d u_n(x) with respect to the elementary symmetric polynomials. =Convergence to standard normal distribution= The sequence d u_n(x) converges weakly to the standard normal probability distribution d\\\\mu(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}\\\\, dx with respect to functions of polynomial growth. In the limit, the extension of the operator C above in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials with respect to the measure d u_n(x) is expressed as an operator T in terms of the Hermite polynomials with respect to the standard normal distribution. These Hermite functions are the eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, and the (q, p)-norm of the Fourier transform is obtained as a result after some renormalization.

The origins of traditional Japanese flower arrangement through the Ikenob≈ç school are linked to Rokkaku-d≈ç in the medieval Muromachi period. Kansai Window : Kansai History and Culture. Rokkaku-d≈ç was instrumental in the development of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´. In 1201 CE, Shinran undertook a 100-day retreat. He had a dream on the 95th day, seeing Prince Sh≈çtoku (regarded as an incarnation of Avalokite≈õvara), who directed him to another monk, H≈çnen. Shinran subsequently became H≈çnen's disciple, establishing J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ within H≈çnen's J≈çdo-sh≈´. Legends  According to legend, when Prince Sh≈çtoku (ËÅñÂæ≥Â§™Â≠ê) was a child on Awaji Island he found a small Chinese chest that had floated ashore. Opening the lid, the prince found a gold image about 5.5 cm long of the Nyoirin Kannon, which he decided to keep as a sacred Buddhist image or amulet. He prayed to the Kannon to bring him success, promising Kannon that he would build Shitenno-ji Temple (in the area of present Osaka) if he was successful. In 587, Prince Shotoku decided to build the great temple of Shitennoj-i in Osaka. Searching for building materials, the prince journeyed out from Osaka. It was a hot day and the prince stopped by a pond to cool down. He took off his clothes and his precious amulet in order to bathe in the pond. He placed his clothes and the Nyoirin Kannon on a nearby tree. After his swim, he went to put on his clothes and put the Nyoirin Kannon back in his pocket. Suddenly the Kannon became too heavy to pick up and the prince was unable to continue. So the prince decided to spend the night there and await the morning. During the night he dreamed that Nyoirin Kannon appeared to him saying, ‚ÄúWith this amulet I have given you, I have protected many generations but now I wish to remain in this place. You must build a six sided temple and enshrine me within this temple. Many people will come here and be healed.‚Äù So Prince Shotoku built the temple and enshrined Nyoirin Kannon within it. In 1204, when he was 29 years old, Shinran Shonin (1173 - 1263) decided to spend 100 days in seclusion or privacy at Rokkakudo Temple. On the 95th day, Kannon appeared to Shinran in a dream and told him to forgo his vow of celibacy and marry. She told him that she would appear to him in the form of a woman and they would become lovers and enter into Amida‚Äôs Paradise. She then told him that he should seek out Honen, his teacher, and found a new order of Buddhism that encouraged clerical marriage and family life. A small hexagonal hall at Rokkakudo features two statues of Shinran ‚Äì one seated in a dream trance and one standing with walking staff and beads.

The New York Times wrote that she was \\"regarded as Hawaii's last great exponent of the sacred hula ceremony,\\" and the Honolulu Advertiser wrote: \\"In her ancient dances, she was the poet of the Hawaiian people.\\" The Iolani Luahine Hula Festival was established in her memory, and awards a scholarship award each year to encourage a student to continue the study of hula. Early years Luahine was born in 1915 in the village of NƒÅpo ªopo'o, near Captain Cook, Hawaii. Her given name was Harriet Lanihau Makekau, and she was the youngest of five daughters in a pure Hawaiian family that traced its genealogy to dancers and keepers of ancient Hawaiian rituals and chants. Iolani was raised by her great aunt Julia Keahi Luahine (1877-1937), who began educating her in the ancient Kauai school of hula when she was four years old. Her aunt Keahi was \\"the foremost hula instructor of her day and one of the last royal dancers from King KalƒÅkaua's and Queen Lili‚Äôuokalani's court.\\" When she was a child, she was afflicted with an illness in her eyes, and a kahuna nui (seer) said she had to be renamed Iolani, heavenly, or royal hawk, after the \`io, native Hawaiian hawk. Her eyesight reportedly cleared shortly after her name was changed. Iolani attended the Kamehameha Schools, but her aunt removed her after learning that dancing hula was forbidden by the \\"missionary\\" institution. After leaving the Kamehameha Schools, Luahine attended St. Andrew's Priory, at St. Andrew‚Äôs Cathedral, where hula dancing was permitted. Iolani later attended the University of Hawaii where she began hula classes with Mary Kawena Pukui. As Iolani's mentor, Pukui steered her away from the commercialized hula forms popularized by Hollywood films. Practitioner and teacher of the ancient hula Luahine opened a hula studio in her home on Honolulu's Queen Street in 1946. There, she taught hula to students of all ages. Her well-known students included George Na ªope, Kawaikapuokalani Hewett and her niece, Hoakalei Kamau'u. In 1947, modern-dance pioneer Ted Shawn called her \\"an artist of world stature.\\" She continued to perform and collaborate with other renowned hula artists, including her former teacher, Mary Kawena Pukui, and Lokalia Montgomery. She was featured in two documentary films, one in 1960 and the other in 1976, and several television programs. She has been referred to as the \\"high priestess\\" of the ancient hula\\", a \\"link to traditional Hawaiian culture\\", and \\"the last handmaiden to the Hawaiian gods.\\" Her students and friends spoke of her lessons in a reverent manner. Luana Haraguchi called Luahine her greatest influence and said, \\"When she danced, she floated. Sometimes when she taught, she would just tell us a story, about the people, the types of rain and vegetation in a certain song. It could last two or three hours. That was the dance class.\\" Dorothy Thompson, a co-founder of the Merrie Monarch Festival, an annual week-long hula festival in Hilo, Hawaii, described Luahine as follows: \\"Her dance was her life and her story itself. 'Io was such a beautiful person, an extraordinary dancer. She seemed like she would go into a trance. And her movements were like nobody else's.\\" Some who knew her told stories of Luahine's \\"mystic abilities.\\" The Honolulu Advertiser wrote that those who saw her perform \\"typically speak about the almost mystical experience she seemed to channel.\\" Some say she had \\"a deep, spiritual connection to the hula goddess Laka and the volcano goddess Pele.\\" Others claimed that she \\"could call up the wind and the rain and could make animals do her bidding.\\" In 1969, organizers of the Merrie Monarch Festival were about to cancel their parade because of heavy rain, but Luahine said the rain would stop for two hours starting at 1 p.m. Even organizer Dorothy Thompson recalled: \\"She told me the parade had to start on time, at 1 o'clock, because the rain would stop for only two hours. It poured cats and dogs. At 1 o'clock on the nose the rain stopped, and at 3 o'clock the rain came down.\\" Hula master George Na ªope told a story that the Queen of Tonga and an FBI escort were visiting Hawaii, and the queen would not get out of the car because it was too windy. According to Na'ope's story, \\"Iolani turned around, chanted, and the wind stopped. After that, the queen and the FBI were supposed to go to a hotel in Kona, and instead they went to Iolani‚Äôs house in Napoopoo, where she summoned all the animals to greet the queen. Her dog barked, her cat meowed, her rooster crowed, her pig oinked, and they bowed to the queen. When someone said that they are not supposed to be at Iolani‚Äôs house, an FBI agent replied, 'If she can stop the wind, we are going to be here.'\\" In 1970, Luahine and Lokalia Montgomery became the first recipients of Hawaii's State Order of Distinction for Cultural Leadership. Luahine gained worldwide recognition and was invited to perform at the National Folk Festival in Wolf Trap, Virginia three times. She was also named a \\"Living Treasure\\" in 1972. In 1972, she was still performing. Honolulu Star-Bulletin columnist Ben Wood recalled playing recordings for her featuring Gabby Pahinui, Sonny Chillingworth, Atta Isaacs and Eddie Kamae. He later wrote: \\"When the music started, Iolani fell silent and a distant look came to her eyes. Then she sprang up and started dancing to the music. I was in awe.\\" Posthumous honors and recognition When she died in 1978, The New York Times wrote that she was \\"regarded as Hawaii's last great exponent of the sacred hula ceremony.\\" The Honolulu Advertiser wrote: \\"In her ancient dances, she was the poet of the Hawaiian people.\\" A mainland newspaper called her \\"the foremost hula dancer of the 20th century.\\" The Honolulu Star-Bulletin called her \\"easily one of Hawaii's greatest dancers if not the greatest.\\" And the Honolulu Advertiser wrote: > \\"Yet, while Luahine certainly helped bring international recognition and > respect to traditional hula, her impact in her home Islands might have been > even greater in that she helped keep Hawaiian culture alive through the > latter days of its suppression. ... As a kumu in her own right, Luahine, a > longtime curator of the Hulihe'e Palace in Kailua, Kona, and an adviser to > the Merrie Monarch Festival, would become one of the most ardent and beloved > practitioners of ancient Hawaiian hula and chant.\\" In 1980, Iolani Luahine received an academic and lifetime achievement award called Na Makua Mahalo Ia presented by the Institute for Polynesian Studies under Brigham Young University Hawaii. This award was presented after Aunty Iolani's death, therefore, her student and niece Hoakalei Kamau\`u humbly received the award in her honor. In 1985, Hawaiian photographer and historian, Francis Haar, published a biography of Luahine. In 1997, a statue of Luahine (sculpted by Kim Duffet) was dedicated at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, where Luahine performed in the 1950s. In 2003, the 'Iolani Luahine Hula Festival was established to perpetuate the hula, the memory of Luahine, and her contributions to the preservation of hula and the Hawaiian culture. The festival awards a hula scholarship award each year to encourage a student to continue the study of hula. In 2005, the documentary film, Keepers of the Flame: The Cultural Legacy of Three Hawaiian Women profiled Luahine, her teacher Mary Kawena Pukui and Edith Kanakaole. In March 2017, Hawai ªi Magazine ranked her among a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

The hall, comprising the eastern half of the E. Cullen Building, was named in honor of Ezekiel W. Cullen, a former congressman for the Republic of Texas. The facility seats 1,544, and hosts music, opera, dance, theatrical events, and public lectures. Opening in 1950, the facility was designed by Alfred C. Finn. History On March 21, 1945, the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building along with Cullen Performance Hall was announced. Construction of Cullen Performance Hall was part of a large expansion to the University of Houston's permanent buildings on campus that took place starting on May 10, 1948. The hall originally sat 1,680, and was intended to host similar events as the Houston Music Hall which was the main music venue for the city at the time. The hall was named in honor of Ezekiel W. Cullen, a congressman for the Republic of Texas, and the grandfather of then University of Houston Regent Hugh Roy Cullen who was the principal donor to the project. The university hired native Houston architect Alfred C. Finn to design the building. In order to give the building a classical look, Finn designed the building with long wings and regularly spaced pilasters. The dedication of the Cullen Performance Hall was held in conjunction with the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building on Halloween of 1950. For the dedication, conductor Efrem Kurtz directed the Houston Symphony Orchestra, and H.R. Cullen gave a speech. In 1988, the facility received complete renovations.

Autolysis in winemaking relates to the complex chemical reactions that take place when a wine spends time in contact with the lees, or dead yeast cells, after fermentation. While for some wines - and all beers \\\\- autolysis is undesirable, it is a vital component in shaping the flavors and mouth feel associated with premium Champagne production.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 54 Oxford University Press 2006 Champagne Science \\"Autolysis - and its effects on Champagne \\" Accessed: December 30th, 2008 The practice of leaving a wine to age on its lees (or sur lie aging) has a long history in winemaking dating back to Roman winemaking. The chemical process and details of autolysis were not originally understood scientifically, but the positive effects such as a creamy mouthfeel, breadlike and floral aromas, and reduced astringency were noticed early in the history of wine.Jancis Robinson (ed), The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pg 399 Oxford University Press 2006 History Ancient Roman writers, such as Marcus Porcius Cato, observed that wine that was left on its lees (or sediment as they knew it) exhibited different characteristics than wine that was quickly separated from its sediment. While the Romans did not understand the full chemical process or details behind the autolysis that took place, they were able to perceive the results of this autolysis in the creamy mouthfeel, reduced astringency and unique flavors and aromas that developed. With modern day understanding of autolysis, winemaking in the Champagne have strict regulation regarding the time Champagne must spend in contact with its lees in order to receive some benefit from autolysis. Under Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) regulations, wines from Champagne cannot legally be sold until it has gone through autolysis in the bottle for at least 15 months with non-vintage Champagne. Vintage Champagne must have a minimum of 3 years aging; some Champagne houses extend the time for autolysis to 7 years or more.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 653 Workman Publishing 2001 Process As the Champagne ages on its lees (pictured inside bottle) the process of autolysis causes the release of mannoproteins and polysaccharides that influence the flavor of the wine. During fermentation, yeast cells convert the sugar in the grape must into ethanol. When the sugar food source for the yeast and necessary nutrients such as nitrogen run out, or the alcohol level of the wine reaches such a point to where it is toxic for the yeast, the cells die and sink to the bottom of the fermentation vessel. These dead cells, or \\"lees\\", are normally removed by racking the wine into a clean vessel. If the wine is left in contact with the lees, enzymes start to break the cells down producing mannoproteins (mannose-containing glycoproteins) and polysaccharides that are released into the wine. In sparkling wine production, a wine is made \\"sparkling\\" or \\"bubbly\\" because a secondary fermentation is introduced when the wine is contained within a sealed wine bottle. During this time the wine is deliberately kept in contact with its lees inside the bottle for a period ranging from a couple of months to several years. Studies have shown that the chemical reaction of autolysis, and its impact on the wine, starts to become noticeable after 18 months and will continue to impart traits for at least 5 years. The sparkling wine is eventually separated from its lees through a technique known as riddling and disgorgement. Influences on the wine The effects of autolysis on wine contributes to a creamy mouthfeel that may make a wine seem to have a fuller body. The release of enzymes inhibits oxidation which improves some of the aging potential of the wine. The mannoproteins improve the overall stability of the proteins in the wine by reducing the amount of tartrates that are precipitated out. They may also bind with the tannins in the wine to reduce the perception of bitterness or astringency in the wine. The increased production of amino acids leads to the develop of several flavors associated with premium Champagne including aromas of biscuitsCaterer and Hotel Keeper Magazine \\"The changing face of Moet\\"' July 26th, 2001 or bread dough, nuttinessBeverage Industry Factsheet \\"Autolysis \\" Accessed Dec. 20th, 2008 and acacia. As the wine ages further, more complex notes may develop from the effects of autolysis. =Potential faults= If not properly managed, wine faults can potentially develop from autolysis. If the layer of lees begins to exceed 4 inches (10 centimeters), the enzymes released from the process of the yeast digesting themselves creates reducing conditions and promotes the development of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptan odors. The process of stirring the lees or b√¢ttonage can help prevent a thick layer of lees forming and promote a smoother autolysis. Poor hygiene of the winemaking equipment or wine made from grapes that had residue from fungicide can create off odors smelling of sulfide. See also * Light Lees Protocol ReferencesExternal links *M.

Life He was born in 1823 at Holker in North Lancashire. After education at the grammar school of Cartmel he was, at the age of thirteen, apprenticed to a partnership of surgeons in Lancaster, and went thence to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1841. He was distinguished in the school examinations, and in 1846 graduated M.D. at Berlin. In 1855, he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and delivered the Gulstonian lectures there in 1856. Sir James Paget was then warden of the college of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and in 1848 he and Kirkes published a Handbook of Physiology, which soon became popular among students of medicine. A second edition appeared in 1851, and further editions by Kirkes alone in 1856, 1860, and 1863. In 1867, 1869, 1872, and 1876 further editions by William Morrant Baker appeared. Vincent Dormer Harris was next joined with Baker in several editions, and then edited the book himself, with the assistance of Mr. D'Arcy Power. John Murray, the publisher, to whom it was a valuable property, next employed William Dobbinson Halliburton, under whose care no part of the original work of Kirkes, except his name on the outside cover, remained, and in this form the book goes through almost annual editions, and is still the most popular textbook of physiology for medical students. Kirkes was appointed demonstrator of morbid anatomy to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1848, and in 1854 defeated Dr. John William Hue in a contest for the office of assistant physician. He became lecturer on botany, and then on medicine, and in 1864, when Sir George Burrows resigned, he was elected physician to the hospital. He died at his house in Lower Seymour Street of double pneumonia with pericarditis after five days' illness on 8 December 1864. Work His most original work is a paper in the Transactions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London (xxxv. 281 ) on \\"Embolism, or the carrying of blood-clots from the heart to remote parts of the body,\\" a pathological process then just beginning to be recognised. Kirkes' main research field was cardiology and vascular disease, and he first described embolism from vegetations in infective endocarditis in 1852. In 1855, he published a paper on apoplexy in Bright's disease, in which he singled out the role played by increased intra-arterial tension in arterial disease.

The operation occurred under the auspices of Operation Astute, being the deployment of Australian forces in the wake of 2006 East Timorese crisis, and resulted in the Australians successfully securing the target compound and defeating the small rebel force, before the assault was called off by the Timor Leste government. Reinado and nine other rebels subsequently evaded the Australian cordon, however, and made good their escape into the mountains. Prelude Alfredo Reinado was a significant figure during the crisis, leading a mutiny in May 2006 during which nearly 600 soldiers deserted and triggered clashes between rival factions of the Timor Leste Defence Force (F-FDTL) and the National Police of East Timor (PNTL). He was subsequently detained on charges of murder and mutiny. However, he later escaped from Becora Prison in Dili along with 50 other prisoners on 30 August 2006 and had been on the run ever since, all the while attempting to negotiate a pardon. Following a large man-hunt he was finally tracked to a mountain compound in Same in late February 2007.'Timor: Anzac Battle Group', Australian and New Zealand Defender Magazine, Winter 2007, pp. 22‚Äì26. The situation became serious after Reinado's rebels raided a police station west of Maliana on 25 February and stole radios, automatic assault rifles, pistols and ammunition. In response Australian and New Zealand forces from the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), including infantry from 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment and armour from B Squadron, 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment, were subsequently ordered to seal off Same. Following the failure of negotiations between the Timor Leste government and the rebels, the decision was made to detain Reinado by force, with President Xanana Gusm√£o ordering international security forces to arrest him. Battle On 1 March Reinado was quoted on Al Jezeera as saying that \\"Australian special troops\\" were away from his hideout and that he would \\"fight to the end\\", criticising the government and stating that \\"if any political leader wants to harm the stability of this nation, I have a right to stand up and defend the people.\\" Brigadier Mal Rerden, Commander ISF, subsequently delivered an ultimatum, saying that \\"any operation to capture Reinado would involve appropriate use of force\\", urging him to surrender. \\"He has one option. He can help the people of Timor-Leste by surrendering himself and removing the threat of the weapons... If he cares about the people of Timor-Leste, if he cares about the people with him now, he would give up his weapons and surrender. Anything that happens from now on is his responsibility.\\" Reinado refused to surrender however, and following the written approval by the Timor Leste authorities for the conduct of offensive operations, four C-130 Hercules aircraft carrying a task force consisting of approximately 100 Australian special forces troops subsequently deployed to Dili on 2 March. Known as the Apprehension Task Group, it was believed to include a Commando Company from the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment as well as personnel from the Special Air Service Regiment. Under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Mark Smethurst, a Special Forces officer with extensive operational experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, the elite force was tasked with capturing Reinado and ending the stand-off.Horner 2008, p. 336. Although many of the details of the operation remain classified, according to one report the Special Forces assault group moved in late on 3 March, while ISF conventional forces secured the approaches to the compound. An S-70A Blackhawk helicopter inserted one Special Forces team into the compound, while three M113 armored personnel carriers from 3/4CAV moved on the Petitioners, inserting another Special Forces team into blocking positions. At 01:45 on 4 March a second Blackhawk deployed another assault group into the corn garden close to the compound. It is believed that the rebels subsequently detected the Australian insertion and opened fire on the helicopter, with the Australians returning fire in response and killing two rebels before continuing with the assault. At least two more of Reinado's men were killed and another wounded during the subsequent fighting, which continued for a further 90 minutes. However, for reasons that remain unclear Dili then ordered the Australian assault to cease, and the Special Forces teams were subsequently stood down. Reinado and nine other rebels‚Äîpossibly including Gastao Salsinha according to one source‚Äîwere believed to have evaded the Australian cordon amid the thick vegetation, and made good their escape into the mountains. The Australians subsequently occupied the compound. Aftermath During the clearance of the compound five rebels were found dead and one wounded, while a number of others were also captured. There were no Australian casualties in the operation. Meanwhile, a major ISF cordon and sweep operation of the area failed to capture the survivors. Rerden was later quoted in the media as saying that the rebels were killed \\"because they were armed and posed an unpredictable threat.\\" Further stating that \\"we don't have him,\\" and we are \\"continuing the operation to capture him\\", denying that the operation had been botched although declining to give additional details. \\"Any operation is a series of phases... this operation is ongoing and it will succeed.\\" He said his troops had cleared Reinado's base and captured some prisoners, but he declined to say how many. Regardless, despite successfully securing the compound and defeating the small rebel force, the most immediate consequence of the mission was its failure to capture Reinado. Indeed, he remained on the run, leading to concerns about the potential for violence in the lead up to East Timor's presidential elections, set for 9 April. Equally there was significant criticism of the conduct of the operation in the press in Australia and from the public in Timor Leste, with large crowds rioting outside the Australian embassy in Dili and in the village of Gleno where Reinado grew up, trashing cars and two government buildings. Ultimately the elections passed peacefully however, and by mid-April 2007 the search for Reinado was called off by the Timor Leste government, ostensibly in order to facilitate dialogue. In August 2007 Reinado subsequently met with Jos√© Ramos- Horta, who was by this time President, with the pair backing the initiation of a dialogue that would seek a peaceful resolution. However, on 11 February 2008 violence flared again, and Reinado was subsequently killed during a coordinated attempt to assassinate both Gusm√£o and Ramos-Horta.

Life and career Urspruch was a pupil of Ignaz Lachner and Joachim Raff in Frankfurt, and later one of the favourite students of Franz Liszt in Weimar. In 1878 he was appointed one of the first teachers at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt when it opened there, teaching piano and composition and had friendly communication with Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms. After the death in 1882 of the Conservatory director Joachim Raff, Urspruch moved to the newly founded Raff- Konservatorium in Frankfurt, where he taught until his death. In 1883 Urspruch married Emmy Cranz, daughter of the music publisher August Cranz. In addition to his teaching, he produced a wide variety of compositions from piano solo, solo voice, choir, chamber music up to large orchestral works as well as two operas. Many of his works had successful performances in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Leipzig and Frankfurt. In the last years of his life Urspruch was part of the revival of Gregorian Chant, having contact with the Beuron Archabbey and the cloister at Maria Laach Abbey.

He unsuccessfully contested 2014 Lok Sabha Polls as an AAP Candidate from Ludhiana . In 2017 he successfully contested from Dakha assembly Constituency, but resigned on 12 October 2018 over alleged failure of Congress government in acting on Ranjit Singh commission's inquiry report on desecration of Guru Granth Sahib Ji. However his resignation was accepted by speaker after nearly 10 months on 9 August 2019. Phoolka's resignation accepted by speaker  Early life and education Phoolka's formative years were spent at his native village Bhadaur,into Sidhu Jat royal family in the Barnala district of Punjab, India. His education began in a small school in his village. He graduated from Ludhiana, and went to Law School in Chandigarh.  Family  Phoolka married Maninder Kaur in 1983. She is a food technologist and was a 1990 \\"outstanding graduate\\" of American Institute of Baking, Kansas. She is said to have declined job offers in the United States and returned to India to support her husband's struggle for justice  Career  After completing his law degree in Chandigarh, Phoolka landed in Delhi to practice law. He served as member-secretary of the Justice Narula Committee formed in 1993 to probe the carnage. He was later appointed the counsel for Central Government in January 2001. He is known as a lawyer who won't take up a case if he finds that the client is in the wrong.  1984 Anti-Sikh riots  Phoolka is well known for spearheading the crusade to seek justice in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi and resulted in the killing of approximately 2,733 Sikhs and displacement of over 50,000 Sikhs within 2 days. He was then just 28 years old and new to practising law and the city of Delhi. He has put the cause of justice for 1984 Sikh massacre victims before his career and family life. = First encounter and escaping the massacre = Phoolka was caught in the massacre while driving pregnant wife Maninder Kaur home on his motorbike. When informed by a friend of the attacks on Sikhs, he avoided the main roads to reach his home in South Delhi via the slums of Kotla Mubarakpur. Phoolka's Hindu landlord drove the mob away by telling them that the Phoolka family had left Delhi and hid them in his store room. There the Phoolkas spent 2 days, and came out under escort. They then flew to Chandigarh in the cockpit of an overcrowded plane. = Resolution to fight = Phoolka planned to move his residence to Chandigarh after the riots, but he learned that lawyers were needed to draft affidavits on behalf of the victims, and went to the Farsh Vihar relief camp to help. The sight of orphans, bereaved mothers and wives in the relief camp prompted the Phoolkas to change their plans. Instead of relocating to Chandigarh, they chose to stay and help the victims of the massacre. Since then, Phoolka has fought cases relentlessly for the victims despite government cover-up. = Formation of Citizens Justice Committee = Phoolka conceived and pursued the formation of the Citizen's Justice Committee (CJC). The CJC served as an umbrella organisation for several human rights activists and legal luminaries. Floated in May 1985, the CJC has been pivotal in representing the 1984 anti-Sikh massacre victims before the various judicial commissions that have been formed for inquiry into the massacres. Membership included Justice Ranjit Singh Narula, Soli Sorabjee, General Jagjit Singh Aurora, Justice V. M. Tarkunde and Khushwant Singh. As a counselor for the CJC, Phoolka represented the victims before the first formal sitting of the Mishra Commission on 29 July 1985. The proceedings of the sitting were not made public and were closed to the press. In March 1986, the CJC withdrew its co-operation from the Mishra Commission because it disagreed with the commissions decision to hold secret proceedings, and started filing individual court cases. = Mooting of Carnage84 website = To make the many documents and findings of Citizens Justice Committee on 1984 Sikh massacre available to the general public, Phoolka mooted the idea of the \\"Carnage84.com\\" website, which was launched 10 July 2001 and claimed 150,000 visits from people of 30 different countries within only 10 days of it going online Blog on 1984 trials and related issues.

The project site, previously known as Sheep Hill, is on Lower Eyre Peninsula adjacent to Lipson Cove on the western shore of Spencer Gulf.  History  Port Spencer was originally proposed by Centrex Metals for the export of iron ore from iron ore deposits at Wilgerup and in the hills of Koppio on Lower Eyre Peninsula. The project was named Sheep Hill and was contingent on the development of the Fusion Magnetite Project. The associated mine development was a joint venture partnership between Centrex Metals and Wuhan Iron & Steel (Group) Co, a Chinese government steelmaking enterprise. In October 2016 the joint venture was wound up. In September 2018, agribusiness Free Eyre expressed interest in revisiting and optimising previous plans for Port Spencer exclusively for the export of grain. The port project is currently proposed by Peninsula Ports Pty Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Free Eyre Limited), which has redesigned the project for the export of grain. The port's proponents expect construction to be complete in time for harvest in 2021. The project received development approval from the Government of South Australia in August of 2020. The approval was met with some local opposition, who have argued that the project site is too close to the Lipson Island Conservation Park and that the business case for the port development doesn't look viable based on grain export alone. Location and transport The site for Port Spencer is located between Lipson Cove and Rogers Beach, about northeast of the town of Tumby Bay. The port could be served by a narrow gauge branchline from Ungarra on the Eyre Peninsula Railway. Lipson Cove lies immediately to the south with the proposed wharf structure 1.5 kilometres north of Lipson Island Conservation Park. Swaffers Road was marked to become a future haul road. Centrex Metals' preferred method for the long-term transport of ore to the port was via a slurry pipeline. A desalination plant capable of producing of 5-20 gigalitres of water per year would have been required to provide the water necessary to transport the ore in a slurry to the Port Spencer site. Once the ore was dewatered, it would have been loaded onto conveyors, along a jetty and onto capesize bulk carrier vessels.EPBC Act Referral Detail - Port Spencer Government of Australia, Department of the Environment. Retrieved 2014-01-08. An alternative development approach announced in November 2013 proposed the ore to be trans-shipped from a shorter jetty in barges, each carrying 15,000 tonnes. If such a method were to be employed, 12 barge-loads (round trips) would be required to fill a single Capesize vessel, with a capacity of 180,000 tonnes.Centrex Metals Ltd \\"Port Spencer Transshipment PFS Results\\" Retrieved 2013-11-20. = Grain-only revision = Free Eyre's 2018 revision of the Port Spencer proposal intends to have grain delivered to the port site by truck, then directly loaded onto Panamax vessels via a single 600 metre-long jetty. The jetty would be supported by ten pylons, and the total cost of the development was estimated to be $130 million AUD. Project costs had been heavily optimised over several years, down from prior estimates of $300-400 million AUD. In 2019, the proponents were seeking $10 million in Federal funding to develop a feasibility study for the project. The prospect of funding such a project was challenged by Senator Rex Patrick, who believes that supporting the Cape Hardy port proposal less than ten kilometres to the north would be a better investment. In 2020, Peninsula Ports' revised plans for Port Spencer were made available for public comment. In February of 2020, mining industry executive Gordon Toll was appointed to the board of directors of both Free Eyre and its subsidiary, Peninsula Ports.  Environmental approval processes  Centrex Metals' port development proposal required three stages of environmental approvals plus associated mine development approvals before ultimately being abandoned by its original proponents. * The South Australian Development Assessment Commission deemed it appropriate for the project to produce two stages of documentation in the form of Public Environment Reports for South Australian Government approval.South Australian Government Major Development Proposals - Sheep Hill deep water port (stage 1) (accessed 2013-11-04) * The Federal Australian Government also deemed it necessary for Centrex Metals to obtain Federal environmental approval for Port Spencer. * The Federal Environment Department required Centrex Metals Ltd to respond to identified risks to two threatened species known to visit the region- the southern right whale and the fairy tern. The original Port Spencer (Sheep Hill) proposal was dependent on the advancement of the Fusion Magnetite Project, which required its own environmental approvals at both State and Federal levels. The sale of the Port Spencer site to FREE Eyre subsidiary Peninsula Ports as a potential grain export facility included the transfer of pre-existing approval for the construction of an iron ore export port and associated infrastructure.

A descaling agent or chemical descaler is a liquid chemical substance used to remove limescale from metal surfaces in contact with hot water, such as in boilers, water heaters, and kettles. Limescale is either white or brown in colour due to the presence of iron compounds. Glass surfaces may also exhibit scaling stains, as can many ceramic surfaces present in bathrooms and kitchen, and descaling agents can be used safely to remove those stains without affecting the substrate since both ceramics and glass are unreactive to most acids. \\"Descaler\\", Wiktionary, Accessed January 14, 2014 Action Descaling agents are typically acidic compounds such as hydrochloric acid that react with the calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate compounds present in the scale, producing carbon dioxide gas and a soluble salt. CaCO3(s) + 2 H+(aq) ‚Üí Ca2+(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) MgCO3(s) + 2 H+(aq) ‚Üí Mg2+(aq) + CO2(g) + H2O(l) Strongly acidic descaling agents are usually corrosive to the eyes and skin, and can also attack and degrade clothing fibres, so appropriate protection such as rubber gloves and plastic aprons should be used in cleaning operations. Acids used Notable descaling agents include acetic acid, citric acid, glycolic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfamic acid and hydrochloric acid. The calcium salts are soluble and thus washed away during dissolution or Solvation. The speed of the descaling action depends on the concentration and acidity or pH of the solution provided. Hydrochloric acid is much stronger than acetic acid for example, so tends to remove scale faster. Weak acids such as acetic or citric acids may be preferred however, where damage to the substrate is to be minimised. There are many companies offering inhibited or \\"buffered\\" acids that inhibit the corrosive effect of the acids on various materials. Typically about a 10% concentration of hydrochloric acid with a corrosion inhibitor and some added penetrating and wetting agents added. This allows for a better cleaning of machinery and especially heat exchangers because often the scale is mixed up with silica and other contaminants. These additives reduce the corrosion on the metals and cut through and loosen up these other materials mixed with the scale for faster and more thorough cleaning.

It primarily aims to eliminate usage tracking and other privacy- compromising functionality that the Google Chrome browser includes. Iron ships with certain Chromium privacy options switched on by default, it provides some additional features that distinguish it from Google Chrome. Development history Iron was first released as a beta version on 18 September 2008, 16 days after Google Chrome's initial release. On 26 May 2009 a Preview-Release (Pre-Alpha) of Iron came out for Linux. And on 7 January 2010 a beta version for macOS was released. On 11 August 2010, Microsoft updated the BrowserChoice.eu website in order to include Iron as one of the possible choices. More recent versions of Iron have been released since then, which has gained the features of the underlying Chromium codebase, including Google Chrome theme support, a user agent switcher, an extension system, integrated Adblocker and improved Linux support. Differences from Chrome The following Google Chrome features are not present in Iron: * RLZ identifier, an encoded string sent together with all queries to Google. See Which Google Domain * Google search access on startup for users with Google as default search. Source code comment on line 31 * Google-hosted error pages when a server is not present. * Google Updater automatic installation. * DNS pre- fetching, because it could potentially be used by spammers. * Automatic address bar search suggestions. * Opt-in sending of both browser usage statistics and crash information to Google. * Google Native Client. Added features include: * An ad blocker. * A user agent switcher. * Opt-in blocking of other background communications, such as extension, GPU blacklist, and certificate revocation updates. * Increased number of recent page thumbnails shown on the New Tab page.  Criticism  In December 2014, Lifehacker said that Iron offers little that is not available by simply configuring Google Chrome's privacy settings. However, the_simple_computer wrote that Iron removes the Google Native Client, Google's custom navigation and error pages and other similar features. In October 2014, the_simple_computer wrote that even though SRWare Iron released under the BSD licence, the latest source code publicly available at the time was incomplete and for version 6, even though the binaries were on version 14; source code was moved to RapidShare in 2013, with external access blocked, effectively making the program \\"entirely closed source\\".

In the early Church, many ministries were held by men and women. By the early Middle Ages, some of these ministries were formalized under the term \\"minor orders\\" and (along with the diaconate) used as steps to priestly ordination. One of the minor orders was the office of acolyte. In several Christian Churches women have traditionally been excluded from approaching the altar during the liturgy. Thus The Service Book of the Orthodox Church (English translation by Isabel Florence Hapgood) states that \\"no woman may enter the Sanctuary at any time\\". In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church the traditional rule was: \\"women may not enter [the sanctuary] at all\\". This did not exclude women, especially in convents of nuns, entering the altar area at other times, as for cleaning. In Eastern Churches women are further restricted by not being allowed inside the altar area and in some traditions even within the church building during their monthly periods.Alessandro Bausi, Languages and Cultures of Eastern Christianity: Ethiopian (Routledge 2017) The Latin Church abandoned this practice in 735.Karl Kaser, The Balkans and the Near East: Introduction to a Shared History (LIT Verlag 2011), p. 250  Traditional practice in the Catholic Church  Formerly, it was generally forbidden to have women serving near the altar within the sacred chancel (infra cancellos), that is, they were prohibited from entering the altar area behind the altar rails during the liturgy. In convents of nuns, women did serve within the chancel.Catholic Moral Theology, Fr. Jone OFMCap, Nr. 315. In his encyclical Allatae sunt of 26 July 1775, Pope Benedict XIV renewed the prohibition, \\"Women should not dare to serve at the altar; they should be altogether refused this ministry\\", stated more than five centuries earlier by Pope Innocent IV in his letter Sub catholicae professione of 6 March 1254 to Odo of Tusculum on Greek rites.Mulieres autem servire ad altare non audeant, sed ab illius ministerio repellantur omnino Pope Benedict XIV also stated that what he called the evil practice of women serving the priest at the celebration of Mass had been condemned also by Pope Gelasius I (492‚àí496).Encyclical Allatae sunt of 26 July 1775, section 29 He used the following words: The references to \\"the Greeks\\" pertains to the Orthodox practice of ordaining women as deacons. With the practice of private Masses (Mass by a priest and one other person, often offered for a deceased person), scandal was an additional reason not to have a woman or girl alone with a priest. However, it has been customary in convents of women for nuns to perform the ministry of acolyte without being formally ordained to that minor order. This practice was used when the Council of Trent developed the seminary system where men in minor orders would go away to schools for training to be a priest rather than study under a parish priest. XXIII Session, Council of Trent, ch. XVIII. Retrieved from J. Waterworth, ed. (1848). The Canons and Decrees of the Sacred and Oecumenical Council of Trent. London: Dolman. pp. 170‚Äì92. Retrieved June 16, 2009. After the 1963 decision of the Second Vatican Council to reform the Catholic liturgy,See Sacrosanctum concilium trials were carried out, including that of allowing females to serve Mass in girls' schools and convents. However, the 1970 instruction Liturgicae instaurationes, in putting the council's decree into effect, withdrew permissions granted for experiments with the Mass while the reform was a work in progressLiturgicae instaurationes, 12. and reaffirmed the traditional rules reserving service of the celebrant at the altar to males alone.\\"In conformity with norms traditional in the Church, women (single, married, religious), whether in churches, homes, convents, schools, or institutions for women, are barred from serving the priest at the altar\\", Liturgicae instaurationes, 7. This was repeated more briefly in the 1980 instruction Inaestimabile donum: \\"Women are not, however, permitted to act as altar servers.\\" Inaestimabile donum, 18 At the time of 1970 and 1980 instructions, the 1917 Code of Canon Law was still in force. It ruled: \\"A woman is not to be the server at Mass except when a man is unavailable and for a just reason and provided that she give the responses from a distance and in no way approach the altar.\\" It was superseded by the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which did not maintain the prohibition.  Change in 1983  The Pope of 1983 with female altar servers The 1983 Code of Canon Law altered the juridical situation. Without distinguishing between male and female, it declared: \\"Lay persons can fulfill the function of lector in liturgical actions by temporary designation. All lay persons can also perform the functions of commentator or cantor, or other functions, according to the norm of law.\\" With the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, prominent canonists argued that this reservation to males no longer held,The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary, ed. by James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, and Donald E. Heintschel, Paulist Press, 1985, . based on the inclusion of both males and females in canon 230 ¬ß2: \\"Lay persons can fulfill the function of lector in liturgical actions by temporary designation. All lay persons can also perform the functions of commentator or cantor, or other functions, according to the norm of law.\\" In many dioceses, females were allowed to act as altar servers without explicit clarification on the matter from the Holy See. On 30 June 1992, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts issued an authentic interpretation of that canon declaring that service at the altar is one of the \\"other functions\\" open to lay persons in general. This 1992 authentic interpretation (confirmed by Pope John Paul II on 11 July 1992), declaring that service at the altar is one of the liturgical functions that can be performed by both lay men and women, was recalled in a circular letterActa Apostolicae Sedis 86 (1994) pp. 541-542 (Official Latin; English translation) that each diocesan bishop can decide whether to allow them in his diocese..Vatican Communication on Female Altar Servers A later document, from 2001, states that, even if a bishop permits female altar servers, the priest in charge of a church in that diocese is not obliged to recruit them, since nobody has a right to become an altar server. The document also states that \\"it will always be very appropriate to follow the noble tradition of having boys serve at the altar\\". Pope Benedict XVI had both male and female altar servers in Papal masses in London (2010), Berlin, and Freiburg (2011). United States In the United States the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska was the only diocese that does not allow females to be altar servers, after the only other diocese ended its prohibition on female altar servers in 2006. The cathedral of the Diocese of Phoenix announced in August 2011 that it would become another of the Catholic churches in which girls would not be allowed to serve at the altar. Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke has been publicly critical to the introduction of female altar servers as part of what he calls \\"radical feminism\\" and a unwelcome sign of the \\"feminization\\" of the Church.McGough, Michael, \\"Opinion Cardinal Burke: Serving at Mass is a 'manly' job\\" , LA Times, January 9, 2015. Burke says that it requires a \\"certain manly discipline to serve as an altar boy in service at the side of a priest, and most priests have their first deep experiences of the liturgy as altar boys. If we are not training young men as altar boys, giving them an experience of serving God in the liturgy, we should not be surprised that vocations have fallen dramatically.\\"margeryeagan, \\"The Church has a problem with women?

It initially served students in grades ten through twelve who had previously attended Cameron, Donelson and Two Rivers high schools. McGavock added ninth grade in 1978. McGavock is a part of the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools system. It sits on a part of the McGavock plantation that was purchased by Metro Parks in 1968 for $68,000. The land is still the property of the park service. The school was named for the antebellum Two Rivers mansion built by David H. McGavock. McGavock was the first truly comprehensive high school built in Nashville. Planning for the school took place during the administration of Superintendent Dr. John Harris. Dr. James Burns, the resident consultant for secondary development for Metro-Nashville Public Schools, developed a structure that would serve as a model for other comprehensive high schools. McGavock was the first high school in Nashville that combined the academic program with extensive vocational training. Facilities McGavock is the largest high school in Tennessee, with a little under 500,000 sq. feet. McGavock has four softball fields, a baseball diamond, six tennis courts, a football stadium and a track. The 14-acre building houses 82 classrooms, 14 science labs, a credit union, a flight simulator, a bistro, nine Career and Technical shop/classroom areas (including a student-run courtroom and a health science lab) seven business education labs, two gymnasiums, two cafeterias, a 586 seat auditorium, and formerly a two-story library (currently a one story on the second floor) with fiction, audio- visuals, materials and equipment on one level, and non-fiction and computers on the other. It has a green room, a planetarium, a computer and technical education (CTE) lab equipped with 60 computers and a CTE presentation room equipped with state-of-the-art projection capabilities.

(), formerly known as Pilipino Telephone Corporation or Piltel, is a holding company of the PLDT Group for its venture into the electricity distribution industry. Previously, it was one of the mobile and fixed-line telephone service providers in the Philippines. PCEV is 99.5%-owned by Smart Communications, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT). The remaining 0.5% of PCEV's shares is owned by the Filipino investing public.pse.org.ph, Piltel's 2009 Annual Report, page 4 Through PCEV, PLDT forms a consortium with Metro Pacific Investments Corporation to form Beacon Electric Asset Holdings, Inc. which is the majority owner of Meralco. History Piltel was incorporated with limited liability on July 18, 1968. It started its business by providing landline services in eight cities and municipalities in the Philippines: Baguio City, General Santos, Olongapo, Subic, Puerto Princesa, Digos, Boac and Masbate. In March 1991, Piltel started offering cellular phone services branded Mobiline, using the AMPS standard. In August 1993, Piltel launched it paging business called Beeper 150. In July 1995, Piltel had its shares listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange. By 1996, Piltel dominated the market with 42% market share. However, in that same year, cellular fraud or cloning became rampant in the Philippines. This prompted Piltel to upgrade its AMPS network to the CDMA standard. It was also in the same year that Executive Order No. 109 was implemented, thus, Piltel had to expand its landline services to unserved and underserved areas in southern and western Mindanao. Unluckily, in July 1997, a financial crisis that started in Thailand spread across neighboring countries in Asia. This, together with rising inflation, the cost of upgrades and expansion, loss of wireless subscriber confidence because of the cloning problem in the previous year, and lack of subscriber interest in the newly installed Mindanao landline network because of the financial crisis; started to weigh heavily on the finances of Piltel. On top of it, intensified competition started eating into Piltel's wireless market subscriber share. In 1998, competitors using the GSM standard started promoting the use of SMS, which has since become the most preferred communication method of the Filipinos. Before Piltel had the chance to add SMS facilities to its CDMA network, it was already deep into the red with Php4.1 billion worth of losses as of end-1998. In November 1999, Piltel's management decided to stop investing in its AMPS/CDMA networks. Moving forward, management signed a facilities-sharing agreement with competitor Smart Communications to be able to provide wireless services using Smart's GSM network. By April 2000, Piltel launched its GSM brand, Talk 'N Text. Since then, most of Piltel's employees have been absorbed by Smart Communications. Likewise, the management of its wireless business have also been outsourced to Smart Communications. The Beeper 150 network was already shut down, and its landline business was sold to PLDT on June 4, 2008. As of July 29, 2009, Smart Communications completed its tender offer to buy out most of Piltel's other minority shareholders, thereby raising its ownership to 99.5%. On August 17, 2009, Piltel completed the transfer of its wireless businesses to Smart Communications.pse.org.ph, Piltel's 2009 Annual Report, page 4 On May 25, 2010, Piltel renamed to its current name after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the change in its corporate name, as well as other amendments to the Company‚Äôs Articles of Incorporation. Subsidiaries The following are Piltel's wholly owned subsidiaries: * Telecommunications Service Providers (Telserv) - Phils : involved in operator services * Piltel International Holdings Corporation (PIHC) - British Virgin Islands : involved in the issuance of bonds convertible into common shares of Piltel * Piltel (Cayman) Ltd. - Cayman Islands : involved in bringing into the debt restructuring plan holders of Piltel's convertible bonds Wireless Today, Piltel is no longer a wireless services operator. Before the transfer, Piltel used its AMPS/CDMA networks to lease out telephone lines to a few corporate subscribers, and has decommissioned all but six of its AMPS/CDMA cellsites. Likewise, Piltel also reported 16,590,737 subscribers to its GSM brand, Talk 'N Text, just before the transfer.pse.org.ph, Piltel's 2009 Annual Report, page 7 Philippine area code assignment Piltel used the 912 area code for its AMPS/CDMA service.

Content Pedaling to Freedom is a documentary film set in Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, India. The film revisits a year-long initiative that took place there in 1993, in what used to be one of the poorest parts of the world. As a result of this initiative 230,000 people learnt to read and write, and over 100,000 women learnt to ride bicycles. Wages increased 1000%. It happened in the space of just one year and cost less than one and a half dollars per person. The film relies on archival stills, filmed footage as well as interviews with those who were associated with the project. Kannammal, an insurance company office assistant who took leave from work to volunteer for the project is featured prominently. She served as a central coordinator and at the end of the project, went back to her office where she remains an office assistant. Mobility was seen as an important tool for empowerment and in addition to reading and writing, women were taught how to ride bicycles. The film captures the conditions in the district including cycling classes for women where men often gathered to crack jokes and taunt women trying to learn cycling.

He was eligible for Germany's highest officer's decoration for valor, the Pour le M√©rite, when Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication scotched the award and the German military largely disbanded after its defeat. Fruhner would return to his nation's service to join the nascent Luftwaffe as a Major in 1935. He would serve in various training commands throughout World War II, rising to become a Generalmajor. Early life and service Otto Fruhner was born on 6 September 1893. He was born in Brieg, Germany (now Brzeg, Poland). Frunhner began his military career as an aviation mechanic on 14 November 1914 for Feldflieger Abteilung (Field Flier Detachment) 4.Franks et al 1993, pp. 111‚Äì112. Aerial service He then underwent pilot training, and beginning in June 1916, flew as an enlisted pilot of two seater aircraft for FA 51 on the Eastern Front against the Russians. In August, he received the Iron Cross Second Class and was promoted to Unteroffizier. He then volunteered for fighter duty in July 1917, and was assigned to Jagdstaffel 26, commanded by Bruno Loerzer. Fruhner's combat successes began when he was serving in Jagdstaffel 26. He shot down two Sopwiths in two separate engagements on 3 September 1917. There was a four month lapse. Then, on 3 January 1918, he scored for the third time, and continued his success through until March, with his 9th victory on 26 March. On 3 June, he received the First Class Iron Cross. At the same time, he was awarded the Prussian Military Merit Cross, the highest award for valor available to enlisted men in the German military.The Aerodrome website page on the Military Merit Cross http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/germany/prussia_mmc.php?pageNum_recipients=1&totalRows;_recipients=22#recipients On 1 July, he downed his tenth victim to become a double ace. From that point on, he accrued victories until 4 September 1918, when he shot down three Sopwith Camels from No. 70 Squadron RAF as his share of the eight losses by the British; this dogfight was the largest loss of fighters ever suffered by the RAF in a single engagement in World War I.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/canada/forman.php Retrieved 3 February 2013. Fruhner was subsequently commissioned a Leutnant. He was also proposed for the Pour le M√©rite, the German military's highest award for bravery by officers. There were only five German aces who won both awards. However, the Kaiser abdicated before approving the award. On 20 September 1918, while in a dogfight with Sopwith Camels of No. 203 Squadron RAF, he collided with one of them. Although injured, he leapt from his irreparably damaged aircraft and parachuted to safety. The Camel he had collided with also crashed; it was credited as Fruhner's 27th victory. After this, Fruhner was withdrawn from combat duty. Post World War I service In 1935, Fruhner joined the Luftwaffe as a major commanding a flying school. He later rose in rank in the Luftwaffe during World War II. Remaining in training commands, he eventually attained the rank of Generalmajor (major general). Otto Fruhner died in Villach, Austria, on 19 June 1965. Inline citationsReferences * Franks, Norman; Bailey, Frank W.; Guest, Russell.

He is particularly known for his work on Tungusic languages and the Jurchen language. Biography Grube was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 1855. He studied Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan under Franz Anton Schiefner at the University of Saint Petersburg from 1874 to 1878. In 1878, Grube moved to Germany to study at the University of Leipzig under Georg von der Gabelentz, and he submitted his doctoral dissertation in 1880. The following year he taught a course on Tibetan grammar at the University of Leipzig, but he was unable to obtain a regular teaching position, and so in 1883 he took up a position as an assistant at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. He also had a junior teaching position at the University of Berlin, and in 1892 he was awarded the title of extraordinary professor. In 1897 he went to China with his wife, and they stayed there until 1899, acquiring a large collection which he deposited in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin when he returned. Scholarship Grube is principally remembered for his pioneering studies of three little-known languages, two spoken in the Amur region of the Russian Far East, and one extinct language spoken by the Jurchen people of Manchuria. At the behest of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Grube worked on the linguistic materials brought back from the Amur region by Carl Maximowicz and Leopold von Schrenck during the 1850s. Based on these materials, in 1892 Grube published a vocabulary of the Gilyak language (a language isolate, also known as Nivkh), and in 1900 he published a vocabulary of the Gold language (a Tungusic language, also known as Nanai). By the nineteenth century, the Jurchen language that had been spoken by the ancestors of the Manchu people during the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) was almost completely unknown, and the few surviving inscriptions in the Jurchen script were undecipherable. However, in the early 1890s the Royal Library at Berlin acquired a manuscript copy of the Vocabulary of the Bureau of Translators () from Friedrich Hirth which included a chapter on the Jurchen language that was missing from other known copies of this book. The Jurchen chapter of this book comprised a vocabulary list with each word written in the Jurchen script and also transcribed phonetically using Chinese characters (this contrasts with the vocabularies produced by the Bureau of Interpreters, which only included the phonetic transcription in Chinese characters). In 1896 Grube published a translation and study of the Jurchen vocabulary list that changed the status of Jurchen from a completely undeciphered language to a language that could be read and understood with the help of Grube's book. The year after its publication, S. W. Bushell used Grube's translation of the Jurchen vocabulary to study the Jurchen inscription on a stele from Kaifeng, and it has remained the principal source for the study of the Jurchen language ever since. In addition to his linguistic studies, Grube also published extensively on Chinese philosophy, religion and mythology. He was also interested in Chinese literature, and posthumously published a German translation of the Chinese mythological novel, Fengshen Yanyi ('The Investiture of the Gods'), as well as German translations of a set of Chinese shadow play scripts.

It dramatized the debate over Alaska statehood. Alaska had become a state in 1959. Plot The film follows the 1958 Edna Ferber novel in telling the story of Zeb Kennedy (Richard Burton) and Thor Storm (Robert Ryan), Alaska settlers in the period following World War I. Kennedy works his way up through the Alaskan fish cannery business, befriending Wang, a Chinese worker (George Takei), and Storm, an idealistic fishing boat captain. Kennedy and Storm begin to plan a cannery together in the fictional Alaskan town of Baranof, when Kennedy falls for Bridie Ballantyne, Storm's fianc√©e (Carolyn Jones). The feeling is reciprocated, but Kennedy chooses money over love, marrying Seattle heiress Dorothy Wendt (Martha Hyer). When Storm discovers his disappointed fianc√©e's infidelity, he punches out Kennedy and flees into the wilderness on a dog sled. Kennedy launches a packing company in Baranof, hiring Wang as well as his old friend, Dave Husack (Jim Backus). His persistent feelings for Ballantyne, now abandoned by her fianc√©, are no secret to his wife. The Kennedys give birth to a daughter, Grace. Storm returns to Baranof with an infant son, Christopher, born to an Eskimo wife who died after labor. Over the following years, Storm comes to resent Kennedy for his cannery's use of salmon traps, which are depleting the salmon population and putting fishermen out of business. Meanwhile, their children, Christopher (Steve Harris) and Grace (Shirley Knight), begin a romance. Kennedy tells Storm to keep his \\"half-breed kid\\" away from his daughter. Storm, drawing on the support of fishermen and Alaska natives, becomes a candidate for the Alaska Territorial Legislature on a platform advocating statehood and opposing the excesses of business mogul \\"Czar\\" Kennedy. Christopher and Grace elope to live among Christopher's maternal relations in the fictional village of Anavak. Grace's mother, Dorothy Kennedy dies. Grace becomes pregnant, and the young couple decides to make a journey to Baranof so that the child is born there. They set off by dog sled, but Grace begins labor en route, and Christopher is waylaid by a bear and killed. Grace's father, Zeb, along with Thor and \\"Aunt\\" Bridie, intercept and shoot the bear. Grace gives birth to a baby girl, Christine, but dies. Christine grows up between the houses of Ballantyne and her feuding grandfathers, Kennedy and Storm. Kennedy grooms Dave Husack's son, Bay (Ray Danton), to be his champion in the territorial legislature. He encourages the young lawyer to marry Christine for political advantage. Ballantyne discovers and exposes the plot, and the engagement is broken. Storm, on a flight to Juneau, is forced by a snowstorm to make a crash landing on a glacier. Ballantyne prevails on Kennedy to make a risky flight to save Storm and his pilot, an Eskimo named Ross Guildenstern (Sheridan Comerate). Storm survives, and his speeches before Congress are decisive in winning approval for Alaska's statehood. Victorious, Storm gives a conciliatory radio address, thanking erstwhile statehood opponent Kennedy.

Ferber spent four years researching and writing it, beginning the project in 1954. She visited Alaska several times over the following years, often with the assistance of Ernest Gruening. The character of Kennedy was based on Austin Lathrop; the Bridie Ballantyne was based on Eva McGown. The Ice Palace itself was a composite of actual buildings in Alaska. Baranof, the novel‚Äôs main fictional setting, was based on the Alaskan town of Fairbanks. Ferber later said she felt as though she finished the novel \\"a month too early\\" because of her ill health. She had suffered a car accident and a recurrence of neuralgia and decided to send it for publication instead of doing another draft. \\"I felt if I didn't finish the book I would never be able to write again,\\" she later said.As I Was Saying--: Edna Ferber Keeps on Writing Despite Painful Illness at 70 Chase, Ilka.

He investigated Haitian Vodou and the process of making zombies. He studied ethnobotanical poisons, discovering their use in a reported case of a contemporary zombie, Clairvius Narcisse. Overview The book presents the case of Clairvius Narcisse, a man who had been a zombie for two years, as showing that the zombification process was more likely the result of a complex interaction of tetrodotoxin, a powerful hallucinogenic plant called Datura, and cultural forces and beliefs.Guerico, Gino Del (1986) \\"The Secrets of Haiti's Living Dead\\", Harvard Magazine (Jan/Feb) 31-37. Reprinted in Anthropology Annual Editions 1987/88 188-191, note: this article has no citations to back up its claims. According to the book, the assortment of ingredients in Haitian zombie powder include puffer fish, matter from a corpse (specifically to Davis' adventure in Haiti, the bokor, a Haitian shaman, crushed the skull of a deceased infant that had been dead for a month or two, and added it to the poison), freshly killed blue lizards, a large dried toad (Bufo marinus) with a dried sea worm wrapped around it (prepared beforehand), \\"tcha-tcha\\" (Albizzia), and \\"itching pea\\" (pois grater, a species of Mucuna). The book inspired the 1988 horror film, The Serpent and the Rainbow.  Criticism  Davis' claims were criticized for a number of scientific inaccuracies.Hines, Terrence (2008), ‚ÄúZombies and Tetrodotoxin‚Äù, Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 32, Issue 3 (May/June), pp 60-62. Some scientists found little or no tetrodotoxin in samples provided by Davis. Davis argued that a number of factors may account for the negative results of some investigators and decried their unsubstantiated accusations of fraud, noting the variability of formulations, possible errors in the testing performed on the samples he brought back, the possibility that the tetrodotoxin-based mixture may have had ingredients that improved blood‚Äìbrain barrier transmission of the tetrodotoxin, and the nature of folk medicine with respect to success rates (i.e., that very few successes are required to establish credibility). In the book, Davis does not suggest that the zombie powder containing tetrodotoxin was used for maintaining \\"mental slaves\\", but for producing the initial death and resurrection that convinced the victims and those who knew them that they had become zombies. The zombies, such as Clairvius Narcisse, were kept biddable by regular doses of the poisonous plant, Datura stramonium, which produces amnesia, delirium, and suggestibility.

Summary Having first referred to a child's coming of age, the poem describes a number of (particularly fatal) misfortunes which may then befall one: a youth's premature death, famine, warfare and infirmity, the deprivations of a traveller, death at the gallows or on the pyre and self- destructive behaviour through intemperate drinking. However, a man of mature age may also prosper in terms of his material wealth and friends, and achieve happiness. The poet explains that the distribution of man's fortunes and misfortunes is in God's hands, including that of one's skills and talents: martial dexterity (throwing and shooting), cunning at board-games, scholarly wisdom and the craft of a goldsmith. The same applies to one's success or skills in cheering one's drinking fellows or in singing and plucking the harp, while sitting at the feet of one's lord. The last image drawn from Anglo-Saxon life is that of taming the hawk. Apart from underpinning the vast array of skills made available to men, it may also be intended to serve as an analogy to the opening image of the child clothed, reared and disciplined by his parents.Drout, Michael D. C. \\"The Fortunes of Men 4a.\\" 186-7. In conclusion, the poem praises God's supreme skill in measuring out and managing the many and various destinies of men and urges its audience to express gratitude to the benevolent Ruler.

It has been noted that 'Great Britain's newfound success and passion for the sport is helping change perceptions throughout the country and the world.' The Olympic Channel produced an original 10 minute film following an English Cheerleading Team (Unity Allstars, Ruby) as an example of the increasing momentum of competitive cheerleading within the UK, and how the ongoing debate about its legitimacy of a sport is slowly diminishing, as well as an example of the increasing international aspect of the sport Some schools offer cheerleading as a sport or extracurricular option; a 2010 Department of Education report said that 37% of schools were offering cheerleading as an extracurricular option physical education choice. Cheerleading is conducted through all-star, university and school teams. Many of these teams compete against other cheerleading teams at regional, national, and international levels. Cheerleading is classified as a BUCS sport. There are also squads attached to some football and Rugby League teams; however, these often involve more dancing than the gymnastics and stunting elements of cheerleading.  Competitive Cheerleading  Competitive cheerleading is an incredibly challenging sport that requires strength, co-ordination, focus and team-work. The discipline is more commonly and widely known as 'All Star Cheerleading'. The number of programmes in the UK that are dedicated cheerleading programmes is increasing - competitions are getting more competitive, the standard of athletes is increasing, and UK athletes are gaining places on prestigious world-class teams from North America, as well as England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being able to put together teams that compete at the World Cheerleading Championships at the highest level (and in some cases win).

The following year, when the division officially opened, Team England returned to win their first Adaptive Abilities Gold medal. UK based charity ParaCheer International, who promote the inclusion of disabled athletes in Cheerleading and helped pioneer the division, assisted with the development of the rules and scoring, and their founder Rick Rodgers (an English athlete and wheelchair user) now acts as an advisor to the International Cheer Union (the International Governing Body For Cheerleading) on disability. The competitive version of the sport features many of the moves performed by Olympic gymnasts, including tumbles and complicated jumps, as well as the balances and team work you'd see from sports acrobatic teams. The main organisations hosting competitions in the UK are Scotcheer (Scottish National Championship), The British Cheer Association National Championships (BCA), ICC (British open cheer and dance competitions), The Cheer and Dance Internationals (Future Cheer), UKCA (UK Cheerleading Association) and Legacy Cheer and Dance. The governing body is Sportcheer UK, an umbrella organisation comprising SportCheer England,http://www.sportcheerengland.org SportCheer Wales,http://www.scwales.org/ SportCheer Scotland https://sportcheerscot.org.uk/ and SportCheer NI - recognised by the International Cheer Union (ICU) the International Governing Body for Cheerleading - recognised as such by the International Olympic Committee (of which Cheerleading is a member sport). UK teams compete in various national competitors throughout the year to win a 'bid' from one of these competition providers in order to qualify to attend USASF Worlds the following season. 'Bids' are awarded to teams in various levels of paid or unpaid sponsorship, and athletes/parents pay to subsidise the rest of their trip to Florida, USA to compete. One particular cheerleading program, the Ascension Eagles of the London Borough of Newham, has received attention and awards for its positive impact in its economically disadvantaged neighbourhood. In April 2014 Crimson Heat Tigers Cheer based in Reading, won the COA (Cheerleaders of America) National title in Florida, gaining the USA Champions title. Crimson Heat, who hold UK National and European titles were also official cheerleaders for the London Games and are the first UK team to achieve the COA National Title. The top teams in the country, who have placed admirably well at the 2019 USASF World Championships, are Coventry Dynamite Ammunition (3rd), Rising Stars Ellipse (3rd), Intensity Cheer Extreme (6th), Unity Allstars Black (7th), Rising Stars Midnight (7th) and Unity Allstars Ruby (8th).

The cast included real-life experienced vaudevillian actor George Burns as Lewis, Walter Matthau as Clark, and Richard Benjamin as Ben, with Lee Meredith, F. Murray Abraham, Rosetta LeNoire, Howard Hesseman, and Ron Rifkin in supporting roles. Plot Al Lewis (George Burns) and Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) are two elderly comedians who were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as \\"Lewis and Clark\\" and also called the Sunshine Boys. After 47 years together, they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then. The break-up was due, in part, to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing. Willy's nephew, Ben (Richard Benjamin), a talent agent, tries finding work for Willy, which proves difficult due to Willy's age and blustery temperament. When one of the major networks decides to air a program on the history of comedy and wants the Sunshine Boys to reunite for the show, Ben tries securing the duo's cooperation one last time. Ben tries managing the individual quirks of two old men in their twilight years, including omitting the abuse and insults each used in discussing the other with him, and diplomatically portraying each as anxious to do the \\"Doctor Sketch\\" for an ABC special to give the appearance of harmony. An attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch at Willy's apartment starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted, but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office, before Willy decides to change the scripted long- established \\"Come in\\" to \\"Enter!\\" This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure. Ben has to patch up and salvage the situation, despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio. In the dressing room, they do not speak to each other as persons, just like they did in the last year they did their sketches. There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al, followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors, in the dressing room. After Phyllis Diller finishes her scene and Steve Allen speaks his introduction, the Doctor Sketch starts. It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest. Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order, Willy finally storms off the set, shouting accusations and abuse, and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man). In the stairwell, Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack. Willy recovers, first in the hospital and then at home with a private nurse, with whom he argues. Ben visits and tells him that he has to retire now. He has in mind an actor's retirement home. Al is also going to move into the same retirement home, as his daughter is going to have a baby, and she will need his room. The two meet again at Willy's apartment, in attempts to finally establish a friendship.

Twenty years later, he would be cast as Lewis in the 1996 television adaptation. =Casting= Initially, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby were proposed for the leads, but Simon was opposed to the idea, as he felt the roles required Jewish comedians. Several actors, including Groucho Marx and Phil Silvers were considered and the roles eventually were given to real-life vaudevillian veterans Red Skelton and Jack Benny. Skelton declined after realizing his income was higher performing his stand-up comedy than what he was offered for the film; he was replaced by the younger Matthau. Benny was forced to withdraw after being diagnosed with the pancreatic cancer that would soon claim him and recommended his friend and fellow real-life vaudevillian veteran Burns for the role, who had not been in a film since 1939. Burns' Academy Award-winning role revived his career and redefined his popular image as a remarkably active, older comedy star. Six weeks before filming started, Burns had triple bypass surgery. ReceptionBox office= The film was a box office disappointment. Frank Rosenfelt, president of MGM said \\"I liked it. I thought it was funny. I thought the playing was great. But it didn't work with the public.\\"Working their assets off The Guardian February 9, 1980: 13. =Critical= As of August 2020, the film holds a rating of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews with the consensus: \\"Thanks to the sparkling chemistry between its stars and Herbert Ross' gentle direction, this sweetly ambling comedy ranks among Neil Simon's finest screen adaptations.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that with Matthau \\"at the top of his most antisocial form\\" and Burns \\"giving a keenly funny, brilliant straight performance and with Mr. Simon delivering some of his best one-liners, the movie is extremely easy to take. It's only afterward you realize that two complex characters, as well as a unique personal and professional relationship, have been used up‚Äîwasted‚Äîin the interests of comedy no more substantial than the insults that Willy and Al throw at each other.\\"Canby, Vincent (November 7, 1975). \\"Simon's Comic 'Sunshine Boys' Opens\\".

Close up of the south east front. Portnall Park is a manor house in Virginia Water, Surrey, on Bagshot road, three miles (5 km) from Egham, and 21 miles from London. History A house was built at Potnalls, Potenall, Portenall, or Portnall Park by c. 1770. In 1804 Rev. Thomas Bisse (c1754-1828) exchanged it for some land at Tite Hill, Egham (probably land that had belonged to his wife's aunt Lydia Challoner (died 1803) with David Jebb,Crown Lands at Egham, Exchange, King and David Jebb Act, 1807 the younger son of Dr. John Jebb, Dean of Cashel (c1706-1787),The life of John Jebb, D.D.

Bisse extended the mansion, as did the son, Colonel Bisse-Challoner (1788‚Äì1872), after 1828. This is how Prosser described it in 1828: 'The park, comprising nearly four hundred acres, is beautifully undulated, and diversified with timber and flourishing plantations, through which extensive gravel walks and green rides are formed ; in well-chosen situations are seats and rustic retreats, commanding extensive and beautifully varied views over the Surrey hills on the one side, and over the far-famed lake of Virginia Water on the other. The entrance lodge is built in a peculiarly elegant style, and the approach to the house is about three quarters of a mile through some thriving plantations. The gardens and farm to the south-west of the house are lately erected on a very convenient and elegant plan.' Photo of a terrace, looking northish towards the house, c1870. From an album belonging to Rev. Henry Jerome's brother Willy and his wife Emily. Col. Challoner married, secondly, on 6 January 1859, Henrietta Emma Helena De Salis (1824‚Äì1863) third surviving daughter of Count de Salis. In 1872 Col. Challoner died and his estate passed to his second wife's youngest brother, Rev. Henry Jerome de Salis (d.1915). According to Henry Jerome's second son Cecil in 1872 Portnall was staffed by three men in the house; two in the stables; six or seven men in the garden; nine or 10 maids in the house; and four or five men on the farm [which was c600 acres]. On his death the life interest passed to Henry Jerome's eldest son, Rodolph (died 1931) (the youngest son was Charles Fane de Salis). He soon had the house on the market and after a brief struggle with his next brother it was eventually alienated and sold in 1923 to golf course pioneer and property developer W.G. Tarrant now of Wentworth Estate fame, for ¬£15,000. The freehold comprised with a [nearly half a mile] frontage to the main road. The mansion house had 27 or 30 bedrooms and dressing rooms. There was a 'large square block of stabling' (for 15 horses); a six booth coach house; barn; cowsheds; bailiff's cottage; bothy; potting sheds; 'good' greenhouses; two walled gardens; five pairs of freehold cottages (three at Shrubs Hill and two at Knowle Hill); two lodge cottages; and a gardener's cottage. In an Affidavit sworn 23 January 1923 in the High Court of Justice Chancery Division before Mr. Justice Eve, re. Challoner's Settled Estate, Rodolph wrote: :'As regards paragraph eight my view is that having regard to the proposed developments there will shortly be little to choose between Dawley and Portnall in respect of destroyed amenities'. Comparison in 2008 of the fate of the land around Dawley, Middlesex, just south of Hillingdon towards Heathrow, with the present state of the Wentworth Estate would show that to have been a miscalculation. (Dawley was a small estate that his brother had inherited and had seemingly proposed to sell off in order to keep Portnall).

Publication history The character Alura appeared unnamed in Action Comics #252 (May 1959) as part of the origin of Supergirl (Kara Zor-El). She was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino. Her role was similar to that of what Lara was to Superman. She and her husband, Zor-El, send her to a spaceship from Argo City to Earth to survive. Fictional character biographyPre-Crisis=Earth-One In pre- Crisis continuity, Alura supported her husband Zor-El, one of the only scientists to believe his older brother Jor-El's predictions about the impending destruction of Krypton. When the planet exploded, Argo City was somehow blown safely into space with a life-giving bubble of air around it (a later version of the story in Action Comics #316 (September 1964) has the city saved by a weather dome that Zor-El had constructed). The explosion had turned the ground beneath Argo City into Kryptonite, but Alura, Zor-El and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead. The Kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years, and Kara was born a number of years after the destruction of Krypton. The end for Argo City came during Kara's teens when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting, exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation. Zor-El had managed to build a rocket and now used it to send his daughter to Earth. Alura provided Kara a costume based closely on Superman's own. It was later revealed to Supergirl through Zor-El induced dreams that he and Alura had teleported away into the Survival Zone (similar to the Phantom Zone) during Argo's final moments. Supergirl was able to rescue them in Action Comics #310 (March 1964), and Zor-El and Alura went on to live in Kandor. When the bottle city was enlarged, Zor-El and Alura resettled on New Krypton/Rokyn. Earth-Two In the alternate universe of Earth-Two, Allura In-Z (note different spelling) is married to Zor-L, and they send their daughter Kara Zor-L to Earth Two where she becomes Power Girl. This Zor-L was an expert in psychology, and created a virtual reality chamber for Kara inside her spacecraft. As she aged inside the rocket on her way to Earth- Two, she experienced the type of life she would have had on Krypton with Allura and Zor-L. Zor-L and Allura were killed when Krypton exploded. This version of Allura lived in Kandor and not Argo City. Allura only made one appearance, in Showcase #98 (March 1978). =Post-Crisis= In \\"The Supergirl from Krypton\\" story-arc in Superman/Batman #8-13 (May‚ÄìOctober 2004), Alura and Zor-El rocketed their daughter away from Krypton before Kal-El left. It was expected that she would reach Earth first and could help raise Kal from his infancy. However, she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach Earth until years later, so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens. After Lex Luthor uses Black Kryptonite to split Kara into good and evil parts, the evil Kara claims that Zor-El actually sent his daughter to Earth to kill his nephew, since he resented his older brother and hated the idea of Jor-El's lineage continuing past Krypton's destruction. This tied together and explained fragmented flashbacks that had suggested Zor- El was a villainous character, including his dismissal of schoolchildren taunting Kara as \\"the dead\\" (they had already been possessed) and Alura telling Kara to kill her and \\"make your father proud\\" (she had also been possessed by Phantoms from the Phantom Zone, and this was not a taunt but a genuine request from what remained of her original personality) as well as the original idea that he wanted Kara to kill Kal-El. As the story ended, it was revealed that the house of El was cursed by the phantoms as they saw them as their jailers. Wherever one of the El blood line went, the Phantoms would follow. To save Earth, he needed to send Kara to remove Kal and stop the El blood line from ever growing. At the end of this story arc, however, it was revealed that the images of Zor-El and the Phantoms subsequently invading Earth as predicted were all a ruse by the Monitors to see if Supergirl belonged in the New Earth universe. Upon discovering she was truly that universe's Supergirl she was left to her own devices to reconcile with all the people she harmed in the wake of the \\"test\\". The Monitor does, however, assert that the memories of Zor-El and the phantoms on Krypton were nevertheless real. A subsequent flashback in issue #24 apparently contradicts the Monitor, revealing that \\"New Earth\\" Zor-El was not a scientist, although Alura was. In current continuity, Zor-El was a Ranger, and got on well with his brother. With his encouragement, Alura designed the ship that sent Kara to Earth, as both Kal-El's protector and the last living being who remembered Krypton (since Kal-El was an infant). In Action Comics #869 it is revealed that Alura saved Argo City from Krypton's destruction by engineering a protective dome with her husband Zor-El. However, Brainiac who was the culprit for Krypton's explosion, returned to finish the job. He merged Argo with the Bottle City of Kandor and killed those he considered to be duplicate information. Superman finds the city in Brainiac's ship. Zor-El and Alura are able to make contact with Kal-El to enquire about their daughter. The Bottle City of Kandor reverts to its full size in the North Pole at the end of the \\"Brainiac\\" story arc, which leads directly into \\"New Krypton\\". A rather minor character historically, Alura has a major role in the on-going \\"Superman: New Krypton\\" storyline. She is shown not to trust Earth people, and does not approve of her daughter or nephew's choices. Zor-El is a voice of reason to her, and when he is murdered by Reactron, she is beside herself with grief and anger. After Zor-El's death she takes command over the Kandorian people, putting as many Superman's enemies as she can in the Phantom Zone and waging war over the human race in retribution for Reactron's attack. When a coalition of human heroes, led by Superman, manages to stop her plan de-powering some of the Kryptonian Army, Alura uses Kryptonian Sunstones to turn Kandor into a new planet, the so-called \\"New Krypton\\" and put it into orbit around the Sun, at the opposite side of Earth. It is later revealed that she freed General Zod to help manage the planet and lead its military. As part of his participation in Project 7734 (a covert U.S. military operation dedicated to neutralizing the Kryptonians), Luthor sends a robot double of himself with Brainiac on an mission to attack New Krypton. While there, the Luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously-captured Reactron.Supergirl (vol. 5) #52 (June 2010). DC Comics (New York). Shortly thereafter, Reactron kills himself, initiating a chain reaction which ultimately destroys New Krypton and all but seven thousand of its 100,000 Kryptonian inhabitants. Alura, who was at ground zero, is among the casualties.Superman: War of the Supermen #1 (July 2010). DC Comics (New York). In other mediaTelevision= * Laura Benanti initially portrays Alura in the TV series Supergirl in seasons one and two and by Erica Durance (Lois Lane of Smallville) in seasons three and five. In this version, Alura is a member of the Kryptonian Science Council. She also has a twin sister, General Astra (also portrayed by Benanti), one of the primary antagonists of season one (alongside her husband Non) who was part of the attempted coup d'√©tat and now is trying to take over Earth, while convincing Kara that she is doing it for the good of the planet. In season three, Supergirl discovers that Alura is still alive and is part of Argo City's High Council. Her late husband Zor-El built a fail-safe around Argo City to protect it from Krypton's explosion. * Alura appears as a final cameo in the 2019 animated series DC Super Hero Girls, episode \\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\\" (Part 1), voiced by Kari Wahlgren. She is part of the Council member, where she faces General Zod, Ursa and Non when Krypton is being collapsed, until sentencing them to the Phantom Zone, and reunites with her daughter Kara to send her to Earth where her cousin Kal-El. =Film = * Alura appears in the film Supergirl portrayed by Mia Farrow. * Alura appears in Superman: Unbound, voiced by Sirena Irwin. * Alura appears in DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year, voiced by April Stewart. =Video games= Alura appears in the video game Injustice 2, voiced by Grey DeLisle.

He managed both of the Edinburgh derby rivals, Heart of Midlothian (Hearts) and Hibernian (Hibs). The Sunday Herald newspaper listed McCartney in 22nd place in their 2003 list of the 50 greatest Scottish football managers, citing his role in the development of Hibs' Famous Five forward line. The newspaper also said that McCartney \\"was intelligent, jovial and had great presence\\",Scotland's 50 Greatest Football Managers : 50 to eleven, Sunday Herald, 8 June 2003. and described his ultimate failure to win a major trophy as \\"unthinkably cruel\\". Hearts manager McCartney was appointed Hearts manager in November 1919, replacing his father, John. Unlike his father, Willie McCartney had never played football at a high level because he suffered an injury while playing as a youth and he initially became a referee instead. When he took the manager position at Hearts he had the task of rebuilding a team that had been decimated by the First World War, including three dead on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Although Hearts drew big crowds during the early 1920s, the team was unsuccessful and narrowly avoided relegation in 1922. Hearts improved through the rest of McCartney's time, particularly after the signing of prolific goalscorer Barney Battles, Jr. in 1928, but defensive frailties meant that they did not win any trophies. In 1933, McCartney asked to be relieved of clerical duties to concentrate on working with the players, but this had no discernible impact. McCartney resigned in June 1935, as the new chairman wanted a more hands-on approach to management. McCartney had signed and developed many good players, but ultimately failed to deliver success. Hibs manager After a year out of the game, McCartney was appointed Hibs manager in 1936. Hibs had suffered a very poor period in the early 1930s, having been relegated in 1931 and failing to win promotion in 1932. Although Hibs won promotion in 1933, they only just retained Division One status in 1934 and 1936. McCartney's appointment produced some excitement, as Hibs drew a crowd of 25,000 for his first match in charge. Hibs again struggled in his first season, as McCartney tried to find the right blend of the many new signings he had made. McCartney developed a strong group of younger players, but the club suffered a humiliating defeat in the 1937-38 Scottish Cup by Edinburgh City. Hibs put up a much better effort in the 1938-39 Scottish Cup, but were beaten 1-0 by eventual winners Clyde in the semi-final. Just as it appeared McCartney was building a good team, with The Scotsman predicting a good 1939-40 season for Hibs, the Second World War started. The Scottish Football League abandoned competition after five games of the league season, with only friendlies outside \\"danger areas\\" (major central belt towns and cities) allowed. These restrictions were soon relaxed to allow games to be played in the cities, subject to Home Office permission, but the league was regionalised. Hibs used the war years productively, however. Gordon Smith and Bobby Combe were signed in 1941, even though Hearts had been watching both players. Soon afterwards, Smith scored a hat-trick for Hibs against Hearts at Tynecastle. Combe also scored in a 5-3 win for Hibs. At the same time, McCartney attracted guest players including Matt Busby and Bobby Baxter. Hibs won the Summer Cup in 1941, defeating Rangers in the final. Rangers were the dominant club during the war, winning every Southern League competition and six of the ten cup competitions. McCartney's Hibs were their main challengers, winning two of the other four cups, and winning an equal share of the league points contested between the two sides. The guest players moved on at the end of the war in 1945, but McCartney continued to build the side. Willie Ormond and Eddie Turnbull were signed during the 1946-47 season, while a young Lawrie Reilly also signed in that season. McCartney technically wasn't allowed to sign the 16-year-old Reilly, but got around the regulation by keeping the signing form in his desk until Reilly's 17th birthday. Hibs finished that season as runners-up in both of the main competitions, second to Rangers in the league and 2-1 losers to Aberdeen in the 1947 Scottish Cup Final. Hibs started the 1947-48 season strongly, and were top of the league in January ahead of a key match against Rangers at Ibrox. The week before, Hibs played Albion Rovers in the 1947-48 Scottish Cup at Cliftonhill.Sat 24 Jan 1948 , London Hearts. Hibs won an unremarkable match 2-0, but manager McCartney had collapsed and died later that day. Trainer Hugh Shaw was appointed as McCartney's replacement, and Hibs went on to win the league that season Shaw completed the Famous Five lineup by signing Bobby Johnstone, and the team went on to win further league championships in 1951 and 1952.

One of America's first celebrity chefs, he publicized himself and his hotel by inventing dishes, writing cookbooks, and hosting extravagant meals. Biography Hirtzler was born in approximately 1875 in Strasbourg, France. He trained at the Grand Hotel in Paris, France, served as cook and food taster to Czar Nicholas II, and chef du cuisine for Carlos I of Portugal, before moving to Sherry's and the Waldorf in New York City. In 1904 he moved to San Francisco to manage food service at the recently opened St. Francis Hotel on Union Square. The hotel survived the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, and opened for breakfast as usual that morning, shortly after the quake, to the surprise and admiration of the city's residents. Hirtzler created and named a dish after Enrico Caruso,The dish was 'Spaghetti Caruso' or 'Macaroni Caruso' and consisted of pasta with a sauce of mushrooms, tomato, shallots and garlic. a prominent guest at the time. For a number of years, including the 100th anniversary of the disaster, the hotel recreated the morning's menu for a special \\"Earthquake Survivor Breakfast\\" in honor of the last few remaining survivors, with dishes including \\"Chilled Rhubarb Stew\\", \\"Southern Hominy with Cream\\", and \\"Eggs with Black Truffles in Puff Pastry\\". However, the hotel interior was soon gutted by fires sweeping the city, and the main part of the hotel closed until 1907. Known for a thick French accent, a pointed beard and curled moustache, showy costumes that included a red fez, and frequent appearances to greet guests and dignitaries throughout the hotel, Hirtzler \\"exceeded even the Hollywood portrait of a master chef\\". His cooking style was French, and he specialized in offering his guests many choices: \\"A typical dinner menu would offer a choice of fourteen cheeses, twenty clam or oyster dishes, eleven soups, twenty-four relishes, seventeen kinds of fish, and fifty-eight entr√©es from hamburger to Bohemian ham.\\" Breakfasts included 203 different preparations of eggs, such as \\"Eggs Moscow\\" stuffed with caviar. In addition to naming dishes after guests (such as \\"Eggs Sarah Bernhardt\\", with diced chicken), Hirtzler invented or renamed a number of dishes after himself including \\"Chicken Salad Victor\\", \\"Crab Cocktail Victor\\", \\"Victor Dressing\\", and the best known, \\"Celery Victor\\". Hirtzler may also have invented \\"Crab Louie\\". Hirtzler returned to Strasbourg in 1925, returning to San Francisco briefly in 1926 for the opening of the Mark Hopkins Hotel on Nob Hill.Northside, San Francisco (2008), Ernest Beyl, \\"Victor Hirtzler, Alsatian superstar chef was surrounded by P.R. haze\\" He died in Strasbourg, France, on February 9, 1931, as announced in the Hotel Monthly (Chicago, John Willy). Late in life, Victor had married Regina CASPARY (1882‚Äì1955), of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, daughter of the wagon-maker and bottling company owner, Adam CASPARY (1835‚Äì1907). Publications *L'Art Culinaire. Beginning in 1910 Hirtzler promoted his hotel, and his status as a chef, by publishing cookbooks structured as a series of multi-course menus for three meals per day, every day of the year. He titled the initial version (in a \\"popular\\" and more expensive \\"subscription\\" edition with a 9-page introductory list of \\"patrons\\") L'Art Culinaire, after Le guide culinaire, the landmark cookbook by French chef Georges Auguste Escoffier, whom Hirtzler considered a rival.

The method exploits the rose natural processes by which water is drawn up the stem. By splitting the stem and dipping each part in different coloured water, the colours are drawn into the petals resulting in a multicolored rose. With these changes to the rose, it causes them to not live as long as an uncoloured rose. The colours are artificial. Besides roses, other cut flowers like the chrysanthemum, carnation, hydrangea, and some species of orchids can also be colored using the same method.  History  Cultivars  A commonly used cultivar is \\"Vendela\\", a cream coloured Hybrid Tea cultivated in the Netherlands, Colombia and Ecuador, as this cultivar absorbs the different dyes perfectly. \\"Vendela\\" has a flower diameter of 6 cm in full bloom, a stem length of 40 to 100 cm, and is not scented. Other cultivars that can be used for this colouring process are Rosa La Belle and Rosa Avalanche+. Some vendors use the cultivar name to describe their products, e.g., Vendela Rainbow Rose, or Rose Avalanche Crystal Green.  Colour combinations  The Original Rainbow Rose has the seven colours of the rainbow and is the most popular rose in this category. However, there are also the tropical variant with combinations of red/pink and yellow, and the ocean variant with combinations of green and blue. Other colour combinations are also possible, though black and white are impossible to make.

Sundbyberg Church is the main church of Sundbyberg, in Sweden, and is a part of the Church of Sweden. It is located in Central Sundbyberg, on Rosengatan 15. Opened in 1911, it was built in a Swedish church building architecture after drawings of architect Axel Sj√∂gren (1877-1962). History The construction of the Sundbyberg church, known for its stained glass panels, began in 1909, once since the beginning of that year it was already clear that community would form their own congregation. In the fall of 1910, the church was ready for consecration, but because of a dispute over the cemetery with Bromma, it was opened on 4 June 1911. The church is a three- aisled basilica in the Art Nouveau style, clearly influenced by the slightly older Hjorthagskyrkan in Stockholm. The architect Axel Sj√∂gren took care to give the church building clear features of Swedish national Romanticism. The church is built in an east-west direction with the choir designed as a vestibule. At the southwest side is the church tower. Parish, vestry and other areas are located in a separate part on the north side of the church. Originally in the chancel a chapel was built, but it is now used as a little church. Interior The sanctuary, as well as the church in general, was decorated by Filip M√•nsson, a Swedish decorator, artist, and teacher at the Technical School in Stockholm. A stained-glass window over the altar is the work of Swedish painter and printmaker Olle Hjortzberg, and serves as the altarpiece. The subject is Christ rising from the grave, and pointing to the heavens. With the other hand he holds a scepter. The church hall's paintings are rendered by Jose Samson.

He proceeded to amass 144 matches in his first four years, adding five in the team's victorious campaign in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994‚Äì95. For the 1988‚Äì89 campaign, the Aragonese signed Paraguayan Jos√© Luis Chilavert and Cedr√∫n would be again second-choice during two seasons. However, he managed to bounce back at age 30, going on to start again in the following three. From 1993 onwards, Cedr√∫n began facing some competition from Real Madrid youth graduate Juanmi and, after no league appearances to his credit in 1995‚Äì96, left for a single top level campaign at lowly CD Logro√±√©s, retiring subsequently. Personal life Cedr√∫n's father, Carmelo, was also a footballer and a goalkeeper. He too represented Athletic but with more success, playing more than 400 competitive matches in the 50s/60s. His nephew, Markel Areitio, is also a goalkeeper.

Early life Gration was born in Richmond, Victoria, on 6 January 1932 to David Roy Gration and his wife Margaret (n√©e Fleming). David, a dental mechanic, had served in the First World War as a sapper on the Western Front and later enlisted in the Volunteer Defence Corps during the Second World War, discharging with the rank of corporal in 1945. Peter attended Scotch College, Melbourne from 1945 until matriculation in 1948, where he was active in the school's cricket, football, and athletics teams. Military career Accepted into the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Gration began his course at the college in 1949. He graduated as a lieutenant three years later with the Queen's Medal, and was allocated to the Royal Australian Engineers. Over the following two years, Gration was a resident student at Ormond College in the University of Melbourne where he completed a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree; Gration subsequently completed a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Economics at the University of Queensland in later years. Gration saw active service during the Malayan Emergency, before attending the British Army Staff College, Camberley in 1964. He completed a tour of duty during the Vietnam War between 1969 and 1970, during which time he was posted as commanding officer of the 1st Australian Civil Affairs Unit with the rank of lieutenant colonel. For his \\"distinguished services\\" in Vietnam, Gration was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1971. In 1973, Gration was appointed Director of Engineers. Following that three-year stint, he was posted to a course at the United States Army War College. Gration was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 1984 Australia Day Honours for his service as Assistant Chief of the Defence Force Staff. Later that year he was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed Chief of the General Staff ‚Äì the professional head of the Australian Army. In 1987, Gration was appointed Chief of the Defence Force and promoted to general. In the Australia Day Honours of 1988 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia. In October 1992 Gration visited Sweden and J√§mtland Air Force Wing (F 4) where he studied the Swedish Air Force's next airborne surveillance radar system, the FSR-890. Following forty-four years of service, Gration retired from the Australian Army and active military service in 1993. Retirement Since his retirement from the army, Gration has held various senior positions in companies and charities, including Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, Chairman of the Management Committee of Transfield Defence Systems, Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Australian Defence College, Director of Tenix Pty Ltd, Chairman of Tenix Toll Defence Logistics Pty Ltd, Founding Chairman of the General Sir John Monash Foundation, and National President of Toc H. In 1993 Gration was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of New South Wales. During 1994‚Äì1995, Gration served as a consultant to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and had primary responsibility for negotiation of a security agreement with Indonesia. During this time, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Melbourne University Regiment, and made Representative Colonel Commandant of the Royal Australian Engineers during 2000. Since the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Gration has been open in his criticism of Australia's involvement in the war. In an article he wrote for The Age, Gration declared: \\"... there are insufficient grounds for war, which is unnecessary and may lead to unpredictable and potentially disastrous consequences. It is not in Australia's interests to take part in such a war.\\" In April 2005 he was awarded the inaugural Peace Prize from the Australian Medical Association for the Prevention of War for his \\"outspoken criticism\\". Married with two sons, Gration is an Hononary Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Australia, and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering.

Thavie's Inn is one of the earliest Inns of Chancery on record, both by date of establishment and dissolution. It remains a well-known City of London landmark, where Lloyd's Bank is situated, on the opposite side of Holborn Circus from Ely Place. Origin of property In 1349 John Thavie, an armourer based in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, \\"left a considerable Estate towards the support of the fabric forever\\" of that church, a legacy which survived the English Reformation. It has been invested carefully through the centuries, and still provides for the church's current upkeep.\\"London:the City Churches\\" Pevsner,N/Bradley,S : New Haven, Yale, 1998 His name has been transcribed as 'Thavy', 'Tavy' and 'Davy', i.e. the Welsh surname ('dd' in Welsh is pronounced 'th', when Anglicised as a single 'D' the pronunciation is lost). In his will, the property is described as an inn \\"wherein the apprentices used to dwell\\" (note the past tense) and the assumption is that these were \\"Law Apprentices\\" who were known to lodge along Holborn, to be near the chancellor's court, i.e. at the Bishop of Lincoln's establishment there. The property in question is best located by the present Bartlett's Buildings on the south-side of Holborn. Thavie's original property, which was left for his endowment of the church, may still have been let to 'lawyers' by Thavie's executors for income, and may have been the original home of Lincoln's Inn before it relocated to its present site on Chancery Lane.The Wards of Farringdon Tony Sharp FWC 2000 There is, however, considerable confusion as to just how the names of both the Inn of Chancery and the Inn of Court are derived. The will's statement uses the past tense and we know from the records of the inn that the community of clerks had moved to the neighbouring house of John de Besvile; it is this site that is associated with the title of 'Thavie's Inn' and the assumption is that the transfer of that name indicates the later lawyers association as having started in the original Thavy premises. Research by the Librarian at Lincoln's Inn in 2016 into the relationship between it and the property of John Thavy, St Andrew's benefactor, has cast doubt on the assumption that the later Inn of Chancery was based there. The reference in the Will of Thavie to his property is to 'his apprentices' and therefore these would have been armourers rather than lawyers. It seems that a Clerk of Chancery, John Davy, had neighbouring property at Besvile's Inn near Thavies Inn and these different individuals and their properties became confounded retrospectively. Besvile's Inn owned by John Davy was named after him as was Barnard's Inn named after its first Principal. The Inn of Chancery was not that of the benefactor of St Andrew's but its near neighbour.http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/index.php/library/the- inns-archives/archive-of-the-month There is a reference, after the relocation but before 1400, to the clerks at Besvile's house being addressed as \\"treshonorable, tresage compagne de David Inn in Holborn\\" ie. the 'Right Honourable and Learned Company of David's Inn in Holborn'. A deed of 1419 referring to \\"Davesynne\\" is extant. All of these references are important because they are the first record of any formal establishment of lawyers. Lincoln's Inn's own records, the 'Black Books', themselves start in 1422.The Parish of St Andrew Holborn pp. 14‚Äì22 Caroline Barron, London 1979  Bishops, Earls, and Thomas called 'of Lincoln'  The Templar Order had its first house in Holborn street from sometime in the reign of King Stephen, building one of their characteristic round churches on the site, located at what is now Southampton Buildings, next to Chancery Lane. The Templars relocated to the present Temple area in 1161, selling the first property to Robert de Chesney Bishop of Lincoln as his 'London' palace. Bishops were then also senior government officers of the Crown and those of Lincoln where often the chancellor, the king's most senior officer. The Dominicans or 'Black Friars' arrived at Holborn in 1224, extending and developing their estate in Holborn and southwards to Fleet Street. It is alleged that the Archbishop of Canterbury induced them to relocate to the nearby Thames side and eastern side of the Fleet in 1279, to an area better known since then as 'Blackfriars'. They sold their old property to Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln in that year.The Parish of St Andrew Holborn pp. 11‚Äì12 Caroline Barron, London 1979 It is the claim of Lincoln's Inn that it derives its name from the EarlA Portrait of Lincoln's Inn 3rd Millennium 2007 as its patron. In 1369, the Benedictine cleric, the Abbot of Malmesbury, also required a London establishment for his affairs and the Benedictine Order acquired \\"Lyncolnesynne\\", that of one Thomas of Lincoln, who was a Serjeant at law, and thus a local landlord unrelated to the ecclesiastical or lay magnates bearing a similar title/name. The Abbot did not occupy all of the buildings himself, instead letting them out to various tenants, perhaps some of them law apprentices and their masters. Thomas of Lincoln's property is located at what is now Furnivall Street, on the south- side of Holborn.Barron ibid p. 14 This former site of \\"Lyncolnesynne\\" was close to the Thavie's Inn and Furnival's Inn sites. The derivation of the present Lincoln's Inn name could simply be in reference to the group who migrated to the present 'Chichester Inn' site of Lincoln's Inn, in Chancery Lane, from this earlier Thomas's inn. At the latest, this was done by 1442, so that the group must have occupied at some time before something called 'Lincoln's Inn'. The Black Books start some twenty years before this move. Thavy's property itself was, however, a sub-division of Earl Henry de Lacy's manor so that the association of lawyers may have acquired their collective name from any informal affinity with the leading magnate's local interests. As to why the Inns of Chancery became subject to the Inns of Court is a moot point; it is, however, notable that the two subject to Lincoln's Inn (Thavie's and Furnival's) were not adjacent to its present site, unlike the dispositions of the other Chancery Inns to their patron Inns, but further east actually closer to the Thomas de Lincoln site. Lincoln's Inn sold Thavie's Inn for redevelopment in 1785, the proceeds being used to erect 'Stone Buildings'.

It is situated on the N2 national road, between George and Knysna. The town was proclaimed in 1929 on the farm Sedgefield, which in turn was named in 1894 after the village of the same name in the UK where the father (Henry Barrington) of the then farm owner was born. History The farm Ruigtevlei was granted to the widow Meeding by Lord Charles Somerset and upon her death in 1878, the farm was divided into 9 lots. Lots A and B were first bought by individual farmers, before eventually being purchased in 1894 by John Barrington, son of then-famous politician, farmer and industrialist Henry Barrington (referred to as ‚ÄòHenry Barrington of Portland‚Äô in the novel ‚ÄòCircles in a forest‚Äô by Dalene Matthee). John named the town in honour of his father‚Äôs birthplace Sedgefield in the United Kingdom. Kate Maurice (n√©e Barrington) inherited the farm Sedgefield from her brother upon his death in 1901. Kate sold the farm in 1911 to Salmon Terblans. A part of the farm Sedgefield was subsequently sold as Middelplaas, but was reincorporated in 1926. Terblans and Thomas Moodie investigated the possibility of proclaiming a town on the farm. Eventually, Moodie invested a lot of work into developing a town plan after securing an option to buy the farm but due to an oversight by Moodie‚Äôs lawyer, Terblans was able to step back out of their agreement at the last moment and sell the ground to Thesen and Company. However, Charlie Thesen decided to compensate Moodie for his invested effort and allowed him to name the newly proclaimed town. The name of Sedgefield was but one of a number of names considered by Moodie. In the end, the fact that it translated well to the original Afrikaans name of Ruigtevlei as well as the observation that it was very descriptive of the environment gave sway in favour of the name. After proclamation, the town experienced organic growth by attracting families who were attracted by the ‚Äònew winter resort‚Äô advertised in the George and Knysna Herald from 1927 onwards. The first families to settle were the Salts, Schumachers, Browns, Barnards and Mullers. In 1921 a railway connection between George and Knysna was planned and the project was completed in 1928 by routing the line over a new bridge crossing the adjacent Swartvlei (‚ÄòBlack lake‚Äô). In 1940, the town was given a postal service outlet and in 1947 the road through Sedgefield was completed, thus fully integrating the town into the commercial route between George and Knysna. A library was opened in 1962 and the town expanded further during the next four decades to comprise a central business district with supermarkets, pharmacies, filling stations, curio shops and other undertakings. Fresh water has been supplied from nearby Karatara River Municipal water extraction plant run by Sedgefield Municipality then Knysna Municipality, but being pressed by an unusually dry summer a desalination plant was erected in 2009 to make the town totally self- sufficient in terms of water supply. Until the end of the 20th century, Sedgefield was an independent local authority. When the ANC came to power nationally, for a variety of reasons, they decided to reduce the total of such local authorities country-wide and Sedgefield became part of Knysna. This was a decision that was opposed by many of the residents. Sedgefield today The central area of Sedgefield (The Village) together with the Island (Extension 1) form part of the original town area. Since then, the extensions of Smutsville, Sizamile, Groenvallei, Myoli Beach and Cola Beach were added to provide residences for the approximately 8000 permanent inhabitants of Sedgefield. The town‚Äôs main economic activity revolves around tourism, with secondary activities centered on serving the needs of local residents and regional farmers. The laid-back rustic village atmosphere is reflected in the town‚Äôs motto of being a place where ‚Äòthe tortoise sets the pace‚Äô. Sedgefield is the first African member of the Cittaslow movement. A popular attraction is the Wild Oats market which attracts large numbers of tourists and residents from the region every Saturday morning with fresh produce and local crafts. A golf course (the ‚ÄòFynbos Links‚Äô), tennis court and bowls field caters to the significant portion of retired permanent residents of the town. Local natural attractions include Gericke‚Äôs lookout point which resembles the profile of a resting lion and the protected natural dune areas which harbours Cape Fynbos plantations and rare bird species.

Aims * To increase the amount of land available for cereal production and help the Battle for Grain. * To provide more jobs, reduce unemployment and stimulate demand. * To improve health by reducing malaria, thereby improving living standards. * To show dynamic government in action, impressing foreigners. * To revive rural Italy by altering the pattern of small farmers at the expense of large estates. Actions * Expanded previous government‚Äôs schemes of providing money to drain or irrigate farmland (laws passed in 1923, 1928 and 1933). * The Pontine marshes, only 50 km from Rome and thus easily accessible by foreign journalists, were the showpiece; by 1935 they provided land for settlement. * Malaria swamps were drained and a network of small farms were set up, owned by ex-servicemen. * Private landowners were made to cooperate with drainage schemes and other projects via the landholder association, which determined contributions.Fascism and National Socialism: A Study of the Economic and Social Policies of the Totalitarian State, Michael T. Florinsky, 1936 * Fascist propaganda stressed the need to revive the rural areas and to build up a strong peasantry. Propaganda generally portrayed peasants as ideal citizens with strong fascist values. * Abolition of day and short term labour. Collective contracts were negotiated which secured long-term employment in agriculture (this encouraged relocation to the countryside, particularly in the South).Florinsky, 1936 Successes * Public health was improved. * Provided thousands of jobs during the depression. * New towns‚ÄîLatina and Sabaudia‚Äîcreated as show pieces. * Between the years 1928 and 1938, 80,000 hectares were reclaimed. Failures * The 80,000 hectares reclaimed was only one twentieth of the propaganda claim which was one sixth of Italy‚Äôs land. * Three quarters of the reclaimed land was in the North; the South, which was most in need of improvement, was largely neglected. * Southern landowners who were unable to make great enough contributions in terms of finance, stock or employment had their land expropriated, albeit rarely.Florinsky, 1936 * The Fascist regime achieved nothing in the way of land redistribution, which was, in any event, inconsistent with the central thrust of the higher-profile Battle for Grain. * The scheme was abandoned in 1940. Conclusion The Battle for Land was, again, more style than substance. Propaganda enlarged the realities of the amount of land reclaimed‚Äîa mere 80,000 hectares compared to the claim of 1,600,000 hectares. It was successful in improving public health and had a great impact on jobs which was not to be underestimated given the depression. However, farming was not particularly boosted‚Äîthe beneficiaries largely the landowners who were able to make the greatest contributions, and the somewhat small number of peasant families relocated to the showpiece towns. Its publicity value and role in supporting the Battle for Grain, however, should not be underestimated.

Rather than having just one county record office, Cumbria County Council operates four local record offices, now known as archive centres, in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Whitehaven. The four archive centres Carlisle Archive Centre was officially opened in 1962, although archives had been collected before that date and archive staff had been appointed from c.1944 onwards. For many years, it operated from the Alma Block within the grounds of Carlisle Castle. It moved to newly converted premises at Petteril Bank House, on the south side of the city and about two miles from its centre, in 2011. Important collections include family and estate records of the Earls of Lonsdale from the 12th-20th centuries. The staff provide administrative assistance for the Egremont Estate Office at Cockermouth Castle.Janet Foster & Julia Shepherd, British Archives: A Guide to Archive Resources in the United, 3rd edition 1995, . Kendal Archive Centre was also established in 1962 under a joint archives committee for the former counties of Cumberland and Westmorland and the City of Carlisle. Few archives other than local authority records had been collected before this date. The office operates from the main County Offices in the town. Important collections include Appleby Castle estate records (containing papers relating to Lady Anne Clifford, 1590-1676), and the business records of Thomas Mawson, landscape architect, 19th-20th centuries. Barrow Archive Centre was opened in purpose-built premises in 1979 (following local government reorganisation and the creation of the new county of Cumbria). Records had been collected locally in temporary premises at Dalton- in-Furness since 1975 and the new office also absorbed records from the Furness Collection, gathered from 1948 onwards by the Central Library in Barrow. Following building extensions the record office joined with the local studies library in 1998 to provide a unified service within a joint search room. Important collections include records from the Furness estate office of the Duke of Buccleuch.Janet Foster & Julia Shepherd, British Archives, 4th edition 2002, Whitehaven Archive and Local Studies Centre was officially opened within specially converted premises in August 1996. It collects archives mainly from the south and west portions of the former county of Cumberland. All four archive centres are recognised by the Lord Chancellor as places of deposit for public records. They are also designated as diocesan record offices by the Bishop of Carlisle. A specialist unit for the conservation and repair of records operates from within the archive centre at Petteril Bank House, Carlisle.

Pages 4‚Äì6 present a whirlwind tour of Anauroch, including settlements of the local peoples, and important oases and trade routes. Pages 7‚Äì9 detail the secret of Anauroch; that thousands of years ago it was once a glacier that became swallowed up by the howling sands. The role of the phaerimm and the sharn in Anauroch's history is also revealed. Pages 10‚Äì24 detail the society of the Bedine, the native people of Anauroch.

Pages 34‚Äì58 detail the Sword, the large region that lies like a broad swordblade across the southern end of Anauroch; it is named not for its shape, but of the local humans' and orcs' chief activity of carving up others with gusto. Pages 59‚Äì62 detail the Plain of Standing Stones, the central plain-like region of the Great Desert. Pages 63‚Äì67 describe the High Ice, the glacial ice that covers the northern reaches of Anauroch.

Club career Loreto was born in Seville, Andalusia. After making his professional debut with Real Betis, scoring two goals in 23 games for an eventual La Liga relegation in the 1990‚Äì91 season, he excelled at neighbours C√≥rdoba CF in the third division (signing with the club in 1993), which prompted a return to the top flight with Real Zaragoza. However, Loreto was grossly unsettled at the Aragonese, and played one season in the second level, being crucial for CD Logro√±√©s' promotion whilst on loan. At the end of the campaign, he was released and spent a further four years in division three with C√≥rdoba and C√°diz CF.
