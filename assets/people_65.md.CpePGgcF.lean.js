It is known throughout the Queens Jewish community as a \\"minyan factory\\", a place where one can find a mincha minyan throughout the afternoon or maariv minyan until late into the night. History Elyakim Rosenblatt was a student of both Aharon Kotler and Henoch Leibowitz. Leibowitz influenced him to spread Torah to as many Jews as possible. He therefore began teaching Torah to non-religious Jewish students in Corona, Queens, where he was a rabbi. Rosenblatt's students in Corona encouraged him to start Yeshiva Keser Torah. In the 1970s, Rosenblatt opened the yeshiva on the Grand Central Parkway in Briarwood, near Queens' Main Street, where it remained for over a decade.

They therefore purchased a house in the center of Kew Gardens Hills' Jewish community, where the yeshiva is located today. While the classes in Kesser Torah were intended mainly for non-religious Jews, there were classes aimed towards a general community audience. Over 500 of Rosenblatt's classes are accessible today. =Kew Gardens Hills= Yeshiva Kesser Torah in 2020 In the early 2000s, more minyanim (prayer groups) were added to the schedule, and the student body began to decrease. The yeshiva then began sponsoring mincha and maariv minyanim every thirty minutes, with the latest maariv minyan being held at 11:30 or midnight. On Shabbat (Jewish Sabbath), Kesser Torah holds one Friday night kabbolas Shabbos and maariv, with shacharis the next morning followed by a small kiddush (meal), two minchas in the afternoon followed by a shalosh seudos (the third meal), and one maariv that night.

They are dedicated to perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and to reparation to God for the sins of the world. To this end, they serve to help deepen the faith of laywomen though conducting spiritual retreats in their monasteries.  History  Born into an aristocratic but non-religious family, Dubouché (1809–1863) grew up to be an artist who was known for her religious works as a painter. On February 25, 1847, she had a dream in which she saw Christ crowned with thorns and his head covered with a veil. She then painted this vision. Feeling that she had received a call from God to a more exacting form of spiritual life, Dubouché and her father were allowed to take up residence in an outlying building of the Monastery of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Paris, then located on a portion of their original cloister in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. During the night of June 29, 1848, which she was spending in adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, Dubouché had another vision of Christ, this time appearing on the altar of the monastery's chapel. In this vision he asked that she offer worship and reparation for the damages to the Church which were then occurring in the uprisings of the Revolutions of 1848 as part of a religious institute. She shared this vision with the prioress of the monastery, Mother Isabelle, who suggested that Dubouché found a community of the Third Order vowed to those ends. Dubouché then outlined a community of both Religious Sisters and secular tertiaries living together in community. The only distinction between the two branches would be that the secular sisters would not take a vow of poverty. Eight young women were found who felt called to share in this proposed way of life. With them, on August 6, 1848, Dubouché began a canonical novitiate, establishing the new community of Religious Sisters and secular tertiaries. At that point she assumed the religious name of Marie-Thérèse of the Heart of Jesus. The Sisters then took over the former Ursuline monastery which had been closed by the French Revolution, at what was then Rue des Ursulines, now 39 Rue Gay-Lussac. The small community received the formal approval of the new archbishop, Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour, in February 1849. Dubouché professed her initial religious vows on May 29 of that year and on June 13 received thirteen Sisters into the novitiate of the new congregation. The congregation was granted the Decretum laudis (Decree of Praise), giving conditional recognition of the community, by Pope Pius IX in 1853, achieving full papal approval under Pope Leo XIII in 1887. The Sisters then took over the former Ursuline monastery which had been closed by the French Revolution, at what was then 3 Rue des Ursulines, now 39 Rue Gay- Lussac. They were granted the Decretum laudis (Decree of Praise), giving conditional recognition of the community, by Pope Pius IX in 1853, achieving full approval under Pope Leo XIII in 1887. New communities of the congregation were founded by Dubouché in Lyons (1850) and Châlons-en-Champagne (1860). In the 20th century, this religious congregation was merged with two others which had been founded with similar goals: *1909: The Sisters of the Reparative Association, also founded in 1848 in Saint-Dizier by the Abbé Pierre Marche, who had also established the Archconfraternity of Reparation. Their goal was reparation through eucharistic adoration for the blasphemies committed by non- believers and for society's refusal to enact Sabbath laws enforcing the biblical demand to rest on the Sabbath. *1939: The Sisters of Reparation, founded in 1864 by Mother Marie-Thérèse de Waroquier (born Yolande), in Saint- Affrique, whose goal was adoration and reparation. By the end of the 20th century, the community was present in three houses: the original motherhouse in Paris and two monasteries in Ireland, in the cities of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Ferns, County Wexford. As of 2017, they totaled 20 members. The congregation gained some public notice in 2014, when they accepted four candidates to their way of life for the first time in nearly twenty years. The group included a well-known BBC News journalist Martina Purdy and Barrister Elaine Kelly. They received further public attention five years later when these two women announced that they had been forced to leave the monastery, as it had been decided that the congregation was not viable for future growth. That same month, the website of the congregation announced that the chapel of the motherhouse was being closed for six months. In March 2020, it was updated to advise that it would remain closed until further notice as the future of the community is determined.

The centre of the teip is the village Zandak, which is located in the Nozhay-Yurtovsky District.  Geography  Members of the teip live all across the Chechen Republic and the Aukh region of todays Dagestan. They either make up the majority or founded the following villages * Baytarki (Байтарки) * Gamiyakh (Гамиях) * Gilyani (Гиляны) * Mazhgara (Мажгара) * Simsir (Симсир) * Zandak-Ara (Зандак-Ара) The teip also had historical settlements in other parts of Chechnya which were named after their native village Zandak, like on the right side of the Gums (a tributary of the Sunzha) and one between the Gekhi and Valerik. These were burned down during the Russian conquest of the Caucasus.  Etymology  The origin of the word Zandak is unknown, although historians believe it possibly derived from the word sona/sana, which means angle, and duk, meaning ridge. There is also the common belief that the name derives from Zana, who according to a legend was the founder of the teip (Zana + duk, Zanas ridge).  History  The village is the name giverfor the Zandak culture, an archaeological culture spanning from the 11th to the 7th century BC. The burial ground of the culture was accidentally discovered in 1952 and was made up of 66 burials in which they found several arrowheads, spear tips, a brush, a bracelet and other things. During the Caucasian War, members of the teip supported the Caucasian Imamate and fought consistently against the Russian conquerors. Among them was Gheza- Hadzhi Zandakskiy, a Sufi preacher and spiritual leader of the Chechens. In 1877, inhabitants of Zandak and other mountain villages in Eastern Chechnya, started an uprising under the fellow Zandkhoy Alibek-Hadzhi Aldamov. The uprising lasted until 27 November, when Aldamov decided to surrender and put an end to the suffering Chechens went through. During the uprising, many Chechen villages were burned down by Russian forces, including Zandak, Baytarki and Alibeks home village, Simsir, on 17 May. Inhabitants of these villages were then pushed to the planes or deported to Dagestan. In the course of the Chechen-Ingush deportation in 1944, Zandak was renamed Dagbash and resettled with people from Dagestan. After the restoration of the Chechen- Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the village returned to its former name Zandak and the Dagestanis resettled back to Dagestan.  Branches  The teip is split into 11 branches (некъи, neq̇i): the Zaghash neq, Ghoytk neq, Ghurma neq, Baci/Be neq, Le neq, Mentig neq, Arzin/Khaghashan neq, Ghadalan neq, Daki neq, Khornin neq, and Khokhcala neq. = Genetics = All members of the teip that have tested so far belong to the J1 and J2 haplogroup. 2 families of the Ghurma neq and Daki neq are J1, while the rest are J2, which include one Ghoytk family, one Ghadalan family, one Zaghash family and one Ghurma family.

Born in Bünzen, near Aukrug, Stühmer was orphaned at an early age. He excelled at school and hoped to become a teacher, but could not fund the training. He eventually found a paid apprenticeship as a tailor, and in 1887 joined the Travel Support Association of German Tailors. At the time, the Anti-Socialist Laws made trade unions illegal, but the Travel Support Association fulfilled some of the same role. Stühmer was drawn to the potential of trade unions to improve pay and working conditions, and in 1888 he moved to Hamburg, then the centre of the German labour movement. In 1888, the German Union of Tailors was formed, and Stühmer was appointed as its secretary, then soon moved to become its Hamburg branch representative. In 1891, he began editing the union's newspaper, becoming the first employee of the union. He championed the formation of the International Clothing Workers' Federation, and served as its first president, and then as secretary from 1900. In 1903, he was elected as the union's president, relocating to the union's new headquarters in Berlin. The international became moribund at the start of World War I, but Stühmer remained leader of the tailors, in what became the German Clothing Workers' Union. At the end of the war, the international was re-established, and Stühmer was elected to its board. He stood down as union leader in 1920, but served on the Reich Economic Council, and wrote a history of the German clothing movement, covering 1888 until 1928.

Yakutumba has been involved in armed mobilization since 1996, fighting for the Mai-Mai before eventually leading his own group. Yakutumba claims to fight for democracy and against the purported invasion of Rwandophone populations in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Early life and Education Yakutumba was born to a Bembe family in the Lubondja sector of Fizi in the mid-1960s or 1970s. In 1990, he traveled to Lubumbashi to study history at the University of Lubumbashi. After three years at UNILU, he broke off his studies for unknown reasons. In 1996, when Laurent Kabila's AFDL invaded the country, Yakutumba returned to Fizi and joined the Mai-Mai. Career Yakutumba fought for the Mai-Mai in both the First and Second Congo Wars. Originally fighting alongside rebel forces during the first war, he ended up fighting for the new Kabila government against the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy. Yakutumba's unit was under the command of a certain Dunia Lwendama, who had been active in rebellions since the 1960s. =Mai-Mai Réformé= At the end of the Second Congo War, many Mai-Mai leaders felt marginalized, believing they had not gained political and military representation they deserved for their role in the war. During this time, the government was attempting to demobilize Mai-Mai groups and integrate them into the national army. In 2007, the FARDC sent trucks to finish the integration of the 118th Brigade, the Mai-Mai unit under Yakutumba's command. Yakutumba and a small group of loyalist fighters fled to the Ubwari Peninsula, where they established Mai-Mai Réformé. This prompted the government to try and negotiate with Yakutumba, who stated he would integrate into the armed forces if Banyamulenge units did so first. It was at this time that Yakutumba began to refer to himself as \\"General\\". =Mai-Mai Yakutumba= In September 2007, Yakutumba and his political deputy, Raphael Looba Undji, visited Kinshasa at the invitation of then-president Joseph Kabila. They spent around six months in the city, where they established political contacts. Following the visit, Yakutumba established the Party of Action for the Reconstruction of Congo (PARC), the political wing of his group. During the period of 2009-2010, Yakutumba used his forces to pressure politicians and the armed forces into supporting his goals. During this time, he also feigned disarmament, which he would use to regroup and strengthen his militia more. Yakutumba also had entered a relationship with the National Forces of Liberation, a dissident Burundian rebel faction. This relationship allowed Yakutumba's forces access to more advanced training and weaponry. In 2011, he merged his political wing, the PARC, with his new armed wing, the Alleluia Armed Forces (FAAL), forming the PARC-FAAL, better known as Mai-Mai Yakutumba. This new development caused Yakutumba to shift his rhetoric to a national scale, claiming Joseph Kabila was an agent of Rwanda. As the years went on, however, Mai-Mai Yakutumba fell out of political relevance, content with taxing roads, fishing, and gold mining in areas under the group's influence. Yakutumba, by 2014, no longer had the military prowess or political clout he had in the years before. =CNPSC= In late 2016 to early 2017, Yakutumba re-emerged, leading a wide coalition of Mai-Mai groups calling itself the National Coalition of the People for the Sovereignty of Congo (CNPSC). The new coalition launched two major offensives in South Kivu in 2017 and 2018, even coming close to capturing Uvira city. Yakutumba stated that he intended to overthrow the government to \\"chase the dictator Kabila from power\\". Yakutumba claims to have around 10,000 troops under his command, but analysts disagree, stating he has close to 1,000. Currently, the coalition is engaged in fighting mainly against the Banyamulenge-led Ngumino and Twiganeho militias. In a recent video statement, Yakutumba re-affirmed the coalition's goals, as well as denounced alleged invasions of the country by Rwandophone groups.

Raised in Madrid, she attended university during the Spanish Civil War at the University of Valencia. Junquera was a noted translator, chronicler, and short story writer in the mid-20th century, whose works and impact received new interest in the 21st century with republishing of some of her works and scholarship on her life. Early life Amanda Junquera Butler was born on 19 October 1898 in Madrid to Emilia Butler and Tomás Junquera de Basañez. She grew up in Madrid along with her five siblings, Isabel, María Luisa, Emilia, María Teresa, and Tomás. She enjoyed reading and from a young age, traveled widely and studied music and literature. In July 1928, at the Santa Bárbara Parish Church of Madrid, she married the academic and dean of the Faculty of Arts for the University of Murcia, . Junquera continued traveling widely after her marriage, moving as was required for Alcázar's career. Career In 1936, at a reception for the opening of the in the Murcia Region of Spain, Junquera met the writer Carmen Conde Abellán, who had been active in getting the university established. Conde was the wife of poet, Antonio Oliver Belmás and would become the first woman admitted into the Royal Spanish Academy. The two women had an immediate affinity for each other and began exchanging books and letters. Within a month of their meeting, Conde was dedicating poems to Junquera, which explicitly described her desire for engaging with Amanda using all of her senses and alluding to Katherine Mansfield in language widely known as lesbian coding in the period. Just over a year after meeting, in June 1937, the two women planned a holiday together, without their husbands, at Penyal d'Ifac Natural Park in Valencia, where they became lovers. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) the women cemented their relationship, as their husbands were away and they were able to continue to meet and correspond. Because of and social custom, the two women were not allowed to divorce or acknowledge their sexuality, which created the need to publicly hide their situation. Both husbands had volunteered to serve in the Spanish Republican Army and both served in Baza, Granada. Conde's husband, Oliver, was captured and imprisoned, while Junquera's husband, Alcázar, was transferred to the University of Valencia, and would become Director-General of Universities under Francisco Franco's dictatorship. Junquera enrolled in classes at the University of Valencia, when she returned from her holiday at Peñón de Ifach. Among her classmates were and . At the end of the war, authorities marked Conde for arrest because she was a pro-Republican intellectual. Junquera helped her escape from Valencia and they moved into the home of Junquera's sister in Madrid. For a year, they lived with the sister, where Conde hid in a bedroom. In 1940, the women moved to San Lorenzo de El Escorial and then in 1942, Alcázar joined them in Madrid. He and Junquera rented #5 Calle Velintonia from poet, Vicente Aleixandre, which would be the home for the three of them off and on for the next four decades. It was in the early 1940s, that Junquera began to publish, using the pseudonym Isabel de Ambía. She wrote essays, chronicles, literary critiques, and short stories which were mainly published in magazines like Cuadernos de Literatura Contemporánea (Contemporary Literature Notes), Destino de Barcelona (Destiny Barcelona), El Español (The Spanish), and Hispania. From 1942, Junquera translated literary works of English, French, and Italian writers into Spanish. These included works by , Marcel Pagnol, Anna Maria Speckel, Alejandro Tassoni Estense, and William Thomas Walsh, among others. praised her translations of Micheli and Tassoni in a 1944 review in Cuadernos de Literatura Contemporánea, and her translation of Walsh was republished in both 1953 and 1963. She also published stories throughout the 1940s. In 1947, Junquera published her only book, Un hueco en la luz (A Hollow in the Light). When Oliver was finally released from prison, he and Conde agreed to remain married in name only. Oliver was required to live in isolation in Murcia, but Conde returned to El Escorial, where she could be with Junquera. When Conde was accused of political offenses, Junquera and Alcázar used their influence to help her get the charges dismissed. Suffering from a heart condition, Oliver was allowed to return to Madrid in 1945 and Conde ostensibly lived with him and his mother in a separate apartment. The two couples remained close, often vacationing together in spite of the complicated relationships. Junquera's husband died in 1958 and she and Conde remained constant companions. When Oliver died in 1968, Conde permanently moved into Junquera's home. Death and legacy Junquera died on 27 December 1986 in Madrid and she was buried in the cemetery in Torrelodones. Though she was often overshadowed by their fame, both Conde and Alcázar dedicated multiple works to her in recognition of her significance in their own literary productions. Revived interest in her works began in the 21st century and her biography was included in volume 2 of the Indice Biográfico de España, Portugal e Iberoamérica (Biographical Indices of Spain, Portugal and Latin America, Walter de Gruyter, 2000). Several of her translations also were republished in 2000 and 2001. In 2007, José Luis Ferris published Carmen Conde: vida, pasión y verso de una escritora olvidada (Carmen Conde: Life, Passion and Verse of a Forgotten Writer), which chronicled the relationship of Conde and Junquera publicly.

It was one of the military outposts created during the Second Seminole War to assist Colonel Zachary Taylor's troops to capture Seminole Indians and their allies in the central part of the Florida Territory that were resisting forced removal to federal territory west of the Mississippi River per the Indian Removal Act.Roberts, Robert B. Encyclopedia of Historic Forts: The Military, Pioneer, and Trading Posts of the United States. New York: Macmillan. 1988, p. 169. Brief History After Major General Thomas S. Jesup, Quartermaster General and Commander of all U.S. troops in Florida, had given up hope of bringing the Second Seminole War to an end by negotiation he ordered Colonel Taylor “to proceed with the least possible delay against any portion of the enemy and to destroy or capture the same.”The Memoirs of Major General Zachary Taylor – Chapter II, The Bloody Battle of Lake Ohee-chobee. The Daily National Whig (Washington, District of Columbia). May 25, 1847, p. 1. On December 2, 1837, Colonel Zachary Taylor, commander of 1,400 troops of the First Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army of the South, ordered the construction of a fortification on the banks of the Kissimmee River just south of Lake Tohopekaliga in the central part of the Florida Territory - present-day Polk County, Florida. This particular fortification was named Fort Gardiner after Captain George Washington Gardiner, who was killed on December 28, 1835 during the battle of Dade's Massacre in present-day in Sumter County, Florida. On December 19, 1837, Colonel Taylor marched south from Fort Gardiner with 1,032 soldiers (180 Missouri volunteers, 47 from the “Morgan Spies” company, 70 Delaware and Shawnee Indians and 735 regular U.S. Army troops) to join General Jesup’s campaign to penetrate deep into Seminole territory with large forces and trap the Seminoles and their allies and force them to fight or surrender. On December 21, 1837, Colonel Taylor ordered another fortification constructed to support his plans. This particular fortification was named Fort Basinger after Lieutenant William E. Basinger who was killed during the battle of Dade's Massacre. Colonel Taylor stationed one company of troops and approximately 85 sick men and some Indians at Fort Basinger. The remaining troops marched south and captured small parties of Indians as they surrendered. Meanwhile, about 380 to 480 Seminole Indians and their allies led by Old Sam Jones, Alligator and Coacoochee were preparing a battleground to confront Colonel Taylor’s soldiers. On December 25, 1837, the Battle of Lake Okeechobee took place. It was a tactical victory for the Seminoles and their allies as the U.S. forces suffered 26 killed and 112 wounded compared to 11 killed and 14 wounded on the Seminole side. The Seminoles and their allies retreated, however Colonel Taylor could not pursue them as his forces sustained too many casualties. Colonel Taylor regrouped his soldiers and marched back to Fort Basinger and from there they proceeded to Fort Gardiner where they set up a makeshift hospital. Many of the wounded soldiers were then escorted to Fort Brooke for further care.Mahon, John K. History of the Second Seminole War (1967). Gainesville, FL: University of Florida Press. pp. 219-230.Andrews, Mark. Forts Played Role in Florida History. Orlando Sentinel. August 11, 1991. pp. K1, K4. While at Fort Gardiner Colonel Taylor wrote a letter to Brigadier General Roger Jones in Washington, D.C. titled “Seminole Campaign, Official, Report of the Battle of Okeechobee, on the 25th December 1837” where he detailed his operations prior, during and after the battle, and praised his fallen men. The Battle of Lake Okeechobee led to the promotion of Zachary Taylor and was most likely his first step towards being elected the 12th President of the United States in 1849. Fort Gardiner was abandoned at the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, and most likely burnt to the ground. Rolland, Dean. Time and the River. The Orlando Sentinel.

Class of 1812. #19. Site of Fort Gardiner Today, no remnants of Fort Gardiner exist, but its site is marked with a Florida Board of Parks and Historic Memorials sign at Camp Mack in Lake Wales, Florida. The sign reads, “South of this site, on the banks of the Kissimmee River, stood Fort Gardiner. This Second Seminole War army post was named for Captain George Washington Gardiner who died in the Dade Massacre in 1835. Established December 2, 1837 by Colonel Zachary Taylor on his march to the Battle of Okeechobee. Designated as the Headquarters, First Brigade, Army of South of the Withlocoochee. It was used as a supply depot and in 1838 by the Fourth and Sixth Infantry. Following the Battle of Okeechobee, the wounded were brought to this depot and sent forward to Tampa on January 1, 1838. The original marker designating this site was dedicated in 1968 and replaced in 2020 due to damage.\\" In August 2020, the Historical Marker was relocated from the side of Camp Mack Road after it was damaged to Camp Mack, a Guy Harvey Lodge, Marina & RV Resort. The Marker is now on the Kissimmee River and very close to the actual site of the Fort. The Marker is part of the Camp Mack Heritage Trail which was developed by Camp Mack and the Polk County Historical Commission over a year in 2019/2020.

He also said to have changed his mind about Zwarte Piet. On 25 June, Mark Rutte invited several protesters at the Catshuis to discuss racism and the recent demonstrations. This sparked some criticism, because lead figures of the Dutch antiracist movement, including organisers and spokespeople of organisations such as Black Lives Matter and Kick Out Zwarte Piet, were not invited.

He seems to have been the king who took control of the Dodecaschoenus after the Roman withdrawal in 298. This enabled him to make a personal visit to the temple of Isis at Philae. The second element in the name Yesebokheamani refers to the god Amun. The meaning of Yesebokhe, which stands alone in other inscriptions, is unknown. The sources sometimes place the Amun-element first. There are many variant renderings of the name in English (Yesbokheamani, Yesbekheamani, Yesboẖe-Amni, Amani-Yeshbêhe). Yesebokheamani is known from four Meroitic inscriptions. He raised a sandstone dedication stela in the temple of Apedemak in Meroë with an inscription in cursive Meroitic script. This stela was discovered by John Garstang in 1909, but is now lost. The untranslated inscription appears to be a hymn to Apedemak. Several other cults are mentioned in the inscription, including those of Isis at Philae, Sedeinga and Thebes, those of Horus at Philae and Thebes and that of Amun at Napata. The three other inscriptions are evidence of Yesebokheamani's rule in the Dodecaschoenus. A monumental lion statue was erected at Qasr Ibrim in his honour. It bears an inscription in hieroglyphic Meroitic describing the king as \\"beloved of Amun of Luxor\\". Jack Plumley dated it to between 286 and 306. There are two Meroitic graffiti at Philae, on the north and south walls of the passage between Hadrian's Gate (where pilgrims arrived) and the hypostyle. The graffiti are proskynemata to the goddess Isis and were almost certainly carved when the king was there in person as a means of continuing his presence after he left. This visit probably took place after the Kushite occupation of the Dodecaschoenus, which affected all the land south of Philae and may have left Philae itself in an ambiguous position for a time. There is archaeological evidence for the Kushite fortification of Kalabsha, presumably as a defence against the raiding Blemmyes.

Vigils and protests of thousands of participants have taken part nationwide.  Background  The George Floyd protests sparked a strong response among New Zealanders, in particular among the indigenous Māori people who face structural discrimination similarly to African Americans in the United States. In the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, the police conducted a trial of equipping normally unarmed police officers with firearms. The trial ended in April 2020 without incidents of officers discharging their weapon.  Reactions  Several prominent Māori and other Polynesian figures including Taika Waititi and Parris Goebel expressed solidarity with George Floyd. = Political = Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern has stated that she was \\"horrified\\" by the situation around the killing of George Floyd. Ardern had been criticised by local Black Lives Matter solidarity protesters for remaining silent about Floyd's death for a week. Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand politicians James Shaw and Marama Davidson both stated they believed U.S. President Donald Trump was racist when asked by press gallery journalist about his inflammatory tweets. Todd Muller declined to answer the question. In a letter, Davidson requested that police commissioner Andrew Coster end the testing of armed officers. She also called for Coster to acknowledge New Zealand's challenges with racism and discrimination. On 9 June, Coster announced that the New Zealand Police would be scrapping their armed response teams after public feedback and consultation with community forum groups. However, just a day after Coster announced the Armed Response Teams would be axed, he floated the idea of arming the police with sponge bullets instead. Emilie Rākete, a spokesperson for the Arms Down campaign, responded by saying that sponge bullets are extremely dangerous, and will be used against Māori more than any other group if they are rolled out. On 1 June, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters criticised protesters in Auckland for violating the government's COVID-19 regulations regarding limited social gatherings. Green MP Golriz Ghahraman stated, \\"The disease of state- based discrimination is not constrained to American borders. We must acknowledge that here in New Zealand, at every single step of the justice system, Māori face increased discrimination. This means that Māori experience more arrests, more prosecutions, longer jail sentences, more brutality, and deaths, than Pākehā in similar circumstances.\\" = Civil society = Captain Hamilton's statue drew considerable media attention. On 9 June 2020, the Akaroa-based bar and restaurant \\"Bully Hayes Restaurant\\" announced that it would be changing its name after several historians including Scott Hamilton criticised its namesake William \\"Bully\\" Hayes' involvement in blackbirding in the Pacific during the late 19th century. On 10 June, Marist College in Auckland attracted publicity after teachers reportedly tore down Black Lives Matter posters. Students organised a nine minutes silence for George Floyd and started an online petition to highlight racial issues at the college, alleging that several teachers had been racist towards students. In response, Prime Minister Ardern voiced support for the students' activism. In addition, a formal complaint was lodged against Marist College. On 16 June, 30 students staged a peaceful protest against alleged \\"systematic racism\\" at the college. On 12 June, the North Island city of Hamilton removed a statue of British Captain John Fane Charles Hamilton at the request of local Māori iwi Waikato Tainui. Captain Hamilton was controversial among Māori for his role at the Battle of Gate Pā during the New Zealand Wars. The statue's removal has been linked to calls for the removal of statues of figures associated with colonialism and racism in New Zealand and the world, which had been precipitated by the killing of George Floyd. In response, the Māori Party's co-leader and Te Tai Hauāuru candidate Debbie Ngarewa-Packer called on the Government to establish an inquiry to identify and remove what she regarded as racist monuments, statues and names associated with New Zealand's colonial era. The Marlborough District's Deputy Mayor Nadine Taylor has also called for the renaming of Picton due to his controversial governorship of Trinidad. Calls to remove statues were opposed by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and National Party Member of Parliament Simeon Brown, who described them as a \\"wave of wokeism\\" and \\"erasing history.\\" On 13 June, a statue of Captain James Cook in the North Island town of Gisborne was vandalised with graffiti promoting Black and Māori rights and swastikas. On 15 June, the leasehold upstairs venue to Dunedin's Captain Cook Hotel announced that it would be changing its name in response to both Captain James Cook's controversial legacy among Māori and the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by George Floyd's killing. The building and downstairs restaurant will keep its name. In addition, statues of Queen Victoria and Scottish poet Robert Burns were targeted by protesters in Dunedin in mid-June due to the former's association with British colonialism and the latter's alleged complicity in slavery. On 18 June, it was reported that the Rangitikei District Council had covered up a statue of Captain Cook in Marton pending a decision about its future in response to the public debate around colonial era statues, monuments, and place names. Calls to remove monuments to controversial colonial figures also triggered a call by LifeNet charity director Brendan Malone to remove a monument to Māori chief and Ngāti Toa military leader Te Rauparaha in Ōtaki since had enslaved, tortured, and eaten members of rival Māori tribes. In response, Victoria University of Wellington historian Dr Arini Loader and former Labour Party candidate Shane Te Pou disputed Malone's attempts to draw a moral equivalence with colonial figures such as Captain John Fane Charles Hamilton, arguing that Te Rauparaha had supported a local church and that other iwi including Rauparaha's former victims recognised his historical importance. = Organisations = Arms Down NZ stated that they saw a parallel in the plight of African Americans and the indigenous communities in New Zealand in regards to police brutality and racism.

The Auckland event was organised by several African New Zealanders including Mahlete Tekeste, African-American expatriate Kainee Simone, sportsperson Israel Adesanya, and musician Mazbou Q. Speakers linked the issues faced by African Americans to those faced by Māori and Pacific Islanders in New Zealand. The American flag in front of the consulate general appeared to have been removed prior to the protest. Protesters had signs including \\"Be kind\\", \\"Silence is Betrayal\\", and \\"Do Better, Be Better\\". Participants in this protest were in violation of social distancing protocols in place for the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand which limits gatherings to fewer than 100 people.

It is peculiar to Japan and is an integral part of the urban space formation in the country. The term entails several abstract connotations such as profundity and can be used to describe not only physical but also psychological depth.  Origin  The term oku is both used in Japanese and Chinese languages and share three literal meanings: 1) private, intimate, and deep; 2) exalted and sacred; and, 3) profound and recondite. In Japan, oku is also often used in adjective form. Some of the usage that are relevant to the notion of space includes, oku-dokoro (inner place), oku-sha (inner shrine), oku-yama (mountain recesses), and oku-zashiki (inner room). In traditional Japanese culture, oku emerged as a principle to signify \\"the inner\\" or \\"inward\\". This idea is traced back to the emergence of rice cultivation in Japan and the environmental separation of villages from the environment. This formed part of the belief that the natural landscape has cosmological attachment, including spiritual spaces. In this view, the locations such as mountains and grove of trees are considered realms that are sacred and lofty, hence forbidden. According to Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, \\"for the Japanese, the land is a living entity,\\" and that \\"at the foundation of this idea is a feeling of deep respect for the land based upon its reverence\\". The environment came to be separated through spatial configurations from the Japanese homes and communities, which had relatively high densities since the ancient times.  Concept  As a Japanese concept, oku specifies an idea of spatial configurations, which implies a relative distance or an impression of it at a given space. It is also described as a concept that signifies relative or a sense of distance within a space. It is not limited to this kind of configuration as it also expresses psychological depth and an a priori image scheme when approached from the Kantian perspective. A broad conceptualization described it as an invisible middle point. For example, in the case of a building, the principle of oku seeks to bring what is distant closer so that the interior and exterior are unified. Oku is demonstrated in the architecture of the Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo. It features a steel wall that run along the approach to the museum while the landscaping that dominates the scene does not establish a focus. The principle of oku is often used in constructing homes, buildings and spaces in Japan. According to Maki, oku can be distinguished from the so-called \\"center demarcation\\" to building spaces in Western culture. In addressing the relationship between center and boundary, the latter follows a layout oriented towards the attainment of the climax. Oku, on the other hand, works to embed drama and ritual in the process of the approach itself so that instead of going out of a route, the movement is all about searching or roaming. The feeling is also described as \\"moving into unknown places\\". Oku is often associated with the concept of ma, which corresponds to the notion of \\"in between\\" in Confucian thought. The latter involves the ambiguity of the boundaries while oku is all about the ambiguity of the center. These two principles are said to be used to mediate what is found in nature and what an artist can make of it. Such mediation can be demonstrated in the way a designer turns a living Japanese garden into a vital and cubic enclosure. The principle of oku can also be applied in other fields such as art, literature, and individual behavior. This is seen in the multi- viewpoints of traditional landscape paintings, with each part of the drawing forming a different layer. The simultaneous coexistence of these elements create a complex symbolic spatiality.  Boundaries  Oku or an impression of it is achieved through the creation of multi-layered boundaries that some scholars call spatial creases. These boundaries are built and interrelated with several elements such as topography, roads, and fences, among others. It is suggested that these boundaries are analogous to a wrapping and serves as a structural principle that adds to the value in an analysis of a structure. These creases or layers also demonstrate the other defining characteristic of oku in terms of space - the focus on roaming or searching in the approach. The winding layers both conceal and hint at places where people can gather or rest. For this reason, different types of “denial” are used so that the space creates a sense of curiosity. An example was the kansho or the open space positioned at the center of each urban block within the Edo period Nagoya castle town. These spaces were embedded within the checkerboard layout of Nagoya and served as a place were urban activities took place.

At this time Intel had a new project to develop nonvolatile memory technologies and a new semiconductor chip. After learning about the opportunities to work on these new technologies during the interview, he left AMI for Intel in 1974. While at Intel, he became an expert in semiconductor device physics, circuit design, and semiconductor fabrication processes. His first task, to design and develop an N-channel EPROM different from its predecessor the P-channel EPROM, that would work with the microprocessors Intel was developing at the time. The project known as the 2708, was introduced by Intel in 1975. His invention of the N-channel EPROM was important, as it was the first time a positive voltage and channel injection was used for a nonvolatile memory device, thus requiring significantly lower voltage than its P-channel predecessor. The 2708 was a revolutionary chip, particularly for use with microprocessors. In 1978, Perlegos designed and developed the Intel 2816, an Electrically Erasable PROM (EEPROM) that eliminated the lengthy UV exposure cycle using tunneling to both program and erase the memory. First ever EEROM CELL design utilizing tunneling over a thin oxide = SEEQ Technology = Leaving Intel with other Intel employees in 1981, he founded SEEQ Technology. He developed an improved version of EEPROM. that could be programmed and erased on the system board for the first time. The improved version of EEPROM \\"A 5V-only 16K EEPROM utilizing oxynitride dielectrics\\" could be programmed and erased on the system board for the first time. It used an on-chip charge pump to generate required programming voltages. It was this ability to program and erase at system levels that allowed EEPROM/FLASH devices to be incorporated in all computers, laptops, cellphones etc = ATMEL = In 1984, Perlegos founded Atmel corporation and was CEO of Atmel from 1984 to 2006. The firm created many embedded EEPROM and flash memory devices, was a pioneer in NVM, as well as the world’s first microcontroller with on-chip flash.

Stokes and Alvin Stokes, was a 20th-century African-American civil servant, best known as an investigator for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Background Alvin W. Stokes was born on December 4, 1904, in New York City. Career From 1935 to 1940, Stokers served chief administrative officer and secretary to three Bergen County sheriffs, as well as the first ever black member of the Bergen County Republican Committee. From 1945 to 1954, Stokers served as an investigator for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 1949, Stokes led as first witness into HUAC hearings on \\"Communist Infiltration of Minority Groups.\\" He stated: > In the course of my investigations, I have interviewed hundreds of Negro > leaders in every walk of life. On the basis of these interviews and > committee records, I can report that hardly more than 1,400 Negroes, or one- > tenth of 1 percent of the entire Negro population of the United States, are > members of the Communist Party. This in spite of the fact that they have > been and are the target of constant and relentless Communist propaganda. After praising the efforts of the NAACP and Urban League, Stokes launched into his findings on Paul Robeson. Of particular concern to HUAC (discerned from repeated questions to most witnesses during this set of hearings) was a \\"welcome home rally\\" for Robeson at Rockland Palace in New York City on June 19, 1949, sponsored by the Council on African Affairs (on the 1947 AGLOSO); Stokes had attended the rally. Robeson had just returned from what Stokes describes as a \\"Communist-inspired\\" World Peace Conference in Paris on April 20, 1949. Stokes paraphrase Robeson as saying, \\"It is unthinkable that American Negroes or Negroes anywhere would go to war on behalf of those who have oppressed us for generations, against a country which in one generation has raised our people to the full dignity of mankind.\\" Stokes said that only a quarter of the audience of some 5,000 were African-Americans and claimed that \\"The rest were the usual ragtag and bobtail of the Communist Party.\\" Stokes did not relate the gist of Robeson's speech, though he claimed that \\"Mr. Robeson's voice was the voice of the Kremlin.\\" He then cited a survey of 1,000 citizens in 7 cities that he claimed showed that Robeson was having effect on the American population. When questioned, Stokes admitted that there was no direct link between the Party and race riots in Detroit (apparently referring to the 1943 Detroit race riot). Stokes could not testify whether Robeson was in fact a member of the Communist Party, but another witness in that series of hearings, Manning Johnson, testified that Robeson was a secret Communist. (During those same hearings, Manning Johnson also said of Stokes \\"He talked to us in New York about 2 years ago and convinced me I should take part before this committee.\\") In 1950, Stokes reported to fellow HUAC investigator Louis J. Russell on William Remington (accused by Elizabeth Bentley of Soviet espionage). Once, Stokes entered the dressing room of Lena Horne as part of HUAC investigations into Communist infiltration in Hollywood. Horne told him, how could a Negro work for such an organization as HUAC? In 1968, Stokes served as co-chair on an advisory committee to New Jersey Citizens for Richard M. Nixon during the 1968 United States presidential election. Personal life and death Stokes married Rachel Stokes and had a son, Alvin Williams Stokes Jr. Stokes died age 78 on June 20, 1982, at his home in Westwood, New Jersey.

Prior to the war and during its first term of service, the unit was sometimes known as \\"Cook's Battery\\" after its commanding officer, Capt. Asa M. Cook. During its first term, the battery primarily served garrison duty in Baltimore, Maryland. Almost immediately after mustering out, the unit began preparing for a second term, this time volunteering to serve for three years. The battery was attached to the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac during its second term and took part in some of the largest battles of the war including the Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864.  Service details First term of service= The 1st Massachusetts Battery was one of the Massachusetts militia units which responded to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteer troops to serve a term of 90 days at the start of the war. Due to the fact that these first units were en route to Washington on April 19 (the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord), in Massachusetts these 90 day troops are often known as the \\"Minutemen of '61.\\" The battery was organized for active duty on April 20 though it was not mustered into federal service until May 18 near Baltimore, Maryland. The battery left Massachusetts for Fort Monroe, Virginia on April 21, 1861 and arrived on April 23. From there they moved to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and were quartered there until May 4. They were assigned to garrison a key railroad relay station 15 miles outside of Baltimore in Elkridge, Maryland. Here they were officially mustered into United States service. They later moved to Camp Clare near Baltimore and then were stationed at Monument Square in Baltimore where they served garrison duty until August 2. On that date they were mustered out and returned home to Massachusetts. =Second term of service= The unit re-organized for a second term of service at Camp Cameron in Cambridge, Massachusetts on August 27, 1861. They departed for Washington on October 3 and were attached to Brigadier General William B. Franklin's division, part of the Army of the Potomac until March 1862. This division became part of the newly organized VI Corps in March and the battery remained attached to the First Division until June 1863. At that point they were attached to the Artillery Brigade of the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac with which they remained associated until the end of their service in October 1864. The battery served in the defenses of Washington until March 1862 when they advanced with other units towards Manassas Junction from March 10-15. They were part of Major General Irwin McDowell's advance on Fredericksburg, Virginia from April 4-12. They became part of Maj. Gen. George McClellan's Peninsular Campaign in April. The battery was present for the Siege of Yorktown from April 23 to May 4. They were engaged in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond from June 25 to July 1. The battery remained at Harrison's Landing until August 16 when the Army of the Potomac withdrew from the Virginia Peninsula. They played a role in covering the retreat of the Union Army of Virginia after the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30 and September 1. When Maj. Gen. McClellan pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee's forces into Maryland, the 1st Massachusetts Battery joined the Maryland Campaign. They were engaged at Crampton's Gap on September 14 and the Battle of Antietam on September 16 and 17. The battery was stationed at Downsville, Maryland until October 29. They moved to Falmouth, Virginia with the rest of the Army of the Potomac from October 29 to November 19. They were engaged in the Battle of Fredericksburg from December 11-15. During the winter of 1862 to 1863 they participated in the Mud March, a failed attempt to engage Lee's army in January 1863, and then were stationed at White Oak Church in Virginia until the end of April. During the Chancellorsville Campaign, the battery was engaged at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg on May 3. They took part in operations at Franklin's Crossing from June 5-13. During Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania, the 1st Massachusetts Battery participated in the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2-3, being stationed on Cemetery Hill. After the close of the campaign, the battery encamped at Warrenton, Virginia until September 15 and then Stone House Mountain until October 5. They participated in the Mine Run Campaign from November 26 to December 2 and then encamped at Brandy Station, Virginia until May 1864. At the commencement of Grant's Overland Campaign in May, the battery was not engaged during the Battle of the Wilderness but took part in several of the battles that followed, including the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House from May 8-12, the Battle of North Anna from May 22-26, the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek from May 28-31, and the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 1. They were engaged during the Second Battle of Petersburg and the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg from June 17 to July 9. The battery was pulled back to Washington on July 9 in response to the Confederate advance on the capital and participated in the repulse of Confederate forces during the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 12. In August, the battery was detached to participate in Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's Valley Campaigns of 1864 and were engaged during the Battle of Opequan on September 19 and Battle of Fisher's Hill on September 22. With the expiration of their term of service, the battery traveled to Boston from October 2-12. They were mustered out on October 19, 1864. The unit lost six men killed or mortally wounded and 15 men by disease.

After graduating near the top of his class from Fort Hill High School, Izzett enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1993. After moving to Florida for basic training, Izzett wished to be discharged due to being far from family. Izzett reenlisted with the United States Air Force in February 1994. After admitting he was gay, Izzett was discharged in March 1994 due to the Don't ask, don't tell military policy in effect at the time. Izzett returned home to Maryland and began studying journalism at Frostburg State University. The following year, Izzett departed Cumberland, Maryland for a cross-country road trip in May 1995. Disappearance In May 1995, Skelley contacted the Maryland State Police after receiving a distressing phone call with her son while he was in Santa Monica, California. State Police claimed Izzett left on his own free will and was not missing from Allegany County, Maryland. In October 1995, Skelley received mail of an overdue speeding ticket for Izzett driving a Mazda Miata registered to George \\"Shane\\" Guenther from Buckeye, Arizona on May 22, 1995. Research into the citation led Skelley to contact Guenther's grandmother, Sue Guenther, who witnessed Izzett and Guenther having an argument at the family's farmhouse in McComb, Mississippi, about 100 miles north of New Orleans. Guenther's college roommate, Kyle Barnes, came forward claiming Guenther killed Izzett by shooting him three times and burning the body on the McComb property. After sponsoring numerous unsuccessful archaeological digs at the McComb property in the 1990s, 2016, and 2018, a team was successful in discovering human-like remains at the burn site in 2019, but require lab testing to prove their origin. Media Beginning in May 2020, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation podcast Someone Knows Something focused on the case in its sixth season.

Life and career Cornelis Vels was born in Philippolis in Orange Free State. He made his first-class debut for Orange Free State against the touring MCC in November 1927, aged 60 years and 269 days. He opened the bowling with Shunter Coen and took no wickets for 106 off 21 overs as the MCC scored 579 for 7 on their way to an innings victory. He played once again for Orange Free State a few weeks later in a friendly match against Natal. In a match ruined by rain he bowled five overs, again taking no wickets. In his two matches he batted at number 10 or 11 and made six runs for once out. Vels was 60 years 291 days old when he played his last first-class match. There have been nine older players in first-class cricket. However, only one, Raja Maharaj Singh, who was 72 when he played his only first-class match in 1950, was older on debut. Vels worked as a clerk of the court. He married Agnes Charlotte Mitchell, and they had three daughters and two sons. Their son Maurice played first-class cricket for Orange Free State in the 1930s. The South African writer Verna Vels was Cornelis's great-niece. Cornelis Vels died in Ficksburg, Orange Free State, in 1963, aged 96, and Agnes died in 1967, aged 91.

It was written by Wilbur Knorr (1945–1997), a historian of mathematics, and published in 1986 by Birkhäuser. Dover Publications reprinted it in 1993. Topics The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems studies the three classical problems of circle-squaring, cube-doubling, and angle trisection throughout the history of Greek mathematics, also considering several other problems studied by the Greeks in which a geometric object with certain properties is to be constructed, in many cases through transformations to other construction problems. The study runs from Plato and the story of the Delian oracle to the second century BC, when Archimedes and Apollonius of Perga flourished; Knorr suggests that the decline in Greek geometry after that time represented a shift in interest to other topics in mathematics rather than a decline in mathematics as a whole. Unlike the earlier work on this material by Thomas Heath, Knorr sticks to the source material as it is, reconstructing the motivation and lines of reasoning followed by the Greek mathematicians and their connections to each other, rather than adding justifications for the correctness of the constructions based on modern mathematical techniques. In modern times, the impossibility of solving the three classical problems by straightedge and compass, finally proven in the 19th century, has often been viewed as analogous to the foundational crisis of mathematics of the early 20th century, in which David Hilbert's program of reducing mathematics to a system of axioms and calculational rules struggled against logical inconsistencies in its axiom systems, intuitionist rejection of formalism and dualism, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems showing that no such axiom system could formalize all mathematical truths and remain consistent. However, Knorr argues in The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems that this point of view is anachronistic, and that the Greek mathematicians themselves were more interested in finding and classifying the mathematical tools that could solve these problems than in imposing artificial limitations on themselves and on the philosophical consequences of these limitations. When a geometric construction problem does not admit a compass- and-straightedge solution, then either the constraints on the problem or on the solution techniques can be relaxed, and Knorr argues that the Greeks did both. Constructions described by the book include the solution by Menaechmus of doubling the cube by finding the intersection points of two conic sections, several neusis constructions involving fitting a segment of a given length between two points or curves, and the use of the Quadratrix of Hippias for trisecting angles and squaring circles. Some specific theories on the authorship of Greek mathematics, put forward by the book, include the legitimacy of a letter on square-doubling from Eratosthenes to Ptolemy III Euergetes, a distinction between Socratic-era sophist Hippias and the Hippias who invented the quadratrix, and a similar distinction between Aristaeus the Elder, a mathematician of the time of Euclid, and the Aristaeus who authored a book on solids (mentioned by Pappus of Alexandria), and whom Knorr places at the time of Apollonius. The book is heavily illustrated, and many endnotes provide sources for quotations, additional discussion, and references to related research. Audience and reception The book is written for a general audience, unlike a follow-up work published by Knorr, Textual Studies in Ancient and Medieval Geometry (1989), which is aimed at other experts in the close reading of Greek mathematical texts. Nevertheless, reviewer Alan Stenger calls The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems \\"very specialized and scholarly\\". Reviewer Colin R. Fletcher calls it \\"essential reading\\" for understanding the background and content of the Greek mathematical problem- solving tradition. In its historical scholarship, historian of mathematics Tom Whiteside writes that the book's occasionally speculative nature is justified by its fresh interpretations, well-founded conjectures, and deep knowledge of the subject.

Hill, Los Angeles Fashion Week, 2017 Rhonda Pnina Hill (born in 1956) is an American fashion industry analyst, curator, founder of EDGE (Emerging Designers Get Exposure for fashion designers), editor-in-chief of EDGExpo.com, a fashion intelligence platform, known for her advocacy for women's rights and minority empowerment, and for promoting ecological and sociological integrity throughout the entire fashion industry supply chain. Starting in the late 1970s, pursuing a career in a fashion industry with endemic under-representation of African Americans, Hill rose to, in 1998, becoming the first African-American Vice President of Disney Consumer Products.  Early life and education  Hill was born in 1956 at Craig Air Force Base in Selma, Alabama. Her father was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force and graduate of Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama with Master of Science degrees in Science Education from Tennessee State University, and Business Management from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Her mother was a school teacher and graduate of Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama. They were the first college-educated generation in their families. The Hills chose education and a military life to move away from the oppression they had experienced in the South. Rhonda Hill's first exposure to language occurred while her father was stationed in Tokyo, Japan. Hill's father retired to Glendale, Arizona, where Hill graduated in 1974 from the all-female private high school, Xavier College Preparatory, in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1978, Hill graduated from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.  Career  After graduating, Hill moved to San Francisco to work for Macy's, where she was a fashion buyer. Hill held management positions with experience covering the entire production lifecycle of fashion products, including director at Agron Inc, a licensee for Adidas, manager of product development at Levis Strauss & Co, director at Warner Bros. Studio Stores, and Vice President in Disney Consumer Products. After leaving her corporate positions, Hill founded EDGE (Emerging Designer Get Exposed) a fashion intelligence platform for exposing and mentoring emerging designers who meet certain standards of artistic, cultural, and sustainable practice. EDGE has become an international platform advocating ecological responsibility, design integrity, and human rights throughout the entire product life cycle for fashion products. Exposure of emerging fashion designers is primarily through the website EDGExpo.com which ran a series covering fashion production throughout Africa.  Philosophy and sustainable fashion  A key feature of Hill's work has been the linking of fashion production and design to identity, and our cultural infrastructure. As Hill states, “The power of fashion lies in its ability to transform identity and culture.\\" The art historian and Head of School of Creative and Liberal Arts, Regent's University, London, Gill Stark, in her history of fashion presentation points out that Hill is known for a comprehensive approach, exposing fashion designers working throughout the African diaspora with an emphasis on women's rights, workforce empowerment, preserving traditional methods, responsible development of industry infrastructure by governments, with originality of design and its integration into personal identity. Hill says that cultures need to look at the sustainability and ecological responsibility throughout the entire product lifecycle, including how products are discarded, in addition to upcycling and recycling. = Sustainable fashion = Hill is an advocate of sustainable fashion, for brands taking responsibility for the ecological impacts of clothing. As editor of EDGExpo.com, Hill has emphasized sustainable fashion content with a focus on up-and-coming fashion designers who work with sustainable materials, recycle, and upcycle new products from discarded materials. [3] Hill's EDGE Africa series covers designers making a commitment to sustainable fashion, zero waste fashion, and recycling applications. In the early 1990s, Hill was involved with one of the earliest comprehensive operating standards for responsibility and sustainability throughout the product lifecycle while at Levi Strauss & Co, called their Terms of Engagement (TOE), which has influenced her current advocacy through her EDGE fashion intelligence platform.  Curatorial work  Hill is a proponent of fashion exhibits as a means of exposing fashion as an art within a contemporary and cultural context. Hill states that \\"Like art, fashion embodies the time we live in and society bears witness to the interpretation of its historical and cultural significance.\\" Hill curated the exhibition Blurred Boundaries: Fashion as an Art, that opened on September 21, 2018, at the GraySpace Gallery, Santa Barbara, California, featuring the designers Tingyue Jiang, Alena Kalana, Susan Tancer, and Hera Zhou. Hill claims that fashion is an artistic expression as valid as sculpture and painting.  Personal life  Rhonda P. Hill lives in Portland, Oregon with her husband, visual artist, Erik ReeL.

Amy Cooper's dog was unleashed in the Ramble, an area where leashing is required; she allegedly refused Christian Cooper's request that her dog be leashed. When Christian beckoned the dog toward him with a dog treat, Amy yelled \\"Don't you touch my dog!\\" Christian started recording Amy who was not gentle with her own dog as it hung by its collar in a choking manner and ultimately placed a call to 9-1-1 by the time New York City Police Department officers responded, both parties had left. The incident received wide publicity when a video of part of the incident went viral in the hours following the event. On July 6, 2020, the Manhattan District Attorney announced that Amy Cooper had been charged with filing a false police report, a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to one year in jail. She was arraigned on October 14. The Central Park incident happened the same day as the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. Incident On the morning of May 25, 2020, a woman named Amy Cooper was walking her dog in an area of Central Park known as the Ramble. Comic book writer and editor Christian Cooper, who is not related to Amy Cooper, was birdwatching there, and noticed that Amy's dog was unleashed and running free, despite the requirement that dogs in that part of the park be on-leash according to the Central Park Conservancy, which manages the park under contract with the city. Christian asked Amy to leash her dog, and she allegedly refused. By his own account, Christian then said, \\"Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it,\\" and beckoned the dog toward him with a dog treat. Amy then yelled, \\"Don't you touch my dog!\\" Christian then began recording on his cellphone. Christian Cooper's video begins with Amy Cooper approaching him asking him to stop recording and pointing her finger in his face. He says to her: \\"Please don't come close to me\\". She then says to Christian: \\"I’m calling the cops … I’m gonna tell them there’s an African American man threatening my life.” She then pulls out her phone and begins calling the police and, when connected to the 9-1-1 operator, she tells the operator that \\"There is an African American man—I am in Central Park— he is recording me and threatening myself and my dog. Please send the cops immediately!\\" The video ends with Christian telling her \\"thank you\\", the moment she leashes the dog. Police said that by the time they responded, both individuals had left. The New York Times reported in October 2020 that Amy had made a second 9-1-1 call against Christian, in which she alleged that Christian had tried to assault her. However, the Times later made a correction that the second call was when a 9-1-1 dispatcher called her back. The existence of the second 9-1-1 call was not reported by the media at the time of the incident.  Reaction  Christian Cooper's sister posted the video on her Twitter account, while Christian posted the video to his own Facebook page. The Twitter video alone received over 40 million views. Amy Cooper's actions in the video were widely criticized. She was accused of falsely presenting herself as being in immediate physical danger, conjuring a history of the \\"tendency for people and police to treat black people with suspicion.\\" In the video, Amy was seen dragging her dog, a Cocker Spaniel, by its collar. On May 25, she surrendered the dog to the shelter from which she adopted him two years before. On June 3, after an evaluation by the shelter's veterinarian, the dog was returned to her. After viewing the video that day, Amy's employer, Franklin Templeton, placed her on administrative leave pending an investigation. The following day the company fired her from her job as head of the firm's insurance investment. In a Facebook commentary, television host Trevor Noah said that the confrontation between the two Coopers was an example of how white and black Americans see, and are seen by, the police differently. He said that this event being captured on video meant that viewers could perceive Amy Cooper's actions as deliberate, and verifying the police's unequal treatment of people of different races. The incident brought attention to the possibility that many similar events happened in the U.S. without video proof. = Legislation = In 2018, legislation was first proposed in the New York State Assembly by assemblyman Félix W. Ortiz that would consider falsely reporting criminal incidents against protected groups of people—including race, gender, and religion—to be a hate crime. Violators could face prison time \\"if the motivation for reporting such crime is motivated by a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation\\". The bill was re- introduced in the Assembly by Ortiz with four co-sponsors and in the New York State Senate by Senator Brian Benjamin in May 2020 in the wake of the Central Park incident. It was subsequently supported by Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of a set of other proposals related to police reform for the 2020 New York legislative session, and he signed it into law in June 2020. Legal proceedings During the week of the incident, the New York City Commission on Human Rights launched an investigation of the interaction, and sent a letter to Amy Cooper requesting her cooperation. The commission has the power to fine violators of the law, award financial damages to victims, order training on the New York City Human Rights Law, and order community service. The Central Park Civic Association asked New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to ban Amy Cooper from the park. On July 6, 2020, the Manhattan District Attorney (DA), Cyrus Vance Jr., announced that Amy Cooper had been issued a desk appearance ticket (an order to appear in New York City Criminal Court) and charged with filing a false police report, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of up to one year in jail; lesser sentences could include community service or counseling. She was scheduled for arraignment on October 14. The Manhattan DA said in a statement: \\"We are strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable\\". In a New York Times article published on July 7, 2020, Christian Cooper was quoted as saying that he is not cooperating with the Manhattan DA's investigation, stating that \\"Bringing her more misery just seems like piling on.\\" The following week he expanded on his feelings in a Washington Post op-ed piece, saying he was ambivalent about prosecuting her because \\"I think it’s a mistake to focus on this one individual. The important thing the incident highlights is the long-standing, deep-seated racial bias against us black and brown folk that permeates the United States.\\" In October 2020, during a court appearance for Amy Cooper, the New York County District Attorney's prosecutors revealed there was a second 9-1-1 call made by a 911 dispatcher who called Ms. Cooper back. This court appearance was the first time the existence of the second 9-1-1 call had been made public. Amy Cooper was in court facing charges of filing a false report, which is punishable by up to one year in jail.

It is located in the Zqaq el-Bghal neighbourhood, a short distance south from Tala'a Seghira street.  History  The exact date of the house's construction is unknown, but it was built sometime in the late 17th or early 18th centuries. The house is named after one of its earliest owners, Abd al-Khaliq 'Adiyil. He was a rich merchant who was an amin (provost or magistrate) in Fes under the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672–1727) and then became governor of the city under his son, Sultan Moulay Abdallah (ruled 1729–1734). 'Adiyil was also responsible for the construction of the Funduq al-Najjarin to the east. After he died in 1747 the house became the property of the government and in the 19th century it was used as an office of the state treasury. Coins were struck here for the city and revenues from indirect taxation were collected here before being passed on to the central treasury. At the establishment of the French Protectorate over Morocco in 1912 the house became the regional headquarters of the Service des Arts indigènes (\\"Service/Office of the Native Arts\\"), which oversaw the study and preservation of historic heritage, under the direction of Alfred Bel at the time. Its ground floor also served as the first Museum of Native Arts (Musée d'Arts indigènes), before this role was transferred to Dar Batha (the current historic art museum of Fes) in 1915. The house continued to serve as an office for this agency under its two subsequent directors, Prosper Ricard and Marcel Vicaire. It later became a conservatory of Andalusian music before falling into neglect in the 1980s. The house has recently been restored in cooperation with UNESCO and with funding from the Italian government. Since then it has resumed its function as a music conservatory and in recent years has served as one of the venues for the World Sacred Music Festival of Fes.  Architecture  The house is considered one of the most beautiful and well-preserved examples of domestic architecture in Fes, with architectural similarities to houses of the earlier Saadian and Marinid periods. It has two stories and, like many traditional Moroccan houses, is centered around a main courtyard. It is entered via a bent passage from the street which leads directly to the courtyard. The courtyard, as the centerpiece of the house, is elegantly arranged and richly decorated. At its middle is a fountain and around its sides runs a two-story gallery. The gallery is highlighted with wooden elements and stucco decoration, as well as zellij-decorated wall fountains between some of its pillars. On both the ground floor and the upper floor there are four rooms arranged around the courtyard and accessed from the gallery.

This data and the research using it has been discredited, and two papers Desai co-authored that used this data were retracted after being published in prominent medical journals.  Early life and education Desai was born and raised in the North Shore (Chicago) region of Illinois by Indian parents. He is a graduate of the Stevenson High School (Lincolnshire, Illinois) and took 13 AP classes there. Desai attended the University of Illinois at Chicago and studied biology, graduating at age 19. He then joined the combined MD/PhD program at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. During this time, he completed his PhD degree in anatomy and cell biology, and MD degree by age 27. His doctoral adviser said that Desai claimed to be enrolled at John Marshall Law School, and later described himself as having his J.D., but there is no evidence of this being true. A 2004 publication from his period in Chicago showed signs of data manipulation (numerous duplicated regions in photographs), upon re-examination in June 2020. He graduated in 2006, then matched to Duke University for residency as a general surgeon. In 2008 Desai, still a surgical resident, founded Surgisphere to market medical textbooks, produced by Surgisphere, to medical students. Fake 5-star reviews on Amazon from accounts impersonating actual physicians were found. The Guardian noted that \\"in 2010, his Wikipedia page was flagged for deletion\\" because editors questioned his accomplishments. The New York Times described him as an unreliable physician, and a chief resident from Duke said \\"You couldn't trust what he said. You would verify everything that he did and take everything he did with a grain of salt.\\" Thirteen people interviewed by the New York Times said there were \\"broad concerns inside the surgery department\\" about Desai. He would make improbable claims about patients and wouldn't follow through on their care. Desai received his online MBA in 2012 from Western Governors University in three months. Career and further controversy In 2012, Desai became a fellow in vascular surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He published the Journal of Surgical Radiology, which closed in 2013 despite reportedly having accrued 50,000 subscribers, because he \\"ran out of time.\\" The New York Times described his performance at the Texas hospital as problematic and having \\"antagonized some supervisors\\" to the point that they asked for him to be expelled, but he passed the program. Dr. Hazim Safi, the department chair, said \\"I intervened and he graduated\\", attributing the problems to personality, not skill. From July 2014 to May 2016, Desai was a vascular surgeon at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in charge of surgical simulation as vice chair of research. In February 2020, Desai resigned from Northwest Community Hospital in suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois \\"for family reasons\\"; at least four medical malpractice suits had been filed against him. On June 4, 2020, in response to the fraud found after the scrutiny of Surgisphere, its data, and after Surgisphere's inability to convince critics of their data's integrity, Desai joined his coauthors in retracting a paper from the New England Journal of Medicine. The next day the three coauthors of another paper based on findings from Surgisphere data and published in The Lancet retracted the paper without Desai. Dr. Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, called the paper a fabrication and \\"a monumental fraud\\". Dr. Eric Rubin, editor in chief of NEJM, said \\"We shouldn’t have published this\\". In late July 2020, the New York Times said people \\"described him as a man in a hurry, a former whiz kid willing to cut corners, misrepresent information or embellish his credentials as he pursued his ambitions.\\" The Lancet later revised its peer review procedures citing problems caused by Surgisphere's \\"alleged dataset\\". Subsequently, Elisabeth Bik analyzed one of Desai's early first author papers and found evidence of apparent image manipulation. Personal life Desai is related to his co-author, physician Amit Patel, by marriage.

Pollack previously worked for the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), the Greater Boston Institute, BlueWave Strategies, and Northeastern University before starting her position at MassDOT. Pollack was the first female secretary of transportation in Massachusetts.  Education  In 1982, Pollack received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in Public Policy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She graduated magna cum laude with a Juris Doctorate from Harvard Law School in 1985.  Career  Pollack began work with the Conservation Law Foundation as a sophomore at MIT, doing policy research on coal-fired power plants. Pollack continued to work at the CLF after graduating from Harvard, rising to senior VP and acting president before departing in 2006. She also worked as a senior strategy consultant for groups including the Boston Transportation Department and Massport. When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts negotiated Big Dig mitigation with Pollack and ultimately claimed they could not afford her proposals, Pollack stated \\"They can't just say, 'We're broke.'\\" In 2004 Pollack took a position at Northeastern University as a Senior Research Associate and Senior Director at the Center for Urban and Regional Policy and an adjunct professor for the Northeastern University School of Law. During this time Pollack also served on the board of the Newton Transportation Advisory Committee and the MassDOT Transportation Advisory Committee. In January 2015, Pollack was chosen by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker to lead the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Pollack described her appointment as surprising, given fundamentally different policy views between Baker, a lifelong Republican, and her own liberal views as a Democrat. Pollack received criticism for lapses at MassDOT's Registry of Motor Vehicles that led to a crash that killed seven people in 2019. A year later, Pollack acknowledged responsibility for the scandal and pledged to fix the issues.  Personal life  Pollack met her husband Kenneth Snow while at MIT. She has three children, all of whom are studying engineering. Pollack has lived in Newton, Massachusetts, for over 20 years and is a strong advocate of car free transportation.

She was a missionary among Native Americans and assisted her father, Count Nicolaus Zinzendorf, and her husband, Bishop Johannes Langguth, in their religious activities in Europe and America. She enjoyed music and was an Eldress to girl's choirs beginning at the age of 14 and was a leader in an adult choir after she was married. Early life Countess Henrietta Benigna Justine Zinzendorf, born in Berthelsdorf in Saxony on December 28, 1725, was the daughter of Count Nicolaus Zinzendorf and Countess Erdmuth Dorthea (Reuss) Zinzendorf. She was among the four of twelve children who lived past the age of five. The four children, born between 1725 and 1738, were Benigna, Christian Renatus, Maria Agnes, and Elizabeth. Her parents, Pietist Lutherans, lived in a manor house in Berthelsdorf until Benigna was two years of age. They moved to a parcel of land that her father had provided to the community founded on his land called Herrnhut by religious refugees from Moravia. They were descendants of the original followers of the Protestant Jan Hus. Both of her parents became involved with the Moravians and conducted a number of missionary journeys, sometimes bringing their daughter with them. As a young girl, Zinzendorf was a well-liked and cheerful girl, but she had a delicate constitution after surviving a serious illness. She had a Moravian governess from who she received her education, and became religious due to the influence of her governess and her parents. She was a good singer and played the cittern, a baroque type of guitar. At the age of 14, she was made an Eldress to the Children's Choir (four to twelve years of age) and at nineteen she became the Eldress of the Older Girl's Choir (up to 19 years of age). Her role was to help, advise, and counsel the singers. Authorities in Saxony became aware of the religious activities at Herrnhut, which resulted in a ten-year period of exile (about 1737 to 1747) of Nicolaus Zinzendorf from his land. She went with her father to Holland, and then sailed to America in December 1741. During the trip across the Atlantic Ocean, she helped her father by writing down the hymns that he composed during the journey. They settled in Germantown, Philadelphia, after which she travelled with her father and several others to the Moravian settlement, Forks on the Delaware, which was named Bethlehem on Christmas Eve 1741 by her father. Bethlehem Female Seminary On May 4, 1742, Zinzendorf founded a girl's school, initially at Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but in less than two months it was moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The school, called Bethlehem Female Seminary, was the first boarding school for girls in the British American colonies. The curriculum included writing, reading, household arts, and religion. Originally established to educate 25 students, it ultimately became the Moravian College and Moravian Academy. She established a staff so that she could embark on missionary journeys with her father. Missionary Beginning in July 1742, Zinzendorf journeyed into the wilderness with her father to perform missions with local Native Americans. They were successful in spreading Christianity, with some people becoming preachers. After her marriage, her husband was made Bishop and she traveled with him across the Atlantic in July 1748. She was centered in Bethlehem, while her husband traveled through North America and the West Indies. She went on missions to Native American settlements and assisted her husband while he was in Bethlehem. She also reconnected with the girl's school she founded in Bethlehem. Herrnhaag and Herrnhut Herrnhaag as it looked in 1750. She traveled with her father to England and then Herrnhaag, Germany between January and late April 1743. She was the supervisor and headmistress of the girl's establishment at Herrnhaag, which became her headquarters. In 1744, she attended a Synod meeting of the Brethren at (nearby and sister town) Marienborn. It was one of the few times that Zinzendorf was with her three siblings and parents in the same place, due to missionary work and the ten- year exile from his land. After her marriage, she became a member of the Married People's Choir and assisted her husband in his ministry. Zinzendorf and her husband returned to Herrnhaag in January 1750 after their trip to America. The community had grown to 1,000 people, but due to religious persecution, the community moved within three years to Herrnhut. Marriage and children Her father's secretary, Johannes Langguth, the adopted son of Baron Friedrich von Watteville was arranged to marry Benigna Zinzendorf, by her father, with her and her mother's approval. She appreciated Langguth's devotion and beliefs. Langguth became the Baron von Watteville before their wedding, which was officiated by her father during a Synod meeting in Zeist, Netherlands in 1746. Their first child, Johann Ludwig, was born on March 7, 1752 in Herrnhut. Anna Dorthea Elizabeth was born on April 25, 1754. According to the custom of their religion, the children stayed at the nursery, leaving their parents to continue on with their work for the church. In the meantime, her brother Renatus died in England of tuberculosis and her mother died later on June 19, 1756. Descendants Her six-times great granddaughter, M. Blair Gericke graduated from Moravian College in May 2011 with a bachelor's degree in Nursing. Rt. Rev. M.

In animals, this may involve nocturnality, camouflage, subterranean lifestyle, and mimicry. Generally, plant herbivores are visually oriented.} So a mimicking plant should strongly resemble its host; this can be done through visual and/or textural change. Previous criteria for mimicry include similarity of leaf dimensions, leaf presentation, and intermodal distances between the host and mimicking plant. Australian mistletoe and Boquila trifoliolata are well known examples of this mimicry. Researchers hypothesize that crypsis is used to reduce the likelihood of vertebrate herbivory and thus improve the survivability and fitness of the mimicking plant. Mistletoe Mistletoe, or Viscum album, is an obligate hemi-parasite meaning it attaches to its host tree and extracts water and nutrients. Australia is home to over 90 species of mistletoe, with 70 being native. Studies evaluating the role of crypsis on herbivory measure leaf quality, such as nitrogen and protein levels, water content, etc. Ehleringer et al. examined nitrogen levels, as an indicator of protein status, of mistletoe and their host (Acacia, Cassia, Casuarina, Ceriops, and Eucalyptus) to determine if mimicry reduced herbivory in the plant. One hypothesis tested was mistletoe that show mimicry would have higher nitrogen levels and have a selective advantage through reduced herbivory. A second hypothesis tested was mistletoe that do not demonstrate mimicry would have lower nitrogen levels and appear at a lower nutritional status and have reduced herbivory as a result. Seemingly, the researchers thought that the act of mimicry would increase nitrogen levels and depending on nutritional status and detectability, herbivory would be affected. Previous studies have shown that animals may prefer different food resources depending on their water content, vitamins, carbohydrates and energy needs, and appearance might play into an animal’s perception and preference. Record of Kjeldahl nitrogen in the leaves was taken to measure reduced nitrogen levels in the mistletoe, which would affect amino acids, proteins, etc, and possible preference of herbivores. From their results, Ehleringer et al. found that the majority (17 of 22) of mimetic mistletoe had nitrogen levels that were either equal to or greater than their hosts. However, mistletoe that mimicked the Eucalyptus species had nitrogen levels lower or equal to their hosts. Eucalyptus typically has high oil content which is thought to be an anti-herbivory mechanism. One thought might be that in additional effort to avoid herbivory, having lower nitrogen levels and therefore lower nutrition, mistletoe would be less favorable to herbivores than the host Eucalyptus. Of the non-mimetic mistletoe, 15 of 26 had significantly lower nitrogen levels than their hosts. The lowered nitrogen would reflect lower protein levels and potentially lower nutrition to potential herbivores. Ehleringer et al. can only make predictions about the mechanism of mimicry and herbivory rates as no herbivory was actually studied or measured in mistletoe and host plants. Boquila In their research, Gianoli and Carrasco-Urra demonstrate the effect cryptic mimicry can have on the herbivory of the Boquila trifoliolata. Native to the temperate rainforest of South America, Boquila is a climbing vine. Compared to other cryptic plants, Boquila is unique in its ability to mimic several hosts despite no parasitic relationships. Like others, Gianoli and Carrasco-Urra set out to prove that Boquila mimicry results in protection against herbivory. Boquila leaf traits (such as size, shape, color, orientation) were compared with its native host tree species to try to explain such wide morphological changes. Out of 11 traits, there was significant phenotypic association between 9 traits of the Boquila and host leaves. Leaves of unsupported vines growing on the ground did not differ from those of vines growing on leafless stems or trees; showing that when there is no leaf to mimic, climbing plants do not differ from unsupported plants. It was measured that herbivory remained equal between climbing vines and unsupported hosts. Herbivory was significantly higher in vines growing unsupported than in vines climbing on trees. Lastly, herbivory on vines climbing leafless hosts was higher than in unsupported vines. These results suggest that the act of climbing is not enough to avoid herbivory, but additional mimicry of supported leaves may reduce herbivory rates. An interesting note about the Boquila is that leaf mimicry can occur even when there is no contact between the vine and its host. High phenotypic plasticity allows the Boquila to mimic several hosts simultaneously but it does not explain the mechanism behind its mimicry. Mechanism Currently, there is no known explanation for leaf mimicry. In the Boquila, because mimicry is observed despite lack of physical contact between the vine and its host, hypotheses of plant volatile and horizontal gene transfer have been mentioned. Volatile organic compounds have been shown to elicit defense responses in inter-plant and plant-plant situations. When attacked by herbivores, plants release a blend of volatiles that can initiate response in systemic leaves as well as neighboring plants. It has been observed that volatile signals increased the expression of genes related to plant defense and resulted in change to the transcriptome. In mimicry, response to volatiles could be gene edits in the plant, which could change the expression of certain genes and result in phenotypic change. In the Venus fly trap, stimulation of mechanoreceptors and calcium release trigger jasmonic acid synthesis. Proteins and enzymes have been shown to be involved in transport and perception of volatiles. They could also play a role in the conversion of a volatile signal to a chemical product response e.g. salicylic acid and methyl salicylate. With the mistletoe, a possible line of study could be measuring nitrogen level change after mimicry to see if nitrogen is involved in perception of volatiles or if it changes as a result from perception. Horizontal gene transfer involves movement of genetic material without being passed down to offspring. It plays an important role in the evolution of many organisms. It is hypothesized that transfer is conducted through a vector or is a result of plant-plant parasitism. Little is known about how this method could be involved in plant mimicry but it is mentioned by Gianoli and Carrasco-Urra as an explanation that Boquila mimicry is observed depending on which host the plant is nearest to, despite previous contact. Possible transfer within close distances would explain varying amounts of mimicry seen in Boquila and its hosts. Plant-plant interactions Not much is known about the underlying mechanisms of how the mimicking plants and their hosts are able to communicate, or if they do at all. Kin recognition would be an area to further study as it might reveal more about volatile communication between plants. Heil and Karban note that the use of volatiles can be costly to the emitter which poses the question of competition and cost between the host and mimicker. If the host were to somehow recognize the mimicker as kin, it would offer potential reasoning for the exchange between the two. Similar to a study from Crepy et al. in which they noticed plants that recognized kin shifted their leaf position to benefit kin plants growing nearby. Close phenotypic association was observed and could be explored further. Others have discussed that instead of communication, Boquila and other plants eavesdrop on their hosts. It might be that instead of the mimicking plant solely benefitting, the host plant could also experience reduced herbivory as potential herbivores might mistake the Boquila for the host. This would suggest that the relationship between mimicker and host is not just beneficial to the mimicker. Further research into the plant-plant interactions would need to be done in order to answer these questions.

The cohesion and tension properties of water allow for these water potential changes to be transmitted throughout the plant. Plants respond to external stimuli through Thigmomorphogenesis. For example, bending a shoot can cause arrestment of growth on another area of the plant. These types of nonlocal responses can be induced by long distance signaling. Long distance communication in plants must satisfy two things: First, signaling must occur rapidly to an apical area of the plant; Second, the signal must be perceived at the apical site and be converted to a physiological or thigmorphogenetic response. One form of long distance signaling is through hydraulic pulses from the roots to the shoots of a plant. Tree branches and stems contain microchannels that make up the xylem network and serve to carry water longitudinally. Stimuli like wounding can cause tension and compression of plant tissues, which pinches the cross section of the shoot. Hydraulic signaling begins with a local response like water expulsion, creating a suction in the vascular system. The compression of the cross section will then lead to a general increase of hydraulic pressure in the channels of the shoot. This extensive change in hydraulic pressure will lead to activation of hydraulic sensors.  Water Potential  The driving force of the movement of water is the water potential gradient. The water potential gradient is defined by comparing the potential energy of water to pure water in standard conditions. This water potential gradient must be maintained from the soil through the plant and into the air via transpiration. In the xylem, water is transported throughout the plant following increasing water potential differences. These differences are determined by soil water availability and vapor pressure deficit. If this gradient is flipped the translocation of water will occur in the opposite direction. The water potential is the combination of the pressure potential, the osmotic potential and the gravitational contribution. The translocation of water can be restricted by resistances like stomatal aperture, xylem structure related resistance to flow etc.  Long- distance signaling  In order for plants to respond and adapt to external stimuli, long distance signaling is required. In general terms, long distance signaling is defined as the ability to have a widespread response when just one distinct area is stimulated. In plants, water uptake must be tightly controlled, so long-distance signaling by hydraulic cues coordinate plants above and below-ground organs. The daily physiological behavior of plants is tightly controlled by hydraulic signals. Gradients of water potentials are transferred across the plant through hydraulic signals. If the hydraulic signal originated in the root,, it will result in local water potential changes, and consequently turgor changes. The water potential changes can be due to dry soil, water loss via transpiration or physically wounding the plant. These local water potential changes are then transmitted quickly over long-distances as hydraulic signals. Hydraulic signaling is fast and effective because of the cohesion and tension properties of water. Hydraulic signals can be propagated downward or upward, relaying water potential gradients throughout the entire plant. Hydraulic signals can be sensed in a few ways all relating to how an increase in water potential affects the plants. Because water leaves the cell, there is a reduction in the pressure potential and an increase in solute concentration. This is one way the hydraulic signal can be sensed, through sensing the osmotic environment. Increase in water potential also causes mechanical forces on the cell wall and plasma membrane of the cell. This is the second way to sense hydraulic signaling, by sensing the changes in the mechanical forces on the cell wall.  Experimental methods for studying hydraulic signaling  Linear beam theory = Biomimetic systems can be used to mimic the microchannels inside branches. These synthetic plant systems are made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 3D molded like branches and filled with a silicone oil (with viscosity 1 Pa*s). Channels are connected by a differential pressure sensor. The initial branch is straight and the internal water pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure Pref-P0=0. Hydraulic pulses are then induced by automated linear motor deplacement, creating a bend in the synthetic branches which results in a rise in overpressure (Pref), reaching a value of Pref-P0 or deltaP. Returning back to the initial state of the branch will bring the value of deltaP back to 0. The observation is that overpressure increases quadratically with bending strain. This response changes with variation in beam rigidity. = Nonlinear Poroelastic Coupling = In a nonlinear poroelastic system, elastic tubes begin straight. When bent, elastic strain increases proportionally with the distance from the initial position. This induces a bending elastic energy per unit of volume that is quadratically related to the transverse radius. The system will lower this elastic energy by squeezing its cross section. This transverse compression leads to a decrease in the channel volume creating a global increase in pressure. Therefore, the mechanism of generating hydraulic pressure is due to the coupling of bending and the transverse deformation of the elastic beam. = Hydraulic signaling in natural branches = Louf et al. has conducted research on hydraulic signaling in 3 species: P. sylvestris, Quercus ilex, and P.alba. Their findings can be summarized by these points: Bending of a branch leads to an increase in xylem water pressure. The magnitude of response depends on the species of plant and the environmental conditions. Hydraulic pulses were found to be greater in trees grown outside with stiffer properties, also proving that elasticity plays a role in hydraulic pulses.  Mechanism  The overall pathway of hydraulic signaling in plants is similar to that of a sensory pathway, starting with basic perception of the signal by a sensor, which then converts the hydraulic signal into a chemical signal: abscisic acid or ABA. This conversion to a chemical signal leads to the control of different physiological responses in the plant since ABA is a plant hormone known to mediate many plant developmental processes including organ size, stomatal closure, and dormancy in the plants’ seeds and buds. Hydraulic signals are primarily detected as decreases in water potential, usually caused by increases in solute concentration or drought. This decrease in water potential is systemic and transferred throughout the plant vascular network via the xylem. Water follows down the water potential gradient from parenchyma cells into the xylem, ultimately leading to a decrease in pressure potential and osmotic potential in the adjacent cells to the xylem. The hydraulic sensor, which is yet to be known, resides on the inner membrane of the parenchyma cells and detects the decreases in pressure and solute potential through an unknown mechanism. After detection, the unidentified sensor initiates a signal cascade, leading to a calcium transient and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. These ROS are proposed to go on to target ABA biosynthesis enzymes, leading to synthesis of ABA in the parenchyma and later export to regions of the plant requiring the appropriate responses. In an example, ABA response to a hydraulic signal from the roots- a decrease in water potential- is thought to reach the guard cells to stimulate stomatal closure. Despite an unidentified hydraulic sensor(s) and the mechanism of which this sensor detects decreases in pressure and solute potential in the parenchyma, this primary site of ABA biosynthesis is thought to additionally participate as the main location of hydraulic signal perception, vital to mediation of water potential in the plant.  ABA  Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that plays a significant role in the plants’ response to drought conditions. During drought, its biosynthesis is triggered and controls many physiological responses. ABA triggers root growth at low concentrations and closes stomata to prevent water loss from transpiration. ABA is essential for hydraulic signals because of its response to local water potential changes. ABA is also known to increase hydraulic conductance by increasing aquaporin expression.  Hydraulic Sensors  Although sensor(s) for hydraulic signals are unknown and still being investigated, several sensor candidates have been suggested. One candidate for a hydraulic signal sensor has been MCA1, a plasma membrane protein correlated with mechanosensing via calcium-mediated influx in Arabidopsis thaliana. Research has found that MCA1 increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in response to a mechanosensory input: plasma membrane distortion in Arabidopsis. Another sensor candidate proposed are PERKs, members of the proline-rich receptor kinase family in Arabidopsis as well. PERK4 specifically plays a crucial role in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and response and has shown to be an ABA- and calcium-activated protein kinase. Both MCA1 and PERK4 appear to correlate with cytoplasmic calcium gradients and an early response to hydraulic signals since calcium is known to be involved in plants’ early responses to mechanosensation. Despite research on these sensor candidates, both ABA and calcium gradient participation in early events of hydraulic signaling have made it particularly difficult to distinguish the order of which each part plays in the hydraulic signaling pathway. = MCA1 = MCA1 has been identified as a candidate for a Ca2+ permeable mechanosensitive channel in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of plasma membrane protein MCA1 causes an increase in calcium uptake from the roots, which then causes an increase in free calcium in the cytoplasm. MCA1 expression in yeast mutants lacking a high affinity calcium influx system will also increase calcium uptake. = MCA2 = MCA2 is a paralog of MCA1 that was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. Protein sequencing technology reveals that the two genes are 72.7% identical and 89.4% similar in amino acid sequence, making MCA2 a reasonable gene to use in studies to determine the function of MCA1 in calcium uptake. Reverse transcription PCR analysis indicates that MCA2 is expressed in the plasma membrane in leaves, flowers, roots, and stems. Knockout of the MCA2 gene causes a decrease in calcium uptake in the roots, relative to the wildtype, suggesting that the MCA2 gene is involved in calcium uptake. Using GUS staining, researchers were able to find expressions of MCA1 and MCA2 in the pericycle and endodermis of the root in Arabidopsis. No expression was identified in the cortex or epidermis. Rise in cytosolic calcium levels in the pericycle and endodermis under drought conditions suggest that these cells play a role in calcium signaling. The spatial expression of MCA1 and MCA2 and the changes in calcium concentration in the pericycle and endodermis suggests that both MCA1 and MCA2 play a role in symplastic calcium transport and signaling. = PERK4 = Proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases 4 (PERK4) is a gene expressed in the roots and flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana that localizes in the plasma membrane and plays a role in ABA signaling. Using protein motif analysis, a membrane localization signal, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain were identified in PERK4. To study the role of PERK4 and ABA, mutants were made by inserting T-DNA. PERK4 mutants showed a decrease in ABA sensitivity which affects seedling germination and root tip growth. Mutating PERK4 causes cytosolic free calcium levels to decrease in roots relevant to the wild type. The function of PERK4 has been proposed in early stage ABA signalling to inhibit root elongation by disturbing cytoplasmic calcium gradients.  Ongoing research  Arabidopsis thaliana has been a primary model system in the search for the hydraulic sensor however, has not yet produced a certain answer. Screens for plant mutants affected in hydraulic signaling have been necessary yet, none have been reported so far. Some plant mutants have been distinguished by using the Arabidopsis line pAtH-B6::LUC with lesions upstream of ABA action. Recent years prior to 2013 have shown more hydraulic sensor candidates such as osmosensors and turgor sensors however, research is ongoing as to the specific roles they may play in hydraulic signaling in plants.

He adopted a lifestyle of extreme austerity and vowed celibacy (hence brahmachari) and undertook long periods of fasting. He finally attained Enlightenment in the Himalayas at the age of 90 in 1820. His guru was still alive and 150 years old at that point. After enlightenment, he is said to have traveled all over South Asia and Southeast Asia on foot. Having transcended the narrow boundaries of faith and religion, he visited many holy sites of Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. This included three trips to Mecca and tours of modern-day Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Palestine, and other regions of western Asia and the Middle East. Return to Bengal Baba Lokenath returned to Bengal in 1866 and settled down at Baradi, near Dhaka (present-day Bangladesh), where he built a small thatch out of mud and bamboo using his own hands. This would later grow to be his ashram for the rest of his life. The plot of land was donated by Dengu Karmakar, whom Baba had saved from a conviction in the past. Unlike many other sages and mystics of his times, Baba preferred to keep a low profile and avoided any kind of publicity. Nonetheless, he would help and heal anyone who visited him, irrespective of their caste, creed, or color. His fame inevitably spread far and wide, and the ashram at Baradi slowly started attracting devotees from all over the world. Myths and legends Not much is known about Baba Lokenath's personal life, which has always remained shrouded in mystery. Several folklores exist about his miraculous powers and magical abilities. He is said to have lived until 160 and remains one of the most prominent examples of the human longevity myth. Baba stood taller than 7 feet in height and had a very thin, lanky disposition. Decades of sadhana in the High Himalayas had given him the ability to tolerate extremely cold temperatures without any warm clothing. In his later years, he is also said to have completely given up sleeping and would even not blink. Since he never turned anybody down, he was also known as the Wish tree. Death and legacy Baba went into a samadhi with his eyes wide open on 3 June 1890. He was surrounded by his disciples at his Baradi Ashram. Comforting his mourning devotees shortly before his death, Baba promised to continue being available to anyone who prayed and asked for help, even after his death and forever. One of his famous quotes roughly transliterates as: \\"Whether it is at war, or in the woods, or in water; if you are ever in danger, remember me, and I shall save you.\\" Baba Lokenath continues to be a revered spiritual figure in India and abroad, well more than a century after his death.

Christiano is a molecular geneticist in the field of dermatology. Her research focuses on genes involved in hair and skin growth, as well as treatments for hair loss and skin cancers. She is the Richard and Mildred Rhodebeck Professor of Dermatology and Professor of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.  Education and early career  Christiano attended Nutley High School in Nutley, New Jersey. She attended Douglass College, a women-only residential college within Rutgers University-New Brunswick, earning her Bachelor of Science degree in 1987. She continued her scientific training at Rutgers University, earning her Master of Science in Molecular Pathology and Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics. As a postdoctoral researcher in the Jefferson Medical College Department of Dermatology, Christiano focused on genetic blistering skin diseases.  Research  Christiano established her laboratory at Columbia University in 1996. = Genes driving alopecia areata = Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where a patient's immune cells attack their own hair follicles, causing hair to fall out in clumps. In collaboration with the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF), Christiano and her group were able to compare genomes between patients and healthy control individuals. In 2009, Christiano and her group published the discovery of 139 genetic markers linked to alopecia areata. Although many expected that genes involved in alopecia would also be involved in other inherited hair and skin diseases, they found that genes linked to alopecia were linked to other types of autoimmune diseases instead: type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease.  Potential implications for cancer therapy  In patients with alopecia, one of the genes that are hyperactive is IKZF1, which results in overproduction of immune cells that subsequently attack hair follicles. In contrast, many cancer cells escape detection and elimination by immune cells. Scientists in the Christiano Lab were able to activate IKZF1 in certain cancer types, e.g. melanoma, and suppress tumor growth. = Strategies for growing human hair = In addition to her efforts in understanding the genetics behind alopecia, Christiano is also researching ways to treat it and other types of hair loss. Most therapies focus on stopping or slowing down hair loss, while hair transplantation simply moves one part of the scalp to another. Christiano's goal is to grow human hair in lab settings that could be then transplanted onto human scalp with minimal scarring. Although mouse and rat hair easily grow in lab, the methods do not work as well when growing human hair. In 2013, Christiano and her group adapted the hanging drop cell culture technique to grow human cells that successfully grew human hair when transplanted onto the backs of nude mice. In 2015, Christiano and her group found that a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors promoted hair follicles to enter growth phase. In 2019, Christiano and colleagues developed a \\"hair farm\\", using a 3D-printed scaffold as a microenvironment to grow human skin cells and produce hair.  Honors and awards  *Elected member, National Academy of Sciences (2020) * William Montagna Lectureship from the Society for Investigative Dermatology (2009)  Personal life  Christiano is the first member in her family to attend college and graduate school. Hair has been an integral part of her family, as her grandfather was a barber and her mother was retired hairdresser. In her first year of establishing her lab, Christiano started experiencing hair loss and was diagnosed with alopecia areata. While it was known that alopecia areata is genetic, it was not well understood which genes were involved and how they worked. Christiano decided to use her scientific training to address this gap in knowledge.

History A 1887 project to improve the harbor facilities resulted in the construction of a pair of breakwaters to better enclose the bay, one jutting out from either shore. The eastern of the two was marked by a lantern mounted on an iron post, which was first lit in 1895 and then moved to the end of the breakwater upon its completion in 1902. At the same time the lantern was replaced with a Pintsch gas lamp supplied from a pair of tanks on the breakwater. Four years later, the lamp was replaced with the current tower. It is an iron skeletal tower with the top enclosed to for a watch room, and a typical octagonal lantern on top. The original fog signal was a clockwork-powered bell which was wound by an electric motor; both the motor and the lamp were powered from a powerhouse on shore. An electric siren replaced the bell and the lamp was changed from oil to electricity in 1915; the siren was replaced in turn by the present horn in 1941. The light was discontinued for three years starting in 1947, when the breakwater was being extended; it resumed operation with the same structure and signals in 1950, and remains active today.

Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Climate The ecoregion has a montane tropical rain forest climate. Flora Montane tropical rain forests cover most of the ecoregion. The montane forests generally have a lower canopy than the lowland rain forests. Trees have smaller crowns, smaller glossy green leaves, and lack buttress roots. Common canopy trees include species of Nothofagus, Lithocarpus, Castanopsis, Syzygium, and Ilex, the families Lauraceae, Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae, and various conifers. Nothofagus and the conifer Araucaria can grow in pure and dense stands. Myrtaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, and conifers become more common at higher altitudes. Above 2000 meters elevation, the conifers Dacrycarpus, Podocarpus, Phyllocladus, and Papuacedrus predominate as canopy trees and emergents. Fauna The ecoregion has 51 species of mammals, including marsupials, murid rodents, and bats. There are three endemic mammal species, Scott's tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus scottae), Cyclops long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi), and northern glider (Petaurus abidi).

He is a member of the Social Democratic Party and leader of its Baden-Württemberg state branch since November 2018. He previously served as state Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport from 2013 to 2016. Early life and education Stoch was born in Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1969. After graduating from high school in 1989, he studied law from 1990 to 1995 at the universities in Tübingen and Heidelberg. He was a trainee lawyer at the district court of Ellwangen and attended the administrative college in Speyer. Stoch passed his second state examination in 1997 and worked as an independent lawyer with a focus on civil and commercial law in Heidenheim from 1998. Political career Stoch was district chairman of the Young Socialists (Jusos) from 1987 to 1991, and joined the SPD itself in 1990. He became leader of the Heidenheim SPD association in 1999. On 1 April 2009, Stoch became a member of the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg. He succeeded Wolfgang Staiger, who had resigned, and was given a second mandate for the SPD in the Heidenheim constituency. In the 2011 state election, Stoch was the SPD's candidate for the Heidenheim constituency. He won 29.8% of votes, placing second to the CDU's Bernd Hitzler. He was elected to state parliament via a proportional seat. From 2011 to 2013, he was his party's parliamentary managing director and spokesman for legal and media policy. Stoch was appointed as Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport in 2013 to replace fellow SPD member Gabriele Warminski-Leitheußer, who resigned in early January. Stoch was re-elected to the Landtag in the 2016 state election. However, he won just 19.4% of votes, third behind the Greens' Martin Grath (26.1%) and incumbent CDU deputy Bernd Hitzler (25.1%). The SPD's performance statewide substantially worsened, falling to fourth place, and they did not return to government after the election. Stoch thus resigned from cabinet along with the other SPD ministers. After the election, Stoch became leader of the SPD parliamentary group. After the defection of four members from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) parliamentary group during July to October 2016, the SPD became the third largest group. Since the two largest groups, the Greens and CDU, were in government, the SPD became the largest opposition party. Stoch thus became leader of the opposition, succeeding Jörg Meuthen. On 24 November 2018, Stoch was elected leader of the state branch of the SPD at a party conference, succeeding Leni Breymaier.

A ranking member of the Peruvian Aprista Party, he served in a variety of technical positions in the second presidency of Alan García, most notably as Director of the National Fund for Social Development Cooperation, from 2008 to 2011. A controversial figure associated with Alan García's inner circle in the party leadership, he served as the party's Secretary of Organization and Mobilization in three occasions, most recently from 2010 to 2017. At the 2011 general election, Arana ran for a seat in the Peruvian Congress, but was not elected due to the low share of votes the party received nationally. He remains an influential member of the leadership. Early life and education Born in the Jesús María District of Lima on January 22, 1962, his family moved to the middle to-lower class district of Breña. Upon culminating his high school education at the Peruvian Chinese School \\"Diez de Octubre\\", he was admitted to the National University of Engineering, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil engineering. Simultaneously, he took courses in Business Administration at ESAN University. Career At a very young age, he registered in the Peruvian Aprista Party. He quickly rose up in the ranks of the party as Secretary of Organization in April 1992. He rescinded from the position in October 1994, but was chosen once again in March 1995, serving until 1999. During these years, the party struggled in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's government, underperforming in the 1995 general election and municipal elections of 1996 and 1998. Although he was not ratified in the position in 1999 national convention, he continued to rank in the party as a member of the Executive Committee led by Secretary General, Agustín Mantilla. In Alan García's first administration, Arana was chosen as Governor-General to the Pueblo Libre District in 1986, serving in the position through December 1989. Simultaneously, he served as Deputy Manager of the Drinking Water and Sewerage Service of Lima (SEDAPAL), appointed June 1986. In January 1990, he was appointed director of the Bank of Housing, an agency dependent of the Ministry of Housing. He was not ratified in the position in the newly inaugurated Alberto Fujimori administration in July, resigning in August 1990. He continued managing SEDAPAL until January 1993. Subsequently, he was chosen to serve as Advisor to the Mayor of Ica, from August 1993 to July 1996. In Alan García's second administration, Arana was appointed Head of the \\"Water for All\\" National Program, serving in the position from February 2007 to June 2007. At the same time, he also served as Advisor to the Minister of Housing, from November 2006 to March 2007. Arana's profile would come into question when he was appointed Director of the National Fund for Social Development Cooperation (FONCODES), an agency dependent of the Ministry of Women and Social Development, on August 8, 2008. His appointment remained controversial and received widespread media attention, associating him with Agustín Mantilla's inner circle in his youth. It was revealed that Arana had been appointed Deputy Minister of Construction and Sanitation, lasting in office two days after as it was discovered that he had an administrative process in the Higher Council for State Contracting and Acquisitions (Consucode), because the company Corporación Constructiva SA, legally represented by Arana, presented false documentation to renew the registration as Executor of Works, and thus continue participating in tenders called by the State. At FONCODES, Arana led numerous projects in social development in collaboration with minister Nidia Vílchez. After more than two years in office, he resigned in order to run for Congress with the Peruvian Aprista Party in the Lima constituency at the 2011 general election. He attained a high number of votes, but the party was only able to win 4 seats at national level, preventing him of gaining representation. https://archivo.elcomercio.pe/politica/gobierno/aprista-carlos-arana-renuncio- foncodes-postular-al-congreso-noticia-692068 Before his failed congressional bid, he was considered as a potential party nominee for Mayor of Lima at the 2010 general election, but the metropolitan convention ultimately selected Carlos Roca Cáceres. At the 2010 party national convention, Arana was elected Secretary of Organization and Mobilization for a record-third time, serving at the same time as a member of the Political Commission chaired by former Prime Minister of Peru and congressman, Javier Velásquez. In his seven-year tenure, he participated as one of the main campaign heads for Alan García's 2016 presidential bid with the Popular Alliance ticket. He retired from the party leadership after the 2017 national convention elected his successor, Miguel Rosas, his predecessor at FONCODES.

It operated as WTHT from 1961 to 1964 and WHZN from 1964 to 1965. The station was owned by Lou Adelman and closed due to a strike by union workers amid mounting financial and regulatory troubles. History WTHT signed on October 25, 1961, at 5:45 a.m.; the night before, the new station launched fireworks from its transmitter site off Hilltop Road southeast of town. The station was owned by Adelman through his Radio 13, Inc., and broadcast as a daytime-only station on 1300 kHz. In April 1964, the call letters were changed to WHZN. Under its new designation, strife quickly mounted. In August, an election was ordered to determine if the station would be unionized under the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. Four of the five employees voted in favor; the fifth was absent the day of the election. After staff members David DeCosmo and Robert Pavlick were dismissed by management, on October 12, the four employees voted to strike; the station claimed their affiliation to NABET ineffective and charged the union with unfair practices for waiving its initiation fee. However, it would take another three months for a strike to happen. When it did, after negotiations broke down between the union and owner Adelman at 12:45 p.m. on January 14, 1965, it represented the final end for WHZN. The union strike added to troubles already being faced by Adelman. The Federal Communications Commission set WHZN's license renewal for hearing in November over a series of rule violations relating to logs, operator qualifications, rebroadcast of programs from other radio stations, and violations of the Communications Act of 1934. In early December, Adelman had filed to sell the station for $75,000 to John R. Dorsey, who owned half of FM station WSMD in Waldorf, Maryland. When the commission set a conference prior to the renewal hearing, Adelman told the commission that he was not in a financial condition to proceed. He then surrendered the WHZN license to the FCC in February. The WHZN physical plant was put up for auction that November. It was acquired by Broadcasters 7, Inc., whose president was the publisher of the Standard-Speaker newspaper. That November, Broadcasters 7 applied for a construction permit to reactivate the facility, this time licensed to nearby West Hazleton. The application was placed into comparative hearing with rival bids from Summit Broadcasting and CBM, Inc., in March 1969. The competing applicants merged in 1971; the next year, an FCC administrative law judge recommended denial of the Broadcasters 7 application. The decision, upheld by a review board in 1974, found that Broadcasters 7 had not done enough to specify its station as an outlet for West Hazleton, not for Hazleton, and that the station would not provide the requisite coverage of West Hazleton. While lawyers fought at the FCC, the facilities took damage: equipment was stolen in 1971, and a 1973 fire caused heavy interior damage. The FCC would not issue a construction permit for a new station on the frequency in the Hazleton area until August 1981, when the Radio Action Company, owner of WQEQ (103.1 FM), was awarded a permit. The station went on air as WWKC in 1982.

Chapman was born in Edinburgh in 1847. His parents sailed soon after in the Blundell to Port Chalmers. Chapman's father was the Registrar of the Supreme Court, and Clerk to the Provincial Council. Chapman was one of the first to attend Otago Boys High School, before becoming articled to the law, and established his own practice in 1873. Charles Chapman brought about the establishment of Dunedin's first public library, now the Carnegie Centre. (Photo by Robert Cutts) Chapman ran for the mayoralty in 1888, but was defeated by Hugh Gourley. In 1890, Chapman was elected to the Town Council as the member for Bell Ward. Chapman's father built a terrace of townhouses in Stuart Street in 1881, and donated £1,000 towards a towering memorial to the Reverend Thomas Burns in the Octagon, on which it was said the name of the donor was even more prominent than the name of Burns himself. Although the monument was not completed until 1892, it still made Chapman's election as mayor in 1891 somewhat controversial. Chapman was instrumental in the establishment of Dunedin's first free public library, achieved by writing to Andrew Carnegie in 1901. The library opened in 1908, at 110 Moray Place.

Critics' reviews were mostly positive.  Reception  Variety's Matt Trueman praised Escaped Alone, writing that \\"its juxtaposition of afternoon tea and environmental catastrophe proves particularly potent, not to mention wryly funny.\\" Trueman said of the dialogue between the women, \\"As idle conversation, it’s keenly observed — Churchill’s take on talk for talk’s sake. Susannah Clapp of The Guardian wrote a positive review and stated, \\"This is fantasy intricately wired into current politics. It is intimate and vast.\\" She called the monologues \\"extraordinary\\". Michael Billington wrote in the same newspaper that Mrs Jarrett’s speeches are “less effective as they go along” but praised the garden conversations, praising one exchange as “Churchill at her best, observing with wry compassion how people actually talk”. In The Atlantic, Sophie Gilbert asserted that Escaped Alone \\"is funny, charming, and alarming, encapsulating an impossible amount into its brisk 55-minute running time.\\" Gilbert also said that \\"its sense of female endurance resonates.\\" Cameron Woodhead of The Sydney Morning Herald dubbed the play \\"brilliant\\" despite having reservations about the performance he saw (at the Red Stitch Actors Theatre), and argued, \\"Three layers of dramatic action emerge. Light, avoidant surface chat plays over subjective unravelling and personal armageddon, with a black comic buffet of dystopian possibilities erupting from under them. It makes perfect dramatic sense as a kind of reverse pyramid of repression\\". Jerry Wasserman of Vancouver Sun praised Escaped Alone as a welcome shift from the realism of much of modern theater and wrote that it is \\"filled with provocative ideas and entertaining dialogue\\". Making a comparison of one line to Monty Python, he said the women engage in \\"often very funny conversation\\" and that the work \\"is as rich in implication as its meanings are oblique.\\" Time Out's Andrzej Lukowski lauded the play as a \\"masterpiece\\" in a review of a later Churchill work. Conversely, Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter praised Macdonald's work as director but called the play itself \\"familiar ground for Churchill\\". Writing that the work's \\"sketchy revelations about its protagonists serve little dramatic purpose, and arrive at no clear resolution\\", Dalton described Escaped Alone as \\"a minor late work from a major dramatist\\". In The Arts Desk, Mary Paula Hunter dismissed the play as \\"a strange and unsatisfying mix of whimsy and black humor [...] To be truly effective black humor must have us laughing at something we fear, regret, or at the very least recognize. Churchill’s little backyard gathering of retirees is a bizarre confab disconnected from the prosaic\\".

She has served as leader of the Thuringia branch of The Left since November 2013, and leader of the party's parliamentary group since December 2014. Early life and education Hennig-Wellsow was born Susanne Hennig in Demmin in 1977, then a town in East Germany. Her father did military service in the National People's Army and subsequently worked as a truck driver and police officer. Her mother was a registrar and worked in the Ministry of the Interior from the mid-1990s. Hennig graduated from Erfurt sports high school in 1996. From 1984 to 1999 she was a competitive athlete in speed skating. In 1996 Hennig began studying educational science at the University of Erfurt, which she completed in 2001 as a graduate teacher. Hennig-Wellsow is married, has one child and lives in Erfurt. Political career In 2001, Hennig began working for the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) parliamentary group as a research assistant for education and the media. In the 2004 state election, she was elected to the Landtag on the PDS party list. Hennig became a member of The Left after the PDS merged into the new party in 2007. In the 2009 state election, Hennig was re-elected to the Landtag, this time as member for the Erfurt II constituency; she defeated incumbent CDU deputy Michael Panse to win the seat. In November 2011, Hennig became deputy leader of the Thuringia branch of The Left. At the Left party conference in Suhl held from 16 to 17 November 2013, Hennig was elected leader of the party. She won 76 of 134 delegate votes (56.7%) against two other candidates. Hennig-Wellsow was re-elected in Erfurt II in the 2014 state election, winning 31.0% of votes. After Bodo Ramelow was elected Minister-President in December, Hennig-Wellsow succeeded him as leader of the Left parliamentary group. At a party conference in Gotha in November 2015, Hennig-Wellsow was re-elected as party leader with 75.4% of votes. Her re- election was met with controversy, as it is unusual within The Left for the leadership of both the party and parliamentary group to be held by the same person. An amendment to prevent this practice was proposed but defeated, and Hennig-Wellsow retained both positions. Hennig-Wellsow was re-elected once again in 2017 with 85% of votes. Hennig-Wellsow was re-elected in the 2019 state election with an increased majority of 32.7%. Two weeks later in November, she was re-elected as party leader. Hennig-Wellsow attracted nationwide attention during the February 2020 Thuringian government crisis. After Thomas Kemmerich was elected Minister-President with the support of Alternative for Germany (AfD), the leaders of the state parliamentary groups were invited to congratulate him and present him with a bouquet of flowers. As the leader of the largest group, Hennig-Wellsow was the first in line: however, she refused to shake his hand, instead dropping the bouquet at his feet and walking away in protest. The incident was widely reported nationally and internationally; RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland described it as \\"a moment for the history books\\". In September 2020, Hennig-Wellsow announced her candidacy for co-chair of the federal Left party. This followed the announcement that incumbent Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger would not seek re-election at the party congress in October/November. She also welcomed the candidacy of Janine Wissler, and expressed her hope for the election of an all-female co-leadership.

He was a researcher of pre- Hispanic Peru and one of the protagonists of the Indigenismo movement. He is considered the father of Peruvian anthropology, and his work focused on two fundamental axes: the revaluation of the Inca Empire and the vindication of the Andean culture. He brought awareness to the continuity that links the peasant of the Andes with the man of the Tahuantinsuyu.  Biography  His parents, Domingo L. Valcárcel and Leticia Vizcarra, took him at an early age to the city of Cuzco in 1892, where he lived for the next four decades. He completed his secondary studies at the Seminario de San Antonio Abad, and then went on to the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with a thesis entitled: Kon, Pachacamac and Wiracocha (1912), later as a Doctor (11-21-1912); Bachelor in Political and Administrative Sciences with the thesis titled The Agrarian Question in Cuzco (1913); Bachelor of Jurisprudence, with the thesis De Ayllu al Imperio (1916); and Dr. (1916) as well as becoming a lawyer. In 1909 he participated in the university strike that transformed the university into a more modern, democratic institution concerned with the regional problems of Cuzco, thanks to the appointment of the American Albert Giesecke as rector. He taught beginning in 1917 at the National College of Sciences and Arts of Cusco and at the aforementioned National University. He founded the first Anthropological Museum of Cuzco and the University Archive. He was director of El Comercio of Cuzco and editorial writer for the newspapers El Sol, La Sierra, and El Sur. In 1920, he formed the \\"Resurgence\\" group with students and intellectuals from Cuzco, such as José Uriel García, Luis Felipe Aguilar and the brothers Félix Cosío Medina and José Gabriel Cosío Medina, a group that defended the indigenous people from the injustices they suffered, thus starting the Indigenismo movement that this group later called the \\"Cusqueña School\\", which spread in various areas of culture at the national level. Some of its representatives are for example in literature, José María Arguedas, Ciro Alegría, Enrique López Albújar, in painting, José Sabogal, Julia Codesido, José Camilo Blas, in poetry, Cesar Vallejo, and others. He maintained close relations with the thinker José Carlos Mariátegui, and with the group linked to the magazine Amauta. So also with other intellectuals such as the thinker and politician Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre who directs his 1927 essay \\"The Indian Problem\\" to the group Resurgence. At the beginning of the third decade of the 20th century, he was called to Lima to be appointed Director of the Bolivarian Museum; and soon obtained the same position in the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru. On retirement, in 1964, he was aappointed as Director Emeritus of the National Museums. He played an important role in the four hundredth anniversary of Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos of Lima, where he was in charge of the chairs of: History of the Incas, History of Peruvian Culture, and Introduction to Ethnology. In addition, he was Director-Founder of the Institute of Ethnology, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and Professor Emeritus. He also held a teaching career at Columbia University in New York City.  Jobs and public life  He was Minister of Public Education (from 1945 to 1947, a position which reflected the establishment of peasant school nuclei, a network of rural schools that it integrated education, health and work for children and members of a peasant community. He followed the example of Waynasata de Bolivia (1945).Jorge Basadre: \\"Life and History\\" President of the Institute of Peruvian Studies, of the National Association of Writers and Artists (ANEA), of the Peruvian American Cultural Institute (ICPNA), and of the Inter-American Committee of Folklore; Director of the Peruvian Indian Institute; Member of the Peruvian Executive Committee of Unesco; Vice President of the National Academy of History, and of the Center for Military-Historical Studies.

It dates from the 19th-20th century, and was built for the wealthy and powerful Moqri family.  History  left The Moqri family was a wealthy family of merchant origin which rose to prominence within the royal government as well. In the early 20th century, under the reign of Sultan Abd al-Hafid, the Moqri and Glaoui families became the two most powerful families in the makhzen (royal government) of Morocco. In particular, Muhammad al-Moqri rose to several high offices until he became Grand Vizier. His son, Ahmad el-Moqri, was also appointed governor of Fes. Muhammad was Grand Vizier upon the advent of the French Protectorate in 1912 and kept this post under the formal successors of Abd al-Hafid, throughout the 44-year period of French colonial rule, until right after Moroccan independence in 1956. He died in 1957, at the age of 105.

Regional Council of Tourism - Fez. It is located in a district historically known as al-'Uyun (\\"the Sources\\") and known today as the Ziat or Ziyat neighbourhood, which until the 19th century still had space to build and thus accommodated many new mansions for wealthy families. (The Glaoui family, for example, also had their mansion in the city here.) Another building, known as the \\"Riad Driss Moqri\\", was built further north in the 20th century by Driss Moqri, a brother of Muhammad al-Moqri who was mohtasib in Fes.  Architecture  The palace is considered one of the finest examples of late 19th and early 20th century domestic architecture in Fes. The palace has multiple floors and is built around several inner courtyards, covering around a hectare in total. Its impressive main patio courtyard, surrounded by galleries, is decorated with marble and faience tiles, star-shaped water basins, white marble fountains, zellij tilework, carved stucco, and sculpted wood ceilings. Gardens of Andalusian (Moorish) inspiration are also attached.

It shares with maximum parsimony the aspect of searching for the phylogeny that has the shortest total sum of branch lengths. The theoretical foundations of the minimum evolution (ME) criterion lay in the seminal works of both Kidd and Sgaramella-Zonta and Rzhetsky and Nei . In these frameworks, the molecular sequences from taxa are replaced by a set of measures of their dissimilarity (i.e., the so called \\"evolutionary distances\\") and a fundamental result states that if such distances were unbiased estimates of the true evolutionary distances from taxa (i.e., the distances that one would obtain if all the molecular data from taxa were available), then the true phylogeny of taxa would have an expected length shorter than any other possible phylogeny T compatible with those distances. Relationships and differences with maximum parsimony It is worth noting here a subtle difference between the maximum- parsimony criterion and the ME criterion: while maximum-parsimony is based on an abductive heuristic, i.e., the plausibility of the simplest evolutionary hypothesis of taxa with respect to the more complex ones, the ME criterion is based on Kidd and Sgaramella-Zonta's conjectures that were proven true 22 years later by Rzhetsky and Nei. These mathematical results set the ME criterion free from the Occam's razor principle and confer it a solid theoretical and quantitative basis. Statistical consistency The ME criterion is known to be statistically consistent whenever the branch lengths are estimated via the Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) or via linear programming. However, as observed in Rzhetsky & Nei's article , the phylogeny having the minimum length under the OLS branch length estimation model may be characterized, in some circumstance, by negative branch lengths, which unfortunately are empty of biological meaning. To solve this drawback, Pauplin proposed to replace OLS with a new particular branch length estimation model, known as Balanced Minimum Evolution (BME). Richard Desper and Olivier Gascuel showed that the BME branch length estimation model ensures the general statistical consistency of the minimum length phylogeny as well as the non- negativity of its branch lengths, whenever the estimated evolutionary distances from taxa satisfy the triangle inequality. Le Sy Vinh and Arndt von Haeseler have shown, by means of massive and systematic simulation experiments, that the accuracy of the ME criterion under the BME branch length estimation model is by far the highest in distance methods and not inferior to those of alternative criteria based e.g., on Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference. Moreover, as shown by Daniele Catanzaro, Martin Frohn and Raffaele Pesenti, the minimum length phylogeny under the BME branch length estimation model can be interpreted as the (Pareto optimal) consensus tree between concurrent minimum entropy processes encoded by a forest of n phylogenies rooted on the n analyzed taxa. This particular information theory-based interpretation is conjectured to be shared by all distance methods in phylogenetics. Algorithmic aspects The search for the shortest length phylogeny is generally carried out by means of exact approaches, such as those described in as well as heuristics such as the neighbor-joining algorithm, FASTME, or other metaheuristics  See also  * Least squares inference in phylogeny * Occam's razor  References Further reading * Category:Phylogenetics Category:Computational phylogenetics ","title":"Minimum evolution"},{"id":"64189067","text":"Robert John Bartlett (1879 - 1980) was a British psychologist.

She has won two literary awards: in 2016 for Amondeu (아몬드 Almond) and in 2017 for Seoreunui bangyeok (서른의 반격 Counterattack of the Thirty). Sohn’s novels explore the meaning of human existence and growth, and are characterized by the use of unique characters and rapid plot development.  Life  She was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1979 as the second daughter of Sohn Hak-kyu, a Korean politician. Sohn Won-pyung’s father is South Korean politician Sohn Hak-kyu. He had been involved in student and labor movements before entering politics in 1993. When she submitted her work for a film festival, there was a newspaper article that mentioned in its title that she is the second daughter of Sohn Hak-kyu. Her elder sister, Sohn Won-jeong, directs plays. * * In college, she majored in both sociology and philosophy. Sohn believes that structured thinking skills she acquired from learning sociology and the concept of individuality she learned as a student of philosophy have been conducive to her novel writing. Notably, she has been actively engaged in both film making and novel writing. She says that because the two genres are unique in their expressive realms and because she is attracted to both collaborative and personal creative processes, she will continue to pursue her career in both fields.  Films  Although Sohn had dreamed of becoming a professional novelist since she was in elementary school, her debut in the film industry preceded her literary debut. In 2001, she won a Film Criticism Award (영화평론상) from the film magazine Cine 21. Later she attended the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA) and majored in film directing. Established in 1984, the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA) is a specialized film education institution. Here, students learn about all aspects of film through an intensive curriculum and then produce 4 films per year to gain practical experience. These films have been shown in international film festivals. The school has graduated over 700 movie talent. * * After graduation, she directed a number of short films, winning several awards and critical acclaim for Inganjeogeuro jeongi an ganeun ingan (인간적으로 정이 안 가는 인간 Ooh, You Make Me Sick) (2005).; Furthermore, she won a Best Scenario Synopsis Award (시나리오 시놉시스 부문상) at the 2006 SF Creative Writing Contest (과학기술 창작문예 공모전) for Sunganeul mideoyo (순간을 믿어요 I Believe in the Moment). Author Sohn Won-pyung’s first feature film Daughter (tentative title) is currently being filmed. It is a mystery thriller movie where a sister returns home after gone missing for 25 year and her elder brother and other family members treat their now unfamiliar sister with suspicion. * *  Novels  Since her college years, she had repeatedly applied for numerous literary awards, using more than 30 pen names, but had not been successful. In 2013, she gave birth to a baby and began writing a small amount of words whenever she had time to spare. Sohn recalls that during this period she wrote much more than expected. It was during this period of her life that she had her belated literary debut as a novelist by winning a Changbi Prize for Young Adult Fiction (2016) for Almond. The translation rights for Almond were sold to 13 different language regions in 12 countries around the globe, an extremely rare case for a novice writer’s work. The following year, she won a Jeju 4.3 Peace Literary Prize (제주 4.3 평화문학상) for Seoreunui bangyeok. Sohn says that since the news of her first award winning had given her ten years’ worth of happiness, the news of her second award winning did not excite her very much. As a novelist, she hopes to create a number of works. In particular, she is planning to write an epic novel depicting the history of four generations of daughters. * *  Writing  Sohn Won-pyung’s novels and scenarios pinpoint critical social issues .  Such characteristic of her works is related to Sohn’s unique way of creating literary and cinematic works, where she determines a subject matter first before creating characters suitable for the subject. Almond Almond (2016) is Sohn’s debut novel and representative work. It was critically acclaimed as a great coming-of-age novel and an outstanding young adult fiction stylized in a uniquely Korean fashion.Young adult fiction is a literary term used in English-speaking cultures to describe literature targeted to teenagers. Often in this genre, a teenager main character experiences life in their imaginary world beyond reality and comes of age by overcoming emotional trauma and a sense of deprivation. * The lead character Yun-jae suffers from alexithymia, a subclinical inability to identify and describe emotions, as he has a relatively small amygdala, whose etymological meaning is “almond.” On the other hand, his friend Goni is a boy who cannot control his emotions and bursts out his anger. Ironically, it was Yun-jae, the emotionally disabled boy who is unable to feel any fear, who gave solace to the emotionally hurt problem child Goni. Through a character who cannot feel any emotions and therefore is curious about the behavior of the Other, the author stresses that true compassion requires special efforts. Seoreunui bangyeok Seoreunui bangyeok (2017) is a novel about the concerns and a sense of loss felt by younger generations who want to become proper adults. In the novel, the short sentence “The main character Kim Ji-hye was born in 1988.” reminds us of the special meaning the year 1988 has in Korean society and of the common name “Ji-hye” that was popular at the time. The year 1988 was when the prolonged military dictatorship had finally come to an end and when the social expectations and hope for the realization of democracy ended up having a halfway success (or failure). Numerous “Ji-hyes” who were born at the time have now grown to become members of the so-called “880,000 Won Generation.”, The 880,000 Won Generation metaphorically refers to Korean youth in their twenties who, even after graduating from college, have to work as irregular workers and live in fear about uncertain future. The term is similar to Japan’s Bubble Generation, Europe’s 1,000 Euro Generation, and America’s Generation Broke. * and their only dream is to become “ordinary.” In the novel, Ji-hye, Gyu-ok, Mu-in and Nam-eun, all are friends of the same age, attempt their own counterattack against their unfair society. However, their revenge is mere practical jokes or acts of play, such as throwing a raw egg toward an immoral member of the National Assembly and sending a mocking letter to the rude General Manager Kim who is always farting and burping. Even though such pranks do not have the power to overthrow society, they can make a small crack in their unfair daily environment. In this way, instead of giving up and accepting their realities, they manifest their rejection of the irrationality through blithe acts of resistance that continue in small ways. Saworui nun Saworui nun (사월의 눈 April Snow) (2018) deals with the “moment of compassion” between someone who suffers and someone who tries to understand the suffering of the Other. In this novel, a couple distressed by their baby’s stillbirth meets Mari who belongs to a different nationality, race, and generation from this couple. The reason for Mari’s own suffering is unknown, but she nevertheless deeply empathizes with them and gives consolation. Their conversation is a completely unexpected event—like a blizzard in April. However, without exception, it provides all those who are suffering with “lonesome yet affectionate solace.”  Works  《아몬드》, 창비, 2017 / Almond (Almond), Changbi, 2017 《서른의 반격》, 은행나무, 2017 / Seoreunui bangyeok (Counterattack of the Thirty), EunHaengNaMu, 2017  Works in Translation  《4월의 눈》 k-픽션 21, 도서출판 아시아, 2018 / April Snow K-Fiction Series 21, ASIA, 2018  Awards  Changbi Prize for Young Adult Fiction (2016) for Almond Jeju 4.3 Peace Literary Prize (제주 4.3 평화문학상, 2016) for Seoreunui bangyeok  References  Category:1979 births Category:South Korean novelists Category:Living people ","title":"Sohn Won-pyung"},{"id":"64189172","text":"Thomas Shelburne Ferguson (born December 14, 1929) is an American mathematician and statistician.

After early appearances in Dublin, he appeared in London at Drury Lane and Covent Garden, and in Edinburgh, where as actor-manager he built a theatre. Early life and career Ross, born in London, was the son of a Writer to The Signet in Edinburgh, who settled in London in 1722 as a solicitor of appeals. He was educated at Westminster School, and some indiscretion committed there when he was thirteen years old lost him the affection, never regained, of his father, who, in his will, left instructions to Elizabeth Ross to pay her brother annually, on his birthday, the sum of one shilling \\"to put him in mind of his misfortune he had to be born\\". Ross appealed against this will in 1769, and, after carrying the case to the House of Lords, obtained nearly £6,000. How he lived after his father's abandonment is not known. He played Clerimont in Henry Fielding's The Miser at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in May 1749, and remained there for two more seasons. Engaged with Henry Mossop by David Garrick, he made his first appearance at Drury Lane in London in October 1751 as Young Bevil in The Conscious Lovers, by Richard Steele. The part suited him: \\"His person was pleasing, and his address easy, his manner of speaking natural, his action well adapted to the gravity as well as grace of the character. He was approved by a polite and distinguishing audience, who seemed to congratulate themselves on seeing an actor whom they imagined capable of restoring to the stage the long-lost character of the real fine gentleman\\". (Thomas Davies, Life of Garrick, i. 195, ed. 1808). He sprang into immediate favour, and is said, with Mossop, to have inspired some jealousy in Garrick.In 1753 he appeared in the title role of Thomas Southerne's play Oroonoko. In February 1754 he was the original Icilius in Samuel Crisp's Virginia. On 3 Oct. 1757 he made, in his favourite character of Essex in Henry Jones's The Earl of Essex, his first appearance at Covent Garden. He remained here until 1767, playing leading parts in tragedy and comedy. Few original parts were assigned to him at Covent Garden. The principal were Sifroy in Robert Dodsley's Cleone in December 1758, Lord Belmont in The Double Mistake by Elizabeth Griffith in January 1766, and Don Henriquez in Thomas Hull's The Perplexities in January 1767. Edinburgh Theatre Royal, Edinburgh At the end of the season of 1766–7 he left Covent Garden for Edinburgh. In 1767, after popular tumult and violent opposition, a patent was obtained for a patent theatre in the city. Ross solicited the post of patentee and manager, and, although he was personally unknown in Edinburgh, the theatre was made over to him in the autumn of 1767. He is said to have paid a rental of £400 a year. A strong and influential opposition to Ross as \\"an improper person\\" originated, and led to a paper warfare. He nevertheless opened the \\"old\\" theatre in the Canongate on 9 December 1767, playing Essex in The Earl of Essex, which is noteworthy as being the first play legally performed in Scotland. Two years later, on 9 December 1769, he opened, with The Conscious Lovers, a new theatre at Edinburgh, the Theatre Royal. He had succeeded, in spite of innumerable difficulties, in raising the building by subscription, but seems to have had inadequate capital to work it. At the close of a disastrous season he let it to Samuel Foote, and returned to London. Return to London In October 1770 Ross reappeared at Covent Garden as Essex, this being announced as his first appearance for four years, and resumed at once his old characters. After a season or two, during which he was seen as Sciolto and Alcanor in Voltaire's Mahomet, his name became infrequent on the bill. After the season of 1777–8 he had the misfortune to break his leg, and he did not reappear on the stage. He was for some years in extreme poverty. An unknown friend, subsequently discovered to be Admiral Samuel Barrington, made him an annual present of £60, which was continued until his death. He died in London on 14 September 1790, and was buried three days later in St James's Church, Piccadilly, James Boswell being chief mourner. He is said, at the instance of Lord Spencer, to have married, with an allowance of £200 a year, the courtesan Fanny Murray, who \\"had been debauched\\" by Lord Spencer's father. Commentary John Joseph Knight wrote: \\"He was a good actor, his great success being 'in tragic characters of the mixed passions'. He was, in his youth, a fashionable exponent of lovers in genteel comedy, but forfeited those characters through indolence and love of pleasure.... He was said to be the last pupil of Quin, whose Falstaffian qualities he perpetuated.... His extravagance kept him in constant trouble. He was a good story-teller and boon companion, and made many influential friends in Scotland and in England.\\" References Attribution * Category:1728 births Category:1790 deaths Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:18th-century English male actors Category:18th-century British male actors Category:Actor- managers ","title":"David Ross (actor born 1728)"},{"id":"64189362","text":"The 1904 Colorado gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 1904.

Poe is an American neuroscientist specializing in the study of sleep and its effect on memory and learning. Her findings have shown that the absence of noradrenaline and low levels of serotonin during sleep spindles allow the brain to form new memories during REM, as well as restructure old memory circuits to allow for more learning during later waking periods. She currently works as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  Early life and education  Poe grew up in southern California and received her undergraduate degree in Human Biology at Stanford University. After graduating in 1987, Poe spent two years at the Department of Veterans Affairs studying the brain waves of pilots during high-G maneuvers. Poe began working on her PhD in neuroscience at UCLA under the guidance of Ronald Harper. Her thesis concerned the neural mechanisms underlying sleep state in cats. Poe completed her graduate training in 1995. She then pursued her postdoctoral work at the University of Arizona (UA), under the mentorship of Carol Barnes. Studying the importance of sleep in memory consolidation through recording the firing of neurons during familiar experiences, novel experiences, and during sleep, she concluded that circuits encoding recent memories are likely restructured during REM sleep to selectively strengthen new memories and weaken older ones. She also helped pioneer novel approaches to recording brain activity using coherent fiber optic imaging systems. At UA, Poe collaborated with Bruce McNaughton and Jim Knierim to research the effects of weightlessness in space on hippocampal maps of the environment. In 1998, they recorded ensembles of place cells in rats using multielectrode arrays and assessed whether weightlessness disrupted the ability of place cells to create cortical maps.  Career and research  In 1998, Poe was recruited to Washington State University, joining the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Veterinary and Comparative Anatomy and an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology. In 2001, Poe was recruited to the University of Michigan Anesthesiology Department. She became an Assistant Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, as well as an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology. While at the University of Michigan, Poe taught both graduate and undergraduate courses and served on the Sleep Research Society’s Board of Directors. In 2016, Poe returned to UCLA to become a Full Professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology. Poe is the principal investigator of the Poe Lab, and her research program has been focused on exploring the mechanisms by which the neural mechanisms of sleep support learning and memory. They research how neural patterns underlying learning are reactivated during sleep, to determine how sleep influences the encoding of memories. Her work has shown that sleep is critical for the synaptic-weakening component of memory consolidation, in which memories of lower importance are pruned. Her lab currently researches the importance of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the memory effects of diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and post traumatic stress disorder). = Study of sleep and memory consolidation = In 2005, Poe found that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is important for complex associative learning in rats. After depriving rats of REM sleep for four hours, their improvement at a given task was delayed. Poe then examined the biological underpinnings of the observed theta peaks and troughs during REM sleep. She found that a shift in theta rhythms might occur due to potentiation of distal dendritic synapses and depotentiation of proximal dendritic synapses over learning. Continuing to research the effects of decreased REM sleep on memory and cognitive performance, Poe assessed how rats' performance in water mazes was affected when non-REM sleep was left intact, but REM sleep was disrupted. They found that REM sleep is not essential for spatial learning, and that when REM sleep was disrupted during initial learning, reversal learning—the ability to disregard old information due to a change in the maze—was enhanced. This suggests that REM may help consolidate incompletely learned items. Since it is known that antidepressants affect learning and memory, and also inhibit REM sleep, Poe and her colleagues researched the biological underpinnings of how antidepressant-caused inhibition of REM sleep impacts maze learning in rats. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, an effect of SNRIs (a class of antidepressant), reduced the length of the transition to REM sleep. This led to worsened re-consolidation of maze memory, as well as an impairment of novel maze learning. Overall, their findings suggested a new model for the purpose of each phase of REM sleep: re-consolidation occurs during REM, novel information is incorporated and consolidated during the transition to REM, and procedural learning is augmented during slow-wave sleep. During her PhD studies at UCLA, Poe and her colleagues were the first to measure the reflective properties of subcortical neurons in freely moving animals using fiber optic probes, which can be used as an indirect measurement of neural activity with high temporal resolution. Using this tool, they measured the activity of the hippocampus during sleep and wake states in cats. They found that the dorsal hippocampus increased activity during REM sleep, whereas neocortical brain regions decreased their activity. = Advocacy = Poe serves as the Director of Diversity in Outreach and Education Programs at UCLA.

He held the WBC light-flyweight title from 1990 to 1991 and challenged for the IBF super-flyweight title in 1993. Professional boxing career Pascua debuted as a professional boxer on August 3, 1986, outpointing Eddie Dulay after four rounds in Pasay City. Pascua built a record of 14 wins without a loss, with 3 wins by knockout, before facing 18 wins, 1 loss Jum Hwan Choi at Choi's hometown of Seoul, South Korea on January 28, 1988. Despite dropping the local in round six, Pascua lost a ten round split decision to lose his condition as an undefeated fighter. Pascua followed that first defeat with three wins in a row, over Triffon Torralba, Romy Austria and Jun Altarejos but then was surprisingly beaten by 0-1 Paul Badilla and by Rolando Protacio; these losses were both on points as Pascua lost to Badilla by ten round unanimous decision and to Protacio by eight rounds unanimous decision. Pascua then won two in a row, against Roger de Rama by ten round majority decision and Joseph Pacling by third round technical knockout before facing world ranked Rey Paciones, who was 22-2-3 (3 ties) with 5 knockouts coming into their bout. On August 19, 1989, Paciones defeated Pascua by ten rounds unanimous decision at Tagum City. Pascua won 5 of his next six bouts, the exception being a loss by ten round unanimous decision at the hands of Napa Kiatwanchai, to become ranked by the WBC. He was matched to challenge WBC world champion Humberto Gonzalez on December 19, 1990 at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California, United States in what also constituted Pascua's first professional bout in the United States. Gonzalez was undefeated and untied in 30 bouts and was being considered for an unification super fight with the equally undefeated International Boxing Federation world champion Michael Carbajal, but Pascua, who only had 8 knockout wins among his 24 victories in 29 fights and was not considered a very hard puncher, caused an upset when he dethroned the world champion by a stirring, sixth round knockout to win the WBC light-flyweight title. For his first defense, Pascua returned to the Great Western Forum, this time to meet Melchor Cob Castro, who with 30 wins, 2 losses and 4 draws was challenging for a world title for the first time and beat Pascua by tenth round technical knockout on March 25, 1991. After losing to Cob Castro, Pascua's career followed a pattern of highs and lows. He won six in a row right after that defeat, but then was defeated by undefeated (26-0) Yoon-Un Jin on October 23, 1992 at Seoul. Pascua again recuperated by putting another modest winning streak, reaching three wins in a row, which included avenging his early loss to Rey Paciones by 12th round technical knockout on February 20, 1993 to win the Philippine Games and Amusement Board's national super-flyweight title. Pascua then challenged Chatchai Sasakul for the WBC's international flyweight title but lost by unanimous 12 rounds decision at Bangkok on April 28, 1993, but he followed that loss with a win over Dodie Boy Penalosa, a former world champion, by 10 round unanimous decision at the Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay City on July 17. After a fight in Japan in which Pascua defeated Hiroshi Kobayashi (an 8 wins, 8 losses and 1 tie boxer not to be confused with an earlier world champion boxer of the same name) by ten rounds unanimous decision on October 15, 1993 in Morioka, Pascua was once again ranked world wide, this time by the IBF, and allowed to challenge for a world title, this time the IBF super-flyweight title which at the time was held by Mexican Julio Cesar Borboa, 20 wins and 4 losses coming into their fight. Pascua-Borboa, fought on November 26, 1993 at the Coliseo in Hermosillo, Mexico was a war; Pascua almost became a two time world champion when he dropped the Mexican boxer in round two but lost the fight when the champion dropped him and knocked him out in the fifth. Pascua then lost 15 of his next 24 fights, including defeats at the hands of Samson Dutch Boy Gym, Gerry Penalosa (who thus avenged his brother Dodie's earlier loss to Pascua), Raffy Montalban in defense of Pascua's PGAB's national super- flyweight title, and Johnny Bredahl in a challenge for the minority recognized, International Boxing Organization bantamweight title (a first round knockout loss) on March 29, 1996 at the Brondby Halle in Brondby, Denmark. Pascua was also defeated by Veerapol Sahaprom. Pascua's final fight as a professional came against 7-2 Mapichit Utaiawee, a boxer Pascua had previously defeated, but on September 12, 1999, Utaiawee outpointed Pascua over twelve rounds, causing Pascua to retire afterward and never return to professional boxing. Professional boxing record Rolando Pascua compiled a record of 45 wins and 25 losses in 70 professional boxing fights, with 17 wins and 12 losses by knockout.

He is honored in the bivalve name Pitar frizzelli Hertlein & Strong, 1948.  Early life and education  Don L. Frizzell was born on 19 October 1906 in Bellingham, Washington. He attended grade school in White Bird, Idaho. In 1926, Frizzell entered the University of Washington in Seattle where he received master’s degree in zoology under the direction of Professor Kincaid. During 1930-1931, he published three papers in Nautilus and one more paper on the new molluscan species. In summer 1931, Frizzell worked as a junior paleontologist with the Northwest Experiment Station, U.S. Bureau of Mines in Seattle. In autumn 1931, Frizzell started a five-year doctorate in paleontology at Stanford University. Pursuing graduate school, he received several fellowships such as Jacob Fellow in 1931-1932, Scholar in 1933-1934, and Jordan Fellow in 1934.  Career  After graduating from Stanford in 1936, Frizzell started working for Shell Oil Company as a micropaleontologist. However, he did not consider this job very promising and left it a year later. In 1937, he joined the International Petroleum Corporation spending next 7 years working in the oil field of Peru and Ecuador. On 29 August 1938, Frizzell married an American arachnologist Harriet Exline Lloyd in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 1939, Frizzell was in M. Smith’s 2nd International Directory of Malacologists in Negritos, Peru, and in 1943, M. Smith’s International Directory of Malacologists in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In January 1945, Frizzell accepted an offer to work as an associate professor in geology department at the University of Texas in Austin. In 1946-1948, he spent summers working as a geologist for the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology in Austin. In 1948, Frizzell moved to Rolla and started working in the Department of Geology at the University of Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy. At the University of Missouri Frizzell taught micropaleontology, paleontology, petroleum geology, and later also stratigraphic paleontology. Having completed work on Foraminitera Frizzell opened new avenues of study in the area of holothurian sclerities. Monograph of fossil holothurian sclerites, written jointly with his wife Harriet Exline, was published in 1955. In 1959, Frizzell was awarded a National Science Foundation grant for a two-year (1959 to 1961) study of “Recent otoliths and the Eocene-Oligocene otoliths of the Gulf Coast”. Frizzell kept teaching activities until September 1972. He died at Jefferson City, Missouri, in Still Hospital on 17 October 1972.

It was written in 1981 and was awarded the Guinness Prize for composition that year.  Background  Night Dances was composed in 1981 and was the first piece to grant Turnage notoriety among composers and musicians. Even though he was strongly influenced by his teacher, Oliver Knussen, at the Royal College of Music, Turnage tried to \\"evoke feelings and emotions\\" after first coming in contact with Black music and, especially, Miles Davis's music. The piece was premiered on February 1, 1982 at St John's, Smith Square by the London Sinfonietta conducted by Simon Bainbridge. It was published in 1987 by Schott.  Structure  This suite for orchestra is divided into four movements and takes around 14 minutes to perform. The scoring can be divided into three groups: first, a full orchestra (two flutes, two piccolos, two clarinets in B-flat, a bassoon, two horns, a trumpet in C, a large percussion section consisting of a xylophone, a glockenspiel, a side drum, a woodblock, a tambourine, four tom-toms, claves, two suspended cymbals, a hi-hat, two large tam-tams and two very large tam- tam, and a string section consisting of twelve first violins, twelve second violins, eight violas, eight cellos, and four double basses); then, an amplified solo group consisting of an oboe, a cor anglais, a trumpet in B-flat, a harp, a celesta, and a piano; finally, an off-stage string quintet consisting of two violins, a viola, and two cellos. The movement list is as follows: The general tone of the suite is sensual and atmospheric. Tempo variations are frequent in the dances, but the tempo is generally slow and calm in the first and third movements. One of the suite's most distinctive traits is the third movement, which is influenced by jazz music. It mainly features an amplified trumpet that is required to stand up throughout the whole solo. It is accompanied by a side drum played with wire brushes. Even though a basic rhythm is proposed in the score, the composer asks the drummer to embellish and improvise around the rhythm in a circular motion throughout the whole movement.

The episode was directed and written by Alec Berg, and originally aired on HBO on June 14, 2015. For his teleplay, Berg received a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. Plot The technician from the Natural History museum remains stranded at the bottom of the ravine, and the high-quality live stream has reached 7,000 views. This comes as Richard (Thomas Middleditch) and the Pied Piper team remain pessimistic about the pending verdict in their binding arbitration case with Hooli. Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) suggests to Richard that they should delete the Pied Piper algorithm if Hooli wins. At the same time, Erlich (T.J. Miller) announces to the team that he is putting the house on sale due to the lack of success coming out of his incubator. Meanwhile, the live stream has reached 20,000 views after its link was shared on Reddit and BuzzFeed. And eventually to 200,000 after Manny Pacquiao shares the link on his Twitter account, leading the footage to become a meme in the Philippines. To deal with the increased viewership, the Pied Piper team scrambles to ensure the server's ability to handle the traffic. Gilfoyle sets up servers all over the Hacker Hostel, penetrating a hole between the garage and the living room to connect the processors in the process. Erlich initially turns down a request to help from Jared (Zach Woods), but upon learning from the realtor that potential buyers are only interested in his house solely for lot value, Erlich turns down the realtor and helps the team code. The stream soon hits 300,000 viewers, causing a server in the house to catch fire before the signal was cut when the technician was finally rescued. At the arbitration hearing, the arbitrating judge rules that because Richard tested the Pied Piper IP on an Hooli computer, the company reserves the rights to the IP. In response, Richard secretly texts Jared to delete the algorithm. However, the judge soon reveals that while examining Jared's contract per Gavin Belson (Matt Ross)'s request, he finds a clause within the contract forbidding other employers from hiring contracted Hooli employees, which is in violation of California law. Since Richard was subjected to the same contract, his employment was never valid in the first place and therefore Hooli does not have the rights to the Pied Piper IP. A stunned Richard celebrates but then realizes that he told Jared to delete the algorithm. He attempts to call Jared, but his phone battery dies. He then rushes to his car only to drop the car keys into the sewer. He attempts to borrow the phone at a coffee shop, but then realizes that he doesn't know any of the team member's phone numbers. Richard then boards a bus and borrows the bus driver's phone to e-mail Jared, only for it to go into spam. He rushes back to the Hostel just as Gilfoyle deletes the algorithm, only to realize that the code set up by Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) to delete the IP has crashed, preserving the algorithm. Richard reveals to the team that they won, and they celebrate in response. A defeated Gavin, now under scrutiny over the fact that half of Hooli's employment contracts may be null and void, returns to the Hooli campus and faces the board; rumors spread of Big Head (Josh Brener) being listed as Gavin's potential replacement. Meanwhile, after being impressed at Pied Piper's performance during the live stream, Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer), purchases Russ Hanneman's (Chris Diamantopoulos) stake in Pied Piper, securing three of the five board seats in the process while helping Hanneman regain his billionaire status. As the Pied Piper team celebrates back at the Hostel, Richard receives a call from Monica (Amanda Crew) and learns that Laurie called an emergency board meeting and has voted to remove him as Pied Piper's CEO. Reception Les Chappell of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating, saying the episode gave Silicon Valley \\"the highest energy levels the show has ever experienced.\\" Writing for Vulture.com, Odie Henderson called the episode's script \\"excellent\\" with \\"a streak of pettiness running through it\\".

One of the first steps in Bill and his son Scott's (who had also been let go by the Whalers) process was finding land to build the channel's broadcasting facilities. The Rasmussens first rented office space in Plainville, Connecticut. However, the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because of a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop satellite dishes. Available land area was quickly found in Bristol, Connecticut (where the channel remains headquartered to this day), with funding to buy the property provided by Getty Oil, which purchased 85% of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February 22, 1979, in an attempt to diversify the company's holdings. This helped the credibility of the fledgling company, however there were still many doubters to the viability of their sports channel concept. Another event that helped build ESPN's credibility was securing an advertising agreement with Anheuser-Busch in the spring of 1979; the company invested $1 million to be the \\"exclusive beer advertised on the network.\\" List of presidentsBill Rasmussen (July 1978–July 1979)= Bill Rasmussen served as the first president and CEO of ESPN. ESPN was founded on July 14, 1978, and was launched on September 7, 1979. ESPN, originally called Entertainment and Sports Programming, was incorporated on July 14, 1978. It began broadcasting fourteen months later, at 7 p.m. on September 7, 1979. ESPN wound up being headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut. Rasmussen paid $18,000 for the first acre of ESPN's campus. By July 18, 1979, before launch, the investors decided to remove Rasmussen from power. His salary and responsibilities were cut. Just prior to the launch of ESPN, according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN, Stuart Evey claimed \\"I made Bill Chairman, but in no way did I want to give him any responsibility!\\" \\"Having Bill Rasmussen play a significant role was just not part of the deal.\\" Rasmussen, the one who had the idea for ESPN, stepped back from day-to-day business, having less contact with ESPN until mid 1999. Rasmussen and ESPN \\"made amends\\" in 1999 when then-president George Bodenheimer reached out to the founder for the network's 20th anniversary. On September 30, 1980, ESPN officials announced that Bill Rasmussen was leaving the company by agreement. =Chet Simmons (July 1979–June 1982)= Slightly more than five weeks prior to ESPN's official launch on September 7, 1979, Chet Simmons joined as President bringing along fellow NBC Sports executive and long time friend Scotty Connal to head production and operations. Leaving the prestige and comfort of NBC Sports was natural for Simmons and Connal who strongly believed in the idea of a 24-hour sports network. However, at the time cable and satellite channels were just in their infancy with HBO launching in 1975 and CNN yet to go on the air. Simmons and Connal and the young ESPN team got the network up on time launching with the first SportsCenter hosted by George Grande and Lee Leonard followed by a slow-pitch softball game. Together, Simmons and Connal led the company through its infancy building a first class operation in Bristol, Connecticut.\\"Sports Broadcasting Pioneer Simmons Dies At 81,\\" The Associated Press, Thursday, March 25, 2010. During his three years, Simmons gave start to some of ESPNs most important franchises including SportsCenter, The NFL Draft and full coverage of the early rounds of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Additionally, he is credited for the hiring of Chris Berman, Bob Ley, Greg Gumbel, Bryant Gumbel, George Grande, and many others. He left ESPN to become Commissioner of the USFL in 1982. George Bodenheimer, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks/president of ESPN, says that Simmons, working closely with Scotty Connal, shaped ESPN into something that was real and connected with sports fans. Simmons also forged a culture that is still ESPN's defining advantage in the marketplace, according to Bodenheimer. \\"He treated everyone like a colleague,\\" says Bodenheimer, who was a driver in the mailroom at the time. \\"And you had these two icons from the broadcast-sports industry who moved to a funny cable startup and got the best out of everybody.\\"Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. =Bill Grimes (June 1982–August 1988)= Investing another $15 million into the company and no profits expected any time soon, Bill Getty used management consultant McKinsey & Co. to assess ESPN's future. McKinsey's lead consultant was Roger Werner, who figured with another $120 million and five years ESPN would become a profit maker. Werner soon was hired by ESPN as vice-president of finance, administration, and planning and developed a new business plan. Werner developed a new revenue source beyond advertising by initiating revolutionary affiliate fees paid by the cable operators by number of subscribers starting at 6 cents. Between CBS Cable folding in October 1982 and the new CEO, Bill Grimes, they convince most of the reluctant cable providers to pay. By 1985, the fee was 10 cents. ESPN was the largest cable channel by the end of 1983 with 28.5 million households. Also in 1983, the company began distributing programming outside the US. ABC, Inc. purchased in January 1984 a 14% holding in the company followed by a June purchased of a controlling interest. Capital Cities Communications, Inc. bought ABC in early 1986 to form Capital Cities/ABC Inc. In 1988, Werner became ESPN's president and CEO. =Roger Werner (August 1988–August 1990)= In 1988, Roger Werner became the network's President and CEO. During Werner's time at ESPN, the network became the largest cable television network, grew from $1 million to over $600 million in annual sales, and from an annual loss of $30 million to profits of approximately $150 million. In November 1990, Werner left ESPN and became president and chief executive of Prime Ventures. =Steve Bornstein (September 1990–November 1998)= In January 1980, Steve Bornstein joined ESPN as manager of program coordination when the cable sports network was a four-month-old start-up. During his time as manager of programming coordination, he developed and implemented ESPN's successful programming philosophy of presenting a mix of events, sports news and special interest programming. In 1988, Bornstein was promoted to Executive Vice President of Programming and Production. He advanced through the network's programming and production ranks, becoming ESPN's youngest president and CEO in 1990 at age 38. In January 1992, ESPN Radio was launched and began a rollout of 24-hour programming in October 1998. Also in 1992, Bornstein established the subsidiary ESPN Enterprises to develop new businesses like ESPN.com, which has grown to become the leading sports news and information site on the internet. Bornstein helped to oversee the debut of ESPN2 in October 1993 and ESPNews in November 1996. In October 1997, Bornstein directed the acquisition of Classic Sports Network and rebranded the channel as ESPN Classic, adding yet another network to the ESPN family. Additionally, Bornstein oversaw the development of ESPN International, which has grown to include ownership - in whole or in part - of 24 television networks internationally, as well as a variety of additional businesses that allow ESPN to reach sports fans in over 61 countries and territories across all seven continents. In March 1998, ESPN the Magazine was launched as a joint venture of Disney Publishing and ESPN with distribution being handled by Hearst Magazines. Throughout his time at ESPN, the network created many of the popular programming staples that still thrive today, including the iconic SportsCenter franchise, NFL Countdown, NFL PrimeTime, Baseball Tonight and the Outside the Lines series. In addition to his contributions to ESPN programming, Bornstein developed the X Games and Winter X Games, week-long extreme sports competitions. Bornstein is also credited with the creation of the ESPYs Awards, short for Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award. First awarded in 1993, the ESPYs gather top celebrities from sports and entertainment to commemorate the past year in sports by recognizing major sports achievements, reliving unforgettable moments and saluting the leading performers and performances. During his tenure at ESPN, Bornstein's team won 59 Emmys and 57 Cable Ace Awards. =George Bodenheimer (November 1998–December 2011; Acting Chair, December 18, 2017–March 5, 2018)= George Bodenheimer was president of ESPN since November 19, 1998 and of the former ABC Sports since March 3, 2003. The Sports Business Journal named Bodenheimer the most influential person of 2008 on a list of 50 people. As of January 1, 2012, Bodenheimer was the executive chairman of ESPN, with John Skipper replacing him as president. On December 18, 2017, he became acting chairman of ESPN after Skipper announced his resignation. =John Skipper (January 2012–December 2017)= In June 1997, Skipper became senior vice president and general manager of ESPN the Magazine. In October 2005, he was named as executive vice president of content. On January 1, 2012, he became president of ESPN Inc. and co-chairman of Disney Media Networks. In 2017, Skipper's contract with ESPN's parent company, Disney, was extended through 2021. In his time as President, Skipper was noted for negotiating large television rights contracts for sporting events, including a nine-year, $12 billion deal with the National Basketball Association and a $7.3 billion deal for the College Football Playoff, as well as all four tennis Grand Slams and golf's Masters Tournament. On December 18, 2017, Skipper revealed that he had been struggling with substance addiction, and announced that he would be resigning as president of ESPN in order to focus on treatment. John Skipper told Sports Illustrated that a cocaine extortion attempt led to his ESPN departure. His predecessor George Bodenheimer served as acting chairman of the company during the transition to new leadership. In the wake of Skipper's announcement, the New York Times reported that he \\"didn't have a reputation for partying or erratic behavior\\" among coworkers at ESPN or confidants in his personal life. After his resignation, many current and former ESPN staffers, including Jemele Hill, Michele Steele, and Keith Olbermann, applauded Skipper's past work and the decision to focus on his personal life. Skipper's time as President of ESPN received both praise and criticism. He was admired for his strong support of journalism. The Ringer wrote that \\"he knew quality\\" and \\"spoke a language that editorial people could understand.\\" He was credited for taking chances on ambitious projects like Grantland, FiveThirtyEight, The Undefeated, and 30 for 30. Sports Illustrated wrote that Skipper made ESPN \\"gobs of cash ... but he also made the network smarter and sharper.\\" Skipper \\"championed soccer and the NBA, realizing that ESPN, armed with its many affiliates and platforms, could get more out of broadcast rights than any of its competitors could.\\" He was also praised for pushing ESPN to become \\"more diverse on air and online when it came to both gender and race.\\" During Skipper's tenure ESPN lost nearly 15% of its subscribers and laid off more than 500 employees. Additionally, ESPN's TV ratings declined significantly across the board and the network endured criticism from some quarters over the declining quality of its programming. =James Pitaro (March 2018–present)= On March 5, 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced James Pitaro would become president of ESPN Inc.

Her mother was Sabiha Sultan, daughter of Sultan Mehmed VI and Nazikeda Kadın. Early life Hanzade Sultan was born on 19 September 1923 in the Dolmabahçe Palace, nearly a year after the abolition of the Ottoman Empire. Her father was Şehzade Ömer Faruk, and her mother was Sabiha Sultan. She had an elder sister, Neslişah Sultan, two years elder then her and a younger sister, Necla Sultan, two years younger then her. She was the paternal granddaughter of Abdulmejid II and Şehsuvar Hanım, and the maternal granddaughter of Sultan Mehmed VI and Nazikeda Kadın. A month after her birth, Turkey became a republic on 29 October 1923. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Hanzade her mother and sister left Turkey. The three of them left the mansion in Rumelihisarı on 11 March, and took the Orient Express to join her father and grandfather in Switzerland. Later, her parents and sisters moved to Nice, France where she spent her childhood. In fall of 1938, she arrived with her sister and father in Alexandria, Egypt. Their grandfather, Abdulmejid used to take her and her sister Neslişah to seashore during special occasions. Marriage In 1940, Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim send a proposal to Neslişah Sultan, as he was willing to marry her. Neslişah didn’t agreed and relations between her and father got cold, following which she agreed. Hanzade's family was impoverished because of the ongoing World War II, as their grandfather Abdulmejid was unable to send them money from France. And because of this she wanted to marry, and get out of the situation immediately. However, her father disagreed and initially said \\"The eldest marries first, then the younger ones, let Neslişah then we will be thinking about Hanzade\\". However, later, Faruk changed his mind and chose Prince Muhammed Ali Ibrahim as husband for her. The wedding was situated in Cairo, and the family stayed Aziza Hanım's home at Al-Qubba. Prince Muhammed Ali rented a large house in Gezira, which also had a library with beautifully bonded books. The wedding took place on Thursday, 19 September 1940, as Thursday was considered a lucky day for marriage in Egypt. The next week on Thursday, 26 September 1940 the wedding of Neslişah Sultan and Prince Abdel Moniem took place. The couple's first child Sabiha Fazile Hanımsultan was born on 8 August 1941. She was followed by Sultanzade Ahmed Rifat, born on 31 August 1942. In 1958, King Faisal II of Iraq send a proposal for Fazile. The proposal was a surprise for her parents because, Fazile was only sixteen and was studying in school. However, the marriage didn't took place because of the king's murder in the same year in 14 July revolution. Fazile later married Hayri Ürgüplu, in Paris on 10 December 1965, the son of Suat Hayri Ürgüplü, who served as Turkey's Prime Minister for seven months. Hanzade lived in Egypt until 1952, the Egyptian revolution of 1952 took place on 23 July 1952, and Egypt was declared as a republic, Hanzade and her family were exiled, the family moved to Paris, France and never returned back. Hanzade's father, Ömer Faruk developed an increased interest in his cousin Mihrişah Sultan, the daughter of crown prince Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin. It was also a public knowledge that things weren't going well between Faruk and her mother Sabiha. She and her sisters sided with their mother. Faruk accused Sabiha of turning their daughters against him. But he was already in love with Mihrişah and the issue of the council was just an excuse. In 1948, after twenty eight years of marriage, Faruk divorced Sabiha, and married Mihrişah, after which Sabiha came to Paris to live with her. After the revocation of the law of exile for princesses in 1952, her mother moved to Istanbul. Hanzade was widowed at Prince Muhammed Ali's death in 1977. Death Hanzade Sultan died on 19 March 1998 at the age of seventy-four in Paris, France. Her body was taken back to Istanbul, and was buried on 26 March 1998 in Aşiyan Asri Cemetery.

Early life Born in South Carolina, Bishop studied at Furman University and obtained a double BA in Political Science and Music. She then decided to pursue a career in opera, and trained at the Juilliard School. She won the 1993 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and accepted a role at the San Francisco Opera as an Adler Fellow in 1994. CareerOperatic career= She has been most closely associated with the Washington National Opera, the San Francisco Opera, and the Metropolitan Opera. Her versatile operatic roles have included Emilia (Otello), Eboli (Don Carlo), Meg Page (Falstaff), La Marquise de Merteuil (The Dangerous Liaisons), Suzuki (Madama Butterfly), and her frequent role of Mère Marie in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites. She has also often appeared as Wagnerian heroines, including Fricka, Waltraute, and Second Norn (Der Ring des Nibelungen) and Brangäne (Tristan und Isolde). In 2013, she gained attention for becoming one of the few artists to perform two major roles in one day at the Metropolitan Opera, namely Mère Marie in Dialogues des Carmélites and Fricka in Wagner's Das Rheingold. Anthony Tommasini of the New York times described this event, calling her performance 'vocally lustrous'. On the concert platform, Bishop often performs Mahler, with Das Lied von der Erde, and Mahler's Second, Third and Eighth Symphonies in her repertoire. Speaking about her own career to the Washington Post, Bishop stated: 'I have made a decent career out of being the world’s best fourth choice. They can’t get the star, they can’t get the old star, they can’t get the new girl who is coming up: Let’s call Betsy. She can do anything'. =Teaching= Bishop is a voice teacher at the Juilliard School, and has also taught at her other alma mater, Furman University. In addition, she has taught at Palm Beach Opera, Wolf Trap Opera Company, Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music, and Washington National Opera Institute for Young Singers.

Life Sturge was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England on 5 January 1849. She was the first daughter of the Quaker abolitionist Joseph Sturge and his second wife Hannah Sturge born Dickinson. Her aunt of the same name was Joseph’s sister, and was, like Joseph, an important member of the anti-slavery movement. After an education at home, Sophia Sturge devoted her life to philanthropy and to attempts at reform. She was a pacifist who emphasised peace-making by women, worked with the Neutrality League to oppose WWI, initiated a programme to help enemy aliens in WWI and contributed to post-war relief for German children. Sturge was a president of Young British Women's Temperance Association and a member of the Women's Liberal Social Council. She was a strong supporter of suffragism. As a supporter of the Irish Home Rule movement and appalled by the poverty in Ireland she moved to Connemara in 1888, where, with financial assistance from some Quakers, she set up a basket- making industry in the village of Letterfrack, which had already become a place of residence for several other Quakers. She taught young girls the art of basket-making, leading to a self-sustaining enterprise that sold many of its products in Britain. She lived there for seven years but then returned to England for health reasons. The factory continued to function under a manager until 1905. By 1900 pacifism had become the main focus of her activities and she attended several international peace conferences. She opposed the Second Boer War and supported the campaign against it led by the Nobel Prize winner Norman Angell. Sturge became a member of the Union of Democratic Control, which was a British pressure group formed in 1914. While not a pacifist organisation, it was opposed to military influence in government. On 7 August 1914, the British issued orders to detain all those considered to be dangerous. By the end of August, 4,800 people had been interned although many had been living and working in Britain for decades. On the day that WWI was declared, Sturge was travelling home from London to Birmingham when she saw queues of hundreds of Germans waiting to register as enemy aliens. She wrote a letter to Stephen Hobhouse, a fellow Quaker and prominent peace campaigner, to suggest that the enemy aliens would need help. Her suggestion led to the Quakers setting up the “Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germans, Austrians and Hungarians in distress” (usually known as the Friends' Emergency Committee). Initially, the committee concentrated on finding people willing to provide employment to Germans who had suddenly been made unemployed; accommodation for those who had been evicted from their homes; and financial help. Many Germans who were reservists had been called home, leaving their British wives and children destitute. Sometimes the Committee helped people return to Germany. In December 1914, a group of suffragists and social reformers, including Emily Hobhouse, Isabella Ford, Helen Bright Clark, Margaret Clark Gillett, Sophia Sturge and her sister Lily, and Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith, addressed a letter through the International Women’s Suffrage Alliance, to the women of Germany and Austria urging them to join them in calling for a truce. Dutch suffragists, led by Aletta Jacobs, proposed holding a Women’s International Congress at The Hague. Sophia Sturge was on the Committee to organize British participation. 180 British women wanted to attend and 25 were given passports. However, they were barred from travelling by the British Government at the last minute and were attacked in the press as unpatriotic and pro-German. In the end, only three British women managed to make their way to The Hague. After the war Sturge went to the Netherlands, where she helped German children affected by the war. She also spoke at many British schools and published several works for children, including The Children of Hunger, a collection of children's letters from Germany and Austria written after the First World War. Over time, she began to question her attitude to Quakerism, and she became a member of the Church of England. However, she resumed her Quakerism before her death, on 17 January 1936.

The son of Sir John Wallington, he was born in December 1854 at Oakley, Hampshire. He was educated at Sherborne School, before going up to Oriel College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University, making his debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1875. He did not feature for Oxford in 1876, but did play a further four matches in 1877, including in that years University Match. He scored 100 runs in his five matches for Oxford, at an average of 14.28 and with a high score of 38. Wallington later played a single first-class match for the MCC against Oxford University in 1885, in addition to playing minor matches for Wiltshire. He was described as a cricketer by Scores and Biographies as “a good batsman with steady defence, a slow under- hand bowler and fields well, generally taking point, cover-point or short leg.” Entering into the Civil Service from Oxford, Wallington later served as private secretary to Lord Carrington, the Governor of New South Wales, from 1885–89, before serving as private secretary from 1889–96 to both Lord Hopetoun and Lord Brassey during their terms as Governor of Victoria. He then served in the same capacity from 1896–1900 for Sir Thomas Buxton and Lord Tennyson during their terms as Governor of South Australia. In 1901, he served Lord Hopetoun when he was appointed the first Governor-General of Australia, while in the same year he was made a Companion to the Order of St Michael and St George in 1901.

In 1804 an earlier racecourse field was recorded at Heathfield Nook, on the other side of Buxton town. Fairfield Common was established centuries ago as common grazing land. A racecourse was laid out on the common in the early 1800s. From 1821 racing and county cock fighting meetings were held each summer. The 6th Duke of Devonshire commissioned a grandstand building costing £1,000 which stood in the 1830s. The race programme for the meeting on 16th-17th June 1830 lists the Duke of Devonshire's Gold Cup race, The Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Subscription Plate race and the Farmers' Stakes race. That year a mass riot and fight broke out. alt= Pigot's Commercial Directory for Derbyshire of 1835 reported: > \\"On a large tract of waste ground, an excellent round course is formed, > where horse-races take place on the Wednesday and Thursday in the week after > the meeting at Newton-in-the-Willows; and it is provided with a handsome > stand for the accommodation of visitors.\\" Buxton raceourse closed after the last race meeting in 1840 and the grandstand was subsequently pulled down. Timbers from the stand were reused in the building of the Methodist Chapel at Higher Buxton in 1849. The racetrack's grandstand is shown on the 1841 tithe map of Fairfield and the track itself is shown on an old OS map from c.1830s. Buxton and High Peak Golf Club was founded in 1887, after a nine-hole course was laid out on Fairfield Common in 1886. The course was extended to 18 holes in 1893. The 9th par 5 hole is called Stand Side, which refers to where the racecourse grandstand once stood. 611x611px Another local race track is Buxton Raceway, which is a modern oval motorsport track 3 miles south of Buxton. Racing started at the site in 1974 when it was known as 'High Edge'.

Location The Argyle Street Waterworks Depot was located in Mong Kok, at the intersection of Argyle Street and Sai Yee Street, at No. 111 Argyle Street and No. 128 Sai Yee Street, near Mong Kok East station. History The Argyle Street Waterworks Depot was built in 1950. An additional three storey block of offices was completed in 1954. One morning during the 1967 Hong Kong riots, 300 workers at the Argyle Street Waterworks Depot left their work at 9 am in a protest against the move to suspend 12 fellow workers. The building housed the New Territories West (NTW) Regional Office of the Water Supplies Department. It was a depot-type office for the operation and maintenance staff and vehicles of the Water Supplies Department and its contractors. It served the \\"NTW region\\", covering Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi, Yuen Long, Tuen Mun and Tin Shui Wai. The building also housed a small Water Resources Education Centre since the early 2010s. The building was demolished in 2019. The WSD Mong Kok Office was relocated to WSD Tin Shui Wai Building at 20 Tin Pak Road, Tin Shui Wai. Features The building was built in Modernist style. A section of the \\"Mongkok's Graffiti Wall of Fame\\" was painted on north eastern side of the building. Future The demolition site is managed by the Architectural Services Department. Two banyans that are around 50 to 70 years old, remain on the site. The redeveloped site also includes the area of the former FEHD Sai Yee Street Environmental Hygiene Offices-cum-vehicle Depot. The site is expected to be later sold for office and commercial development.

She was in time able to supply them with details of 250 men and boys who were imprisoned. She was contacted by mothers in 2016 who wanted to know where their sons were as they had just gone missing. She used the Yemeni courts but no information could be produced. Using social media she managed to unearth the truth that there were prisons in Yemen that the judicial system was unaware of. In 2017 the story was revealed by the Associated Press using much of her research to substantiate the story.

As a two-year-old in 2016 she showed great promise by winning her first two races including the Kokura Nisai Stakes and went on to be placed in both the Keio Hai Nisai Stakes and the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In the following spring she ran fourth in the Daily Hai Queen Cup and second in the Fillies' Revue before recording an upset victory over a strong field in the Oka Sho. She failed to win in thirteen subsequent races, running her last race in February 2019. Background Reine Minoru is a chestnut mare with a white stripe bred in Japan by Fujiwara Farm. During her racing career she was trained by Masaru Honda and raced in the red and white colours of Minoru Yoshioka. She usually raced in a red and white hood. She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Daiwa Major, an outstanding miler whose wins included the Tenno Sho, Mile Championship and Yasuda Kinen. As a breeding stallion he has also sired Major Emblem, Curren Black Hill (NHK Mile Cup), Resistencia and Admire Mars. Reine Minoru's dam Daiwa Angel showed no racing abiility, failing to win in four starts. She was a female-line descendant of the American broodmare Lima (foaled 1937), a half-sister to Bostonian. Racing career2016: two- year-old season= Reine Minoru made a successful racecourse debut when she won a maiden race over 1200 metres at Kokura Racecourse on 7 August. Four weeks later over the same course and distance the filly was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Kokura Nisai Stakes and started the 2.9/1 favourite in a fifteen-runner field. Ridden by Suguru Hamanaka she won by six lengths from Daiichi Terminal. After a two-month break the filly returned at Tokyo Racecourse when she was moved up in class and distance for the Grade 2 Keio Hai Nisai Stakes over 1400 metres in which she started favourite but was beaten half a length into second place by the colt Monde Can Know after being overtaken in the last 100 metres. Reine Minoru ended her season in the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 11 December when started at odds of 6.9/1 and came home third behind Soul Stirring and Lys Gracieux only losing second place in the last 50 metres. In the official Japanese ratings for 2016, Reine Minoru was rated the fifth-best two-year-old filly, six pounds behind Soul Stirring. =2017: three-year-old season= On her first run of 2017 Reine Minoru started at odds of 3.6/1 for the Grade 3 Daily Hai Queen Cup at Tokyo on 11 February and came home fourth of the sixteen runners behind Admire Mayabi, Aerolithe and Flawless Magic. On 12 March she was made odds-on favourite for the Grade 2 Fillies' Revue at Hanshin but was beat a neck into second place by Karakurenai. Reine Minoru's trainer Masaru Honda In the 77th edition of the Oka Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin on 9 April Reine Mionoru was partnered by Kenichi Ikezoe and started a 39.8/1 outsider in a seventeen-runner field. Soul Stirring started favourite while the other contenders included Admire Mayabi, Lys Gracieux, Mi Suerte (Fantasy Stakes), Aerolithe, Karakurenai, Rising Reason (Fairy Stakes), Jeune Ecole (Daily Hai Nisai Stakes) and Deirdre. Reine Minoru started fast before settling in fourth as the outsider Kawakita Enka set the pace and opened up a long lead. She made a forward move entering the straight, took the lead just inside the last 200 metres and held off several late challengers in the closing stages to win by half a length and a neck from Lys Gracieux and Soul Stirring. After the race Ikezoe said \\"I felt that she was a talented filly and had a good chance to win the Oka Sho when I rode her for the first time in training. I was more confident today as she felt really good in the post parade, and once she broke smoothly out of the gate, I just concentrated on keeping her stride in good rhythm. I was careful not to let her go too early in the straight and once we hit the front, it felt like forever up to the finish line as the horses came chasing behind us, but she really held on well\\". Her assistant trainer Hitoshi Nakai later commented \\"The ground was pretty shifty and she couldn't get traction in a number of places. It was a tough race but she ran solidly until the end... She was in tiptop shape and was the most tense she's ever been. She was tired after that...\\". Reine Minoru was stepped up in distance for the Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 21 May and started the 9.4/1 fourth choice in the betting but after reaching fifth place on the final turn she faded in the straight and came home thirteenth of the eighteen runners behind Soul Stirring. After a summer break Reine Minoru returned on 17 September and finished ninth in the Rose Stakes before running unplaced behind Deirdre in the Shuka Sho a month later. Hitoshi Nakai blamed the poor condition of the track for her disappointing performance in the latter race. On 19 November at Kyoto Racecourse she was matched against male opposition in the Mile Championship and produced a much better effort: starting a 46/1 outsider she settled in fifth place before moving up to dispute the lead in the straight and finished a close fourth behind Persian Knight, Air Spinel and Sungrazer. The filly ended her season on 21 December by finishing seventh behind Isla Bonita in the Hanshin Cup. In the official Japanese ratings for 2017, Reine Minoru was rated the third-best three-year- old filly, behind Soul Stirring and Deirdre. =2018–19: later career= Reine Minoru remained in training as a four-year-old in 2018 but failed to win or place in seven races. After finishing sixth in the Ocean Stakes at Nakayama Racecourse she produced her best performance of the season when she finished seventh behind Fine Needle in the Takamatsunomiya Kinen on 25 March beaten only two lengths by the winner. She subsequently ran unplaced in the Victoria Mile, Yasuda Kinen, Swan Stakes, Mile Championship and Hanshin Cup. In February 2019 Reine Minoru came home eleventh of the seventeen runners behind Dea Ragalo in the Kyoto Himba Stakes and was retired from racing. Breeding record Reine Minoru was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She was covered by Leontes shortly after her last race and her first foal was expected in 2020.

Čolak-Antić (; 21 August 1871 – 24 March 1949), also known as Boshko Tcholak-Antitch, was a Serbian diplomat, and Marshal of the Court of the Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, He served as ambassador in the Middle East as well as in several European capitals. From a prominent noble military family, he was a skilled diplomat who played a significant role during the critical era of the First World War. Early life and family Boško Čolak-Antić was born in Kragujevac, Principality of Serbia into an influential Serbian family with a long military tradition; the first son of Colonel Ilya Čolak-Antić commander of the Ibar Army during the Serbo-Turkish war, and Jelena (née Matić). Čolak-Antić's maternal grandfather was prominent Liberal politician and philosopher Dimitrije Matić who was President of the National Assembly when Serbia gained independence. He had a younger brother Vojislav (1877). Čolak-Antić was the great-grandson of famous Vojvoda Čolak- Anta Simeonović, one of the leaders of the First Serbian Uprising of 1804. After graduating from secondary school, he went to study law at the University of Geneva, where, in 1894, he graduated as doctor of law. He returned to Serbia and began his career at the Ministry of Finance before transferring to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1898. Diplomatic service His diplomatic career started in 1899 when Čolak-Antić was appointed Secretary of the Serbian Representation in Sofia then Minister Plenipotentiary to the Principality of Bulgaria; three years after Ferdinand had been recognized as king of the Bulgarians by the Great Powers, at a time of turmoil in neighbouring Turkish provinces; Čolak-Antić expressed concerned about the secret talks happening between the Bulgarians and the Ottomans regarding the unrest in the region of Macedonia, bypassing the three other members representing the different communities Serbian, Greek and Vlach, and warn his government about Bulgaria's expansionist intentions. Macedonia was the focus of diplomatic and political activity of both Bulgaria and Serbia, the ascendancy of nationalistic visions meant that both were interested in partitioning the Turkish territory and claiming it as historically theirs while making preparations for war with the Ottoman Empire. Čolak-Antić's mission in Bulgaria ended in 1903, that same year, the outbreak of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising in Macedonia, a failed rebellion organised by Bulgarian secret revolutionary society intensified the path towards war. The residence and the office of the Marshall of the Court (center building in a horseshoe shape) within Belgrade's City Courts Complex. After the change of dynasty and the coronation of Peter I of Serbia, on 21 September 1904, Čolak-Antić became acting Marshal of the Royal Court of Serbia, a position he will occupy until 1907 while still executing diplomatic missions around Europe. His next appointment was in Cairo where he served as ambassador from 1908 until 1912, at the time the country was an autonomous tributary state of the Ottoman Empire under British dominance. In Egypt he started a lifelong friendship with French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, who served as director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Maspero mentioned Čolak-Antić multiple times in his memoirs; he returned to Serbia at the start of the Balkan wars. On 9 January 1914, royal embassies and consulates and informed “by encrypted telegram“ that diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Serbia have been restored, less than a year after Bulgaria had attacked its former ally, losing the second Balkan War, and for the first time since Bulgaria became a Kingdom. Despite the complex intertwining of Serbian Bulgarian interests, as a result of the desire for stability in international relations, which was of interest to both countries and due to internal pressures, diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Serbia were restored fairly quickly. At the beginning of 1914 Boško Čolak- Antić is appointed minister plenipotentiary in Sofia, his nomination is accepted and validated by the Bulgarian government. On 4 February 1914 he hands over his letters of credit. =First World War= On 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo, a month later, on 28 July, Austria-Hungary began hostilities by bombarding Belgrade, effectively beginning the First World War. Bulgaria declared its neutrality but entered at the same time secret negotiations with Austria-Hungary and Germany. In a telegram dated 1 July 1914, Čolak-Antić warned Prime Minister Nikola Pašić that through a loan offered by the German Empire, the Bulgarian government was bound to the camp of the Triple Alliance and therefore presented an imminent danger to Serbia. Tcholak-Antitch's telegram about Italy's secret negotiations with the alt= In August 1914 Austro-Hungarian forces entered deep into Serbia, occupying the north of the country, the government had to relocate but by mid- December against all odds the Serbian forces defeated the invader and pushed them out of the country. The pressure of war transformed diplomacy too, Boško Čolak-Antić found himself entrusted with the important task of bringing new partners into the war while maintaining the links between allies and preventing them from going over to the other side. In April 1915 Čolak-Antić warned his government in a telegram that the Italians were participating in secret talks with the Triple Entente about annexing lands in Dalmatia and ports in Albania in exchange for joining the Allies side. On 10 August Čolak- Antić met with the Bulgarian prime minister Vasil Radoslavov, bringing forward a proposal, by the Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić, for a mutual settlement which would have resolved all disputed between the two countries, in particular the issue of prisoners of war, without the need of meditation by Allied diplomats. Radslavov rejected the proposal asking for more time. Čolak- Antić informed his government that the participation of Bulgaria on the side of the cental powers seemed inevitable. On 24 August 1915 Radslavov signed a secret agreement with the minister plenipotentiary of the German Empire, followed by a treaty of friendship and alliance between the two countries. Later that day Radslavov signed a military convention with Germany and Austria-Hungary, placing Bulgaria in the camp of the Central Powers and as such an enemy of Serbia, Russia, France and Britain and an ally of the Ottomans. On 9 September 1915, tsar Ferdinand and prime minister Radoslavov signed a decree of general mobilization. Numerous rumors of preparations for mobilization started to spread, Čolak-Antić warned Pašić about the rumours but the Bulgarian government kept denying. In Serbia Field Marshal Radomir Putnik, the Serbian Chief of the General Staff, suggested launching a preventive attack while Bulgaria was mobilizing, their only chance before Austria attacked again. To the consternation of Boško Čolak-Antić, Edward Grey, British foreign secretary, chose to give Bulgaria one more chance with the reason that Bulgaria had assured the allies of her pacific intentions. The Triple Entente tried to calm the situation by giving an ultimatum to Bulgaria, without success. On 23 September 1915, the Triple Entente severed diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. In connection to that, as well as on the basis of orders from his government, Serbian plenipotentiary minister Čolak-Antić left Bulgaria. On 6 October 1915 the combined armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary launched the invasion of Serbia, a few days later, on 11 October, without any previous declaration of war, Bulgaria joined the invaders and attacked the greatly outnumbered Serbian army from the rear. Čolak-Antić returned immediately home to volunteer. On 31 October he arrived in Raška to meet the representatives of France, Great Britain, Russia and Italy, after spending the night there, Čolak-Antić brought them to Mitrovica to meet with the King, Nikola Pašić and the Serbian government. He joined the retreat through Albania to Corfu, where he followed the Serbian Government in exile. Later that year he relocated to Salonika with the rest of the army and where his brother Vojin Čolak-Antić, now Colonel, is the commander of the 3rd Serbian Cavalry Brigade. In Salonika he took part in the controversial trial of Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević known as Apis and other members of the Black Hand. During that time, Čolak-Antić is appointed Marshal of the Court, of this period of intrigue when politicians mistrusted military officers who mistrusted governement, he famously declared: \\"Trust no one. Suspect everyone.\\" For the rest of the war, while the government was between Corfu, Salonika and Nice and the army fought on the Salonika front, Serbia was divided and occupied and under harsh military government by respectively Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary. Čolak-Antić is sent on missions for the government around Europe. =Later years= After the war and the ensuing reshuffle he became Ambassador of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia in Sweden, taking residence in Stockholm on 18 February 1918 staying until 1920. On 3 March 1920 Čolak-Antić was appointed envoy extraordinary then ambassador to Romania, he was based in Bucharest where he represented the kingdom in the talks of the Little Entente with Czechoslovakia and Romania in order to build a common defense against Hungary. On 7 July 1923 in Bucharest, after the two kingdoms agreed to conclude a defence Convention, Tcholak-Antitch, as Plenipotentiary Delegate, signed the Convention on the Defence Alliance between the kingdom of Romania and the kingdom of Yugoslavia. The first article of the Convention indicated that: \\"In the case of an unprovoked attack by Hungary on either High Contracting Party, the other Party shall come to aid the attacked Party in accordance with the Treaty provided for\\". While in Bucharest he kept a record that would later become a book about his experience. At the beginning of July 1929, as the head of the Yugoslav delegation, Čolak-Antić, was invited back to Belgrade to receive new instructions from the Minister of Foreign Affairs Vojislav Marinković. When Romania started to get closer to Bulgaria as well as improving its relations with Hungary, Boško Čolak-Antić demanded a meeting of the Little Entente at which Romania had to explain its position. Boško Čolak- Antić complained of Romanian military authorities’ 'lack of frankness' and increasingly questioned the military value of the Little Entente and the Romanian-Yugoslav ties. Five years later, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary will all be joining Germany and the Axis Powers leaving Yugoslavia alone to face Nazi Germany and its allies. In 1935 he goes back to Yugoslavia after being appointed Marshal of the Royal Court of King Peter II, he remained in that capacity until 1941. Personal life Boško Čolak-Antić was a keen sportsman throughout his life, he was the founder of the Serbian Cycling Society in 1885, the main national governing body for cycle sport in Serbia. He was also an accomplished equestrian and a practitioner of martial arts. On 13 March 1905, after judging that an article by a journalist has insulted the memory of his late father, war hero Colonel Ilya Čolak-Antić, he demanded reparations to the author Milan Pavlović, Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper , challenging him to a duel. Čolak-Antić wanted to fight with sabers but following objections from the other party, it was decided that the duel would take place with pistols, on 16 March at 4 pm, on the clearing of Banovo Brdo, at a distance of 20 steps between the opponents; Dr Roman Sondermajer would be present together with the witnesses. Both opponents arrived on time, refused to settle the dispute, fired their guns and remarkably both remained unharmed. The event was reported by Čolak-Antić’s brother in law, journalist, and founder of the newspaper Politika, Vladislav F. Ribnikar: \\"Yesterday at exactly 4 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a duel between Mr. Boško Čolak-Antić, Marshal of the Court and Milan Pavlović, Editor-in-Chief of ”. Government officials chose to stay silent on the issue, even though by law, duels were prohibited. , the fiercest critic of the government, stopped publishing a month later. During his service in Bucharest, on a formal reception in the Romanian court, Čolak- Antić organised together with Dr. Momčilo Ninčić the arrangements of marrying Romanian princess Maria to Alexander Karadjordjević. In July 1915 he was described, during negotiations with Bulgaria about joining the war on the Allies side, as possessing “a refined courtesy and a real impartiality which dictated all the actions of his important position during a very delicate situation”. According to French historian Marcel Dunan, He was “a perfect gentleman, an aristocrat, who could have passed as a member of the Court of Henry III”.

Usually, hobby tunnelers dig their tunnels by hand, using little equipment, and some can spend years or even decades to achieve any degree of completion. In some cases tunnels have been dug secretly, and only discovered by chance.  Motivations  Start of a hand-dug escape tunnel in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, thought to date from the First Jewish–Roman War in 66–73 CE A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil or rock for the purpose of transport, passage or communication. Tunnel construction is a sub-discipline of civil engineeringTunnelling, designingbuildings.co.uk, 23 March 2020. and usually the domain of engineers and construction companies. When civilians dig tunnels it may be for criminal purposes, like smuggling or hiding illegal goods, or gaining unauthorised access to an area. People may also build escape tunnels, such as those under the Berlin Wall. Tunneling may be part of the building of underground dwellings. Subterranean construction may be done as an art form, as in the work of Ra Paulette.Cavedigger: Inside Ra Paulette's luminous subterranean world, CNN Edition, 15 December 2015. Dutch graphic designer Leanne Wijnsma digs short, shallow tunnels as an art form and for fun. She had dug thirteen by 2015, three at cultural festivals. Leanne (27) graaft tunnels om zich te ontspannen, Algemeen Dagblad, 5 March 2015. = Hobby = A few people have dug tunnels as a hobby or for fun, although some have given additional reasons for their activities. Seymour Cray, for instance, has said that the work of digging helped him to think about other problems, and Harrison Dyar saw digging as a form of exercise. Some hobbyists started out constructing something understandably useful, but continued digging after completion. This was the case with William Lyttle, who started by digging a wine cellar,, Retrieved through GoogleBooks, 6 June 2020. and Michael Altmann, who excavated a cooling cellar for a cafe. A Swiss contemporary of Altmann named Peter Junker dug in his garden, searching for water, but continued digging after finding some, excavating a tunnel length of . Un original creuse un tunnel de 220 mètres sous sa maison, Tibune de Genève, 28 July 2012. Others have always said that they excavated for a particular purpose, although the tunnelling effort seems out of proportion to the stated purpose. Dyar biographer Marc Epstein thinks it is mainly outsiders that desire a sense of purpose. On Dyar's tunneling for exercise reasons he says that \\"it’s almost unfathomable, the amount of energy it would take\\" and that \\"it still doesn’t add up\\". Author Will Hunt thinks extensive tunnelling is at least part obsession. Psychiatrist Anton Tölk believes that tunnel digging can be interpreted as a desire to return to the security of the mother's womb, and that as an activity it allows contemplative satisfaction.  Notable cases  Harrison Dyar = The American entomologist Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. constructed a network of tunnels on two occasions, with a length of combined. His first, under his Washington, D.C. home was accidentally discovered during construction work in 1917, without drawing much attention. It was rediscovered in 1924, when a truck sank though the pavement nearby. The tunnel system led to speculation in the press, not in the least because a lot of German newspapers from the war years of 1917 and 1918 were found in the tunnels. After a few days Dyar came forward as the tunnels' constructor, claiming he had dug them between 1906 and 1916, when he relocated to California. Back in Washington a few years later, Dyar dug out a second set of tunnels under his new home. The network had concrete lined walls, steel staircases and electric lighting. Dyar described hobby tunneling as a kind of exercise for him, saying \\"some men play golf, I dig tunnels\\". = William Lyttle = William Lyttle's house in 2005 In the mid sixties, British civil engineer William Lyttle dug a wine cellar under his Hackney property. Having done so, he said that he had \\"found a taste for the thing\\" and kept on digging, for some forty years. Eventually, several tunnels on multiple levels led in all directions, under the property and surrounding grounds, some of them long. After complaints by neighbours, a power supply interruption and a sinkhole in the pavement, the borough had a survey carried out that revealed the extent of the tunneling. Lyttle was evicted and the tunnels were filled with concrete. = Lyova Arakelyan = Armenian man Lyova (or Levon) Arakelyan dug a storage cellar under his rural house in 1985. When completed, he continued to dig and kept at it for some 23 years, constructing an extensive complex of tunnels, rooms and stairs which extended deep into solid rock. Arakelyan stated that he received directions for his work in dreams and visions. The underground spaces were transformed into a museum, called 'Divine Underground', after his death in 2008. Arakelyan never made any money from his tunneling in life, and the museum provides some income for his family. = William Schmidt = Entrance to the Burro Schmidt Tunnel William \\"Burro\\" Schmidt was a Californian miner who spent 32 years drilling a tunnel through solid granite. He claimed to be building a shortcut from his mining operation to the smelter. When a new road was constructed, rendering his shortcut obsolete, Schmidt carried on his work regardless. He used simple handtools and occasionally explosives for tunneling, carrying out the debris in a wheelbarrow or on the backs of his two burros. Schmidt supported himself by working as a farm hand in summer. If precious metals were ever found, Schmidt never took any of it to market. Schmidt the tunneler took the better part of Schmidt the miner, according to a later caretaker of the Burro Schmidt Tunnel. When his tunnel was completed, he sold his concession to another miner, packed his belongings and left. = Seymour Cray = The American engineer and supercomputer architect Seymour Cray is known to have been a hobby tunneller. Cray built an cedar-floored tunnel under his house, explaining that the digging helped him to think about computer designs. \\"While I'm digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem,\\" he said.Seymour Cray: An Appreciation, University of Manchester website, February 1997. = Michael Altmann = Between 1958 and 2008 Austrian Michael Altmann dug two tunnels of combined. At first, he wanted a cooling cellar for a cafe he was to open, but upon completion he could not get a permit. In 1965 he took over another bar, but kept his digging as a hobby. Altmann would mainly use a pickaxe for digging and occasionally explosives, after passing an explosives handling examination at the fire department. He dug a second tunnel branching off from the first one, using a tunnel boring machine he designed and built himself. In 1962, he installed steel doors on the tunnel system and added a store of emergency rations, with the intention of making it usable as a nuclear bunker. In 2008 Altmann reached a block of granite and, considering his age, gave up tunnel digging. = Baldassare Forestiere = A tunnel leading into a patio in Forestiere's complex The kitchen of the Forestiere Underground Gardens In 1904 Sicilian immigrant Baldassare Forestiere bought a plot of land in Fresno for horticulture. The hardpan soil however, was unsuited for the fruit trees he intended to plant. While working elsewhere Forestiere dug a maze of underground and below ground spaces to escape the summer heat of the San Joaquin Valley. He opened up ceilings to let in light and below he planted the fruit trees he wanted in the first place. The complex consists of bedrooms, living spaces, patios, a fish pond and hallways. After his death in 1946 some of the land was sold off and some tunnels filled in, but currently about have been saved.

The underground complex was large enough to hold his daughter's wedding reception in 1960, with some 200 guests attending. Havens ignored building regulations and never got any permit. Local authorities recommended people not to go inside, but took no further action. = Others = Costa Rican miner Manuel Barrantes has built an underground family house, consisting of hallways, bedrooms, conference rooms and a bathroom. The complex, totalling , is used as a home and a museum. In Butler, Pennsylvania Ron Heist created a 50 room dwelling made of salvaged materials from abandoned places in the vicinity. It includes several tunnels Heist dug out and reinforced himself. A documentary film was made about him, entitled Mole Man.Mole Man (2017), IMDb entry, 11 October 2018. In 2015 a tunnel was discovered in a Toronto park. After a few days of speculations in media, the use as a terrorist hideout being among them, young construction worker Elton McDonald came forward as its builder. Asked for the purpose of his digging, he answered \\"Honestly, I loved it so much. I don't know why I loved it\\". In 1984 Russian Leonid Murlyanchik had the plan of digging a tunnel towards the house of his beloved Ekaterina. However, after Ekaterina's son objected to the liaison, he changed his intention into building his city of Lebedyan a subway system. For 27 years Murlyanchik spent most of his hours, and his pension money, on the project. At his death in 2011 he had completed of tunnel, which was subsequently closed off.

It included hallways, a ballroom, a billiards room, a library and a tunnel from the mansion to the riding house, wide enough for several people to walk in side by side. Some of the spaces were lit by lightwells and at night by gas lighting. Most of the spaces that are known as 'underground' are actually 'below ground', constructed in a cut- and-cover technique. Few of the tunnels and rooms were ever used for their intended purpose, however. Towards the end of his life, the Duke lived as a recluse and very few people actually got to see him. Spaces that were intended for social gatherings, like the ballroom, were never used. But the Duke did frequently use the tunnels that allowed him to move about his property mostly unseen.  Press coverage  Several urban legends or even hoaxes involving private tunnels have appeared in media. One such a story is about an Irishman who dug a tunnel from his bedroom to his local pub, whithout his wife noticing. In one version of the story, that did the rounds at least between 2014 and 2018, the tunneler is said to have used a spoon for digging. When a tunnel in Calgary was discovered in 2016, a local newspaper ran a do it yourself tunneling manual as a story.How did he do it?

History The Bosnische Post catered for the German-language administrative and business community living in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 40 years of Austrian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These included rural colonists as well as soldiers, merchants, skilled workers, experts and civil servants, which often had Slavic roots and used German as lingua franca. This population made up up to one third of the population of Sarajevo in 1910.Carl Bethke, \\"Bosnische Post - Newspaper in Sarajevo (1884-1903)\\", in: Markian Prokopovych, Carl Bethke, Tamara Scheer, Language Diversity in the Late Habsburg Empire The history of the Bosnische Post is strictly related to the Austrian policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina - first under the administration of Benjamin Kállay from its foundation till 1903, then under the \\"new course\\" imposed by his successor István Burián. The Bosnische Post was founded by Julius Makanec from Zagreb, who came to Sarajevo in 1879 as a 27-year-old doctor. In December 1883, Makanec obtained a licence to found a German-language newspaper for an audience of civil servants and merchants (the so-called Kuferaši). The first issue of the Bosnische Post appeared on 3 January 1884 with Makanec as the publisher and Eugen Ritter von Toepffer, from Vienna, as the editor. The aim of the newspaper was meant to be familising the “broader circles of the monarchy with the relationships, requirements and achievements” in “New Austria” and to strengthen the “feeling of belonging”, including by providing “safe refuge” to “our Muslim brothers” and ensure their continued existence and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The newspaper thus, since the start, advocated a pro-Bosnian agenda, rather than a pro-Croat one. In May 1884 the newspaper opened its own printing house, “Spindler und Löschner”, the first private printing company founded in Sarajevo, which proved pivotal for its commercial viability. As of late 1884, the Austrian administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina decided to cover from the public budget half of the total costs of the newspaper. Despite its reputation as a pro-governmental publication, the Bosnische Post claimed to retain objectivity. Makanec was also one of the initiators, together with Konstantin Hörmann and Mehmed Kapetanović, of the Sarajevo Museums Association, which in 1888 led to the foundation of the Landesmuseum, the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two years after its foundation, in 1886, the Bosnische Post was bought by Eugen von Tõpfer, who bequeathed it to his fiancée Milena Mrazović upon dying in 1889. Mrazović was authorised by the Austrian administration to continue publishing the newspaper, making her the first female editor-in-chief and publisher in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the first professional journalist in the province. Despite the government's concession, Mrazović refused to bow to the government's will in her articles. The government commissioner for Sarajevo, Lothar Berks, described Mrazović as an \\"unbearable, quarrelsome, scheming woman, who is under the influence of hideous delusions and is usually in a more or less hysterical condition, regarding the manifold, sometimes crucial, questions involved in important matters of state.\\" The government was eager to see her sell the newspaper to someone malleable. In 1893–94, Mrazović built an apartment block with newspaper offices and a printing shop on the ground floor in Cukovicgasse (today's Muvekita street). Two years later, she sold the Bosnische Post, as well as the printing and publishing business.

Overview In 1979 a revision to the Book of Common Prayer that was more substantial than the ones before it was made under the influence of the Liturgical Movement. Its most distinctive feature may be the presentation of two rites for the Holy Eucharist and for Morning and Evening Prayer. The Rite I services keep most of the language of the 1928 edition and older books, while Rite II uses contemporary language and offers a mixture of newly composed texts, some adapted from the older forms, and some borrowed from other sources, notably Byzantine rites. The Book also offers changed rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions. Article X of the Canons of the Episcopal Church provides that \\"[t]he Book of Common Prayer, as now established or hereafter amended by the authority of this Church, shall be in use in all the Dioceses of this Church,\\" which, of course, is a reference to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer. Many traditionalists, both Anglo- Catholics and Evangelicals, felt alienated by the theological and ritual changes made in the 1979 BCP, and resisted or looked elsewhere for models of liturgy.

Football career Until the outbreak of the second world war Redolfi played his youth football by local club AS Huningue. During the war, while in military service, his involvement in football was with the reserves of RC Strasbourg.

Vigils and protests of thousands of participants have taken part nationwide. Background In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made its way to Australia, with the first recorded case in January. By March, social-distancing rules were implemented and international borders closed to non-residents. March also saw lockdown, with services deemed non-essential by governments forced to close. In May, whilst Australia had flattened its curve, states still had various restriction and social-distancing measures, which included limits on gatherings. On May 25th, US police responded to a callout. As a result, a black man George Floyd was arrested for allegedly using counterfeit money. Once restrained, George Floyd's repeatedly stated \\"I can't breathe\\" whilst a white officer knelt on his back until he died. When footage of the arrest and death was released, all officers affiliated with the arrest were fired. George Floyd's death was ruled a homicide by the coroner with charges being laid against the officers. The death of George Floyd lead to widespread protests in the US, as his death became a focal point for race relations, institutionalised racism and police brutality. Police brutality in the United States was a longstanding social issue with activists often protesting against excessive force and high incarceration rates of African Americans. Aside from solidarity with US protesters, these themes also resonated in Australia, where the media considering similarities with Aboriginal deaths in custody and wider social issues faced by Indigenous Australians. Oppression of Indigenous Australians is a prominent theme in modern Australian history. Despite encountering Indigenous Australians upon arrival, British forces invoked the principle of terra nullius to claim the continent. This was followed by a long period of recurrent massacres and violent conflicts. By the 20th century, the Australian Government adopted a policy of forcibly separating mixed race Indigenous children from their families, which remained in place until the 1970s. In 1987, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was appointed to investigate 99 cases of Aboriginal deaths in custody during the 1980s. As of 5 June 2020, an additional 434 Aboriginal Australians had died in custody since the commission's findings were handed down in 1991. As of 2016, while Indigenous Australians accounted for roughly 2% of Australia's total population, they made up 27% of the national prison population, with incarceration rates rising markedly in the preceding decade. The George Floyd protests in Australia often referenced recent instances of Aboriginal deaths in custody. These include: the 2014 death of Ms Dhu in police custody; the 2015 death of David Dungay (whose final words were \\"I can't breathe\\") in a prison hospital; the 2017 death of Tanya Day in a police cell; and the forceful arrest of an Aboriginal teenager on 1 June 2020. Many Indigenous people have been frustrated that it took the death of a black man in the US to bring the focus onto the injustices here in Australia. Reactions Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated his beliefs that violent protests would not create change. He warned against Australian demonstrations taking a similar course as \\"there's no need to import things happening in other countries.\\" Following major Australia-wide protests on 6 June, Morrison called them \\"completely unacceptable\\" and demanded an end to further protests. In addition to concerns around COVID-19, he stated that some protests had been hijacked by left-wing movements, and called for demonstrators at future events to be charged. However, after being challenged on his assertion that there had not been slavery in Australia, Morrison acknowledged that \\"all sorts of hideous practices\\" had taken place in the past. The Labor Party did not directly criticise people protesting, but said that everyone should follow the authorities’ health advice. Senior Indigenous MP Linda Burney said that it was important for the media to focus on the issues, not whether people protested or not. DemonstrationsAustralian Capital Territory= * Canberra: 2,000 protesters in the capital city marched to Parliament House on Friday 5 June. =New South Wales= Protests have occurred across the state, Australia's largest, to show solidarity with American protesters and to highlight the high rate of death among incarcerated Indigenous Australians. The protests were preempted by an incident wherein a 16-year-old Indigenous boy was kicked and pinned to the ground by a New South Wales Police Force officer in Surry Hills. Protests that have occurred in the state have done so in violation of the state's coronavirus Public Health (COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement) Order, which bans gatherings of more than ten people outdoors for a common purpose without a reasonable excuse or exemption.Public Health (COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement) Order (No 3) 2020  Sydney  Three major protests have been held in Sydney. The first was held on Tuesday 2 June, where 3,000 protesters peacefully marched from Hyde Park to Parliament and Martin Place, was held on Tuesday 2 June. The second and largest protest was held on Saturday 6 June, where at least 10,000 protesters gathered at Sydney Town Hall and marched to Belmore Park. The crowd chanted \\"I can't breathe\\" and held a moment of silence for George Floyd. A counter-protester, who interrupted the protest by holding up an \\"All Lives Matter\\" sign, was handcuffed and removed from the protest by police. A group of protesters was pepper-sprayed by police at Central Station following the protest, and Acting Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon later defended this action as an appropriate use of force. The protest caused significant controversy. Premier Gladys Berejiklian originally stated that she believed people had a right to protest, but later backflipped and deemed the protest 'illegal' and in violation of the state's public health orders. Following this, the protest was subject to a successful legal challenge in the Supreme Court from the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force on the basis of health reasons. That decision was overturned on appeal by the New South Wales Court of Appeal just minutes before the protest began. The Court of Appeal – constituted of Chief Justice Bathurst, President Bell and Justice Leeming – overturned the decision of Justice Fagan on the basis that the protest organisers had complied with the necessary steps in order to gain approval to hold the protest in an authorised way. A third protest was held on the evening of 12 June in solidarity with protesters at Sydney's Long Bay Correctional Centre, where Corrective Services officers fired tear gas on inmates who spelled out \\"BLM\\" on the prison yard. Approximately 300 protesters met in Hyde Park because of a significant police presence at Sydney Town Hall, the original location for the protest. 600 police were involved in policing the gathering, and one woman was arrested for failing to comply with a move on order. Mounted police and officers guarded a large statue of James Cook located in Hyde Park on the night, which was later defaced. A police officer was filmed making an OK gesture toward protesters, a gesture which has been co-opted by the white power movement. The Police Force denied that the officer used the gesture in an offensive way.

It was built in 1938 by Walter C. Raabe, the owner of Raabe & Mauger Hardware Company, as a showcase for the Kelvinator appliances the company distributed. It was one of over 200 \\"Kelvin Homes\\" built around the country starting in 1936. The house was designed by William E. Burk, Jr., and was one of the city's earliest International Style homes along with the Lembke House. In 1976, a stylistically consistent second-story studio space was added to the building. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1978. History The first Kelvin Home was built in 1936 in Livonia, Michigan and by 1938 there were reportedly over 200 of them around the country. Each home was equipped with a complete Kelvinator climate control system and electric appliances, and was intended to be affordable to the average consumer. According to the company's promotional materials, \\"The Kelvin Home, the result of years of scientific research on the part of Kelvinator corporation, applies the latest findings in the fields of air- conditioning, refrigeration, heating and architectural design to the needs and desires of the home owners of America. Designed for the moderate income group family, the Kelvin Home plans and specifications will be offered by Kelvinator corporation to the architects and builders of the country as a basis for the construction of truly modern homes.\\" In Albuquerque, Walter C. Raabe built his own Kelvin Home in 1937–38 in the Granada Heights subdivision, which was then at the edge of the city. Raabe was the owner of the Raabe-Mauger Hardware Company, a local distributor of Kelvinator products. An advertisement for the building's grand opening in February, 1938, read: It was reported to be the first house in Albuquerque to be equipped with air conditioning, and was called \\"ultra-modern in every respect\\" and the \\"home of tomorrow\\". It featured centrally controlled air conditioning, heating, and humidity control, as well as the newest Kelvinator refrigerator and electric range. The design by local architect William E. Burk, Jr., featured the latest International Style architecture, which stood out among the mostly Pueblo Style houses in the area. In 1972, the house was purchased by Edna Heatherington, then an architecture student, who studied the building's design principles and constructed a second-story addition consistent with the original architecture. The addition was completed in 1976 and became the basis for Heatherington's master's thesis. Architecture The Kelvinator House adheres to the principles of the International Style: an emphasis on functional, rational spaces, and a rejection of symmetry and ornament. According to architect Edna Heatherington, \\"Kelvinator House has an interesting place in the brief history of 'modern' architecture in Albuquerque, not only because of its aesthetic distinction but also because of its theoretical purity.\\" The house is of frame construction and is two stories high, with a flat roof. The first floor is organized around a large living room which includes a semi-cylindrical wall of windows overlooking the back yard, with two bedrooms on one side and a garage, kitchen, and small dining area on the other side. The second floor originally consisted of only a single recreation room and an outdoor terrace area, but was expanded to include an additional bedroom or studio space in 1976. Like other International Style homes, the Kelvinator House makes extensive use of steel casement windows and glass brick.

He was an Austrian/Hungarian photographer who is best known for his portraits of actors of the early silent film era in Berlin. Life Willinger lived in Budapest until 1900, from 1902 to 1918 he ran a photo agency in Berlin, while maintaining a studio at Orczy út 8 in Pest. He married Margarethe (who ran the darkroom) and they had a son László Willinger (1909-1989) also became a portrait photographer. In Berlin he was registered in W 30 at Schwäbische Straße 8. During the First World War he was an Honvéd officer in the Austro- Hungarian Army. After the First World War, in 1919, together with Hans Schnapper he established a studio in Vienna. In 1921, Schnapper left the studio and Willinger became the sole owner. The Willinger & Schnapper company was located in Kärntnerstraße 28 in the First District of Vienna and remained at that address until 1938 when it was taken over by Adolf Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. At one point the studio was one of the largest in Vienna with 30 employees. The photo archive was confiscated by the Gestapo soon after 13 March 1938 and apparently dispatched to the Reichspropagandamt [Reich Propaganda Agency] in Berlin later on. During his time in Vienna he founded the Organisation der Wiener Presse (Organization of the Vienna Press) with various other photographers in 1924. In 1930 he took over part of the company R. Lechner (Wilhelm Müller) and turned it into the agency for Austrian press pictures Willinger & Lechner. Later he founded the together with Leo Ernst and Friedrich Cesanek sales company Austrophot - Willinger, Ernst & Cesanek. Eventually, the Atelier Willinger operated in Berlin, Vienna and Paris. The Berlin branch operated from 1920 to 1934 under the name of his wife, Margarete Willinger. It was located at Dorotheenstrasse 72 or 60, and (from 1932 to 1934) at Fasanstrasse 68. Their son also worked in several branches of the studio (Paris & Berlin). His work shows a wide variety of motifs and events. He photographed \\"role portraits\\" of stage actors, scenes from stage plays and portraits. His photographs can be found in various magazines, newspapers, as well as in books. Court documents from a case in Vienna in 1926 show his marital status as \\"divorced\\". Exile & Death Willinger left Vienna in 1938. He emigrated to Shanghai and was able to ship his photographic equipment with him, where from 1940 he ran his studio, Willinger & Co Shanghai, at 11 Nanking Road.

Her sons, Richard Twining and John Twining, eventually took over the company from her. Today, Twinings still exists and is a recognized, global brand. Portrait of Mary Twining, artist unknown  Life and death  Mary Little was born on 9 August 1726 in Wisbech, England, and was the eldest daughter of Richard Little Esq., a merchant. She married Daniel Twining in 1745, two years after he lost his first wife, Ann March. Along with a son from his first marriage, Thomas Twining, they had three sons together, Daniel, Richard, and John. Daniel (1748-1765) was supposedly killed by a blow to the head from a cricket ball while studying at Eton College. Mary died in 1804, at the age of 78.  Twinings  Prior to Daniel Twining's sudden death in 1762, he ran the family business created by his father, Thomas Twining, from 1741 until 1753 by himself. In 1753 he took on a business partner named Nathaniel Carter, who was also his nephew. When Daniel died in 1762, leaving Mary with his four sons to care for, Carter left the business soon after in 1763. Mary then ran took over running the business (then known as Twining's with an apostrophe) from 1763 until 1782. Starting in 1763, the London Directories described the business as, “Mary Twining. Tea Warehouse, Devereux Court, Strand.” In an excerpt from Alexander Meyrick Broadley's work on Twinings, he states: “Between [Daniel’s death] and 1782, the whole conduct of the affairs of the ‘Golden Lyon’ remained in the capable hands of Mary Twining, his widow, the style of the firm in 1778 (or possibly a little earlier) being ‘Mary Twining & Son,’ although in 1763 she must have had sole control, since Kent’s London Director of that date gives ‘Mary Twining, Tea Warehouse, Devereaux Court, Strand.' She was succeeded by this son, Richard, who was joined by his brother John.\\" Despite women’s typically lower or even non-existent status in business in the eighteenth century, Mary Twining managed and ran the affairs of the company in great form. Under her leadership, Twinings' global exports grew and the business remained stable, despite the taxation of tea rising to 119 percent during this period. The cost of tea in the late eighteenth century, in part due to the high import taxes, made it affordable to very few people in England. Tea smuggling from Holland or France to England ensued as a result, and since smugglers risked execution to perform these duties, they typically diluted the tea leaves by 100 percent in order to maximize their profit value, thereby lessening the tea quality. In addition, shortly after Mary took the reins of the company, the American Revolution began in 1765 in part due to perceived heavy taxation of imported goods on the American colonies from England. Skirmishes like the Boston Tea Party of 1773 exhibited direct objection to the taxation of tea itself. The 18-year war ultimately cost England a fortune, plunged the country into debt, and made taxes on tea as well as other imports go up in an attempt to compensate. In effect, the East India Company’s monopoly, artificially high prices, and fixed import supply threw fuel to the fire of a thriving smuggling trade, and by 1784 smuggled tea made up for an estimated two-thirds of all tea consumption in Great Britain. Later in life, Mary wrote in her diary that she never purchased smuggled tea while running the business, despite the cheaper cost, so that it would not dilute the brand's association with quality product.  Legacy  Before Mary died in 1804, she passed her late husband's family business onto their issue. Richard Twining, who left Eton College to help his mother with the family business when he was 14, gained significant knowledge early in life regarding the ins and outs of the tea business while working alongside Mary. Twinings is still in existence more than 300 years after its founding.

It is signed and dated bottom left \\"DAVID. TENIERS. FEC. A 1643\\". Provenance It was painted for the guild house's main hall. Teniers himself was a member of the guild and Klinge suggests that he painted it as a gift for the guild in return for exemption from guard duty, which was otherwise mandatory for all guild members. The painting was owned by the guild until 1649, when it hit financial difficulties and had to sell both this work and Rubens's The Crowning of the Virtuous Hero to the painter Gerard Hoet. Both works later became part of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel's collection, from which they were both looted by Napoleon's troops - Crowning is now back in Kassel's Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. Guild was taken in 1806 and assigned to Napoleon's wife Josephine Beauharnais, who kept it at her Château de Malmaison until 1814, when she sold it with 37 other works to Alexander I of Russia Бабина Н.

It has been in the Hermitage ever since State Hermitage Museum. Description The background is Antwerp's Grote Markt, with the 1560s city hall on the left and Zilversmidstraat and the guild's base in the Huys van Spanien to the right. With over fifty people in the first and second rows, it is a guild group portrait, a popular genre in Flanders and the Dutch Republic between 1625 and 1650, the most famous of which is Rembrandt's The Night Watch, painted the previous year. Teniers himself had also approached the theme in a less static and ceremonial vein in The Guard Room. Guild members are depicted in black dress with white collars and red cummerbunds. Three men also have red scarves over their shoulders - these are probably the leaders of the guild. To the left are a drummer and two men in yellow dress holding their muskets, whilst to the right is another man in yellow dress holds a standard at right and a priest in red, perhaps a cardinal, leans on a crossbow. Interpretation As early as the mid 18th century Jean-Baptiste Descamps suggested that the work showed a parade by various artisan guilds Descamps J. В. La vie de peintres flamands, allemands et hollandais. — Paris, 1754. — T. 2. — P. 167.. By contrast, Alfred Michiels considered that it showed an oath by the crossbowman guild Michiels A. Histoire de la Peinture Flamande. — Paris, 1869. — T. 7. — P. 455., whereas Frans Jozef Peter van den Branden argued that it showed a parade for the anniversary of the Dean of the Gudeward Sneijders Guild Branden F. Jos van den. Geschiedenis der Antwersche Schilderschool. — Antwerpen, 1883. — P. 991.. Margret Klinge considered that Van der Branden's theory is unlikely due to a lack of documentary evidence, but agreed that the picture depicts an unknown parade, as well as adding the detail that the guild's dean was then also mayor of AntwerpKlinge M.

After triggering an improvised explosive device during a routine foot patrol in 2007, he suffered serious injuries resulting in a triple amputation. He was the UK's first triple amputee to survive the Afghanistan conflict. He has since gone on to participate in the Invictus Games. Military careerRoyal Marine= Ormrod joined the Royal Marines in 2001 at the age of 17. He served in the Iraq War before leaving the Royal Marines after completing his minimum service in 2006. After working as a bodyguard, he rejoined 40 Commando in 2007. He was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick. On Christmas Eve 2007 Ormrod's platoon was conducting a foot patrol in Helmand Province when Ormrod stepped on an IED, losing his left leg and his right arm in the explosion. His right foot was attached to his body by only a thick muscle. He was evacuated to Camp Bastion by the Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT) commanded by Squadron Leader Charlotte Thompson-Edgar. They were unable to insert an intravenous line into Ormrod's left arm as the vein had collapsed so they had to improvise by drilling a needle into his iliac crest, part of his pelvis. For her \\"great skill, courage and determination” in saving Ormrod's life, Thompson-Edgar was made an Associate of the Royal Red Cross. Ormrod was the first British service person injured in Afghanistan to survive a triple amputation. He was then repatriated to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. After a period of recovery at Selly Oak, Ormrod was transferred to Headley Court to begin his rehabilitation. While in rehabilitation he met Prince Harry during a visit. After initially being told he would never walk again, Ormrod walked across the Parade Ground to receive his operational medal in 2008, six months after he lost his limbs. He was medically discharged from the Royal Marines in 2010 before being employed by the Royal Marines Association. Ormrod was one of the torchbearers during the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay. =Invictus Games= Ormrod stated that initially he thought \\"disabled sports would be patronising.\\" He eventually tried out for the Invictus Games 10 years after the explosion. After being selected for the team, Ormrod participated in the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto where he won two silver and two bronze medals with one of the medals being presented by Prince Harry. At the closing ceremony of the Games Ormrod was awarded the Jaguar Award for Exceptional Performance, Determination and Dedication. He reapplied for the 2018 Invictus Games where he won seven medals, four gold. He was noted for participating in the 50m breaststroke with only a few hours preparation having never swam in the event before. He participated in the event after finding out it would be cancelled due to a lack of participants. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the year Award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games. Other work Ormrod was awarded an honorary master's degree in sports science by Plymouth Marjon University in 2018. A documentary about his life entitled NoLimits was released in 2017. It was announced in August 2020 that a film was to be made about Ormrod's life. Development of the film was slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced in the Queen's Birthday Honours for 2020 that Ormrod had been awarded an MBE \\"for services to the Royal Marines and Veterans.\\" Personal life Ormrod is married to Becky, and they live in Plymouth. He was engaged to Becky while recovering in hospital in Selly Oak. Ormrod has one daughter from a previous relationship. The family lives in a house in Plymouth with a garden renovated by Alan Titchmarsh with help from a number of organisations including the Royal Marines.

He is a pioneer of modern archaeological and heritage management research in southern Africa and Zimbabwe. Pwiti was amongst the first generation of indigenous historians to be trained in archaeology in postcolonial southern Africa and he was the first professor of Archaeology in Zimbabwe.  Education and early life  Pwiti was born in 1958 in Mazoe, Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He received a BA Dual Hons in History and African Languages in 1980 from the University of Zimbabwe. In 1982, he moved to Europe to continue his archaeological training. He studied for an MPhil in Archaeology at Cambridge University in 1985. He received a PhD in Archaeology in 1996 from the University of Uppsala. His thesis was entitled Continuity and change: an archaeological study of farming communities in northern Zimbabwe AD 500-1700.  Career  Pwiti was amongst the first generation of indigenous archaeologists in Zimbabwe. In 1985, he established the first archaeological unit in Zimbabwe, as part of the Department of History at the University of Zimbabwe. He established the first archaeological degree in Zimbabwe, first offered in 1990. Later, in 2000, he had a key fundamental role in establishing the Master of Art degree in Heritage Studies at the University of Zimbabwe. Pwiti assisted colleagues in establishing further archaeological departments in Zimbabwe, at Midlands State University and Great Zimbabwe University. His main archaeological research has been in the regions of northern and eastern Zimbabwe, including finding evidence for early farming in the mid Zambezi valley. He undertook excavations at Kadzi, recording evidence for farming in the fifth century CE. His research has also addressed the transformation to complex societies in the 2nd millennium CE, questioning the existence of a 2nd wave of Bantu migrations. Pwiti has undertaken major work on cultural heritage management in postcolonial Africa, including developing key concepts such as intangible heritage and community participation. Through this work he showed how colonial rule separated people from their physical and cultural heritage. More recent work with Shadreck Chirikure has addressed the challenges for heritage management in identifying custodians for heritage. Throughout Pwiti's career he has authored and edited several key publications, including Caves, Monuments and Texts: Zimbabwean Archaeology Today (1997), and Legal Framework for the Protection of Immovable Cultural Heritage in Africa with Webber Ndoro (2005). He established the publication series Studies in the African Past in 2001 with colleagues from East Africa. Pwiti has had a key role in mentoring heritage managers and professional archaeologists in Zimbabwe. He has also held a number of visiting academic positions at international institutions, including the Department of History of the University of Botswana. He was acting president of the World Archaeological Congress from 1998 to 2000, and served as the Secretary General of the Pan African Congress for Prehistory and Related Studies.

It required Amtrak to adopt cost and performance metrics with regard to its intercity trains and established the Northeast Corridor Commission to govern Amtrak’s shared services along the Northeast Corridor. Background The National Railroad Passenger Corporation was established in 1970 by the Rail Passenger Service Act in order to maintain passenger rail service in the United States. Since its inception, Amtrak has remained unprofitable and requires an annual subsidy from Congress in order to maintain service and make critical capital improvements. In 2006, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation estimated that Amtrak would require $2 billion annually in order to maintain a state of good repair or $1.4 billion annually in order to prevent further deterioration of the infrastructure. Amtrak's annual funding from 2003 to 2007 was about $1.3 billion. Amtrak fired David Gunn as president in 2006 and hired Alex Kummant in his place. Kummant saw growth opportunities on routes from 300 to 500 miles and sought to restructure the route network in favor of these routes. Rep. James Oberstar sponsored the legislation as Division B of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and President George W. Bush signed the act into law on October 16, 2008.U.S. Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, , , . Approved 2008-10-16. ProvisionsFinancial= The law required Amtrak to develop a modern financial and accounting reporting system and to submit a five-year financial plan and budget to the Inspector General. It authorizes Amtrak to restructure its long-term debt and leases by negotiating with holders of that debt. =Service= Amtrak must work with the Surface Transportation Board to develop metrics and standards for performance of intercity service. The STB is also authorized to award damages to Amtrak in cases where freight railroads, on whose tracks Amtrak operates, do not provide preference to Amtrak traffic which may result in significant delays. Under Section 212 of the law, the Surface Transportation Board was permitted to appoint an arbitrator to settle disputes in certain cases. Amtrak is required to rank the performance of its long-distance routes and develop performance improvement plans for those routes that underperform. =State supported routes= Amtrak is required to develop a methodology for allocation of costs on such routes and allocate costs appropriately to those states. States may select a different provider for those services and may agree with Amtrak on the usage of its facilities for those providers. =Northeast Corridor= Section 212 created the Northeast Corridor Commission and mandated the Commuter and Intercity Rail Cost Allocation Policy which provides for a methodology of allocating costs to all users along the Northeast Corridor including commuter rail service. =Capital assistance= The DOT is authorized to make grants to states for the benefit of intercity passenger rail service. Funds may also be authorized to establish a program for development of high-speed rail corridors. Legal actions In 2011, the Association of American Railroads files a federal lawsuit seeking to invalidate the terms of Section 212 as unconstitutional. The AAR claimed that the law gave a private party the ability to regulate the conduct of another private party. In 2015, United States Supreme Court ruled that Amtrak was effectively a government entity and remanded the case back to the District Court. In 2016, the court voided the metrics published by Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration in May 2010. In 2017, the District Court ruled that the arbitration provision of the law was unconstitutional, but severed that provision from Section 212, allowing the remainder of the section to take effect. Amtrak filed suit against the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority to force an increase in rent of land adjacent to its tracks along the Northeast Corridor that SEPTA uses for SEPTA Regional Rail stations and parking lots. In 2016, Amtrak, citing Section 212, demanded that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority pay $30 million for Amtrak’s costs in servicing the Attleboro Line, which is owned by MBTA. MBTA citing an existing agreement in which Amtrak was permitted to use the line for its trains and agreed to maintain the line at no cost. In a settlement, Amtrak and MBTA agreed to share costs along the Attleboro line and Amtrak would continue to allow the use South Station with cost sharing for use of the facility.

The union was founded in 1907, when the Union of Bakers merged with the Central Union of Confectionery and Gingerbread. Soon after, it organised an international conference in Stuttgart, which established the International Federation of Bakers, Pastry Cooks and Allied Workers' Associations. Nationally, the union was affiliated to the General Commission of German Trade Unions, then from 1919 to its successor, the General German Trade Union Confederation. The union published the Bäcker und Konditoren-Zeitung until 1922, when it was replaced by Einigkeit. During World War I, the union maintained close links with members who were serving in the armed forces, for example, polling them on its policy on night baking. After World War I, the union led a prominent campaign against night work, and it also promoted agreements on tariffs. At some point in the 1920s, it changed its name to the German Basic and Luxury Food Workers' Union. By 1927, the union had 52,580 members. On 24 September, it merged with the Union of Brewery and Mill Workers, the Central Union of Butchers, and the Union of Coopers, Cellar Managers, and Helpers in Germany, to form the Union of Food and Drink Workers.
