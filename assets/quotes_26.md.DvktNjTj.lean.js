It was founded in 1994 and is published from Colombo. Its sister newspapers are the Iruresa (Irudina) and the defunct The Morning Leader. Founded by brothers Lasantha Wickrematunge and Lal Wickrematunge, the newspaper is known for its outspoken and controversial news coverage. The newspaper and its staff have been attacked and threatened several times and its founding editor Lasantha Wickrematunge was assassinated. History The Sunday Leader was founded in 1994 by brothers Lasantha Wickrematunge and Lal Wickrematunge with the first edition being published on 19 June 1994. The newspaper was associated with silent partner and leading politician and presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake who was assassinated on 24 October 1994. The Sunday Leader was shut down by the Sri Lankan government on 22 May 2000 using the recently passed censorship law – the Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and Powers) Regulation No.1 of 2000. The government's chief censor Ariya Rubasinghe had ordered that the newspaper cease publication for six months (22 May 2000 to 21 November 2000) following an article in the paper which mocked the country's censorship of the military situation imposed after the embarrassing defeat in the Second Battle of Elephant Pass. The police locked Leader Publications' printing facility and installed armed guards outside the building. Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge subsequently filed a fundamental rights application with the Supreme Court challenging the closure. On 30 June 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the ban on The Sunday Leader was illegal and ordered the police to re-open the newspaper immediately. On 5 September 2000 Lasantha Wickrematunge was found guilty of criminally defaming Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1995 article in The Sunday Leader. Wickrematunge was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for five years. Government minister Mahinda Wijesekara threatened to kill Lasantha Wickrematunge in Parliament on 27 July 2003, saying: \\"Very soon I'll put him in a room and have him shot or he will be stabbed to death!\\" The threat followed the expose of corruption in Wijesekara's ministry. Lasantha Wickrematunge was threatened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa using abusive language in a telephone call on 11 January 2006. According to Wickrematunge the president had threatened to destroy him saying \\"Fuck your mother, you son of a bloody whore!...I treated you well all this while. Now I will destroy you\\". Wickrematunge was detained briefly at Bandaranaike International Airport on 21 February 2006 as he arrived for a flight to Geneva. Airport officials had claimed that Wickrematunge required \\"special permission\\" to leave Sri Lanka. In late December 2006 an unsuccessful attempt was made to arrest Lasantha Wickrematunge for \\"endangering national security\\" after The Sunday Leader published a report exposing a Rs. 500 million luxury bunker to be built in the presidential complex. Journalist Arthur Wamanan Sornalingam and his mother were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department on 24 October 2007 following a complaint from government minister Mano Wijeyeratne. The arrest followed an article in The Sunday Leader which alleged that a government department had paid Wijeyeratne's wife's mobile phone bill. Investigative editor Dilrukshi Handunetti was forced to hand over documents relating to the article to the police. Sornalingam subsequently filed a fundamental rights application with the Supreme Court in relation to the arrest. On 5 December 2008 a judge ordered Leader Publications not to publish any reports about Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for two weeks. Gotabhaya had gone to the courts to sue Leader Publications for Rs. 2 billion (€14 million) in damages for publishing \\"slanderous\\" reports about him. Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge was shot dead on 8 January 2009. Frederica Jansz became editor of the newspaper following Wickrematunge's murder. On 22 October 2009 Jansz News Editor Munza Mushtaq were sent handwritten death threats through the post. \\"We will slice you up if you do not stop your writing,\\" the letters threatened. Jansz told Reporters Without Borders Wickrematunge had been sent an identical letter which was compared by a Graphologist who said all three letters were written by the same fist. The Sunday Leader carried an article on 13 December 2009 entitled \\"Gota Ordered Them To Be Shot\\", alleging that Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa ordered the then commander of the 58 Division, Major General Shavendra Silva, to shoot down the surrendering LTTE leaders during the final days of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Sarath Fonseka, the former commander of the Sri Lanka Army, and candidate of the 2010 presidential election who was quoted in the article, initially denied the story, but The Sunday Leader subsequently refuted the denial. The story resulted in Fonseka being charged with \\"\\"propagating a false rumour\\", a violation of emergency regulations. In November 2011 Fonseka was found guilty and sentenced to three years in jail and fined Rs. 5,000. President Mahinda Rajapaksa threatened Leader Publications chairman Lal Wickrematunge in a phone call on 19 July 2011 after the publication of an article that claimed the president and his son Namal Rajapaksa had received payments from China for use \\"at their discretion\\". According to Wickrematunge the president had said: \\"...if you attack me personally, I will know how to attack you personally too.\\" Editor Frederica Jansz was threatened and insulted by Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in a phone call on 6 July 2012. According to Jansz the Defence Secretary said: \\"Yes, I threatened you. Your type of journalists are pigs who eat shit!...I will put you in jail!... People will kill you!!! People hate you!!!\\" In September 2012 Asanga Seneviratne, an ally of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, bought a 72% stake in The Sunday Leader and its sister newspaper the Iruresa. Seneviratne is managing director of Asia Fort Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket. He is also president of Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union and controversially appointed President Rajapaksa's son Yoshitha Rajapaksa as captain of the Sri Lanka national rugby union team. The Sunday Leader had published a number of reports exposing Seneviratne's property developments and investment deals. According to editor Frederica Jansz, Seneviratne asked her stop publishing articles critical of the Sri Lankan government and the Rajapaksa family. She refused and on 21 September 2012 she was sacked as editor. Jansz was replaced by Sakuntala Perera as editor of The Sunday Leader. Seneviratne denies Jansz claims. In 2015 May, The Sunday Leader tendered an unconditional apology to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for a series of articles regarding the purchase of MIG 27 airplanes for the Sri Lanka Air Force. In 2018 October, The Sunday Leader newspaper and website have suspended operation due to the political turmoil in Sri Lanka after the removal of the Prime Minister by the President. Attacks The Sunday Leader and its employees have been subject to numerous attacks since its foundation in 1994. Lasantha Wickrematunge was assaulted on his way home in 1994. On 7 February 1995 Lasantha Wickrematunge and his ex-wife were pulled from their car and beaten. On the night of 18 June 1998 Lasantha Wickrematunge's house in Nugegoda was attacked with Type 56 assault rifles causing extensive damage and narrowly missing Wickrematunge's driver. The attack came after The Sunday Leader exposed irregular financial dealings between Minister of Posts, Telecommunication and the Media Mangala Samaraweera and Sri Lanka Telecom CEO Kamitsumo. Two photographers for The Sunday Leader, Lakmal Spencer and Ashoka Fernando, were amongst a group of media personnel who were attacked by the police as they covered an opposition rally in Colombo on 15 July 1999. The two men filed a fundamental rights application with the Supreme Court and in October 2001 they were awarded damages of Rs. 86,625 and Rs. 72,750. On the night of 16 October 2005 armed men entered the printing press of Leader Publications, threatened the manager with \\"dire consequences\\" if the newspapers continued to be printed and then set fire to bundles of newspapers. The attack came after The Sunday Leader had published an article which alleged that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had misappropriated tsunami relief funds. The printing press of Leader Publications in Ratmalana was burnt down on 21 November 2007 by a group of armed masked men who entered the building, poured petrol on the printing machines and set fire to them. The attack came after The Morning Leader had been critical of the Asian Tribune's relationship with a government backed paramilitary group. Lasantha Wickrematunge was shot dead on 8 January 2009 in Colombo. Three days later an editorial appeared in The Sunday Leader written by Wickrematunge before his death in which he predicted his own murder, stating \\"it will be the government that kills me\\". Wickrematunge and his newspaper had been highly critical of the government and he had been attacked before. He had been assaulted twice before and his house had been sprayed with machine-gun fire. A number of people including seventeen army personnel were arrested in relation to Wickrematunge's murder but later released. To date no one has been brought to justice for Wickrematunge's murder. On February 16, 2013 Sunday Leader's Faraz Shauketally, who holds dual British and Sri Lankan citizenship, was rushed to hospital after being shot in the neck. Shauketally was on the phone to a colleague at the Sunday Leader on Friday evening at his home in Mount Lavinia when the call was cut. Shortly afterwards he answered a call and said he had been shot in the neck by three intruders, who had then escaped. President Rajapaksa said he would investigate the incident but nobody was apprehended. On the 24th of August 2013 Journalist Mandana Ismail Abeywickrema's house was invaded by five armed men who held her at knifepoint as they searched her home before police burst in and shot one of the intruders dead, officials said. Police spokesman Buddhika Siriwardena said three officers were injured when the intruders attacked them with knives. \\"One intruder was shot dead and the other four have been arrested,\\" he said. Police described the pre-dawn intrusion as an attempted armed robbery but the island's main press freedom organisation, the Free Media Movement (FMM), said they suspected the attack was linked to her work.

The channel was a joint venture of both DD Metro and Nine Gold of Kerry Packer and Vinay Maloo HFCL - Nine Broadcasting India; hence known as Metro Gold. During its first launch, the channel was more likely known as DD Metro channel's \\"primetime block\\" from 7 pm to 10 pm IST, where it showed its programmes only in the given three-hour span on DD Metro Channel. But when the programmes started becoming popular in the primetime slot, DD Metro tried to set up some realistic terms with Nine Gold, which created disagreement between the companies and led up the channel's closing. Metro Gold's programming was targeted at family audiences, and covered genres including drama, comedy, horror, and live events. Among its most successful programmes are Mamla Gadbad Hai, Saamne Wali Khidki, Tede Medhe Sapnay, and Chonch Ladi Re Chonch. After Metro Gold went off-air, it signed a contract with STAR Plus, India's number 1 channel and sold off all of their shows to the channel. STAR Plus bought Nine Gold's entire library of programmes after signing the deal, and all of the programmes were re-aired on STAR Plus from the beginning. Besides, all of Metro Gold's programmes now belong to (are claimed by) STAR Plus and known as theirs rather than DD Metro's, though they were aired on DD Metro channel. The reason was that HFCL - Nine Gold paid DD Metro 1.21 million rupees for the three hours of air-time on DD Metro and they had full claim and the right to sell their programmes to anyone, and when they signed a deal with STAR Plus, DD Metro had no say in it.

In July 1918, the squadron went to Capelle, Dunkirk, equipped with DH.9s for day-bombing operations against targets in North-West Belgium. In October 1918, it moved to Bisseghem, Belgium, and remained based there until the Armistice. During its service overseas the squadron made 59 successful bombing raids, 40 reconnaissance flights, two photographic flights, dropped approximately 70 tons of bombs, and shot down nine enemy aircraft (a further 20 were reported shot down, but were not confirmed). Between the wars Disbanded in July 1919, the squadron did not reappear in the order of battle until January 1937, when it was re-formed as No. 108 (Bomber) Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford.

Its Wellingtons began bombing raids on 22 September, targets being ports on the Libyan coast and in Greece. In November it began to receive Consolidated Liberators and these supplemented the Wellingtons until June 1942. On 18 December 1942 the squadron was reduced to a cadre which was disbanded on 25 December 1942. On 15 March 1943 No. 108 reformed at Shandur as a night fighter squadron. Its Beaufighters flew night patrols over Egypt, Libya and Malta and were supplemented by Mosquitoes in February 1944. The latter were used for intruder missions until withdrawn in July while the Beaufighters moved back to Libya for intruder operations over Greece and the Aegean. In October 1944 the squadron moved to Greece and became involved in the attempted Communist take- over of the country in December. After taking part in attacks on rebel positions until the uprising was quelled, the squadron gave up its aircraft and sailed for Italy in March 1945, disbanding on 28 March 1945.

Members are required to have an association with farming, agriculture or food. History The club was founded in 1842 by the agricultural writer William Shaw, who invited the founder members from the newly formed Royal Agricultural Society of England, and the Smithfield Club. Shaw's letter set out that the club would be \\"a gathering place for farmers which could also serve as a platform, from which would go out to England news of all that was good in farming, with reports of any discussions about those things that needed to be done.\\" The club's membership experienced periodic shifts with the changing prosperity of British farmers over the years - there were 700 members in 1876, 275 in 1892, but the club has grown in the 20th century, claiming 1,500 members in the 1920s, and just under 6,000 today. The club frequently moved premises in its first 60 years. Its inaugural meeting on 9 December 1842 was held in a pub, the Hereford Arms, in King Street, Covent Garden. By April 1893 the club has secured rooms at the York Hotel in Bridge Street, Blackfriars. After several further moves, the club settled on some rooms at 2 Whitehall Court, which it occupied between 1904 and 1942. Whitehall Court is an apartment block built in 1883-87 by the architect firm Archer & Green, with finance from the disgraced MP Jabez Balfour, who used the building's construction to conceal his embezzlement of funds. In 1942, it moved sideways in the same block of flats to its current premises, which were formed by merging several apartments in 3 Whitehall Court. The rest of the block remains largely residential, and the club's former rooms now make up part of the Royal Horseguards Hotel, owned by Thistle Hotels. The Club comprises bedrooms, function rooms, the Restaurant, Bar and Lounge and has a terrace overlooking the river Thames.

It is coordinated by Colorado State University. The trial began in 2005, but has been restricted to elm cultivars commercially available in the United States, unlike the trial conducted by Iowa State University in the 1970s which included the most recent European developments. The trial will be conducted for 10 years, with annual assessments of each tree for height, diameter, crown characteristics, and fall color, as well as response to vascular diseases, canker diseases, foliar diseases, insect infestations, bark beetle infestations, and abiotic damages. Stated goals of the trial are as follows: * Determine the growth and horticultural performance of commercially available DED-resistant elm cultivars in various climate regimes in the United States. * Determine the relative disease, insect, and abiotic stress tolerance of these cultivars. * Promote the propagation and use of elms through local, regional, and national reporting of the trial results to wholesale tree propagators and growers, retail nursery and garden center operators, landscaper designers, arborists, and the general public. As of January 2000, 19 distinct cultivars are being evaluated in regional trials taking place under the scientific supervision of Auburn University, University of California at Davis, Colorado State University, Purdue University, Iowa State University, Kansas State University, Michigan State University, University of Minnesota, Rutgers University, State University of New York, North Dakota State University, Ohio State University, Utah State University, University of Vermont, Washington State University, and West Virginia University.

The clan was founded by Sir William of Magnel, a Norman knight who came to Ireland in 1183 as part of the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th Century A.D. William Magnel built a castle in the site of a pre-existing Celtic Motte-and-bailey castle along the Keatra River in Northern County Cork, and established a Norman settlement that became known as Magnel's town, and eventually Magnelstown. The name, \\"Magnel\\" was difficult for speakers of the local Irish dialect to pronounce, and the name evolved into \\"Maingneir,\\" which was later shortened to \\"Magner.\\" The castle and the town it supported both became known as \\"Castlemagner.\\" Castlemagner remained in the hands of the Magner clan until 1652, when the Magners were dispossessed of their lands during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. A local legend tells how the contemporary inhabitant of the castle, one Robert Magner, was visited by Oliver Cromwell as part of an inquest related to the Parliamentarian reconquest of areas that had taken part in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Cromwell is said to have asked Robert Magner what was so special about the Magners that their lands should be spared confiscation, to which Robert Magner is said to have replied, \\"It is easy for dogs to walk on the graves of lions!\\" an insult that implicated Cromwell's commoner origins. A few days later, Robert Magner received a sealed letter from Cromwell via one of his servants, with instructions to show the letter to the local magistrate. Being suspicious, Robert Magner unsealed the letter to find that, instead of Cromwell's decision as to whether his lands would be confiscated, the letter merely stated \\"Hang the bearer.\\" Robert Magner is said to have resealed the letter and given it to someone loyal to Cromwell and then fled the country with his family. Other members of the Magner clan continued to live in both County Cork and County Limerick, but many emigrated over the succeeding centuries to the Americas, Australia and Europe. One branch of the Magner clan established a farm in Fairfax County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. in the late 1700s, as well as St. Mary's Catholic church. The church was used as a hospital Clara Barton during the Civil War to treat soldiers wounded at the battle of Bull Run. Castlemagner traded hands several times, and was expanded and renovated several times before being partially reduced to rubble during a rebellion in the 19th Century. After that, it was generally abandoned, although local Irish rebels hid caches of weapons and ammunition in the castle during the Irish revolution. Today, the ruins of the castle still stand in the town of Castlemagner. Notable people with the surname include: *Colm Magner, Canadian actor, writer, and director *Francis Joseph Magner, American Roman Catholic bishop *John Magner, baseball player *Michael Magner, soldier *Stubby Magner, baseball player *Ted Magner, former professional manager *Thomas F.

Timeline The station began broadcasting in the Gaza Strip on January 9, 2006 after Hamas won a sweeping victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections. On January 22, 2006, the Palestinian public prosecutor Ahmed Maghni decided to close down a television station because it did not have the necessary broadcast license, but the decision was never enforced.Hamas TV station shut down , news24.com, January 22, 2006 On December 29, 2008, during the Gaza War, Israeli aircraft repeatedly bombed the al-Aqsa television station headquarters in Gaza City. The building was completely destroyed, but the station continued to broadcast from a mobile TV unit On July 29, 2014, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, an Israeli air strike hit a media building housing al-Aqsa TV and al-Aqsa Radio channel in the centre of Gaza City early on in the morning. The television station continued to broadcast, but the radio station went silent. The radio station has since come back on the air. On November 12, 2018, Israel bombed the station building after launching at least five non-exploding missiles nearby as warnings to evacuate followed a surge in cross-border fighting. In 2019 after the Shin Bet assessed that al-Aqsa TV used coded messages to recruit operatives to Hamas, the Israeli Ministry of Defense designated al-Aqsa TV as a terrorist organization. Criticism In May 2013, Al-Aqsa TV became the focus of media scrutiny after a decision by the Newseum to honor two Al-Aqsa TV members as part of its ongoing memorial to journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2012. The U.S. government classifies Al-Aqsa TV as being controlled by Hamas, a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist,\\" and states that it \\"will not distinguish between a business financed and controlled by a terrorist group, such as Al-Aqsa Television, and the terrorist group itself.\\" According to the American Jewish organisation, the Anti-Defamation League, Al-Aqsa TV promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis and much of its programming glorifying violence is geared towards children. In regards to Al-Aqsa's television programme Tomorrow's Pioneers,Al Aqsa TV defies Hamas government , Reuters, May 13, 2007. following complaints by Israeli watchdog groups that triggered international scrutiny, Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti said he had asked Al-Aqsa TV to stop the broadcasts so the content could be reviewed. Despite Barghouti's call, Tomorrow's Pioneers went on the air as usual. In later episodes the co-host, a Mickey Mouse-like character named Farfour was killed by an Israeli interrogator, and was replaced by a bee named Naoul, who also died and was replaced by a rabbit character named Assoud. Assoud, in turn, was martyred and replaced by Nassur the bear. In May 2008, Bassem Naeem, the minister of health in the Hamas government in Gaza, responded to allegations of antisemitism in Al-Aqsa TV programmes. In his letter to The Guardian, Naeem stated that the Al-Aqsa Channel is an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Hamas government or the Hamas movement. In response, The Guardian columnist Alan Johnson wrote that Al-Aqsa TV cannot be a media institution independent of Hamas, because it is headed by Fathi Hamad, chairman of a Hamas-run company that also produces the Hamas radio station and its bi-weekly newspaper, and because, since 2007, Hamas had blocked Palestinian National Authority broadcasts into Gaza, which indicated that there is no independent media in Gaza. About reporting, Ibrahim Daher, a director at Al-Aqsa media operation, said they may not broadcast certain news. He said “If there was bad news during the war, or something went wrong, we just kept silent about it” and “now we mostly keep silent about the blockade, and that Hamas wasn't able to lift it during the war”.

The operation's success was limited as the Royal Navy forces, already heavily involved in the Napoleonic Wars, were unable to permanently suppress the strong fleets of the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. The expedition did achieve its short-term goals by destroying three Al Qasimi bases and over 80 vessels, including the largest Al Qasimi ship in the region, the converted merchant ship Minerva. Although operations continued into 1810, the British were unable to destroy every Al Qasimi vessel and by 1811 attacks had resumed, although at a lower intensity than previously. The operation against the Al Qasimi was a joint campaign by the Royal Navy and the fleet of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), with soldiers drawn from the garrison of Bombay. The expeditionary force, led by Captain John Wainwright in the Navy frigate HMS Chiffone, was despatched to the region, following an escalation in attacks on British shipping in the Persian Gulf after the French established diplomatic missions in Muscat and Tehran in 1807. These attacks not only threatened British trade links in the region, but also placed British relations with Oman and Persia in jeopardy at a time when French aspirations against British India were a cause for concern to the British government. Because the available charts of the Persian Gulf were inaccurate or incomplete at the time, Al Qasimi ships could hide from Wainwright's squadron in the uncharted inlets, a problem Wainwright reported upon his return that resulted in improved British cartography of the area. Background In the early nineteenth century, the Indian Ocean was an important link in the trade routes from British India to the United Kingdom, and Honourable East India Company (HEIC) merchant ships, known as East Indiamen, regularly crossed the ocean carrying millions of pounds worth of goods.Gardiner, p. 92 One of the most important ports for the Indian trade was Bombay, on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent, a significant hub for regional trade with its links to the Persian and Arab ports of the Persian Gulf. The ships that traded in the Persian Gulf were named \\"country ships\\" and were much smaller and weaker than the big East Indiamen. The British had long maintained a naval presence in the region, but the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 diverted much of the British strength in the Indian Ocean to the Dutch colonies of the Cape of Good Hope and Java and the French bases on Île Bonaparte and Île de France, leaving the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea largely undefended. In addition, convoy guardships were needed to escort the East Indiamen through hostile waters and the Navy presence in the Gulf was replaced by warships owned by the HEIC, part of the \\"Bombay Marine\\", the Company's naval arm.Gardiner, p. 88 Like the Royal Navy, the Bombay Marine were spread across many thousands of miles of ocean, often leaving the country ships in the Persian Gulf undefended. As French raiders were rare in the Gulf, few country ships operated in convoys and so they became targets for dhows and bhagalas operating from semi or completely independent harbours in Persia or along the Arabian Peninsula.Gardiner, p. 89 In 1805, the fleets of Al Qasimi captured two large ships, Shannon and Trimmer; the small boats of the Al Qasimi, swarmed the larger merchant ships and massacred the crews. The Al Qasimi converted Trimmer into a formidable pirate ship. When the HEIC warship Mornington, which carried 24 cannon, attempted to recapture Trimmer a few months later, nearly 40 Al Qasimi vessels attacked Mornington, which only just managed to escape destruction herself. =Diplomatic failures= A painting of a Baghlah. Lacking the available naval forces to launch a sizeable campaign in the Gulf, the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat. In February 1806, the young Sultan of Oman, Sa'id II ibn Sultan, signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising to bring an end to attacks originating from his territory, but by 1807 the French had installed consulates in Tehran and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement. In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia in an effort to secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government, but due to French influence in Tehran, he was unable to obtain any guarantees. A second diplomatic mission, sent from London in 1808 under Sir Harford Jones, was instructed to discuss the issue again, Jones deciding to travel to Bushire in Persia by sea. The diplomatic convoy consisted of the frigate HMS Nereide and two HEIC sloops, Sylph and Sapphire. The convoy was commanded by Captain Robert Corbet, who refused to wait for the slower sloops once the force had reached the Persian Gulf. Nereide arrived at Bushire on 14 October 1808. Jones completed his journey by land. Corbet returned south to the Straits of Hormuz, expecting to meet the sloops on his return journey. On 21 October, however, he discovered Sylph in the hands of Al Qasimi, who had swarmed the isolated warship, captured her and massacred her crew. Corbet was able to recapture the vessel and later rejoined Sapphire, which had been detached to conduct surveys of the Persian coast, but the operation demonstrated that it was the pirates who now controlled the Southern Persian Gulf. =Al Qasimi in the Arabian Sea= In April 1808, despite the brief deployment of the ship of the line HMS Albion, and frigates and to the Persian Gulf, Al Qasimi dhows appeared off Gujarat, raiding shipping at Surat before they were driven off by ships of the Bombay Marine. Later in the year, a huge fleet of 50 raiders appeared off Sind in the Arabian Sea and caused severe disruption to the regional trade. The fleet attacked merchant shipping along the Indian coast and even seized a large country ship named Minerva, massacring her crew and converting her into their flagship. At its height in early 1809, it was estimated that the Al Qasimi forces in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea included 60 large bhagalas, over 800 dhows, and employed 19,000 men, against just two HEIC ships, Mornington and Teignmouth. British operations A painting depicting British Expeditionary Force of 1809 landing troops at Ras Al Khaimah A painting depicting the sacking of the coastal town and port of Ras Al Khaimah. In the aftermath of the raid on Sind and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman. Forces were gathered at Bombay during the summer: the small HEIC warships, Mornington, , Ternate, Mercury, Nautilus, Prince of Wales, , Fury and the bomb ketch , and the Royal Navy frigates under Charles Gordon and Chiffone under John Wainwright, who was placed in command of the entire expeditionary force with the temporary rank of commodore. The force was complemented with troops seconded from the Bombay garrison, including a battalion of the 65th Foot, soldiers from the 47th Foot and an assortment of HEIC marines, engineers, artillery men and sepoys from the 2nd Bombay Native Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lionel Smith of the 65th.Gardiner, p. 90 The expeditionary force left Bombay on 17 September, intending to rendezvous at Muscat the following week. However, the force was repeatedly delayed during their passage, first with providing escorts to convoys of country ships in the Arabian Sea and subsequently with rescuing survivors of the Stromboli, which was so rotten that she fell apart in the ocean swell with considerable loss of life. When the force eventually arrived at Muscat in October, Sultan Sa'id informed Wainwright that over 20,000 Bedouin warriors had descended on the coast to join the Al Qasimi. Understanding that a protracted land campaign would be impossible with the forces available, Wainwright determined to make a series of small raids against the principle pirate bases in the area of the Straits of Hormuz, beginning with Ras Al Khaimah, to the north of the Strait on the Arabian coast.Marshall, p. 87 =Battle of Ras al-Khaimah= The British flotilla arrived off the independent town of Ras Al Khaimah on 11 November, discovering Minerva and a fleet of dhows in the harbour. The pirate fleet initially sailed out to attack the British but retreated once the size of the expeditionary force became clear. Minerva failed to make the return to port successfully and was wrecked on a sandbank, the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent her seizure by boats launched from Chiffone. Onshore, the Al Qasimi and their Bedouin allies (whose numbers are unknown, but were significantly less than 20,000) formed a series of emplaced defences around the town that were protected from offshore bombardment by sandbanks that blocked the approach of Wainwright's heavier warships. On 12 November, Wainwright deployed his smaller ships close inshore to bombard the town and provide cover for his troop dispositions offshore.Gardiner, p. 91 At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to the north of the emplaced positions, acting as a diversion while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's diversion distracted the Arab defenders, but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings in their path, which created a pall of smoke under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace. With the harbour secure, Wainwright ordered the squadron into the bay and there burnt over 50 Al Qasimi craft, including 30 large bhagalas.James, p. 204 Smith secured the town itself, burning warehouses and destroying the ammunition stores and fortifications around the town.Marshall, p. 88 The Arab forces, who had retreated after the fall of the palace, taunted the British from the surrounding hills but did not make any counterattacks. By the morning of 14 November, the operation was complete and the British force returned to their ships, having suffered light casualties of five killed and 34 wounded. Arab losses are unknown, but were probably significant, while the damage done to the Al Qasimi fleets was severe: over half of the largest and most dangerous vessels had been destroyed at Ras Al Khaimah. =Further operations= On 17 November, Wainwright ordered an attack on the Persian side town of Linga, the inhabitants fleeing at the arrival of the British fleet, and Wainwright's ships burning 20 dhows without opposition or casualties. Further exploration on the Southern Persian coast revealed that most harbours were empty. Wainwright's main target was Laft on Qeshm Island, which was a principal Al Qasimi stronghold.Marshall, p. 89 Sending ships to block the passages to the Qeshm Channel, Wainwright hired local pilots and descended on the town on 26 November. Following fruitless negotiations with local sheikhs, Wainwright ordered an attack on 27 November at 14:00, Smith's troops landing unopposed. Assuming the enemy to have fled, Smith's men approached the town's fortress, but a heavy fire was unleashed upon them as the British troops reached the gate. Despite heavy casualties, Smith was able to rally his forces and, with artillery support from the sloop Fury, forced the fort to surrender at sunset, after the sheik had been given guarantees he would not be harmed or taken prisoner.Marshall, p. 90 British landing parties burnt 11 large Arab vessels; the expeditionary force suffered 70 casualties in the fight at the fort. Arab losses were estimated at more than 50 killed in the fort alone. The town was turned over to Sheik Dewar, a local ruler who professed support for the British, and Wainwright withdrew his forces to Muscat in early December; all of the squadron reassembled there by Christmas. Only one further operation was launched, a successful attack on 3 January 1810 against the town of Shinas, which had rebelled against Sultan Sa'id and was swiftly recaptured and restored to him. Although minor naval operations against individual local ships continued into 1810, Wainwright and the main body of the squadron returned to Bombay in January, having considered their mission to inflict significant damage on the Al Qasimi forces in the Persian Gulf to have been a success.Clowes, p. 446 Aftermath The operation succeeded in its aim of reducing French influence in Oman and in dissuading the political forces in the region from encouraging attacks on British shipping, but it was unable to totally halt Al Qasimi activity in the Persian Gulf. By 1811, when much of the Royal Navy and HEIC forces in the Indian Ocean were diverted to Java, the Al Qasimi returned in force, although their destructive actions were weaker than before and rarely strayed into the Arabian Sea. Ultimately, it was not until the forces of the Ottoman Empire seized Medina in 1812, that some measure of control could be exerted over the tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Subsequent British intervention, both military and diplomatic, also reduced the threat of attacks during the nineteenth century. The campaign had a significant effect on British cartography of the region. Wainwright reported that the available charts of the Persian Gulf were inaccurate or incomplete, thus allowing Al Qasimi ships to hide from his squadron in uncharted inlets. The Bombay Marine had long been aware of this problem and had been developing charts of the region in the years leading up to the campaign, under David Ewen Bartholomew, who had been on Sapphire during Corbet's mission to the region and whose charts were published in 1810 as a response to these problems.Bartholomew, David Ewan, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J.

He was one of 11 American pilots who flew with RAF Fighter Command between 10 July and 31 October 1940, thereby qualifying for the Battle of Britain clasp to the 1939–45 campaign star. He was killed in action in September 1942. Early life Donahue was born to Frank and Ada Donahue on 29 January 1913 and was raised on a dairy farm near St. Charles, Minnesota. He learned to fly as a teenager at the Conrad Flying Service, operated by Max Conrad, an aviator known as the \\"Flying Grandfather\\" who had set numerous world records for distance and endurance. Becoming Minnesota's youngest commercially certificated pilot at the age of 19, Donahue helped Conrad run the flight school until he left to enlist in the Royal Air Force. He traveled to Canada, claimed to be Canadian, and was accepted.Battle of Britain pilots biographies Royal Air Force service After training with No. 7 Operational Training Unit, Donahue was assigned to No. 64 Squadron at RAF Kenley on 3 August 1940. Two days later, he saw combat against Messerschmitt Bf 109s off the French coast, and suffered serious damage to his aircraft, forcing him to land at RAF Hawkinge. Donahue thus became one of ten Americans to fly for the RAF in the Battle of Britain in 1940. A week later, on 12 August, Donahue was wounded in combat over England's south coast in his Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I. He was forced to bail out of his burning aircraft, and suffered burns and leg injuries. On 29 September 1940, Donahue was reassigned to No. 71 Squadron, one of three Eagle Squadrons, RAF units composed of American pilots, but did not see combat with that unit. Because of the lack of action, he requested to be reassigned to No. 64 Squadron, arriving back there on 23 October. In February 1941, Donahue served with No. 91 Squadron, although in March he went on leave back to the USA. In October 1941 he was posted to No. 258 Squadron in the Far East, and participated in the Battle of Singapore, also seeing action over Sumatra in February 1942, where he was wounded by ground fire. After returning to England in mid-1942, he rejoined No 91 Squadron as a flight commander. He became the first American in RAF history to lead an all-English squadron. He was credited with downing two enemy aircraft, with two more probables and one damaged. He was awarded four medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross on 27 March 1942.Commonwealth War Graves Commission The citation for the award read:London Gazette 27 March, 1942 =Death= Flight Lieutenant Donahue was killed in action on 11 September 1942, while a member of No. 91 Squadron.

It was destroyed by fire in 1895. The property changed hands, and a new mill, the Mische Mill, was built in 1908. The Mische Mill used an underwater turbine rather than the old waterwheel, and the owners altered the course of the stream and the bluff at the site. The mill was in operation until 1956. It was renamed the Dillard Mill in 1975 when the state took over management of the property. It was dedicated as a historic site in 1977. Restoration of the mill was completed in 1980.

Between 1990 and 1992, he served as the first speaker of the freely elected Slovenian Parliament.France Bučar, a Founding Father of Slovenian Democracy, Dies. 2015. STA (21 October). He was the one to formally declare the independence of Slovenia on 25 June 1991. He is considered one of the founding fathers of Slovenian democracy and independence. He is also considered, together with Peter Jambrek, the main author of the current Slovenian constitution.  Biography  Bučar was born in the small Upper Carniolan town of Bohinjska Bistrica in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, now in Slovenia. After graduating from the St. Stanislaus Institute in Šentvid near Ljubljana, he enrolled in the University of Ljubljana, where he studied law. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Bučar joined the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. In May 1942, he was arrested by the Italian Fascist authorities and sent to the Gonars concentration camp. After the Italian armistice, he returned home, but was arrested by the Nazis. In July 1944, he escaped and joined the Partisan resistance in southern Carinthia. In 1944, he joined the Communist Party of Slovenia, after a guarantee that he could keep his Roman Catholic religious affiliation. In May 1945, he was in the military unit that liberated Klagenfurt. After the end of the war, Bučar was included in the Slovenian division of the Corps of National Defence (later renamed to OZNA), a Yugoslav military counter-intelligence service. He was demobilized in 1946. In 1947 he graduated from law at the University of Ljubljana. Between 1947 and 1956, he worked as an expert on economic law in the government of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. In 1956, he obtained his PhD at the University of Zagreb and moved to Belgrade, where he worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce for one year. In 1957, he became a legal consultant of the Republic Assembly (State Parliament) of Slovenia. In 1959, he travelled to the United States as an Eisenhower Exchange Fellow, studying for ten months at the University of Philadelphia. In 1962, he started teaching public administration at the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana. During this period, Bučar started openly voicing his criticism to certain features of the Yugoslav Communist system, especially the excessive centralism and the not entirely successful economic integration of the different regions of Yugoslavia. In 1963, he was excluded from the Communist Party. He continued teaching at the university, where he grew increasingly popular among students; in an environment that was skeptical to non-Marxist social theories, Bučar expanded the curriculum by introducing system theory and the thought of Max Weber. Unlike other prominent faculty, Bučar assumed a skeptical attitude towards the student movement in the years 1968–1972. After 1968, he published numerous articles criticizing the establishment of large business systems in Yugoslavia, the frequent changes in the legal framework and the lack of clear responsibilities in decision-making processes. In 1976, he was fired from the university and was not allowed to publish anything for five years. In the 1980s, he started collaborating with the alternative journal Nova revija. In early 1988, he was invited to speak at the European Parliament; he caused a scandal in Yugoslavia by proposing to block all economic aid to the socialist countries of Eastern Europe in order to force them to adopt economic and political reform. In 1989, he was among the co-founders of the Slovenian Democratic Union, one of the first opposition parties to the Communist regime in Slovenia. After the victory of the DEMOS coalition in the first free elections in Slovenia in 1990, Bučar was elected as the Chairman of the Slovenian National Assembly. As the speaker of the Parliament and member of the Constitution Committee, Bučar had a crucial role in the adoption of the new Slovenian constitution. During this period, Bučar insisted on providing a sound legal basis for Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia, and rejected all voluntaristic political actions, gaining a label of legalist. After the split in the Slovenian Democratic Union, Bučar joined the Democratic Party led by Dimitrij Rupel. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in 1992 and became the chairman of the Committee for the Control over the Secret Service. In 1993, he left the party, remaining an independent MP until the elections of 1996. In 1996, he unsuccessfully ran as mayor of Ljubljana backed by a coalition of centre-right parties. In 2002, he unsuccessfully ran for President of Slovenia as an independent candidate. Until May 2012, he was the president of the International Paneuropean Union for Slovenia. In June 2012, Bučar stated in an interview for the magazine Mladina that the democracy in Slovenia was very weak, with the power concentrated in the hands of a few people, as in the time of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia before 1991, and that the Parliament was only a formal institution. Bučar lived in Ljubljana. Besides Slovene, he was fluent in German, English, and Serbo-Croatian. He died on 21 October 2015 at the age of 92.

It encompasses an area of 24,000 square kilometers, about 12% of Senegal, with a population in the 1990s of 1,060,000. The western portion contains the Saloum Delta, a river delta at the junction of the Saloum and the North Atlantic. It is in this region that the Saloum Delta National Park is located. 145,811 hectares of the Delta were designated a UNESCO Heritage Site in 2011. Because it flows so slowly, this delta allows saltwater to travel deep inland. Long ago, the Serer kingdoms of Sine and Saloum were rivals. In 1984, the area was divided into two administrative regions: Kaolack and Fatick. Economy Primary economic activities in the 2000s consisted of fishing, salt production, peanut farming, and millet farming. Transportation is difficult because of the many islands. A secondary economy is the construction of fishing boats. Ecosystem Salt wells (view from an ultralight aeroplane) Much of the region consists of mangrove swamps. The upper reaches of the rivers adjoin the Sahel region and are affected by its desertification. The salinity of the water increased during the 1970s instance of the Sahel drought and mismanagement of the rivers upstream has been described as a factor. Mangroves are disappearing, and freshwater fish are disappearing with them. The villagers have difficulty obtaining freshwater. Sometimes water pumps are donated by international organizations, but spare parts are difficult to find when the pumps fail. The change in water salinity is affecting the ecosystem as much as it is changing the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the region. Navigation Sine-Saloum has long been feared by even Europe's most distinguished mariners because the sandbanks move, particularly in Sangomar. This danger to outsiders has long protected the region and preserved its individual villages.

In the anonymous reply, The argument of the Letter concerning toleration, briefly consider’d and answer’d (1690) he advocated for the possible moderate use of force in matters of religion. He argued that the magistrate had power to restrain false religion.G. A. J. Rogers. Locke and the latitude-men, p. 245 in Richard W. F. Kroll, Richard Ashcraft, Perez Zagorin (editors) Philosophy, Science, and Religion in England, 1640-1700 (1991). Proast's main point was that coercion may not lead directly to changed understanding of religion; but indirectly certain uses of force may actually inculcate beliefs or make the mind receptive to them.Jeremy Waldron, God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations of John Locke's Political Thought (2002), p. 210. This argument aimed at undermining the premise of Locke's main argument on the ineffectiveness of intolerant behaviour and penal laws. Other arguments Proast makes include that, while civil societies were formed for primarily civil functions, they were not \\"the onely Ends for which they are designed.\\" Because Eternal and religious matter impact society's welfare, the magistrate can concern himself with those matters as well.Proast, Jonas. The argument of the letter concerned Toleration, briefly consider'd and answer'd.' 'Garland: New York, 1984. Locke reacted with A Second Letter concerning Toleration later in 1690, though under a pseudonym Philanthropus. Proast followed up with a reply in February 1691.Vere Claiborne Chappell (editor), The Cambridge Companion to Locke (1994) p. 18. In this later letter, Proast expanded on his arguments, arguing that good ideas have sometimes needed force, while bad ideas have expanded because of force: \\"Neither does the true Religion always prevail, without the Assistance of the Powers in being; nor is it always the true Religion which does so spread and prevail\\"Proast, Jonas. To the Author of the Second Letter Concerning Toleration. Garland: New York, 1984, 6 Proast also argues against Locke's suggestion that each national religion sees itself as equally valid for civil protection, since French Catholicism was a false religion, French laws requiring subjects to attend mass \\"can be no Laws, which require men to go to Mass; unless Man can make Laws against God's Laws\\" Proast, Jonas. To the Author of the Second Letter Concerning Toleration. Garland: New York, 1984, 44 After a pause Locke produced a Third Letter later in 1692. It was eight years before Proast replied with Three Letters of Toleration (1704). In that year Locke died, and his Fourth Letter was a posthumous work. As a consequence of the exchanges with Proast, Locke had to sharpen his arguments, and moved further onto the ground of religious skepticism.John P.

She was one of the mediums involved in the cross-correspondences, in which messages from the deceased Mary Catherine Lyttleton (who died on 21 March 1875) were supposedly transmitted by automatic writing to her lover Arthur Balfour. She had a long association with the writer and spiritualist Geraldine Cummins. She died on 31 August 1956 at her home in Kensington, London. Her papers are held in the archive of the National Library of Wales*Archives Network Wales After her death Cummins published the book Swan on a Black Sea, containing their correspondence, along with messages received from the alleged spirit of \\"Mrs Willett\\" describing the afterlife. However, according to the psychical researcher Eric Dingwall information published in Cummins' scripts allegedly from Willet were discovered to be erroneous.Eric Dingwall. (1985). The Need for Responsibility in Parapsychology: My Sixty Years in Psychical Research. In Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. pp. 161–174. Prometheus Books \\"An example of what is necessary can be seen in the recently published scripts of the late Miss Geraldine Cummins purporting to emanate from the famous SPR automatist Mrs. Willett. This book was supported by at least three ex-presidents of the SPR, one of whom wrote a long preface to it of over 70 pages. In the course of the communications two odd and startlingly evidential items of information, involving a word and a phrase, were given by the medium, and the editor of the book assured us both that these were actually in the diaries left by the deceased communicator. Fortunately, in this case the original diaries had been preserved. They were examined, and their owner stated that neither the word nor the phrase was to be found in them.\\" The anthropologist and skeptic Edward Clodd wrote that the explanation for the cross-correspondences was the subconscious mind of the medium not spirits. According to Clodd many of the messages were \\"inconsequential rubbish\\". Margaret Verrall was a well-educated classicist who had studied Latin and Greek with her husband. Clodd suggested that Willet had communicated with Verrall and looked up references in classical lore.Clodd, Edward. (1917). The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism.

Between 1937 and 1939, die Meuten in Leipzig had, according to the Gestapo, an estimated 1500 members.  Background  The Meuten became active in Leipzig around 1937, and such as members of Blasen they were blue collar workers, apprentices and shop clerks. When they were not congregating in cinemas, public swimming pools, or formerly Communist neighborhood pubs, they liked to hike and discuss politics. There are reports of die Meuten in Dresden and other Saxon towns for certain, but the records of the activity is incredibly scarce. = Clothing = The group wore motley clothes, with the males wearing plaid shirts, white socks and Lederhosen in the summer, and slalom shirts and ski pants in the winter. Females wore long blue skirts of the traditional youth movement. Red kerchiefs were used as pro-left sympathies were also seen in the group.  Communist leanings  The group had Communist roots and listened to Radio Moscow and stretched the customary bündisch bias for everything Russian, while romanticizing the conditions in the Soviet Union. The group also used a vulgarized Russian greeting of \\"bud cadoff\\" instead of \\"Heil Hitler.\\" The group held strong SPD and KPD roots.  Nazi reaction  They were dealt with ruthlessly by the Nazis. A group of members were convicted in October 1938 and sentenced to between one and five years of incarceration, due to the Meuten being connected to Communism and at the time Germany held legislation that forbade the resurrection of any of the Weimar political parties.

It is part of a Carmelite monastery, also known as the Sanctuary of the Eleona (). The Church of the Pater Noster stands right next to the ruins of the 4th-century Byzantine Church of Eleona. The ruins of the Eleona were rediscovered in the 20th century and its walls were partially rebuilt. Today, France claims ownership of the land on which both churches and the entire monastery are standing under the Ottoman capitulations and further it claims this has been formalised by the Fischer-Chauvel Agreement of 1948, which has not been ratified by Israel. Biblical background The 2nd-century Acts of John mentions the existence of a cave on the Mount of Olives associated with the teachings of Jesus, but not specifically the Lord's Prayer. History The Grotto, that is believed to be a place where Jesus taught the Lord's Prayer to His disciples. =Constantine and the Byzantine period= The modern Church of the Pater Noster is built right next to the site of a fourth-century basilica commissioned by Constantine I to commemorate the Ascension of Jesus Christ. It was built under the direction of Constantine's mother Helena in the early 4th century, who named it the Church of the Disciples. The pilgrim Egeria is the oldest surviving source referring to it as the Church of the Eleona (Greek for olive grove) in the late 4th century. The church is mentioned by the Bordeaux pilgrim in the Itinerarium Burdigalense circa 333, and the historian Eusebius of Caesarea recounts that Constantine constructed a church over a cave on the Mount of Olives that had been linked with the Ascension.The Land and the Book. The church survived intact until it was destroyed by Persians in 614. =Crusader church= The memory of Jesus' teaching remained associated with this site, and during the Crusades it became exclusively associated with the teaching of the Lord's Prayer. The Crusaders built a small oratory amid the ruins in 1106, and a full church was constructed in 1152, thanks to funds donated by the Danish Bishop Svend of Viborg, who is buried inside the church.Suhm, Peter Frederik (1793): Historie af Danmark, vol. VI, fra Aar 1147 til 1152, Copenhagen: Brødrende Berlings Trykkeri, page 102. The Crusader-era church was heavily damaged during Sultan Saladin's siege of Jerusalem in 1187, eventually being abandoned and falling into ruin by 1345. =Modern church= In 1851, the remaining stones of the 4th-century church were sold for tombstones in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The site was acquired by Princess Aurelia Bossi de la Tour d'Auvergne (1809–1889) in the second half of the 19th century, and a search for the cave mentioned by early pilgrims began. In 1868, she built a cloister and founded a Carmelite convent in 1872. A convent church was erected in the 1870s. In 1910, the foundations over the venerated cave were finally found, partly stretching beneath the modern cloister. The convent was moved nearby and reconstruction of the Byzantine church began in 1915. The reconstruction was stopped in 1927 when funds ran out, and the renewed Church of Eleona remains unfinished. The small 19th-century convent church stands at the east end of the modern cloister, while the partly reconstructed Byzantine church stands west of it. The tomb which Princess Aurelia Bossi prepared for herself during her lifetime stands at the entrance of the modern church. She died in Florence in 1889, and her remains were brought to the church in 1957, according to her last wish. Design and layout Altar at Church of the Pater Noster The 4th-century Byzantine church has been partially reconstructed and provides a good sense of what the original was like. The church's dimensions are the same as the original's and the garden outside the three doors outlines the atrium area. The church is unroofed and has steps that lead into a grotto where some Christians believe that Jesus revealed to his disciples his prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem and the second coming. Unfortunately, the cave containing the grotto partially collapsed when it was discovered in 1910. It also cuts partly into a 1st-century tomb. Left of the church's south door is a baptistery paved with mosaic. The 19th-century cloister is modelled on the Campo Santo at Pisa, Italy.. The walls of the cloister, convent church and the partially reconstructed Eleona church are all used to display plaques that bear the Lord's Prayer in a total of well over 100 different languages and dialects. Location The church is located in the At-Tur district of Jerusalem, which has a population of about 18,000 mostly Muslim Arabs, with a small Christian minority.

General John Joseph \\"Jack\\" Pershing lead the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I and attained the rank of General of the Armies. Pershing was born on a farm outside Laclede, but lived in the home from age six to adulthood. The historic site preserves and interprets the boyhood home and the one-room Prairie Mound School at which he taught for a year before attending West Point Military Academy. The home has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1969, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. History The Gothic Revival style home was constructed circa 1857, and purchased by the Pershing family in 1866. Pershing remained in the home after completing high school, taking a teaching position at nearby Prairie Mound School until he left to attend the First District Normal School in Kirksville, Missouri. After graduating he returned to Laclede and taught at the Prairie Mound School again until being accepted to West Point. The Pershing home was acquired by the state of Missouri in 1952 when it was learned the owner at that time was intending to raze the building. On September 13, 1960, as part of a national centennial celebration of Pershing's birth, the home was officially dedicated in his memory and the soldiers who served under him. Activities and amenities The home features period-specific furniture from the mid- and late-1800s as well as a small museum chronicling the life of Pershing. A few steps away, the restored Prairie Mound school also offers interpretive displays. Tours are available. The garden features a Wall of Honor with the names of war veterans as well as a life-size statue of Pershing (pictured at right) created in the 1950s by sculptor Carl Mose.

The park's namesake, Graham Cave, is a cave in St. Peter sandstone with an entrance wide and high and an extent of about into the hillside. The cave protects an historically important Pre- Columbian archaeological site dating back to as early as 10,000 years ago. Visitors are allowed up to the entrance of the cave where interpretive signs point out significant discoveries. The park includes the Graham Cave Glades Natural Area which protects an area of sandstone and dolomite glades with a rich diversity of glade species. The park is adjacent to Interstate 70 from which the entrance to the cave can be glimpsed during foliage-free months. History In 1847, settler Robert Graham purchased the property containing the cave, and the land remained in the Graham family until it was donated to the state for a state park in 1964 by Frances Graham Darnell, Robert's great- granddaughter. Robert Graham's son, D. F. Graham, sheltered hogs in the cave and became interested in archeology from the artifacts he found there. His collection of artifacts was offered by his son Benjamin to the University of Missouri, which investigated the cave in 1930. Benjamin's son-in-law, Wade Darnell, was persuaded to delay plans to enlarge the shelter for his livestock in 1948 so that archeological excavations could be made. The University of Missouri and the Missouri Archaeological Society excavated the cave between 1949 and 1961. The importance of the findings in that period resulted in the site being the first archaeological site in the United States to be designated a National Historical Landmark in 1961. Frances Graham Darnell donated the cave and surrounding land to the state of Missouri in 1964 to be a state park. Artifacts recovered from the cave indicate that the cave's inhabitants used spears to hunt and fish. A ring of smaller stones surrounding a larger stone was found in the cave, suggesting that ceremonies were held. Pottery shows that more recent Native Americans also lived in the cave. Activities and amenities The state park offers access to the Loutre River for boating and fishing, hiking trails named Fern Ridge (), Loutre River (), and Indian Glade (), and camping facilities.

Constituency background Adkins had represented Middleton since winning the seat at the 1906 general election.Who was Who, OUP 2007 At the 1918 general election Middleton was merged with Prestwich to create a new seat and Adkins retained it as a supporter of the coalition government of David Lloyd George and Bonar Law, having received The Coalition Coupon, despite the fact that he had previously acted as a loyal Asquithian.Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party; Cornell University Press, 1966 pp 160–161 In 1918 Adkins had faced only Labour opposition and had won by a majority of 8,330 votes.The Times House of Commons, 1919; Politico's Publications, 2004 p69 By-election truce When the by-election was first occasioned, it had apparently been the intention of the Labour Party to contest it. The Conservatives were content to stand aside again for their coalition partner. Labour were planning to put up Alderman Matthew Burrow Farr of Mossley as their candidate but owing to an outbreak of smallpox in the constituency a by- election truce was called on the advice of the medical authorities so as to avoid the need for the usual door to door canvassing and holding of public meetings.The Times, 15 November 1920 p9 This opportunity to withdraw with honour may have suited Labour given the difficulty in winning the seat they faced against the combined Liberal and Conservative electorate lined up behind Adkins. Result In the event therefore no candidate stepped forward to challenge Sir Ryland Adkins and he was returned unopposed. Adkins, 1920–1923 Adkins continued to represent the constituency until 1923, the second general election after the fall of the Coalition when he lost to the Tories by 529 votes in a three-cornered contest, with Alderman Farr for Labour and A N Stewart-Sandeman for the Conservatives.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p401 References See also  * List of United Kingdom by- elections Category:1920 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1920 in England Category:1920s in Lancashire Category:Elections in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury Category:Elections in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Greater Manchester constituencies Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lancashire constituencies Category:Unopposed ministerial by- elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom (need citation) Category:November 1920 events ","title":"1920 Middleton and Prestwich by-election"},{"id":"20916894","text":"Lake Cumberland Regional Airport is a public use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) south of the central business district of Somerset, a city in Pulaski County, Kentucky, United States.

This article discusses models using a wave equation with a dissipative term. Heat conduction in a Newtonian context is modelled by the Fourier equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}~=~\\\\alpha~ abla^2\\\\theta , where θ is temperature,Some authors also use T, φ,... t is time, α = k/(ρ c) is thermal diffusivity, k is thermal conductivity, ρ is density, and c is specific heat capacity. The Laplace operator,\\\\scriptstyle abla^2, is defined in Cartesian coordinates as : abla^2~=~\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}~+~\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}~+~\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z^2} . This Fourier equation can be derived by substituting Fourier’s linear approximation of the heat flux vector, q, as a function of temperature gradient, :\\\\mathbf{q}~=~-k~ abla\\\\theta , into the first law of thermodynamics :\\\\rho~c~\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}~+ ~ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q}~=~ 0 , where the del operator, ∇, is defined in 3D as : abla ~=~\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}~\\\\mathbf{i}~+~\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}~\\\\mathbf{j}~+~\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z}~\\\\mathbf{k} . It can be shown that this definition of the heat flux vector also satisfies the second law of thermodynamics, : abla\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{q}}{\\\\theta}\\\\right)~+~\\\\rho~\\\\frac{\\\\partial s}{\\\\partial t}~=~\\\\sigma, where s is specific entropy and σ is entropy production.  Hyperbolic model  It is well known that the Fourier equation (and the more general Fick's law of diffusion) is incompatible with the theory of relativity for at least one reason: it admits infinite speed of propagation of heat signals within the continuum field. For example, consider a pulse of heat at the origin; then according to Fourier equation, it is felt (i.e. temperature changes) at any distant point, instantaneously. The speed of information propagation is faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which is inadmissible within the framework of relativity. To overcome this contradiction, workers such as Cattaneo, Vernotte, Chester, and others proposed that Fourier equation should be upgraded from the parabolic to a hyperbolic form, :\\\\frac{1}{C^2}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\theta}{\\\\partial t^2}~+~\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}~=~ abla^2\\\\theta. In this equation, C is called the speed of second sound (i.e. the fictitious quantum particles, phonons). The equation is known as the hyperbolic heat conduction (HCC) equation. Mathematically, it is the same as the telegrapher's equation, which is derived from Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics. For the HHC equation to remain compatible with the first law of thermodynamics, it is necessary to modify the definition of heat flux vector, q, to :\\\\tau_{_0}~\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{q}}{\\\\partial t}~+~\\\\mathbf{q}~=~-k~ abla\\\\theta, where \\\\scriptstyle\\\\tau_{_0} is a relaxation time, such that \\\\scriptstyle C^2~=~ \\\\alpha/ \\\\tau_{_0} . The most important implication of the hyperbolic equation is that by switching from a parabolic (dissipative) to a hyperbolic (includes a conservative term) partial differential equation, there is the possibility of phenomena such as thermal resonance and thermal shock waves.

Built in 1878 in the Neo- Gothic style as the living house for the owners of the manor, the Kropotkin family. The building has changed its owners and functions several times. Since 1993, the Sigulda Region Council has been located in the castle. History The manor center began to develop in the fore-castle area of Sigulda Medieval Castle during the 17th century. There are still a few remaining 18th and 19th century buildings built during the ownership of the Von Borghs and Kropotkins. These are the Summer Castle, the New Castle, the White Castle, the vagar's (supervisor of serfs) house, the servants' house, a barn, a laundry house and a vegetable and fruit basement. The manor center is enclosed by chipped boulder walls with a splendid gate structure. The New Castle was built during the time of Duchess Olga and Duke Dimitry Kropotkins from 1878 until 1881 using the materials from an older building which stood here during the 17th century. The master’s house was built in neo-gothic style by Jānis Mengelis from Cēsis. The planning and the shape of the house is simple. The architectural and artistic value of the castle is achieved through the successful use of Gothic forms and the color shades from the recycled chipped boulders. Looking through any window, you will have a panoramic view of the Gauja valley including the ruins of Sigulda castle. Farther away you will see the ruins of Krimulda and Turaida. On the opposite side, there is a neatly landscaped yard. During World War I this building was destroyed. In 1922, following the agrarian reforms, New Castle became the Writers’ Castle because it was used by the Latvian Union of Writers and Journalists. The building was in unusable condition after the war so the Union had to invest a large amount of money for restoration. In the 1920s and 1930s, full room and board was offered to writers and literary types as well as other visitors. In 1934 the castle was acquired by the Latvian Press Society. From 1936 to 1937, major reconstruction work was done under the leadership of architect August Birkhans. Building plans were completely re-drawn. The overlooking tower was heightened, the terrace around the building was expanded and a new balcony was added to the second floor. Inside, a new modern-age interior design was installed. It became the most notable example of national modern design in the Baltic region. Many famous artists of that time such as Niklāvs Strunke, Pēteris Ozoliņš, Kārlis Sūniņš, and Vilhelms Vasariņš took part in creating it. Pictures of the castle were found in French art magazines as the press at the time would report. The Writers Castle became a popular visitor's destination after the renovation. In 1938, the monument of Atis Kronvalds, made by Teodors Zalkalns, was unveiled at the front of the New Castle. Atis Kronvalds was a teacher and a publicist and helped initiate the second wave of the New Latvian movement. During World War II, the New Castle was used as a headquarters for the Nord division of the German army. After the war, the USSR Council of Ministers made it a recreation house for high state officials. In 1953, the Health Department of the Latvian SSR established the Sigulda rehabilitation center which was in operation until the restoration of Latvian independence. From 1993 through 2002, the New Castle held the Sigulda City council and then, beginning in 2003, the Sigulda District Council. Next to the New Castle, there is a yellow house known as the Summer Castle. It was built at the turn of the 18th or 19th century in the style of classicism. The elongated wooden house was built by a master-builder from Cēsis, a man called the last of the Livs of Vidzeme, Mārcis Sārums. Initially, Kropotkin's family used the building as a personal orthodox church after the completion of the New Castle in 1881. Services were held by the orthodox priest of Ledurga parish. The building also came under reconstruction when the Writers and Journalists Union obtained ownership and remodelled it to become a boarding- house. An art gallery was installed in the former brewery of Sigulda manor. Artist Elmārs Gaigalnieks has, over the past 12 years, created the unique technique of sand art which is in continuous development. In this special atmosphere, you can view the sand art and three-dimensional installations. There is also a unique collection of sand samples from five continents.

It is maintained by the Université Montpellier 1 and open afternoons daily except Monday; admission is free. The garden was established in 1593 by letters patent from King Henri IV, under the leadership of Pierre Richer de Belleval, professor of botany and anatomy. It is France's oldest botanical garden, inspired by the Orto botanico di Padova (1545) and in turn serving as model for the jardin des plantes de Paris (1626). The Montagne de Richer lies within the garden's oldest section, which also now contains a systematic garden. The garden was expanded twice in the 19th century. Its orangery was designed by Claude-Mathieu Delagardette (1762–1805) and completed in 1804, the arboretum was landscaped in 1810, and the English Garden, with pool and greenhouse, dates from 1859. The monumental Martins greenhouse opened in 1860. Today the garden contains about 2,680 plant species, including 500 native to the Mediterranean region. Of these roughly 2,000 species are grown outdoors, and 1,000 under glass. Major sections of the garden are as follows: * Montagne de Richer - a Cistaceae collection * Systematic garden - plants classified according to the Bentham & Hooker system, 1883, complemented by Elias Durand, 1887. * Medicinal plants - about 250 plants of traditional Mediterranean medicines and herbs * Succulents - about 50 species * Orangery and cold greenhouse - about 110 species * Palm trees - 9 varieties, including Brahea armata and Butia capitata. * Arboretum - Fine mature specimens including Acer neapolitanum, Celtis sinensis, Cinnamomum camphora, Cupressus goveniana, Cupressus macrocarpa, Cupressus sempervirens, Quercus calliprinos, Quercus coccifera, and Zelkova serrata. The male Ginkgo biloba, planted in the late 18th century, is particularly noteworthy. * Greenhouse - 423 species in three rooms, including a tropical room with large central basin for aquatic plants, and two temperate rooms. Of interest are the collections of ferns, Bromeliaceae, and Orchidaceae, with good collections from French Guiana. * Naturalized plants - including Delphinium requienii, Fumaria bicolor, Fumaria kralikii, Linaria reflexa, Modiola caroliniana, Salpichroa origanifolia, Symphytum orientale, and Stipa trichotoma.

The parish is in the Vale of Pewsey which carries the upper section of the Salisbury Avon; to the south the parish extends into Salisbury Plain. History A settlement of 29 households and one mill was recorded at Meresdene in Domesday Book of 1086. The Victoria County History traces ownership of the mill – on the Avon in the north of the parish – from the 15th century until 1970, when it was still grinding corn, albeit by electrical power; the property was sold for residential use in 1975. The three-storey mill of 1842 and adjoining two-storey house, both in red brick, were recorded as Grade II listed in 1988. Holders of Marden manor included Gilbert Basset and his brothers Fulk (bishop of London) and Philip, all in the 13th century; and Hugh le Despenser the elder from 1298 to 1326. After Despenser's execution, the manor was granted to Queen Isabella and then Queen Philippa. Later holders included the earls of Abingdon in the 17th and 18th centuries. The present manor house, in Flemish brickwork, is from the early 19th century. John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–1872) described Marden as follows: > MARDEN, or MERTON, a village and a parish in Devizes district, Wilts. The > village stands on the river Avon, 2 miles SW of Woodborough r. station, and > 6 ESE of Devizes; and has a post office, of the name of Marden, under > Devizes. The parish comprises 1,278 acres.

The church is ancient; has two Norman arches and an embattled > tower; and is finely ornate, both without and within. There is a national > School.Marden at visionofbritain.org.uk The population of the parish peaked in the second half of the 19th century, with 247 recorded at the 1871 census, then fell to 152 by 1901. A small National School was built c. 1844; the school was closed in 1925 and its premises were converted for residential use. Marden has been suggested as a possible location for the Battle of Marton (871).  Parish church  All Saints' Church The parish church of All Saints stands on a small rise in the northwest of the village. The body of the church dates from the 12th century, and the south doorway and chancel arch survive from that period. In the 15th century the nave was largely rebuilt, and the chancel and tower added. Restoration in 1885 by C.E. Ponting saw the rebuilding of the chancel. Pevsner states \\"Nave and chancel externally all Ponting's\\". Other work in the 19th century included the replacement of the south porch, re-roofing of the chancel, and rebuilding of the top section of the tower. Today the tower is in limestone ashlar, with a stair-tower to the southeast; the nave is sarsen and greensand rubble with limestone quoins and dressings, on sarsen foundations; and the chancel is flint with limestone banding. The plain octagonal font is from the 13th or 14th century, and the pulpit, also octagonal, is from the 17th. In the tower are six bells: one dated 1627 and three from the 18th century. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1962. The first written mention of the church is in 1205. Later in that century the church belonged to Bradenstoke Priory. The benefice was united with Chirton in 1923, and the vicar was to reside at the parsonage house in Chirton. From 1951, the vicar also held the benefice of Patney, which was added to the united benefice in 1963. The three benefices were separated in 1976. Today the church is served by the Cannings and Redhorn Team Ministry, which covers a group of eight churches in the Vale of Pewsey. Parish registers survive from 1684 and are kept in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre.UK Genealogy Archives: Marden, Wiltshire Local government The civil parish elects a parish council.

He was the grandson of prominent unionist Saumyamoorthi Thondaman. He was the leader of the Ceylon Workers' Congress, a Member of Parliament representing the Nuwara Eliya District and was an advocate for the Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka. His career as a politician spanned over 20 years, holding several ministerial portfolios in different governments. He was regarded as one of the prominent politicians from Nuwara Eliya. Early life and education Born on 29 May 1964, his father was Ramanathan Thondaman, the son of Saumyamoorthi Thondaman. He received his primary and secondary education at the Royal College, Colombo. Political career Thondaman entered politics in 1985 and he entered the mainstream politics when he contested the 1994 general elections from the Nuwara Eliya Electoral District representing representing the United National Party and was elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka. He succeeded his grandfather Saumyamoorthi Thondaman as the leader of the Ceylon Workers' Congress party in 1999. He was consistently re-elected parliament in all elections held from 1994 to 2015, holding his parliamentary seat and the post of party leader until his death. He also served as a cabinet minister of UNP for a brief stint and joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party later in 2016. In December 2019, he was appointed as the cabinet minister of Community Empowerment and Estate Infrastructure Development by the Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. During his political career, he was well known for his long time ally with former President Mahinda Rajapakse. He was due to contest at the upcoming parliamentary election representing Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna from the Nuwara Eliya district. Death Thondaman was admitted to Thalangama Base Hospital in the evening after being reported to have succumbed to serious injuries from a fall at his residence on 26 May 2020. He was later confirmed to have died following a heart attack at the age of 55. He died just 3 days before his 56th birthday. On the same day before his death, he had met with new Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay in order to discuss bilateral cooperation for community development. He served as the cabinet minister of Community Empowerment and Estate Infrastructure Development until his death. His body was also laid in the parliament until 31 May 2020.

Stepan Voyevodsky was born in Smolensk Governorate in the family of a retired Army officer. He joined the Naval Cadets Corps in 1818, and was commissioned as midshipman () in March 1822. Voyevodsky served in the Baltic Fleet until 1834. In 1824 Voyevodsky sailed to Iceland, in 1825 to Mediterranean Sea. In 1827–1830 lieutenant Voyevodsky served on Jezekiel, a ship-of-the-line of count Login Geiden's Mediterranean squadron; he participated in the Battle of Navarino in October 1827 and in the naval blockade of the Dardanelles during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. After four peaceful seasons with the Baltic Fleet (1830–1834) Voyevodsky was transferred from the Navy to the Russian-American Company. He crossed Asia by land, reaching Okhotsk, and sailed to Novoarkhangelsk with Sitka. He commanded Sitka and Yelena until 1839 and was promoted to captain-lieutenant in 1837. In 1841 he sailed from the Pacific to Saint Petersburg, and returned to the Baltic Fleet. By 1849 he attained the rank of captain () and was in command of a ship-of-the-line. In the beginning of the Crimean War (July 1853), Voyevodsky was appointed Governor of Russian America. He reached Novoarkhangelsk on board of Sitka in April 1854; the ship soon seized by the British. Apart from this accident, the war did not hurt Russian America directly: lands of Russian America and the British Hudson's Bay Company were declared neutral and remained neutral throughout the war. Voyevodsky remained in charge of Russian America until June 1859; upon his return to Russia he was appointed commander of Astrakhan port and military governor of Astrakhan. Voyevodsky attained the rank of full admiral in 1877; he died in Saint Petersburg and was buried at the Smolenskoye Cemetery.

He is professor emeritus at the Department of informatics of Umeå University in Sweden.  Biography  Ivanov was born in Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but grew up and was educated in Italy and Brazil. In 1961 he moved to Sweden, where he worked as an electronic engineer in the telecommunications and computer industries, with assignments in France and the USA. In 1972 he obtained a PhD degree in informatics at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences of the Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University. He has conducted further studies in political economy, business administration, and statistics, and obtained a degree in psychology at Lund University His study led to positions at Stockholm University and Linköping University. In 1984 he was appointed to a chair as full professor of informatics at Umeå University. He is professor emeritus since 2002. From 1991 to 2004 he was a scientific advisor to the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen). In 1997 he was \\"president-elect\\" of ISSS, the International Society for the Systems Sciences, a position which he later had to relinquish because of other demanding duties.  Work  In his research and teaching, Ivanov focused initially on the application of systems theory to information systems and especially on practical problems of quality-control of information in industrial databases. More specifically, his early work concentrated on the issue of accuracy and precision of databases as they are related to system development and maintenance, where the systems approach is done in terms of socially framed technical systems, conceived as a further development of the \\"Berkeley school\\" in the tradition of professor C. West Churchman.Ivanov acknowledges (see further references in this article) that he has been partially influenced by Churchman's work as it is summarized in , and The following are some notable ideas in Ivanov's work which eventually lead to ethical and theological organizational issues with consequences for practical applications. In order to clarify these ideas, they will be illustrated with references to Ivanov's own work and to literature upon which it relies. = Quality-control of information = This was the subject of the doctoral dissertation.Ivanov (1972). It resulted in widened definitions of information accuracy and precision,Overriding by means of these two basic concepts other unmeasurable analogues or derivatives like validity, reliability, dependability, correctness, timeliness, exactness, usefulness, consistency, authenticity, completeness, degree of detail, recency, controllability, goodness, trueness, relevance, pertinence, acceptability, refinement, approximation, currency, rightness, coverage, etc. that are grounded in the philosophy of science, especially theory of measurement or metrology,As summarized by Churchman, in The design of inquiring systems, op.cit., chapter 9 on \\"Singerian inquiring systems\\". and its elusive but extremely important concept of error,With some historical roots in (German original: Complexity increases well beyond probability and statistics with the analysis of chance as in (ISSN 1660-1084, , see e.g. Galván, J.M. \\"The case in Christian theological anthropology\\", pp. 129–141.) In a research report whose English title is From statistical control to control of statistics (1976), Ivanov summarizes such insights with a powerful quote from Clarence Irving Lewis: in order to make them applicable to technical systems which are framed in a social context. Quality of data is then seen as the degree of agreement between judgments of data obtained after periodical monitored negotiations in the context of maximum possible disagreement. For this purpose, the definition of data itself, i.e. data elements and data structures in a systems context, was widened to conceive data as information and knowledge.Ivanov (1995) This part of Ivanov's work parallels, and can be seen as a theoretical contribution to groupthink, to the wisdom of crowds and the Wiki-idea itself.Wiki-Collaborative Web Application It required, however, some reservations for problems of social psychology as implied by the study of popular mind.The subtitle of a classic by Gustave Le Bon, The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind (1895), available on the Internet. Cf. Søren Kierkegaard's criticism of Publikum as crowd in (Two Ages: A Literary Review), translated as . Its conclusions appear to be relevant also for general data quality, information quality, accuracy and precision, and control of control, the theoretical framework for democratic security and auditing of audit whose importance become obvious in times of financial and political crisis when systemic concepts of effectiveness and progress are put into question.To appreciate the complexity of effectiveness, controversially synonym of efficacy as acknowledged in Ivanov's as in Churchman's work, see , incorporated into Ivanov, K., & Ciborra, C. U. (1998). East and West of IS. In W. R. J. Baets (Ed.), Proc. of the Sixth European Conference on Information Systems ECIS'98, University of Aix-Marseille III, Aix-en-Provence, June 4–6, 1998. Vol. IV (pp. 1740–1748). Granada & Aix-en-Provence: Euro-Arab Management School & Institut d'Administration des Enterprises IAE. In particular, the concept of quality-control of information contributed to the theoretical base of the so-called Scandinavian school of participatory design as related to computer-supported cooperative work by anchoring the politically and ideologically motivated action research which flourished in the seventies to a secure scientific conception of information and systems.Ivanov. (1995). The concept emphasizes the fundamental role of disagreement and of what in statistics is known as outliers. In doing so it accounts for the sociopsychological and political personalistic conflict between the individual and the collective.As conceived by Ivanov under the avowed influence of Carl Jung, cf. See also Argumentum ad populum, Groupthink, and Political correctness. This early work was supposed to be completed with a comprehensive research program on the essence of computers seen as a capital-intensive industrial embodiment of the formal sciences of logic, mathematics, and geometry. The purpose was to grasp the why and the whither of the formalization of society which is hidden under an aestheticist mask of audiovisual and tactile graphical interfaces and smart human-computer interaction. One main question was whether you should care about what is presupposed and what happens when you press the button, the keyboard's tangent, or touch the screen, while innocently assuming that you are just communicating or interacting. Or is it a matter of naively understood trust? especially chapter 8 on \\"Invisible technicians\\". The research program could not be realized except for the production and survey of an extensive bibliography which was made available to the research community.See the program overview titled Essence of computers & presuppositions of support at Ivanov's research Website. = Hypersystems = This was a further development of the concept of social systems of the Berkeley school mentioned above, with the intent to prevent that its applications in systems design be reductively transformed into other approaches such as communicative action in the Kantian tradition, participatory design or co-design in the liberal tradition, conflict in the Marxian tradition or, lately, phenomenological and post- phenomenological postmodernism (and perspectivism, as in postmodern philosophy), social networks, actor-network theory (and its \\"non-modernism\\"), and design aestheticism.Ivanov's criticisms are found, for instance, in Ivanov (1991) and Ivanov (2001) Regarding design estheticism that followed and replaced Marxian trends in Scandinavia, Ivanov adduces the critique of post- Marxian aestheticism by especially pp. 16-30, 77-133, 263-282.) Ivanov perceives trends in computer and information science (where the design concept is grounded in design theory rather than systems theory) as related to variants of the intuitionism impersonated by Henri Bergson, or to problematic revisions of Aristotelian phronesis as expounded by Aubenque, P. (1993). La prudence chez Aristote, avec un appendice sur la prudence chez Kant [Prudence according to Aristotle, with an appendix on prudence according to Kant]. Quadrige/PUF. (First ed. 1963.) = Security = Ivanov views the problem of political power as related to privacy or personal integrity, freedom of speech, rule of law, and ethics, where the clash between privacy and security, supposedly mediated by participatory practices, portrays in terms of political science a fruitless and hopeless clash between socialist and liberal ideologies which lack a \\"vertical\\" spiritual dimension. = Cultural criticism = In later years the emphasis switched to the furthering of systems thinking in face of the perceived cultural decline of society, with emphasis on universities and research. This is a cultural criticism of inadequate uses of the system concept as well as criticism of some modern and postmodern trends in research and development of computer applications, under labels such as critical theory, phenomenology, design, or sheer eclectic ad hoc theoretical frameworks. Ivanov perceives that they are often misused to downplay not only economic and political realities but also, and mainly, ethical concerns. His criticism follows from his summarizing statement about the future of the systems approach and its limitations when technology and science lead to philosophy, and further to ethics and theology. Abstract and orders.Original research report. Therefore, as emeritus, Ivanov pursues research on current trends of informatics and science to be explained or countered by an understanding of the interface between information, philosophy of technology, and theology.Ivanov, K, (2002).Trends in philosophy of technology. (Pre- publication version.) In this respect, and except for his adduction of theology which he shares with West Churchman, Ivanov may be seen as working along a stream of earlier criticism of the ideology of computer culture. Ivanov is convinced of the necessity of an explicit relation between theology and ethics in systems philosophy and practice, in order to avoid that technology remains an \\"excuse for questionable ethics\\" in the computer- supported edutainment and financial games of affluent societies.The quoted expression is from the title of Ivanov's colleague, Mowshowitz: An overview of Ivanov's latest and ongoing research is available on the Internet.

He was a son of Philippe Colombe and his wife Guillemette and thus the brother of the sculptor Michel Colombe. Work In 1470-1472, Colombe created the miniatures of the Heures de Louis de Laval; around 1475, he illuminated the crusader chronicles, Les Passages d'oultre mer du noble Godefroy de Bouillon, du bon roy Saint Loys et de plusieurs vertueux princes, by Sébastien Mamerot. Both works had been commissioned by Louis de Laval. Between 1485 and 1490, Jean Colombe completed the decoration of the Très Riches Heures which had been left unfinished in 1416. He executed the image for the month of November (below the zodiac arch), completed the Limbourg brothers’ design for September, and retouched other images.

Historical marker in Lloydtown. Jesse Lloyd (11 January 1786 - 27 September 1838) was the founder of Lloydtown, Ontario and a leader in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. Born in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania, he was the third son of Quakers William Lloyd and Susannah Heacock. The Lloyds, who were United Empire Loyalists, possibly came to Canada at Niagara in 1788 but soon returned to the United States. They likely immigrated permanently to Upper Canada in 1808. Upon arrival, they crossed the Niagara gorge and migrated north to settle in the 10th concession of King Township. By 1824, Jesse Lloyd had established a sawmill in Tecumseth Township. Later he was active in King Township where he bought and sold lots, built several mills and, in the process, established the village of Lloydtown, Ontario. Rebellion In the days of the Family Compact in Upper Canada, agitation grew from year to year. Meetings for reform were held all over the home district and even in some remote parts of the province. Lloyd was a local leader in public affairs in his district. During the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837, a proclamation was issued and a reward of 500 pounds was put on Lloyd's head. He was forced to flee the country and he went to Tippecanoe County, Indiana, where he lived out the last few months until his death in 1838. Lloyd was the only family member to flee with the rest remaining in Canada.http://brydondale.com/genealogy/tng/getperson.php?personID=I292&tree;=bryd2 References * NotesExternal links * Category:1786 births Category:1838 deaths Category:People from Bucks County, Pennsylvania Category:American emigrants to pre-Confederation Ontario Category:18th-century Quakers Category:19th-century Quakers Category:Canadian Quakers ","title":"Jesse Lloyd"},{"id":"20917238","text":"USS PGM-2 was a PGM-1 class motor gunboat that served in the United States Navy during World War II.

The Great Ridge Wood, formerly also known as Chicklade Wood, is less than a mile north of the village, just over the parish boundary. History John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870–72) describes Chicklade as follows: > CHICKLADE, a parish in Tisbury district, Wilts; 1¼ mile N by E of Hindon, > and 5 S by-W of Heytesbury r. station.

(See 1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash)  Churches  The Church of England parish church of All Saints was built in 1832 to designs in 12th- century style by J.B. Papworth. It stands on the site of a 12th-century church. The poet William Lisle Bowles was Vicar of Chicklade 1792–97. Pertwood also had a 12th-century church, St Peter's, which was rebuilt in 1872. The ecclesiastical parish of Pertwood was separate until 1899 when it was united with Chicklade, then in 1921, Chicklade with Pertwood was united with Hindon parish. The church at Pertwood was declared redundant in 1972. Parish registers for Chicklade survive from 1722 and are kept in the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives.Chicklade, Wiltshire at genuki.org.uk Local government The civil parish does not elect a parish council.

Etymology The place- name is first attested in the twelfth century, as Creskeld and Creskelde. The name comes from the Old English words cresse ('cress') and kelde ('spring, well', itself a borrowing of Old Norse kelda). Thus the name once meant 'spring with cress growing nearby'. The place-name thus suggests that the settlement dates back to before the Norman Conquest of England.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 40. A spring of fresh water flows past the Hall all year round; and watercress grows in abundance in the streams and water gardens.  History  In 1189, Hugo de Creskeld gave all his land at Creskeld with an annual rent of 6d and a common pasture of 260 sheep to Kirkstall Abbey. A chapel was attached to the house before the end of the 12th century. The Manor House was leased to Sir Richard de Goldsbro and in 1352 a deed was executed between Sir Richard de Goldsboro and Robert Tottie relating to the granting of Creskeld wood for the smelting of iron. This deed is said to be the oldest deed relating to that industry now in existence. At the dissolution of the Monasteries, the Manor of Creskeld passed into the hands of Thomas Cranmer, a nephew of the famous Archbishop Cranmer. In 1596 the Wentworth family from Wakefield occupied the Hall and rented it for £15 a year. In 1660, it was inherited by Evelild, the eldest daughter of George Wentworth, who was the wife of John Thornhill of Fixby. In 1846, Francis Rhodes of Bramhope Hall, the next door estate, married the only child of the owner of the Hall Charlotte Maria Cooper Darwin. He assumed her surname and arms in 1850 upon inheritance of Elston Hall from Robert Alvey Darwin and they took up residence at Creskeld Hall. The estate thus came into the ownership of the Rhodes family, who had been in Wharfedale for many centuries. Francis (Rhodes) Darwin was born in 1825. He became a barrister, then a magistrate and was Chairman of the Highways Committee and Alderman of the new West Riding of Yorkshire County Council for more than 50 years. He died in 1918 at the age of 93.  Recent history  The present Hall at Creskeld occupies the site of the original Manor house and there are parts in the centre which date back to the 1600s, with very old oak beams. Much of the rest of the building was built between 1850 and 1920 and includes a chapel room that was rebuilt after a fire in 1870. This was never re-consecrated and is now part of the main house. A flat-roofed billiard room extension was added in 1919. This connects the rebuilt chapel with the main body of the house, and has enclosed a courtyard where the front entrance used to be. The Hall has been privately owned by the same family since 1919 being purchased by Bertram Parkinson, the grandfather of the current owners. It was then the home of Colonel Sir Malcolm Stoddart- Scott OBE MC TD, Member of Parliament of the local constituency from 1945 until his death in 1973.  Creskeld Herd  Bertram Parkinson founded the Creskeld Herd of British Friesians in 1920, obtaining both a bull and females from a 1922 South African importation and by careful additional purchase accumulated a very good team which won many championships, both pre and post the Second World War. He was President of the British Friesian Cattle Society in 1949. Sir Malcolm Stoddart-Scott continued to develop the herd following Bertram's death in 1953 and had much show ring success in 1966–67 and later. The herd was fully dispersed at a sale in 2013 on the retirement of the Head Herdsman for over 40 years.  Television  The Hall is known to many people as Home Farm from the ITV soap Emmerdale and has been used on the show since the first series commissioned following the pilot series in 1972. Internal scenes have been shot in ITV's Leeds studio since the 1990s and a purpose built facade was used for a short period in 2014 at the Emmerdale village on the Harewood Estate. Over the years the filming of Emmerdale has included memorable scenes such as the 1997 death of David Glover in a fire which was filmed with a temporary structure built on the Hall's billiard room. In 2005 Zoe Tate destroyed the house by setting off a gas explosion which was filmed with the erection of a false facade on the eastern elevation of the Hall. Creskeld has also been used for other television programmes over the years including, Century Falls, The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank, The Darling Buds of May, Anton Mosimann – Naturally, and Secrets of the Royal Kitchen.  Gardens  left The gardens of Creskeld Hall have been open to the public annually for over 10 years as part of the National Gardens Scheme \\"Yellow Book\\", with the proceeds being split between the National Garden Scheme, and a charity of the owner's choice. The hall sits in approximately of garden, with a beech tree avenue, and has many rare colours of Rhododendron and Azalea collected by one of the family in the 1930s. The hall was originally part- surrounded by a moat, which is still visible in the garden and the gardens were laid out in various styles from 1825 until 1936, when the water garden was completed for Bertram Parkinson. The grounds also boast a terrace, walled vegetable garden, croquet lawn, canals, woodland plantings, and a specimen of a mature Monkey Puzzle tree.

Family and Personal life  Frederick Henry Horatio Akbar Mahomed was born on 11 April 1849 in Brighton. He was the eldest son of Frederick Mahomed (1818–1888) and his second wife, Sarah Hodgkinson (1816–1905). He was also the grandson of the pioneering Indian traveller, author and entrepreneur Sake Dean Mahomed. Frederick Akbar Mahomed's father, Frederick Mahomed, ran a fencing, gymnastics and callisthenics academy in Hove, which included boxing instruction. Cameron and Hicks dispute the suggestion that he ran Turkish baths at Brighton attributing this to a confusion of Mahomed's father Frederick with his uncle, Arthur. Mahomed had three brothers (Arthur George Suleiman, James Deen Kerriman and Henry), and one sister (Adeline). He was educated privately in Brighton prior to attending medical school. On June 14, 1873 at the parish church of St Nicholas', Brighton, Mahomed married Ellen (Nellie) Chalk. The couple had two children, a son, Archibald in 1874 and a daughter, Ellen in 1876. Only a month after the birth of Ellen in 1876, his wife, Ellen, died suddenly of sepsis and Mahomed and his family moved in with his uncle, Horatio, also a widower, in Seymour Street near Portman Square, London. In 1879 Mahomed married Ada Chalk, the younger sister of his first wife. As such a marriage was not legal under English law, the couple married in Switzerland. They lived at 12 St Thomas' Street, close to Guy's Hospital. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy in 1880, and Janet in 1881, and a son, Humphry in 1883. In 1884 the family moved from St Thomas' Street into a six-story Georgian house at 24 Manchester Square. Sadly, later that year, Mahomed contracted typhoid fever, presumably from a patient at the London Fever Hospital, where he was working. He died on 22 November 1884 from an intestinal hemorrhage and a perforated intestine. He was buried at Highgate Cemetery. On his death a subscription was set up to assist his family and several notable physicians including Sir William Gull, Sir Samuel Wilks, Sir James Paget and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson contributed. His oldest son, Archibald, later became a doctor, and in 1914 Archibald and the rest of the family changed their name to Deane (possibly acknowledging Frederick's grandfather's name, Deen) to lessen the impact of the xenophobia and racial prejudice associated with the outbreak of the World War I. Frederick's second wife, Ada Deane, died in New York in 1940.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=93319315 Of Frederick's children, Archibald Deane died in 1948, Ellen died in 1954, Janet in died 1955, Humphry died in 1955 and Dorothy died in 1962.  Education and Career  left In 1867, aged 18, Mahomed began to study medicine at the Sussex County Hospital, Brighton. Two years later in October 1869, he entered Guy's Hospital, London as a medical student. He was an outstanding student and, in 1871, won the student Pupils' Physical Society prize for his work on the sphygmograph, having been runner-up the previous year. Mahomed qualified as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1872. Following qualification, Mahomed worked at Highgate Infirmary (St Pancras' North Infirmary, Central London Sick Asylum) for a year. In 1873, he was appointed as resident medical officer at the London Fever Hospital in Liverpool Street, Islington. In 1874 Mahomed became a member of the Royal College of Physicians and was appointed as Student Tutor and Pathologist at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. In 1875, Mahomed gained a doctorate (M.D.) from the University of Brussels. In 1877, he returned to Guy's Hospital as a Registrar (Senior Resident). He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1880, and in 1881, he was awarded an M.B. from Cambridge University for his thesis on \\"Chronic Bright's disease without albuminuria\\". In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician at Guy's Hospital and, in 1882, he was appointed as a Demonstrator in Morbid Anatomy at Guy's Hospital.Diagram of the formation of the pulse (Mahomed)Mahomed‘s earliest contribution, while still a medical student, was to improve the sphygmograph, a device for measuring blood pressure that had originally been devised by Karl von Vierordt and further developed by Étienne- Jules Marey. Mahomed’s major innovation was to make the sphygmograph quantitative, so that it was able to measure arterial blood pressure (in Troy ounces). The description of the modified instrument was published in 1872. Following his graduation in the same year, Mahomed took up an appointment at the Central London Sick Asylum, where he worked with Sir William Broadbent, who became a strong supporter and friend. Several of Mahomed’s pulse tracings are contained in Broadbent’s classic book, The Pulse. Mahomed used the new sphygmograph to measure arterial tension (blood pressure) in Bright's disease and a range of other conditions, including pregnancy, scarlet fever, gout, alcohol and lead poisoning. He found that in some individuals blood pressure was elevated before there was evidence of kidney disease, assessed by measurement of protein in the urine (proteinuria). He also made the association between the elevated blood pressure and various post-mortem changes, including enlargement of the heart (cardiac hypertrophy), thickening and fibrosis of the arterial wall, aneurysm formation, and damage to the microcirculation (arterio-capillary fibrosis). In effect, Mahomed was describing most of the key pathological effects of essential hypertension for the first time. Initially he termed this condition \\"Bright's disease without albuminuria\\" but later he described it as “high pressure diathesis”. His description of the condition is worth citing: > ‘…the existence of this abnormally high pressure does not necessarily mean > disease, but only a tendency towards disease. It is a functional condition, > not necessarily a permanent one, though it is generally more or less so in > these individuals. These persons appear to pass on through life pretty much > as others do… As age advances the enemy gains accessions of strength; > perhaps the mode of life assists him - good living and alcoholic beverages > make secure his position, or head work, mental anxiety, hurried meals, > constant excitement, inappropriate or badly cooked food, or any other of the > common but undesirable circumstances of everyday life, tend to intensify the > existing condition, or, if not previously present, perhaps produce it. Now > under this greatly increased arterial pressure, hearts begin to hypertrophy > and arteries to thicken; what has previously been a functional condition > tends to become more of the nature of an organic one…’ Mahomed also proposed that reducing blood pressure would prolong life, although the means of doing that in his era were in the main limited to lifestyle advice. In 1880 Mahomed made a first foray into public health. He wrote to the British Medical Journal to advocate undertaking the comprehensive systematic documentation of disease in Britain; he termed this idea, Collective Investigation. Mahomed’s proposals were warmly supported by Sir George Murray Humphry, the President of the British Medical Association, and a Collective Investigation Committee was formed in 1881 with Mahomed as secretary. Around this time Mahomed became acquainted with the British polymath, Francis Galton, who shared an interest in factors predisposing to disease. Mahomed and Galton collaborated to produce composite photographs of over 400 patients with phthisis (Tuberculosis), which they compared with composite photographs based on 200 individuals without evidence of phthisis to test whether, as was widely believed, appearance or looks indicated a predisposition to disease. They found no evidence of a characteristic facial appearance associated with tuberculosis beyond some evidence of emaciation. In 1882 Mahomed advocated expanding Collective Investigation to include a general collection of detailed family life histories: > 'for encouraging patients to keep carefully prepared records of their lives > and of the chief incidents therein, both medical and otherwise. These > records would prove of very great value, alike to the patient, to the > doctor, and to medical science.' A life-history subcommittee of the Collective Investigation Committee, including both Mahomed and Galton was formed in 1882. Initially the Collective Investigation Committee was very successful with 54 local Collective Investigation Committees being formed to collect data. Their preliminary findings were published in 1883 as a 76-page single volume called 'The Collective Investigation Record' and included results based on more than 2000 patients. In 1884, a Life History Album was published to allow parents to record details of family circumstances and child development. It was advertized in Nature and Galton offered prizes of £500 to people who submitted the most complete family records - within 5 months he had received in excess of 150 records. Over the subsequent 5 years data based on over 300 family records were published, with the main findings summarised in Galton’s book, Natural Inheritance. However, Mahomed would not see these achievements as he died in November 1884 from typhoid fever. Contribution Michael F.

Woods Hole was held because American educators feared that the Soviet Union was surpassing the United States in educational emphasis on science, math, and foreign languages. The conference marked the beginning of a new trend in educational planning: the unified efforts of distinguished people in varied fields addressing themselves to the general improvement of education. The result was discipline-based education and conceptual learning.  Impact on music education  Music was categorized as aesthetic education. In a 1959 article in The Music Educators Journal, Alberta Lowe and Harold S. Pryor argued that the Soviet Union was also placing considerable emphasis on music education. As a result of Woods Hole, music educators resolved to teach music as an entire discipline that includes concepts, skills, and repertoire.  Impact on mathematics and science education  New math was also a result as well as the spiral curriculum—-learning about and using basic concepts that would be revisited at subsequent levels. Jerome Bruner is an educational psychologist associated with this conference and with the spiral curriculum. The textbook revolution was another result of Woods Hole.

Durand was born in Mayenne, France, apprenticed as a chemist and pharmacist in Mayenne from 1808–1812, studied pharmacy in Paris, and on his graduation in 1813 joined the medical corps of Napoleon's army. He served for 14 months, and was present at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Hanau, Katzbach, and Leipzig. In 1814 he resigned his commission, and became an apothecary in Nantes where he studied botany intensively for two years. After Napoleon's downfall, he was suspected of Napoleonic tendencies, and sailed to New York City in 1816. After intervals in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, he ultimately settled in Philadelphia, where he established a drugstore employed by many of the most eminent physicians of the day. In 1825 he became a member of Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and in 1832 was elected a corresponding member of the Societé de Pharmacie in Paris. In 1835 he was the first to begin bottling mineral waters in the United States, and in 1854 was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Durand actively devoted himself to botany, and became thoroughly familiar with the flora of North America, collecting an herbarium that included a remarkable 10,000 species of North American plants. This, the work of nearly forty years, he presented to the museum of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris in 1868. A separate gallery has been devoted to the collection in that institution, and it was called \\"Herbaria Durandi\\" after the donor.

History Acquired by the state of Missouri in 1992, the 127-acre historic site has proved to be an important archaeological discovery due to its size and quality of preservation. It is considered the largest and best preserved of any Illinois Indian village. The village was occupied from approximately 1640 to 1683. During that time the village contained at least three hundred (300) lodges with an estimated population in excess of eight thousand (8,000) tribe members. Archaeological digs in the 1990s discovered numerous house foundations, storage pits and evidence of a palisade fortification. The remains of at least one tribal member were also recovered at the site, in 1998. Among smaller items found was evidence of contact with early European explorers and traders, including glass beads, metal objects, and Jesuit trade rings. The Illinois Indian tribe were the first Native Americans encountered in present-day Missouri by Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette, who visited the village in 1673. Site details The site is located on a high sand terrace above the Des Moines River floodplain off Clark County Road 188 two miles south-southeast of St. Francisville, Missouri. A walking trail of one and a quarter miles has interpretive signage, the remains of a typical Illinois Tribe–style long house, an oxbow lake, and an example of an Illinois round house. Limited picknicking and restroom facilities are available. The site is open year-round from sunrise to sunset, with a gate blocking vehicle traffic from November through March.

Life Fuhrmann was born on 23 June 1925 in Hiddesen (near Detmold). He started his studies in Leiden. While Fuhrmann wanted to study music, he gave up this plan in favour of classical philology and jurisprudence, whereby the classical philology was decisive for him. 1953 he obtained his doctorate in classical philology in Freiburg, followed by his habilitation ibidem. 1962 Fuhrmann accepted a chair at the University of Kiel, 1966 one at the University of Konstanz. Also, he was a member of the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences of Heidelberg) and of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1990. Furthermore, the University of Freiburg gave Fuhrmann an honorary doctorate in jurisprudence. He died on 12 January 2005. Achievements Fuhrmann is generally considered to be one of the most eminent German philologists. During his lifetime he has undoubtedly achieved a lot: Above all he has worked as a translator — having translated a huge amount of classical Latin and Ancient Greek texts into German: His probably most outstanding achievement was to translate all of Cicero's speeches. For this translation Fuhrmann received the Johann-Heinrich- Voß-Preis für Übersetzung (Johann-Heinrich-Voß-award) from the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung 1990. Besides he has translated texts from other classical authors like Horace, Aristotle and Plato. In addition to his translations, Fuhrmann became well known for his criticism of education. In his book Bildung. Europas kulturelle Identität (Education. The cultural identity of Europe) he criticised that natural sciences are much too important in the most current educational systems, whereas classical philology, history and music do not receive enough recognition.

The historic site includes the Christopher Maus House, the Union Hotel, and the Lohman's Landing Building (also known as the Jefferson Landing Building), which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. History The stone Lohman Building was constructed in 1839 by James Crump and saw use as a grocery store, warehouse, telegraph office, tavern, and hotel. The building earned the nickname \\"the landing\\" and was recognized as a popular meeting place for lawmakers and commercial operators. Crump's business partner Charles Lohman eventually purchased all sections of the building that then became known as Lohman's Landing. In 1855, Charles Maus built a hotel across the street, and his brother Christopher Maus built a small, red brick home just to the south of the hotel. The hotel went through several name changes: Missouri Hotel, Veranda Hotel, and finally the Union Hotel following the Civil War. The Lohman and Union Hotel buildings came to be used for storage, tenement lodgings, and a shoe factory before being acquired by the state in 1976. The buildings were restored as the state's contribution to the nation's 1976 bicentennial celebration. Activities and amenities Exhibits in the Lohman Building depict an 1850s general store and warehouse. The Elizabeth Rozier Gallery, located in the Union Hotel building, offers exhibits on state history, art, and culture. The ground floor of the former hotel also houses the city's Amtrak train station.

Each year, tornadoes and tornado outbreaks occur worldwide primarily under conductive conditions, though a majority of tornadoes form in the United States. Tornadoes also occur to a less frequent extent in Europe, Asia, and Australia. In the U.S., there were 1,304 reports of tornadoes received by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), and 1,159 tornadoes were confirmed to have taken place. Worldwide, 45 fatalities were caused by tornadoes; 22 in the United States, 20 in India, eight in the Philippines, four in Canada, two in Greece and one each in Serbia and Russia. Tornadic activity in 2009 began with the development an EF1 tornado near Stringer, Mississippi on January 3 and ended with the dissipation of an EF0 tornado near Vancleave, Mississippi on December 24\\\\. During the year the two strongest tornadoes were both assessed as an EF4 – one occurred in Oklahoma on February 10 and the second occurred in Tennessee on April 10\\\\. During the early months of the year tornadic activity remained mostly below average in contrast to an active trend of tornadoes in 2008. Activity peaked in April and May as a result of destabilizing atmospheric conditions and featured a bulk of the year's tornadoes. However, the number of developing tornadoes subsequently began to wane and remained generally inactive for the latter half of 2009. Synopsis Adjusted annual tornado report count in the United States compared to minimum, maximum, and climatological percentiles In contrast to the first nine months of 2008, the final quarter was fairly inactive overall, and the inactivity continued into January 2009 with only a few tornadoes in the US the entire month as generally stable air dominated. The pattern broke for the first time on February 10 when a modest tornado outbreak occurred, but produced a deadly tornado in Oklahoma. The severe weather activity changed to a moderate pace for the remainder of February into March, and although the start of the season did not have a large prolific tornado outbreak, it has had several notable events. Overall activity in March ran near normal. The start of Easter weekend brought the first large outbreak of 2009, with many tornadoes on both April 9 and 10. Steady activity through the remainder of April sent the month above average. May started quite active, but in a rather unusual pattern as most tornadoes in the early part of the month were due to summer-like derechos as opposed to large-scale supercells. The second half of May was unusually quiet, with few significant severe weather events. June saw activity return to an above normal pace, and the middle part of the month was particularly active. However, most of the tornadoes were in open country, and activity was steady over many days as opposed to a large outbreak. The second half of 2009, overall, was not active. July also ran near normal, but August ran below normal with most of the activity concentrated in a single non-tropical outbreak. Without any landfalling tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and a relatively stable air mass, September was extremely quiet with only a very small number of isolated weak tornadoes. While October was near average tornado-wise, activity stabilized greatly again in November and it produced only three tornadoes, one of the least active months in recent years. December was more active, primarily as a result of a moderate outbreak just before Christmas. EventsUnited States yearly total=January There were 10 tornadoes reported in the United States in January, of which 6 were confirmed. Activity throughout the month was far below-average, with all tornadoes forming within localized events. The most notable tornado was an EF1 that struck McIntosh, Alabama on January 10, causing $2.5 million in damage. No casualties took place throughout the month and total losses from the storms reached $2.7 million. Across Europe, there were six tornadoes reporting during the month, one of which in Italy was rated F1 on January 27. =January 3= { class=\\"toccolours\\" align=\\"right\\" style=\\"width:25em; border-collapse:collapse; margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" !colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAA; background:#EEE; padding:0.33em; text-align:center; font-size:125%;\\" January 3 - style=\\"border-top:1px solid #AAA; border-bottom:1px solid #AAA;\\" !colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.25em 0.5em; line-height:1.4em; white- space:nowrap; text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAA;\\" !style=\\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.25em 0.5em; line-height:1.4em; white- space:nowrap; text-align:left;\\" Areas affected style=\\"width:100%; vertical- align:top; padding:0.25em 0.5em; line-height:1.4em;\\" Lower Mississippi Valley - !style=\\"vertical-align:top; padding:0.25em 0.5em; line-height:1.4em; white- space:nowrap; text-align:left;\\" Tornadic damage style=\\"width:100%; vertical- align:top; padding:0.25em 0.5em; line-height:1.4em;\\" $40,000 } On January 3, the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for portions of Southeast Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley, citing the predicted passage of a shortwave trough and the potential for increasing atmospheric instability which would in turn increase the likelihood for tornadic activity. At 1535 UTC, the SPC issued a severe thunderstorm watch for areas of southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi due to the development of scattered thunderstorms tracking eastward across the region. In addition, conditions were favorable for the genesis of supercells. One of these storms spawned an EF1 tornado in Smith County, Mississippi, which tracked for . The tornado snapped several trees and caused relatively minor structural damage to several buildings, with damage totaling to $40,000. In addition to spawning the first tornado of 2009, storms in the lower Mississippi Valley caused penny to nickel-sized hail. An additional preliminary EF0 tornado was reported to have blown down several trees in an open field in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, but was not counted as part of the National Climatic Data Center's total tornado count for 2009. Two mobile homes were damaged in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, potentially due to a tornado.

February Damage to the roof of a bus station in Málaga, Spain after an F2 (T4) tornado on February 1\\\\. There were 44 tornadoes reported in the US in February, of which 36 were confirmed. Across Europe, nine tornadoes were reported during the month. The most intense of these was an F2 (T4) tornado that struck Málaga, Spain on February 1\\\\. On February 14, four people were killed in Nizip, Turkey. Overall, tornadoes were responsible for 4 fatalities and 31 injuries in Europe during February. =February 1= 25 people were injured when a tornado hit the city of Málaga in Spain, causing extensive damage to property, windows and vehicles. Most of those injured had been cut by glass, although branches and advertising boards blown around by winds up to resulted in some of the injuries. More than 200 houses were affected, along with 400 cars and 100 industrial warehouses. Nearly 1000 children were without classes because of the damage done to six schools in the city. The tornado was rated as an F2 (T4) by the European Severe Weather Database. =February 10-11= Damage in Lone Grove, Oklahoma caused by an EF4 tornado on February 10. For February 10, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe weather for portions of eastern Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, western Arkansas, and northwest Louisiana. It was projected that supercell thunderstorms would form late in the afternoon with a squall line developing during the evening. During the afternoon, an EF1 tornado touched down northwest of Warr Acres, near the Northwest Expressway, resulting in damage to several businesses in the area. Afterwards, an EF2 tornado struck Edmond, where six homes were destroyed, eight structures received major damage, 51 received minor damage and another 166 structures were affected. Later in the evening, an EF4 tornado devastated the city of Lone Grove, killing eight people, injuring 46 others and destroying 114 homes and mobile homes. The Lone Grove tornado was the deadliest to hit Oklahoma since May 3, 1999 (until May 20, 2013), and the strongest tornado during the month of February in Oklahoma since 1950. The previous strongest were two F3 tornadoes which touched down on February 17, 1961. The Storm Prediction Center also issued a very large slight risk area for February 11 which encompassed parts of the Deep South, Ohio Valley, Midwest, and Appalachians. However, the risk for tornadoes was lower on February 11 due to stronger frontal forcing (which limited discrete supercell activity) and lower instability. The risk area was upgraded to a moderate risk later in the day, but mainly for damaging downburst winds and isolated tornadoes. =February 16 (Country of Georgia)= A tornado, which local authorities believe is the first ever in the nation's history, touched down in the country of Georgia. No injuries were reported, but the tornado damaged trees and around 100 homes in the Tsalendzikhsky and Zugdidsky districts. =February 18-19= Strong southwesterly winds transported a moist air mass northeastward across the Gulf Coast states and the Tennessee Valley. The moisture combined with daytime heating to support a moderately unstable air mass in advance of a cold front, which pushed southeastward across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf States during the afternoon and evening. The cold front combined with a strong jet stream aloft resulted in the development of severe thunderstorms along the cold front. As a result, a moderate risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. Large pine trees stripped of their bark and snapped in half near Boston, Georgia Several tornadoes touched down during the afternoon and evening hours into the early morning of February 19. The strongest tornado was rated as an EF3 tornado, which traveled through Wilkes and McDuffie counties in Georgia. It destroyed a cinder block home, damaged 15 homes and destroyed 19 outbuildings. One person was killed in Hancock County after an EF3 tornado destroyed a church and four mobile homes in the area.

In Newton County, 20 to 30 homes in a heavily wooded subdivision were damaged by trees blown down by an EF1 tornado that was on the ground for . Other tornadoes, with winds ranging from to , occurred in Taylor, Houston and Oconee counties. In the southern portion of Georgia, a supercell thunderstorm produced two tornadoes (rated EF2 and EF3) in Grady and Thomas counties. In Thomas County alone, there were 160 structures damaged with nine mobile homes destroyed and 20 single family homes destroyed. In Alabama, an EF1 tornado tracked across a forest in Randolph County, where several hundred trees were either snapped off or blown down. =February 28= A cold front pushed into warm, moist air in Alabama, Georgia and the Florida Panhandle on February 28, resulting in severe thunderstorms in southern and central Alabama into central Georgia during the morning. At 7:40 a.m CST (1340 UTC) rain fell from the sky and an EF0 tornado blew down several trees and power lines and destroyed two outbuildings in southern Tallapoosa County.

No structures were reported to have been damaged and no one was injured. =March 23= An upper trough moved from the Four Corners region into the southern Great Plains and lower Missouri Valley during the day on March 23. During this, a surface low in western portions of Nebraska pushed into eastern South Dakota. A cold front combined with the low moved across the central and southern Great Plains and was the main area where thunderstorm development would occur. Although moisture was limited, strong wind shear created favorable conditions for supercells to develop and rotate. As a result, the supercells had the potential to produce tornadoes. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for portions of central and eastern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. During the day, a fast-moving supercell produced several tornadoes in eastern Nebraska and across the state line into the west central portion of Iowa. Five tornadoes occurred in eastern Nebraska, with eight people injured in Eagle. In Iowa, an EF2 tornado destroyed one home, damaged another home, a barn and seven outbuildings and derailed 54 empty grain rail cars in Harrison County.

The tornado continued moving northward, damaging more homes before lifting. =April 9-10= A storm system over the southern Great Plains region resulted in severe weather development during the late afternoon and evening along a dry line that stretched from southern Kansas across northeastern Oklahoma into southwestern Missouri and northwest Arkansas. As a result, a moderate risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for eastern Oklahoma, southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri and western Arkansas. The system approached as the atmosphere destabilized as a result of daytime heating. Thunderstorms began developing along a dry line in Oklahoma during the early afternoon hours. More thunderstorms started forming as they approached into western Arkansas, and encountered a strong wind field around the incoming system. Winds began turning with height, which caused some thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Beginning at 6:20 CDT (2320 UTC), several tornadoes were produced in eastern sections of Oklahoma and Texas. The severe weather then moved into Arkansas, where an EF3 tornado killed three people in Mena.

Alternatively, Netherton can also be entered from Netherton Street, which runs from the Heathery roundabout to Netherton Cross. Netherton is bordered by Gowkthrapple, Craigneuk, Muirhouse and the River Clyde. History Netherton, meaning low farming homestead (the Nether-town) was initially a part of the parish of Cambusnethan. Traditionally farming area, some of which are still in operation, there was a Carbarns colliery which shut in the early 1900s, not long after an explosion which killed three men at the pit. In 1859, a branch of the Glasgow Iron & Steel works was opened in Netherton as Lanarkshire was becoming a stronghold of the iron and steel industry. The industry continued in Netherton until the mid-1980s, when the Clyde Alloy works was shut. Many Netherton men also worked in the steelworks nearby, such as Ravenscraig, Dalzell and the Lanarkshire Steelworks. Other major businesses of the past in Netherton include R Y Pickering, manufacturer of railway wagons and rolling stock, and A G Barr, bottling plant of the soft drink maker. Netherton also had a police station and a cooperative society, both now closed. Transport Netherton is served by a range of buses provided by First Glasgow and JMB Travel which provide services to Wishaw, Motherwell, Hamilton and Glasgow amongst other places. There is no longer a train station in Netherton since the closure of Wishaw South station in 1958. Rail services to Lanark and Glasgow are provided from nearby Shieldmuir station. Entertainment and Facilities Netherton has a small shopping centre on the corner of Netherton Road and Carbarns Road consisting of a general grocer/post office, a hairdressing salon, sit-in cafe and a selection of fast food takeaways. Near the bottom of Netherton Road is the Cherry Tree pub. There is a non- denominational primary school in Netherton Road, Netherton Primary School. Further along Netherton Road, at Netherton Cross is a fairly new community centre, which has replaced the dilapidated Netherdale Hall. A football club for teams of under-8s, 10s and 12s, Netherton Football Club, was established for over five years. The club no longer exists. The nearest professional football club is Motherwell, with the club's stadium Fir Park located only 2 miles away to the North-West of the suburb. Netherton also has a methodist church, Netherton Methodist church, formerly Castlehill Methodist, which was opened in 1976 and swiftly established 1st Netherton Boys' Brigade. The population of Netherton has increased greatly in recent years, which has necessitated the building of large new housing estates on the site of Wards scrapyard, at Netherton Street between Wishaw General Hospital and the gastank and next to Netherton Industrial Estate, amongst others. Industrial Estate There is a large industrial estate on the westerly side of Netherton Road. It has been expanded in recent years and businesses include the Royal Mail sorting office, the NHS laundry and Daiwa, as well as a major new household waste recycling centre.

The Tchaikazan River flows the area between the upper & lower lake from the southwest, while the Taseko River feeds it from the southeast, while the equally large Lord River joins it from the south, at the head of the lake. History The Taseko Lakes were proposed to be part of a massive hydroelectric development which would have seen the flow of the Taseko River dammed and diverted westward via a tunnel to Chilko Lake, which would have been also dammed and diverted through further tunnels to Tatlayoko Lake on the Homathko River, which unlike the Taseko and Chilko Rivers drains directly to the ocean at Bute Inlet rather than via the Chilcotin and Fraser Rivers. Fisheries and aboriginal land claims concerns have derailed the Taseko diversion, although the Chilko diversion remains as a possibility. The Taseko Lakes are now part of Ts'il?os Provincial Park, which also includes Chilko Lake and the intervening country, including Nemaiah Valley and Yohetta Valley, which form wide alpentals connecting the two lake valleys.

History  The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a 0–0 tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests.Viera, Mark. (2008, September 10). \\"The Past for Syracuse and Penn State Is Now Present,\\" The New York Times. Accessed: September 1, 2013. In 1953, after Lenny Moore intercepted a pass to seal a 20–14 Penn State victory, he was shoved out of bounds into the Syracuse bench. A Syracuse player jumped on Moore and a wild brawl started. Fans jumped out of the stands to join in. The fighting went on for several minutes before order was restored and Penn State took a knee to end the game. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. Penn State leads the series 43–23–5. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991.  Rivalry resumed  In 2002, it was announced that the two teams would revive the rivalry by scheduling a home-and-home series in 2008 and 2009. After an almost twenty- year break in the series, the two programs played in Syracuse's Carrier Dome on September 13, 2008, with the Nittany Lions prevailing 55–13 over the Orange. The contest didn't generate a sellout crowd at the Carrier Dome. They met again the next year. Penn State won 28–7. After a 4-year break, in 2013 the two teams met again, this time at MetLife Stadium, in front of 61,202 fans; Penn State won 23–17.Cohen, Michael.

The state park bears the name of the nearby town of Knob Noster, which itself is named for one of two small hills or \\"knobs\\" that rise up in an otherwise flat section of Missouri. Noster is a Latin adjective meaning \\"our\\"—therefore, Knob Noster translates as \\"our hill.\\" A local Indian belief stated that the hills were \\"raised up as monuments to slain warriors.\\" The park offers year-round camping, hiking, and fishing and is managed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. History The park was called the Montserrat National Recreational Demonstration Area when it was created in the 1930s as part of a nationwide effort by the National Park Service to show how land that had been cleared for lumbering, mining or farming could be restored and reclaimed for public recreational purposes. The park was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. The men of the CCC and WPA built roads, bridges, camping areas, picnic areas, and park service buildings. The park was transferred to the state of Missouri in 1946 and renamed for the city of Knob Noster. Historic sites The park includes several demonstration area resources dating from the 1930s that were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985: * Camp Shawnee Historic District: The district encompasses 30 buildings and structures constructed between 1936 and 1941 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration. They are large rectangular rustic style frame buildings with side-gable roofs in the saltbox form. (includes 12 photographs) * Montserrat Recreational Demonstration Area Warehouse No. 2 and Workshop: The two buildings were built in 1939-1940 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration. They include the pool house, dining hall, infirmary, staff lodges, office, central latrine, and four frame cabins. * Montserrat Recreational Demonstration Area Rock Bath House: It was built in 1939 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration. It is a modest stone building with a pitched side-gable roof and small hopper-style windows directly under the eave line. * Montserrat Recreation Demonstration Area Entrance Portal: It was built in 1939 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration. It consists of eight-foot retaining walls along a drainage ditch and two massive stone wing walls on either side of Highway 132. * Montserrat Recreation Demonstration Area Dam and Spillway: It was built in 1938-1939 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration to create a small recreational lake. It consists of a concrete dam with a curved ramp- like tailrace flanked by rustic walls of native cut stone and a flight of seven stone steps. * Montserrat Recreation Demonstration Area Bridge: It was built in 1937 by relief workers under the Works Projects Administration. The bridge has two flat arches and a random ashlar wall surface. Ecology The Knob Noster area was described in 1861 during the American Civil War by Confederate soldier, Ephraim McDowell Anderson, as an area of \\"beautiful prairies, dotted with clumps of trees.\\" The park lies in the Osage Plains, a transition zone between prairie and forest. Tall wild grasses and wild flowers grow among scattered trees making habitat similar to a savanna. Since settlement, the savanna has been overgrown with trees as the land is transitioning to a forest. Efforts are underway to restore some parts of the park to its original condition through controlled burning. Clearfork Creek is a slow flowing meandering creek that passes through the park. It provides water for a corridor of trees along its banks. The trees growing along the banks and in other parts of the park include pawpaw, various species of hickory and oak, hackberry and redbud. The creek, prairie and woods provide a habitat for numerous birds and mammals including great blue herons, pileated woodpeckers, wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, fox, opossum, raccoons, screech owls and eastern bluebirds. A section of the park has been specially designated as a protected natural area. Pin Oak Slough Natural Area is in a former oxbow slough of Clearfork Creek. The area is a wet-mesic forest and shrub swamp. Water pools during spring in depressions making vernal pools. Trees growing in the Pin Oak Natural Area include pin oak, swamp white oak and bur oak as well as silver maple. The rare pale green orchid can also be found in the natural area. Geology Knob Noster State Park and the Osage Plains are underlain by soft shales with sandstones and limestones of Mississippian to Pennsylvanian age. Some of the rocks prevalent in the Osage Plains are Mississippian limestone, limestone shale, Ordovician dolomite, and coal. There are also clay and shale within the Pennsylvanian bedrock. Recreation Knob Knoster State Park is open for year-round recreation. Two lakes, Buteo and Clearfork, and Clearfork Creek are open to fishing. The most common game fish are channel catfish, crappie, bass and bluegill. Small boats and electric trolling motors are permitted on the lakes. Several picnic areas are spread throughout the park on the shores of the various lakes. Three picnic pavilions are available. Five different types of camping areas are available at Knob Noster State Park. There are basic campsites with a fire ring and pad, electric campsites are similar to the basic, only with electric hook-ups, equestrian campsites have facilities for horses and the special-use and group camping areas are provided.

This is the type species of the genus. This species may be conspecific with Pecten jacobaeus, the pilgrim's scallop, which has a much more restricted distribution. Description The shell of Pecten maximus is quite robust and is characterised by having \\"ears\\" of equal size on either side of the apex. The right, or lower, valve is convex and slightly overlaps the flat left, or upper, valve, which is flat. Larger specimens have a nearly circular outline and the largest may measure 21 cm in length. The \\"ears\\" are prominent and are a minimum of half the width of the shell with the byssal notch situated in the right anterior ear being slight and not serrated. The sculpture of the valves is distinctive and consists of 12 to 17 wide radiating ribs and numerous concentric lines which clearly show the scallop's growth history, while the \\"ears\\" show a few thin ribs which radiate from the beaks. The radiating ribs reach the margins of the valves and this creates a crenulated form. The left valve is normally reddish-brown while the right valve varies from white through cream to shades of pale brown contrasting with pink, red or pale yellow tints; either valve may show zigzag patterns and may also show bands and spots of red, pink or bright yellow. The colour of the body of Pecten maximus is pink or red with the mantle marbled brown and white. When young they are attached to the substrate by a byssus but mature animals are capable of swimming by the opening and rapid closing of the valves. The adductor muscle which is used to close and open the valves is very large and powerful. The foot is a finger-like organ, which spins the byssal threads, which pass through the byssal notch on the ears. The margin of the mantle has two layers the inner layer is finely fringed while the outer is lined with long tentacles with two series totalling 30-36 dark blue or green simple eyes or ocelli in two rows at their base. Distribution Pecten maximus occurs in the eastern Atlantic along the European coast from northern Norway, south to the Iberian peninsula, it has also been reported off West Africa, off the Macaronesian Islands. In Great Britain and Ireland it is distributed all round the coast but it is uncommon and localised on the eastern North Sea coast. It prefers offshore waters down to 100m Biology Pecten maximus frequently creates a slight hollow in the substrate for its shell to lie in by opening and closing the valve to eject water from the mantle cavity, which raises the shell at an angle to the substrate so that subsequent water jets into the sediment and create a recess. Once settled, sand, mud, gravel or living organisms coat the upper valve, and the margin of the shell, with the tentacles and eyes, is all that is visible. They are filter feeders which extract particles from the surrounding water via a feeding current which is drawn by cilia across the gills where the food particles are trapped, then taken to the mouth in a stream of mucous. Pecten maximus swims but this is generally limited to escape reactions. The main predators which cause this reaction when detected are the mollusc eating starfish Asterias rubens and Astropecten irregularis, although starfish which do not feed on molluscs can cause limited jumping or valve- closing reactions. The swimming action is performed by rapidly clapping the valves and expelling jets of water from each side of the hinge so that it moves with the curved edge of the shell at the front. The scallop jumps forwards by gradually relaxing the adductor muscle and then rapidly opening and closing the valves. Pecten maximus tends to be more numerous in areas where they are not fully exposed to strong currents. Scallops which live in sheltered habitats grow faster than scallops in areas exposed to wave action, possibly due to the filter feeding apparatus being unable to function because of high concentrations of particulate matter in the water in areas subject to high levels of wave exposure. Another factor that may be significant is that the processes of larval settlement and byssal attachment are rather delicate and would be disturbed in strong currents. Abundance and growth rates are negatively correlated with the amount of mud in the substrate. Scallops use larval motility to distribute themselves, as the adult scallops have limited mobility. The distribution of the larvae is affected by factors such as local hydrographic regimes and their survival, and this results in the scallops having an aggregated distribution within their geographic range. This means that the major fishing grounds are normally widely separated and each fishing ground's environmental conditions mean there are marked differences in structures of the populations, although the genetics of scallops are rather uniform across its range. The reproductive cycle of Pecten maximus is extremely variable and the spawning may be influenced by both internal and external factors such as age and temperature respectively but is also influenced by genetic adaptation. Generally, mature scallops spawn over the summer months starting in April or May and lasting to September. They are hermaphroditic and have distinct tongue-shaped gonads which are red or orange in colour for the female gonad and white for the male. It is estimated that a three-year old scallop releases 15 - 21 million oocytes per emission. There appear to be two spawnings in many parts of the range, normally there is a partial one in the Spring and a full one in late August, however younger scallops have a single spawning event in the late summer. In some areas this pattern is reversed and the major spawning is in the Spring. After spawning the animals undergo period of recovery of the gonad before they spawn again. Fertilization of the gametes is external and either sperm or oocytes can be released into the water column first. Since the larval stage of Pecten maximus is relatively long, up to a month, the potential for dispersal is quite high, even smaller adults can use the byssus to drift too. However, in at least some populations, genetic studies show that there is little contribution from more distant populations and that these populations probably sustain themselves. In waters around the United Kingdom Pecten maximus become sexually mature at around 2–3 years old and when they reach 80 to 90 mm in shell length. Where they are not exploited, they may live for more than 20 years and reach shell lengths of more than 200mm. Scallops in shallow water grow faster than those in deeper water; the growth halts in winter and starts again in spring, producing concentric growth rings which are used to age the scallops. Predators and diseases As well as Asterias rubens and Astropecten irregularis major predators on Pecten maximus are crabs such as Cancer pagurus, Carcinus maenas, Liocarcinus puber and Liocarcinus depurator will prey on the scallops as they grow. The anemone Anthopleura ballii was found preying on young specimens of P.maximus in south-western Ireland. The larvae of Pecten maximus are attacked by the bacterium Vibrio pectenicida, which was described in 1998 as a new species after incidents of mortality among cultured scallops in France in the early 1990s. Other strains of pathogenic bacteria were detected in Norway following mass mortality of larvae in culture. Fisheries and aquaculture In 1999 the total catch reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation was 35,411 tonnes with the two biggest catches being reported from the United Kingdom and France which landed 19,108 tonnes and 12.745 tonnes respectively. It is believed that some natural stocks are showing indications of over exploitation resulting in strict enforcement of fisheries legislation and by the development of stock enhancement practices. Great scallops are fished for using Newhaven scallop dredges although a very small percentage, i.e. less than 5% is gathered by hand by divers. In total the scallop fisher for P. maximus. and for the Queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis are one of the top five fisheries by value in United Kingdom waters. However, the use of towed great to harvest scallops causes damage to the wider ecosystem. Pecten maximus can be cultivated in aquaculture and this is reasonably advanced in France and Norway. Spain, France, Ireland, United Kingdom and Norway have been involved in the aquaculture of scallops; production peaked in 1998 when 512 tonnes were landed but production later recessed, with only 213 tonnes landed in 2004, having an estimated value of €852 000, equivalent to €4 per kilogramme. Pecten maximus has been found to contain domoic acid, a toxin that can cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning. The risk associated with scallop consumption is regarded as a significant threat to both public health and the shellfish industry. Cultural significance The oil company Royal Dutch Shell derives its highly recognizable logo from this species. Pilgrims travelling to the town of Santiago de Compostella in Galicia took the shells of scallop with them, in honor of Saint James. This gave rise to the alternative name St James shell.

Seventeen locomotives were bought used by the Norwegian State Railways and designated NSB Di 5. Also the Yugoslav Railways bought used units, and designated them JŽ 734; they were subsequently designated Series 2133 by the Croatian Railways. History The DB had a shortage of small shunters. As a result, in 1951, a diesel shunter was designed, almost all the major locomotive firms being involved in its development and production. The new class was initially called the V 60. In 1955 the first prototype locomotives, V 60 001–004, were delivered by Krupp, Krauss-Maffei, Mak and Henschel, each having different engines. Later that same year orders for the first production locomotives were issued; they were to have GTO 6 or GTO 6A motors from Maybach. Several of the locomotives were given a stronger frame and had a higher adhesive weight of instead of . In addition these engines could carry up to an extra of ballast for heavy duties, however they continued to be classed as V 60s. A total of 942 locomotives of this class were built. In 1968 the V 60s, like all other DB locomotives were given computer readable numbers. At this point the class was divided into Classes 260 (light variant) and 261 (heavy variant). =Norwegian State Railways= In the 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) saw a need for shunters to replace the aging Di 2 units and chose to buy seven used V 260 from DB in 1985 and given the designation NSB Di 5. Two years later NSB bought another ten units, but one of them was only used for spare parts. The locomotives were numbered 5.861–877. They were scrapped between 1996 and 1998—none have been preserved. =Croatian Railways= In 1985, the Yugoslav Railways (JŽ) bought some used locomotives. They were designated JŽ 734. After the split, they were transferred to the Croatian Railways and designated Class 2133. There were two subtypes: 2133-0 with traction effort , and 2133-1 with traction effort . Technology The V 60 (260/261) is long and can run at speeds of up to . The frame is fully welded. The transmission is under the driver's cab, which itself is not quite in the centre of the vehicle. Under the front end is the motor and cooling system, under the rear end the brake compressor and main air reservoir, the fuel system and a tank. The driver's cab is sound-proofed, the footplate is at the front and the loco can be operated from either side. The drive is achieved using a 12 cylinder Maybach GT06-diesel motor capable of producing . This engine is an evolutionary development of the type G05, which was installed from 1932 in various railcars including the Flying Hamburger. The locomotive is driven by means of a hydraulic transmission by Voith via a jackshaft and coupling rods to the three axles, a concept that had also been used on earlier shunting engines such as the Class V 36. The centre axle has about of lateral play. Between the second and third axle there is a jack shaft. The locomotives have shunting and running gears. In order to start the diesel motor, it has to be pre-heated. The first batches had a small coke oven (later ones used an oil burner) and, for that reason, the locomotive carried up to of coke. The Class 362/363 engines had an electrically-controlled preheater and heat retention system. The locomotives had a compressed air through brake, an auxiliary brake and a hand brake that braked the third axle. Operations Class 261 (V 60) in 1984 at Uelzen The engines were not just used for shunting, but also for light goods and passenger train services. They were even employed hauling departmental trains. After the V 60 had been in service for about 25 years, in 1982 the DB tested a variety of shunting engines under the Class 259, which were to be the successors of the V 60\\\\. They were unable to decide on one, however, so that in the following years several measures were carried out in order to improve the economy of the V 60\\\\. In 1987 the engine was classified as a minor locomotive (Kleinlok) and reclassified. Class 260 became Class 360 and the 261s became 361s. Its categorisation as a Kleinlok saved staff costs, because the railway no longer had to employ \\"engine drivers\\", only \\"Kleinlok operators\\", whose training was cheaper. The installation of radio control enabled one-man shunting movements using remote control; the fully radio controlled models were called the Class 364 (light class) or 365 (heavy class), however the only loco in Class 364 was soon renumbered to 365 700. Since 1997 the Maybach motors have been replaced during refurbishment by Caterpillar 12-cylinder engines generating 465 kW (632 PS), this conversion only being done on engines with radio control. These locos are designated as Class 362 (light variant) and 363 (heavy variant). In 2001 one engine was equipped with a Caterpillar V8 engine run on natural gas and tested in the Munich area; it was designated as Class 760. It has since been scrapped. OSE at Thessaloniki New Passenger Station, Greece. Of the 942 locomotives originally supplied to the DB, many are still active. Those without radio control were gradually retired by early 2003, of the radio controlled locos around 400 were still working for the DB in 2004, several of which have ended up in private or industrial railways in Germany and elsewhere, as well as the state railways in Turkey, the former Yugoslavia (e.g. the Croatian Railways HŽ series 2133) and Norway (17 engines as NSB Di 5). In 2008 over 70 were owned by German private and industrial lines, of which the majority were working in construction logistics and in local goods services.Vgl.

Identical or similar locos were and are also used by other state railways. As early as the 1960s they were delivered to places like Greece (Hellenic State Railways, class A-101) or Turkey, or built under licence as in Belgium. Even Israel ran very similar engines. The museum locomotive V 60 150 was burnt up in the great fire at the Nuremberg Transport Museum's locomotive shed. Sources * Arno Bretschneider, Manfred Traube, Die Baureihe V 60\\\\.

Her best-known songs were \\"Stormy Weather\\", \\"Love for Sale\\" and \\"Far Away in Shanty Town\\". She was American-born, but was based in Britain for most of her career. Early life Welch was born in Englewood, New Jersey, where her father was chief gardener of an estate. Her father was of indigenous American and African American ancestry; her mother was of Scottish and Irish descent. Welch was brought up in a Baptist-Christian family, and began her singing in a church choir. She first intended to go from high school into social work, but instead chose to become a professional singer. She started her career in New York in 1922, but in 1929 she went on to Europe – first to Paris and then to London. Professional career After her first appearance in America in Liza in 1922, Welch was the initial singer of the Charleston in the show Runnin' Wild (1923). During the 1920s she appeared in African-American Broadway theatre shows, including Chocolate Dandies (1924) and Blackbirds of 1928. She made relatively few recordings. Before moving to Europe she made only one record – \\"Doin' The New Lowdown\\", b/w 'Digga Digga Do\\", as vocalist for the Irving Mills-assembled Hotsy Totsy Gang (Brunswick 4014, 27 July 1928). One of these was taken to Paris, where in 1929 and 1930, following artist Josephine Baker, she was in cabaret shows, including performances at the Moulin Rouge. Welch was asked to return to New York, where she replaced a singer in The New Yorkers (1930–1931) and sang Cole Porter's controversial song \\"Love for Sale\\". The composer met her afterwards in Paris, and then invited her to perform his song \\"Solomon\\" in Nymph Errant in London in 1933. That year, before this show was available, Welch was given permission to perform in London in Dark Doings, in which she sang \\"Stormy Weather\\", newly written by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. She subsequently took the song as her signature tune. Welch's show- stopping performance in Nymph Errant was seen by Ivor Novello, and in 1935, he gave her a part in his show Glamorous Night, in which she stood out again singing his blues song \\"Far Away in Shanty Town\\". In 1931, she had included in her cabaret act the new song \\"As Time Goes By\\", almost a dozen years before it achieved screen fame in Casablanca. In the late 1930s, Welch entered two media: she appeared in films – usually as a singer, including two with Paul Robeson – and was also one of the first artists to perform on television, appearing on the BBC's new TV service from Alexandra Palace. During World War II, she remained in London during the Blitz. She entertained the armed forces along with many other artists. After the war she was in many West End theatre shows, including revues. She continued on both television and radio, and was even in one pantomime, Aladdin. She also had a series of one-woman shows until 1990. She was in the Royal Variety Performance in 1979 and 1986. In 1979, her recording of \\"Stormy Weather\\" was used by Derek Jarman in his film version of Shakespeare's The Tempest. In 1980, she returned to New York to appear in Black Broadway and she appeared there again in 1986 when her one-woman show earned her an Obie Award. She was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood. Welch was the subject of This Is Your Life in October 1985 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews outside London's Palace Theatre. Her final performance was in 1996 for a television documentary, in which she sang \\"Stormy Weather\\", at the age of 93. Personal life In 1928, she was married to Luke Smith, a musician, and remained with him until his death in 1936. They had no children. Welch died at the age of 99 in Northwood, London on July 15, 2003. Legacy In February 2012, writer Bonnie Greer unveiled an English Heritage blue plaque at Ovington Court in Kensington, London, where Welch lived from 1933 to 1936.

She was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists, and the Founder and Dean Emeritus of the New York Studio School. Biography Matter's father was the American modernist painter Arthur Beecher Carles who had studied with Henri Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe. She first painted under her father's supervision at age 6 and would later recall being given a paintbox to use while working alongside him in the French countryside. At the age of 12, she returned to Europe and lived in Italy for over 2 years. She would later recount that her time in Italy—including Venice, Assisi, Rome, and Florence—was formative and her primary education in art history. Subsequent studies included at Bennett College in Millbrook, NY with sculptor Lu Duble, and in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann. In the late 1930s, Matter was an original member of the American Abstract Artists. She also worked for the Works Progress Administration. She worked with Fernand Léger, who would become a close friend, on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company and again privately on another mural. Léger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer whom she married in 1939. He also resided with the couple for a year sharing their studio and apartment. The Matters were active in the emerging mid-century New York art scene, and contact with other artists was important to them. Close friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning. In 1943, the Matters moved to California. Matter was raising an infant son but the environment away from New York was affecting her work. She returned to New York in 1946. Beginning in 1953, Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts) for 10 years, and then at the Pratt Institute for 10 years. She later taught at New York University for several years. She was a visiting critic at Antioch, Brandeis, Cincinnati School of Art, Kansas City Art Institute, Maryland Institute College of Art, Yale University, Skowhegan and American University in Washington, DC.. In 1964, she founded the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture. A year earlier, she wrote an article for ARTnews titled What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools? in which she criticised the phasing out of extended studio classes which served \\"that painfully slow education of the senses,\\" which she considered essential. The article prompted a group of Pratt students, as well as some from Philadelphia, one from Cooper Union, to ask Matter to form a school based on her ideas. The school was originally housed in a loft on Broadway and gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Early teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Philip Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman. The school continues to train emerging artists. The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley for years, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed the original locale of what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. In later life, the Matters moved to Long Island. Matter suffered a serious illness in 1979 and thereafter her husband became terminally ill. He died in 1984. She would later state that following his death, she coped by immersing herself in an intense period of work which became a sort of harvest of all the years of effort. She taught at the Studio School every other week and remained very much involved in its development. In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death. Her work is included in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Matter died in 2001.

As such he was in charge of investigations into a number of serious railway accidents in the UK. Early life Pringle was born in Madras, the son of a Scottish father, General George Pringle, and English mother, Octavia Catherine Cother.India, Select Births and Baptisms, 1786-1947 Early career Pringle became a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in 1883. As an army officer, Pringle fought in the Third Anglo-Burmese War, 1885-1886. In the Uganda railway survey between 1891 and 1892, Pringle was second in command to James Macdonald. The survey's findings confirmed that the caravan route to the Great Rift Valley was the best path for the line, followed by the easiest gradient to be found over the Mau Escarpment and down to Lake Victoria. Macdonald and Pringle recommended construction of a three-foot six inch gauge railway. They suggested that Kikuyuland would be a suitable place for whites to live, and their civilizing effect would drive out slavery, but the railway was needed to give access to the new colony. Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He received the Gill Memorial from this society in 1895 for his work on the Uganda railway survey. In 1896, he was appointed as the superintending engineer on the survey and construction of the Hyderabad-Godavari Valley Railway which comes under the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway. Inspecting officer Pringle had reached the rank of Major in 1900 when he was appointed an inspecting officer in the Board of Trade. At the start of World War I in 1914, he was appointed a deputy director of railway transport with the temporary rank of Colonel. In 1916 he was confirmed in this rank when he returned to the Board of Trade as Chief Inspecting Officer. When the Ministry of Transport was formed in 1919, he was transferred to the new ministry with his department, retaining his position as Chief Inspecting Officer until his retirement in 1929. Pringle conducted various accident inquiries, including that into the Sevenoaks derailment of 24 August 1927. He chaired a committee to investigate the general adoption of automatic train control on British railways, following the adoption of an electro-mechanical system on the Great Western Railway (GWR), reporting in April 1922. He chaired a second committee on the same subject that reported in 1930, but little was done outside the GWR. He was Chairman of the Electrification of Railways Advisory Committee, which reported in 1928. Pringle was made a Companion of the Bath in 1921, and was knighted in 1925. He died at Cuckfield, Sussex on 16 July 1938 at the age of 75.

At a length of with a width of it is the longest of the four remaining covered bridges in the state of Missouri. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History Interior view of the bridge In August 1868, a contract was awarded by the Linn County Commissioners to Bishop & Eaton for a bridge across Locust Creek, with the cost not to exceed 5,500 dollars. The structure is a Howe truss, constructed of white pine. Vertical iron rods tightly secure diagonal wooden beams to the bottom and top of the structure. In addition to its utilitarian function, over time the bridge was a hangout for locals with some proclaiming their love for one another and their presence at the bridge with carvings along the bridge's internal walls. As a popular fishing and swimming spot, the bridge was visited by John J. Pershing; his boyhood home and the state park bearing his name are nearby. At first used only for wagon, horse, and pedestrian traffic, in the early 20th century the bridge came to be used for automotive traffic as part of Missouri Route 8. It was bypassed with the completion of U.S. Route 36 in 1930. The bridge also runs parallel to the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad. After World War II, the course of Locust Creek was changed and the bridge spanned a dry creek bed. Over time the creek bed filled with silt, leaving the bridge resting on mud much of the time. In 1968, the State of Missouri acquired the bridge and established the Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site, then repaired the bridge, replacing its roof, sheeting, and flooring. The Missouri Department of Conservation undertook another major improvement in 1991, raising the bridge by six feet to protect the wooden frame and flooring from the marshy ground.

She helped found modern taxidermy. Maxwell's pioneering diorama displays are said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as William Temple Hornaday and Carl Akeley (the father of modern taxidermy). She was born in Pennsylvania in 1831. Among her many accomplishments, she is credited with being the first woman field naturalist to obtain and prepare her own specimens. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, Martha Maxwell BiographyEarly life= Maxwell was born Martha Dartt to Spencer & Amy Sanford Dartt on 21 July 1831 in Tioga County, Pennsylvania. Her father died in 1833 and her mother remarried in 1841 to Josiah Dartt, Spencer's first cousin. It was her grandmother, Abigail Stanford, who first instilled a love of nature in Maxwell, taking her for walks in the woods. In 1851 Maxwell left for Oberlin College in Ohio with plans to become a teacher. She had to drop out in 1852 due to her family being unable to afford the tuition. She returned to her parents, who were then living in Baraboo, Wisconsin. =Marriage and children= Maxwell was teaching at a local school when James Maxwell, a Baraboo businessman, hired her in 1853 to chaperone two of his children at Lawrence College in Wisconsin. In return for her services, he agreed to cover her tuition. She had been there less than a year when James proposed to her. Despite him being twenty years older, with six children, Maxwell agreed. They were married in 1854 and had a daughter, Mabel, in 1857. =Interest in taxidermy= The Maxwell family was hit with financial ruin in the panic of 1857. As a result of this, Maxwell and James joined the Colorado Gold Rush of 1860. They left their daughter Mabel behind in the care of her maternal grandparents. The Maxwells eventually settling in Nevadaville, Colorado. While James pursued mining, Maxwell took in washing, mending and baked pies to earn her own income. She made her own investments, and bought an interest in a boarding house, some mining claims, and she purchased a one-room log cabin on the plains east of Denver. In 1861 the boarding house burned down, leaving Maxwell with no way to earn an income and the family no place to live. The plan was to move to the cabin that Maxwell had bought but when they got there, they found that a claim jumper had moved into the cabin. They took the squatter to court, and the decision came down in favor of the Maxwells but the German man living in their cabin refused to move out. Maxwell waited for the man to leave the cabin on an errand. She removed the door from the frame and she entered the cabin and found amongst the man's possessions perfectly preserved stuffed birds and animals. The claim jumper was a taxidermist by training. Maxwell proceeded to put everything out on the prairie and reclaim her property. Maxwell soon wrote to family members requesting a book that would help her “to learn how to preserve birds & other animal curiosities in this country.” In 1862 Maxwell returned to Baraboo, where she studied taxidermy, taught by a local man named Ogden. In 1868 James persuaded her to return to Colorado. =Career in taxidermy= Upon Maxwell's return to Colorado she began building a collection of native birds and mammals. She made trips into the Rockies where she gathered chipmunks, various species of squirrels and birds. By the fall of 1868 Martha had prepared almost 100 specimens, ranging from chicks to hawks, and hummingbirds to eagles. She was asked to display her work at the Colorado Agricultural Society exhibition. Attendees particularly admired that Maxwell created an entire natural habitat for each species, making it appear as if they were still alive. Her work was acknowledged with a $50 prize and a diploma. In mid-1874, she opened her Rocky Mountain Museum in Boulder, Colorado at the northeast corner of Broadway and Pearl Street to display her specimens for both education and entertainment. A central part of the museum was Maxwell's exhibits of animals in their natural habitats, including a buffalo, birds, a bear, and a mountain lion. In addition, she included \\"comic groups\\" of animals, such as a small group of monkeys seated around a table playing poker, and live animals - two bear cubs, rattlesnakes, a mountain grouse, and squirrels. Hoping to find more support in a larger city, Maxwell moved her museum to Denver a little more than a year later. However she was unable to make the venture profitable. Altogether she collected many birds and mammals including black footed ferrets which had been described by John James Audubon but never seen by scientists, and the Otus asio maxwelliae (the Maxwell Owl) named in her honor by ornithologist Robert Ridgway of the Smithsonian Institution. By then she was also a regular correspondent of Spencer Fullerton Baird. Maxwell sent him two bird specimens in 1874 and he in turn supplied her with catalogs of birds and mammals. =Developed taxidermy techniques= Maxwell developed her own way of preserving the animals by molding them in plaster and then covering these molds with the animals skin which she had preserved. She later used iron frames over which to stretch the skins, rather than sewing the skins together and stuffing them, as most other taxidermists did. She also insisted that replica backgrounds portraying the animals' natural habitat were used. =Philadelphia Exposition= In 1876 Maxwell was asked to produce an exhibit for the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, the first official World's Fair. The Colorado commissioners agreed to pay for the packing and transportation of her specimens to and from Philadelphia and her living expenses while at the Centennial. To compensate Maxwell for her time, she would be allowed to keep the proceeds from the sale of any duplicate specimens and photographs of herself and her display. She created a complex habitat diorama that included taxidermy animals (that she had both hunted and mounted), running water, and some live prairie dogs. It is speculated this display was the first of its kind. The display was one of the most popular at the internationally attended event and was heavily covered by the press. The exhibition proved so popular that the fair’s official photographic firm, the Centennial Photographic Company, was unable to keep up with the demand for images. When Maxwell had photographic copies of their images made and began selling them, however, officials forced her to stop. Stereograph of Rocky Mountain display, Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, Centennial Photographic Company Many Centennial visitors apparently wanted a keepsake of Maxwell’s popular display. Maxwell had arranged mammals and birds from both the plains and mountain regions into a realistic natural setting. Buffalo and elk roamed across the plains while bears, mountain lions and smaller creatures were posed among the rocks, each at an elevation suggesting the altitude in which they were naturally found. Like her Colorado museum displays, Maxwell’s Centennial exhibition featured both taxidermy specimens and small live animals. =Financial struggles= In the years following the Centennial, Martha Maxwell continued to struggle financially. Other exhibitions of her specimens failed to garner much attention. =Death and afterward= Maxwell died in Massachusetts on 31 May 1881 of an ovarian tumor. After Maxwell's death her daughter contracted with a man in Saratoga Springs, New York to exhibit and/or sell the collection. The collection was exhibited several times but was then placed into storage. Unfortunately it was not put away carefully and pieces began to disintegrate. In 1920 Maxwell's sister, Mary, tried to retrieve the collection and planned to donate work to the University of Colorado. However, the pieces had aged badly and there was nothing worth preserving.

Early life Lovelace was born in Kansas City, Kansas, on March 16, 1913. He was married to Marjorie Van Evera Lovelace from 1937 to her death in 2005. Education He attended the University of Kansas and the University of Illinois, and in 1935 he received the degree Bachelor of Fine Arts in Landscape Architecture from the University of Illinois (now ). He studied under Harland Bartholomew, who was Professor of Civic Design at Illinois, and upon graduation he joined the firm Harland Bartholomew and Associates in St. Louis. City planner Lovelace's professional career was entirely with Harland Bartholomew and Associates. He became partner in 1943, senior partner in 1961, and chairman of the board upon the firm's incorporation in 1978. He retired in 1981. During the 46 years that Lovelace was with Harland Bartholomew and Associates, he prepared comprehensive plans for such cities as: *Washington, D.C. *Vancouver, British Columbia *Dallas, Texas *Waco, Texas *Corpus Christi, Texas *Lincoln, Nebraska *Oklahoma City, Oklahoma *Baton Rouge, Louisiana *Hamilton County, Ohio *Kansas City, Kansas *St. Louis County, Missouri *Racine, Wisconsin *Kenosha, Wisconsin He also prepared comprehensive plans for numerous smaller cities and suburbs, particularly those of St. Louis, Chicago, and Cincinnati. Lovelace was recognized as an authority in long-range planning, including plans for military installations. During his career, he prepared plans for naval facilities in Hawaii and the Philippine Islands as well as numerous Army and Air Force installations across the country. In his long career, Lovelace also prepared land-use control programs and site planning projects in the United States and Canada. His site- planning projects included Kaanapali, Hawaii, and the grounds at the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri. Grounds at the Gateway Arch National Park He offered expert testimony in numerous land use control litigation cases. Lovelace devised methodologies for relating urban park and recreational plans to the needs and interests of a population. Notable works in this field include the master plan for Balboa Park in San Diego, California, and for the park system of Charlotte and Mecklenberg counties in North Carolina. He also prepared plans for recreation areas, including Cannon Reservoir, Missouri, and Babler State Park, also in Missouri. In another facet of his career, Lovelace prepared campus master plans for universities and secondary schools in Wisconsin, Alabama, New York, and Hawaii. He also prepared plans for private residences and neighborhoods. One of Lovelace's last design interests was a courtyard for the University of Toronto Biological Station at Joker's Hill. Lovelace investigated the problems of the extension of cities. Along with Herbert Hare, he developed the concept of planning for flooding during urbanization. Lovelace and William Weismantel developed concept of the Density Zoning.E.Lovelace. W.L.Weismantel. Density zoning; organic zoning for planned residential developments. Washington, Urban Land Institute, 1961; OCLC: 224394137 Lovelace also worked on land protection. Organizational membership Lovelace was a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. He served as National Secretary and as the first chairman of Council of Fellows of the American Society of Landscape Architects. He was also the ASLA delegate to the International Federation of Landscape Architects for six years, after which he served as Secretary General and as Vice President (1975–77). Lovelace was a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers and a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners. He was a member of the American Institute of Consulting Engineers and the National Society of Professional Engineers. In addition to his professional memberships, Lovelace participated in and supported numerous civic and environmental organizations, from The Nature Conservancy to the Missouri Prairie Foundation. Lovelace was active in the Open Space Council of Metropolitan Saint Louis and served as its secretary and president. He was a member of the American Planning Association St. Louis Metropolitan Section. In 1971 Lovelace was appointed a Commissioner of Tower Grove Park, and he later served as board president, from 1988-1995. The master plan that he had prepared for the park in 1985 was adopted by the board and provided the basis for critical rehabilitation and reforestation within the park. He remained deeply interested in the park as a commissioner emeritus. Awards In December 2006, the St. Louis chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects selected Eldridge Lovelace to receive the Robert Goetz Award for a Distinguished Career in Landscape Architecture.

History Flooding along the Little Chariton River was an ongoing problem for the residents of Macon County and elsewhere in northeast Missouri since the area was first settled in the 1830s. Extensive channelization of the main Chariton River by private entities, local governments, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, while alleviating flooding issues in some areas, exacerbated them for others. Long Branch Dam was authorized by Congress in 1965 as a multi-purpose project for water supply, flood control, recreation, downstream water quality and fish/wildlife management. Construction began in 1973 and the dam was placed into operation in 1980. Long Branch Lake is the reservoir created by the dam, with about 24 miles of shoreline and a flood-control capacity of 98,000 acre-feet. In addition to the adjacent state-run state park, the dam has a visitors center at its southern end, and the Atlanta State Wildlife Area at its northern end near Atlanta, Missouri. Long Branch State Park was created by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources in 1983 after reaching a long term lease agreement with the Corps of Engineers for use of the land. Activities and Amenities The state park features a wide variety of outdoor activities including boating, swimming, water skiing, fishing, hiking trails, picnicking facilities, three boat ramps, marina, and camping area. The large public acreage surrounding the lake provide opportunities for viewing white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and migratory waterfowl.

O. P. Bland, was a British writer and journalist, best known as the author of a number of books on Chinese politics and history. He lived in China for most of the period 1883–1910. Family and early life Bland was born on 15 November 1863 in Malta, the second son of the ten children of Major-General Edward Loftus Bland (1829–1923) and Emma Frances Franks (d. 1894). He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey and Trinity College Dublin. A planned career in law was curtailed while he was still at university, and his father arranged for him to be considered for an appointment in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. Career in China Bland arrived in China in 1883, and worked in the Customs from 1 July 1883 until 31 January 1896, serving in Hankou, Canton, and Peking, serving there as Inspector-General Sir Robert Hart's Private Secretary from 1894–96. From early in his career he began writing light verse about life amongst the foreign expatriate communities in the Chinese treaty ports, collected in Lays of Far Cathay, in 1890. He married an American, Louisa Dearborn Nickels (b. c.1864), widow of M. C. Nickels and daughter of a Pacific Mail Line skipper, Captain H. C. Dearborn, in Shanghai on 29 November 1889. In 1896 Bland resigned from the Customs to take up the position of Assistant Secretary to the Shanghai Municipal Council, which governed the Shanghai International Settlement, succeeding to the Secretaryship the following year on the retirement of the incumbent, R.F. Thorburn. This was not initially an onerous position, and Bland began to develop a parallel career as a free-lance journalist. As a Customs employee he had been forbidden from writing to or for the press, but now, as well as starting a humorous weekly, The Rattle, he penned more light verse, and commenced an association with The Times as its Shanghai correspondent. Verse and Worse was published in 1902 with illustrations by Willard Dickerman Straight, who had joined the Customs in 1902, and with whom Bland struck up a friendship. Bland began to get critically engaged in the politics of Britain's China policy, and was a vocal advocate of a forward policy, especially with the arrival on the scene in China of German interests after 1897. At Shanghai during his tenure of his post as chief administrator, the International Settlement expanded in size threefold, and Bland himself was active in the Shanghai Committee of the British China Association, which advocated a more aggressive policy in China than its parent committee in London. He left the Municipal Council in 1906 to take up a new position with the British and Chinese Corporation (BCC), formed largely by Jardine Matheson and by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1898, becoming its Peking-based agent conducting railway loan negotiations with the Chinese government. This ended in acrimony in 1910 as Bland's anti-German proclivities ran counter to the Bank's policy, and he was dismissed. The following year saw the termination of his relationship with The Times. Since his move back to Peking Bland had assisted the paper's China correspondent George Ernest Morrison, who had no Chinese. Morrison eventually saw Bland as a rival and engineered his dismissal. Return to Britain Bland returned to China just once more in 1920 before his death, but the years after he left were those which saw him carve out a new career as a freelance writer and commentator, mainly on Chinese affairs. As well as a succession of commentaries, Recent Events and Present Policies in China (1912); China, Japan and Korea (1921), he published more light fiction. =Collaboration with Backhouse= He became best known, however, as co-author, with Sir Edmund Backhouse, of two best-selling accounts of recent Chinese history, China under the Empress Dowager (1910) and Annals and Memoirs of the Court of Peking (1914). Backhouse, already widely known as a Sinologist supplied the source materials for the volumes, while Bland, who had some talent as a writer, fashioned them into readable manuscripts. These books were highly influential in shaping Western opinion about the Manchu Qing Dynasty and Cixi, the late Empress Dowager. Unfortunately for Bland, Backhouse was a fantasist and forger, and attacks on the veracity of the key source used in China under the Empress Dowager, the so-called 'Diary of His Excellency Ching-Shan', commenced even before it was published. To the end of his life Bland parried attacks on the books.J.J.L. Duyvendak, 'Ching-Shan's Diary a Mystification', T'oung Pao, Volume 33, Numbers 1–5, 1937 , pp. 268–294 British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper's 1978 biography clearly laid out the lifelong pattern of fraud, forgery and deceit that had mostly engaged Backhouse's energy. =Views on post-imperial China= Bland's reputation has been further tarnished by his furious denunciation of China's nationalist revolution, China: the Pity of it (1932). Its attacks on post-imperial China, on its new nationalist aspirations and politics have seen Bland roundly identified as the quintessential 'Old China Hand', and a reactionary, if not a racist;Lo Hui- min, The Tradition and Prototypes of the China-watcher (1976) according to Hugh Trevor-Roper, however, in his biography of Sir Edmund Backhouse, Bland's opposition to Chinese nationalist movements was based upon his belief that these movements were essentially unrealistic westernised elites attempting to impose a corrupt version of a foreign style of government on a China that was unprepared for such radical change. Trevor-Roper maintains that Bland believed China would only restore its independence with a renewal of its own traditions and institutions in some form of monarchy supported by the peasantry, which Roper suggests ultimately became a reality in the form of Mao Zedong's communist \\"Empire\\". Bland was equally critical of British policy and British diplomats, attacking the 'Foreign Office School of Thought' in his reportage, and making fun of diplomatic life and loves in Peking in his lighter fiction. Bland died on 23 June 1945 in Ipswich, Suffolk, England.

Unlike private individuals who are generally subject to usury laws limiting interest rates on loans, TDICs can legally lend to property owners at rates determined by market demand. Because TDICs usually lend to borrowers with needs banks cannot accommodate (e.g., fast turnaround, multiple-use real estate projects), market rates for trust deed investments are usually significantly higher than bank mortgage rates. TDICs originate, underwrite, fund and service the loans for individual and/or group investors. Trust deed investors receive regular interest payments throughout the loan term and principal is repaid when the loan matures. In the event of default, TDICs generally manage workouts and, where necessary, foreclosure, on behalf of investors. Some TDICs have in-house real estate brokers who can re-sell REO in the event of foreclosure. Others may also have property management staff who can rent foreclosed properties on behalf of investors. Licensing requirements for TDICs vary from state to state. Generally, TDIC activities are overseen by a state's governing real estate, lending or corporation authority, or some combination. The private money loans provided by TDICs are also known as hard money loans—a reference to the hard assets that provide collateral for the loans. Hard money loans are usually short-term, bridge loans designed to meet temporary cash needs for projects that will eventually be refinanced with conventional bank loans.

The FJ Holden is a snapshot of the life of young teenage men in Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia in the 1970s and deals with the characters' difficulty in reconciling mateship with respect for a girlfriend. Debi Enker in Australian Cinema comments: \\"The FJ Holden presents the suburbs as a cultural and spiritual desert. It is a place where regular bouts with the bottle are the only antidote for lives without hope or direction.\\" The film initially received a R classification from the Australian Film Board of Review, but after an appeal to the censors it was revised to a M classification for moderate sex scenes and moderate coarse language. However, all states except Victoria and New South Wales exercised their right to override the Commonwealth decision and retained the R classification. Plot Kevin (Paul Couzens) and his best mate Bob (Carl Stever) drive around Sydney trying to pick up girls in Kevin's FJ Holden. Kevin meets Anne (Eva Dickinson) at a party and she agrees to let him to drive her home. Bob joins the ride, and she has sex with both men. However, a relationship develops between Anne and Kevin and they go to restaurants, race cars, and get drunk. The romance falters, partly because Kevin lets Bob watch them having sex in her bedroom. Drunk and upset, Kevin tries to talk to Bob, who is incapable of a serious conversation. Bob is secretly happy that he has his friend back, but neither is capable of saying what he feels.

Later, Page served as the Director of Research for the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Life and career Page was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the son of a Methodist minister. He attended Hamline University, a small Methodist- supported school in St. Paul. Originally intending to become a minister, he changed his studies to physics and in 1927 received his B.S. degree in this field. Page immediately joined the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. as a junior physicist. Somewhat later he started part-time studies at George Washington University, eventually earning a M.S. degree. Although Page had no formal education in electrical engineering, building radios had been his hobby since childhood. Assigned to the NRL Radio Division, he quickly gained the confidence of the Division Superintendent, A. Hoyt Taylor, by providing very creative solutions to a wide variety of problems. Following an observation by Lawrence A. Hyland in 1930 of radio interference caused by a passing aircraft, Taylor and Leo C. Young began an internally funded, low-level project to develop a radio-detection apparatus based on continuous wave (CW) Doppler interference. Unsuccessful with the CW approach, in 1934 Young suggested using a pulsed transmitter, similar to one that the NRL had built in 1925 for the Carnegie Institution of Washington in measuring the altitude of the ionosphere.Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve The Height of the Ionized Layer (Physical Review, Vol. 28 (1926), p. 554) Taylor assigned Page to design an apparatus for testing this suggestion. A 60-MHz (5.0-m) pulse-modulated transmitter was soon built; this generated 10-microsecond pulses with a wait-time of 90 microseconds between pulses. Using a large antenna atop the main NRL building and a separately located receiver modified to pass the pulse signals, Page began assembling the equipment. In December 1934, Page first successfully tested the apparatus, tracking an aircraft at up to one mile as it flew up and down the Potomac River. Although the detection range was small and the indications on the oscilloscope monitor were almost indistinct, it represented a proof of the basic concept.Buderi, Robert; The Invention That Changed the World, Simon & Schuster, 1996, p. 63 Based on this, Page, Taylor, and Young are generally credited with developing the world's first radar system. (RADAR is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging. Thus, to be called a \\"radar,\\" a system must both detect a target and measure the range to the target. Many earlier systems had functioned only to detect without measuring range.) After the successful demonstration of the concept, in 1935 the U.S. Senate appropriated $100,000 for further research and development of the system, now classified as Secret. Page spent much of the year improving the bandwidth and sensitivity of the receiver. In June 1936, the NRL's first prototype radar system, now operating at 28.6 MHz, was demonstrated to government officials, successfully tracking an aircraft at distances up to 25 miles. This equipment required large antennas, making it impractical for ship mounting. Attention was then given to increasing the system operating frequency and, subsequently, decreasing the antenna size (antenna size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency). For the follow-on system, the frequency was raised to 200 MHz, the limit for transmitter tubes and other components at that time; this allowed the antenna to be greatly reduced in size. Page and Young developed another important unit, the duplexer. This device allowed a common antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving. With other improvements, a full prototype system was first tested at sea on the in April 1937. Initially designated the XAF, the system was improved and tested, then placed into production as the CXAM radar, the first such system deployed by the U.S. Navy starting in May 1940. (The acronym RADAR was coined by the Navy at that time as a cover for the highly classified work in this new technology.) Page, together with the staff at the NRL, made many other major contributions to the overall evolution of radar. In addition to the duplexer, another major invention was the ring oscillator, an arrangement that allowed multiple power tubes to function as one in a transmitter and greatly increasing the power. Still another was the plan position indicator (PPI), proving the well-known circular presentation on the screen of a cathode-ray tube.Page, Robert Morris; The Origin of Radar, Doubleday & Company, 1962, pp. 111-158 When the high-power cavity magnetron from Great Britain was introduced into America by the Tizard Mission in 1940, Page turned his attention to microwave radar and, working with the MIT Radiation Laboratory and the Bell Telephone Laboratories, made invaluable contributions to this new technology. One of the most significant was a system that greatly improved the angular accuracy of tracking radars. Called monopulse radar, it was first demonstrated in 1943. This highly complex technology was later used in the AN/FPS-16, likely the most popular tracking radar in history.Page, R. M., \\"Monopulse Radar,\\" IRE National Conference Record, Vol. 3, Part 8, 1955, pp. 132-134 Following World War II, the NRL returned to performing a wide variety of basic and applied research for all parts of the Navy. Page participated broadly in these activities and in 1957 was named the NRL Director of Research. He served in this position until he retired in 1966. In his four decades at the NRL, he was awarded 65 patents, 40 directly in radar, more than any other person or group of persons.Naval Research Laboratory Seventy-Five Years of High Stakes Science and Technology Recognition For his accomplishments at the Naval Research Laboratory, Page was recognized by three Presidents: * Harry S. Truman, in 1946, awarded him the Certificate of Merit in aid of the war effort. * Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1960, presented him with the Presidential Award for Distinguished Civilian Service, the highest honor for a career employee. * Ronald Reagan, in 1986, wrote to him remarking that 50 years after his initial radar work \\"our nation's scientists continue to rely on your research.\\" In 1957, he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1979, Page was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame. He was awarded the D.Sc. Honorius Causa degree by Hamline University. The Institute of Radio Engineers recognized Page with the 1953 Harry Diamond Memorial Award for \\"outstanding contributions to the development of radar.

Overview Besides his well-known six symphonies, the Danish composer Carl Nielsen wrote many short orchestral works, one of the most famous being the Helios Overture. In 1902, Nielsen signed a contract with the publisher Wilhelm Hansen, which allowed him to go to Athens, Greece, to join his wife Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, who was one of the first sculptors allowed to make copies of the bas-reliefs and statues in the Acropolis Museum. Anne Marie, who had been granted the Ancker Award, was studying Greek art, while Nielsen, being a man of many interests, was interested in archaeology.Symphonist and opera composer. Carl Nielsen Society. The local conservatory placed a study room with a piano at Carl Nielsen's disposal. Here he could sit and compose when he was not on excursions in the surrounding mountains with or without Anne Marie. Nielsen's stay in Athens gave him the inspiration of a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the Aegean Sea, an overture which he called Helios. He began work on it in March 1903, and finished it on April 23 the same year. The score is written for three flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. The work begins as the sun ascends over the Aegean Sea, while strings, divided horns and woodwind sound a melody. This rises out of the darkness to a full orchestra, where fanfaring trumpets begin a striding theme, which returns later in the piece. From there woodwinds begin a graceful tune, from which brass sound. Strings begin to play, which draws the orchestra into a reprise of the striding theme and its fanfare. In the final measures, the music subsides as the sun sinks over the horizon of the sea. The average playing time is between ten and twelve minutes. On the score, Nielsen wrote: \\"Silence and darkness, The sun rises with a joyous song of praise, It wanders its golden way and sinks quietly into the sea.\\"Maryland Symphony Orchestra After a trip to Turkey, Carl and Anne Marie Nielsen traveled through Italy and reached Copenhagen by the end of July. The Helios Overture was successfully performed in Copenhagen on 8 October 1903, with Johan Svendsen conducting, though the reviews were mixed. Carl Nielsen performed Helios several times. The first was an evening concert dedicated to his compositions at the Odd Fellow Mansion on 11 November 1905 and the last performance was on 12 February 1930 in Gothenburg, Sweden.

He was the first and only NFL player to be signed out of high school. His children recently went on Paternity Court with Judge Lauren Lake. He is best known for backing up Mercury Morris and Jim Kiick and returning kicks for the Miami Dolphins' back to back Super Bowl champions in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. He played a total of six seasons in the NFL. Early years Leigh attended Albany High School in Albany, where he was a standout athlete in football and basketball. As a senior, he led his football team to an undefeated season. Professional career In 1965, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Leigh as an undrafted free agent, after then commissioner Pete Rozelle made a special ruling, allowing him to become the first and only NFL player to be signed directly out of high school. He was waived before the start of the season. He played three years for the Orlando Panthers and the Philadelphia Bulldogs of the Continental Football League. Leigh was a part of the taxi squad of the Cleveland Browns from 1966 to 1967, while also playing for the Panthers. He made his NFL debut in 1968, after making the team. As a running back, he rushed 23 times for 144 yards, a 6.3 yards per carry average, and he scored two touchdowns. One touchdown, scored against the Baltimore Colts, was ranked 69th among the 100 greatest rushing touchdowns in NFL history. His number of carries, total rushing yards and yards per carry average all proved to be career highs. He was also used extensively as a kick returner. He returned 14 kickoffs for 322 yards, a 23.0 yard per return average. And he returned 14 punts for 76 yards, a 5.4-yard per return average. Leigh led the Browns and placed 13th in the NFL in both yards per kickoff return and yards per punt return in 1968. He was released on August 29, 1969. On September 1, 1969, he was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers. He would later be cut and re-signed by the Browns, but received little time at running back and did not carry the ball the entire season, although he did catch two passes. He did return five punts for 18 yards and two kickoffs for six yards that season. He was cut before the start of the 1970 season. In 1970, he played 8 games for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, before being released. In 1971, he was signed by the Miami Dolphins after a tryout. That season, he rushed five times for 15 yards and returned just four kickoffs for 99 yards, although he appeared in all 14 games. He couldn't play in Super Bowl VI against the Dallas Cowboys, because of a separated right shoulder he suffered in the AFC championship game against the Baltimore Colts. Leigh became the primary punt returner for the famous 1972 Miami Dolphins team that had a perfect season and won Super Bowl VII. Leigh returned 22 punts for 210 yards and a 9.5-yard average for the 1972 Dolphins. The 22 punts returned ranked 5th in the NFL that season, and the 210 yards and 9.5 average each ranked 6th in the NFL that season. Leigh also returned six kickoff 153 yards, a 25.5-yard average, and rushed 21 times for 79 yards, a 3.8-yard average. Leigh got to play in Miami's 14–7 Super Bowl victory over the Washington Redskins, but did not have any carries or returns. Leigh had one of his most productive seasons in 1973 for the Dolphins, another Super Bowl championship team. Leigh rushed 22 times for 134 yards for a 6.1 yards per carry average with one touchdown. His yards per carry average was second on the team to Mercury Morris' league leading 6.4. He also returned nine kickoffs for 251 yards, for a 27.9 average that would have ranked 6th in the NFL had he had enough returns to qualify for the league leaders. He also had nine punt returns for 64 yards, for a 7.1 average. In 1974, he played one game for the Dolphins before being released. On September 26, 1974, he was claimed off waivers by the Green Bay Packers. He appeared in 10 games, returned 9 kickoffs, for 201 yards and a 22.3-yard average. He also carried the ball one time for the Packers but did not gain any yards. He wasn't re- signed after the season. Career stats For his career, Leigh rushed 72 times for 372 yards, a 5.2 yards per carry average and two touchdowns. The 5.2 yards per carry average was better than several of his more celebrated teammates, including Hall of Famer Leroy Kelly (4.2), Hall of Famer Larry Csonka (4.3), 3 time Pro Bowler Mercury Morris (5.1) and 2 time Pro Bowler Jim Kiick (3.7). He also returned 46 kickoffs for 1082 yards and a 23.5 yards per return average, and returned 50 punts for 368 yards and a 7.4 yards per return average.

He made his first appearance on 15 January 2009 and departed on 14 January 2010. In early December 2009, it was announced that Caulfield had quit the show and would depart shortly. Producers promised a \\"stunning exit storyline\\" which would see a who-dunnit type storyline in which Mark would be killed. Mark was murdered by his wife, Natasha Wylde, on-screen (although only the audience knew of Natasha's guilt) on 14 January 2010. The murder storyline saw the revelation of Mark and Faye's affair, that Mark is Ryan's biological father (meaning that he is Maisie's brother), and Natasha found out about Mark's cheating, giving them all motives for murder. The storyline reached its climax in mid-October, which saw Natasha confess to Mark's killing and sentenced to 21 years imprisonment and Ryan leaving the village for a fresh start. Character creation and developmentCasting= The characters of Mark and Natasha Wylde were announced in September 2008, with Maxwell Caulfield and Amanda Donohoe announced as the actors portraying them. They started filming in October 2008, and were originally thought to be first appearing on 25 December 2008, but this was later changed to 15 January 2009. Caulfield said that the role was \\"just too tempting to turn down and I can't wait to start filming in the beautiful Yorkshire countryside\\". Anita Turner, the series producer, said she was \\"thrilled to be welcoming two actors of such high calibre to the cast\\". He described the character as \\"fun to play\\". Amanda Donohoe said that the Wyldes are \\"self-made millionaires, they're very well-to-do\\", and although not looking for retirement they do want a \\"break from the big city\\". She also said that the couple have been married for 25 years and have two grown-up children and a nine-year-old. Caulfield said that there is a \\"hidden side to Mark that will come out over time\\". Although he is an \\"out-and-out charmer\\" he is one of those people whose \\"sincerity you have to question\\", he said. =Departure and death= In October 2009 after less than a year in the show Caulfield quit the show due to fear of being typecast. it was announced that the character would be killed off and made his last appearance on 14 January 2010. Storylines2009–10= Mark and Natasha first appear on horseback riding into the village to meet Bishop George, who is waiting to hand over the keys of St. Mary's Church, which they have bought in addition to Home Farm. All three then head to The Woolpack, where they are given an unfriendly welcome, as their buying the church means Ashley and Laurel Thomas have to leave the village. However, Natasha announces that they bought the church and vicarage to give back to the community - making them instantly popular. However, Natasha had not discussed this with Mark before announcing it, but later assures him that it was necessary to keep the villagers on side. A couple of months after the arrival of the Wyldes, Faye Lamb (Kim Thomson) turned up in the village after seeing Mark's photo in a magazine profile of the family. Mark saw her several times, and eventually they had a long conversation in the woods. He apologised for the way he treated her in the past and put her up in an expensive flat. In late May, it was revealed that Mark was married to Faye, making his marriage to Natasha bigamous, and his real name was Daniel Lamb. He went missing twenty-seven years ago, after going to pick up a friend from the station, and never returned. They were in serious debt as his company had just gone bankrupt. His parents never recovered from the shock and died shortly afterwards. Faye had Daniel declared legally dead seven years later. He moved to France and later set up a new identity - Mark Wylde. Faye was not sure if she was pregnant at the time and consequently did not tell him. A week later he found out that he and Faye had a son, Ryan Lamb (James Sutton). In late June, Faye told Natasha everything about Mark's previous life, Natasha was very hurt and angry with Mark that she had been lied to for more than 20 years. Faye, angered by Mark and Natasha's behaviour, moved into the village with Ryan, wanting them to get to know each other. Natasha, however, insisted that Mark arrange a job for Ryan in Dubai, which he initially did but later withdrew only days before Ryan was due to leave, as he had bonded with Ryan. Natasha was not happy, warning Mark that it was only a matter of time before the truth came out. In early January Mark and Faye were planning to get back together. Despite earlier plans, they decided to leave things as they were, aware of how much pain they would cause to their children. But Natasha guessed what Mark was doing and confronted them, just as they were making plans for Faye to move on. Faye told her this but Natasha refused to believe it, leading to a row. By this time Ryan and Maisie had started a secret relationship. However, while they are up in Ryan's bedroom they hear voices rowing downstairs, which they soon realise are Natasha, Mark and Faye. They come downstairs and announce that they are dating. Natasha, Mark and Faye explain to that they can't because they are half brother and sister and tell them that Mark is a bigamist. Both Ryan and Maisie are devastated and angry. After Natasha orders him to leave, Mark writes a suicide note that evening and goes out to the woods with a shotgun. Natasha finds the note and heads out to the woods and persuades him to give her the gun. But upon hearing him saying that he was not going to run away anymore, she shoots him with the shotgun and buries his body. His final words were, \\"I've made a decision. Let's go home.\\" Natasha said in response, \\"You don't get to make decisions anymore, Mark...\\" before shooting him dead with the shotgun, killing him instantly. As the camera pans to the sky the gunshot can be heard. Natasha panics and she buries Mark's body, off-screen.. Almost six months later, Mark's body was discovered by Sam Dingle (James Hooton), who was walking his dog in woodland. Sam called the police, who identified the skeleton as that of Mark's. Natasha played the devastated widow, claiming that she'd been away at the time Mark was murdered. Natasha and Nathan both framed Ryan Lamb (James Sutton) who was wrongfully charged with murder and wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment. Maisie however proved that Ryan couldn't have killed Mark as he was with her, trying to come to terms that he'd just slept with his secret half-sister. After her eldest son was confronted by Cain Dingle, (Jeff Hordley) who was hell-bent on exposing Mark's real killer, Natasha finally breaks down and confesses to the murder. She is arrested by Nick Henshall and placed into police custody to await sentencing. On 24 November 2010 Natasha was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 21 years. Reception Prior to the Wyldes' first appearance, the News of the World described their arrival in the village as a \\"Don't miss\\" TV moment of the week. Simon Swift, in his Soaplife blog criticised Emmerdale for not being \\"more radical\\" in their new characters.

Concerned at the lack of transparency and the high retail charges for calls to 070 numbers, Ofcom launched a call cost review in 2017.

The historic site preserves the archaeological site of a major Osage village, that once had some 200 lodges housing 2,000 to 3,000 people. The site, designated by the Smithsonian trinomial 23VE01, was also known for many years as the Carrington Osage Village Site, under which name it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964.  History The Osage Indians were first recorded in 1673 by explorers Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette. The territory claimed by the Osage at its greatest influence was vast and consisted of what is now southern Missouri, Arkansas, eastern Kansas, and Oklahoma. Between 1700 and 1775, a large group of the Osage lived in a village situated on a high, open hilltop near the Osage River valley. This area, designated as a National Historic Landmark for the importance of the Osage in this region and the size of the village, has been preserved as the Osage Village State Historic Site. At its peak, the village contained about 200 lodges with 2,000 to 3,000 people living in them. Archaeological excavations have demonstrated that the shape of the dwellings was rectangular. Artifacts such as pottery, weapons, and tools excavated from the site have provided information about the daily lives of the villagers. The men hunted game and traded with the Europeans for furs in exchange for guns and goods. The women cultivated and processed the crops, and processed game and hides to make food, clothing and tools. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Osage Indians accounted for more than half of the total European-American trade in furs along the Missouri River. After the United States government took control of the Louisiana Purchase territory in 1804, its settlement policies encouraged European Americans to come into the area. It made treaties with the Osage so that they would cede their territory to the US. The Osage Indians were gradually forced to retreat to a reservation in Indian Territory, now Oklahoma.

She made her first appearance, along with her husband Mark Wylde (Maxwell Caulfield), on 15 January 2009. It was announced in July 2010 that Donohoe had quit her role as Natasha, and would leave the series later in the year. She made her final appearance on 24 November 2010.  Creation and development  The characters of Mark and Natasha Wylde were announced in September 2008, with Maxwell Caulfield and Amanda Donohoe announced as the actors portraying them. They started filming in October 2008, and were originally thought to be first appearing on 25 December 2008, but this was later changed to 15 January 2009. The casting of Amanda Donohoe, a well-known name in the United Kingdom and a Golden Globe Award-winning actress, caused press interest with Donohoe doing many interviews prior to her character's first appearance. In one interview she defended soap actors and said that it is a \\"huge privilege\\" to be on the screen of \\"eight million people five days a week\\". Describing being asked to take the part, Donohoe said, \\"I would have been stupid to say no. I am quite excited because I pretty much take over the village and cause a lot of trouble\\", also saying in another interview that she was \\"flattered\\" to be asked to join the soap. In an interview with the Daily Express, the actress said that although she was flattered they wanted to create a role for her, it was \\"a hell of a challenge\\". Anita Turner, the series producer, said she was \\"thrilled to be welcoming two actors of such high calibre to the cast\\". Describing her character she said Natasha is \\"not a classic soap 'bitch'\\" and described her as \\"humorous, witty and strong\\" but would \\"rub people up the wrong way\\". Amanda Donohoe said that the Wyldes are \\"self-made millionaires, they're very well-to-do\\", and although not looking for retirement they do want a \\"break from the big city\\". Donohoe said the couple have two grown-up children and a nine-year-old. Storylines Mark and Natasha first appear on horseback, going to meet Bishop George, who will give them the keys to St. Mary's Church and Home Farm, as they are the new owners. All three head to The Woolpack, where they receive an unpleasant welcome, as the fact they bought the church means Ashley and Laurel Thomas were having to leave. However, Natasha announces that they bought the church and vicarage to return it to the community - making them instantly popular. =Bigamy= In late June, Natasha discovers Mark is married to Faye Lamb. Mark, real name Daniel Lamb, went missing twenty-seven years ago. He told Faye that he was going to collect a friend from the station and never returned. They were in serious debt as his company had gone bankrupt. His parents never recovered and died shortly after Faye had Daniel declared legally dead. Unaware of this and the fact that Faye was expecting their child, he moved to France and set up a new identity – Mark Wylde. Natasha was very hurt, knowing her marriage was a lie. She left briefly but returned, deciding not to end things with Mark. However, she insisted that Mark's past was kept a secret, paying Faye to leave after threatening to report her for insurance fraud. Faye, however, angered by Mark and Natasha's behaviour, moved to the village with Ryan, wanting Mark and Ryan to get to know each other. Natasha, wanting them to leave, got Mark to arrange a job in Dubai for Ryan after he made friends with his half-brothers. However, Mark wanted Ryan to stay and withdrew the Dubai job, much to Natasha and Ryan's horror. Maisie, however, struggled to cope with Faye and Ryan's presence. She saw Faye as the woman determined to break up her family, thinking Mark and Faye had had an affair. The affair was over and Natasha had forgiven Mark. Maisie also forgave him, on the understanding that he wouldn't hurt her mother again. They became reluctant friends, due to both making an effort to get on as Ryan was dating Katie Sugden. =Murder= During December 2009, Ryan and Maisie got closer. They spent more time together and Maisie helps him choose a Christmas present for Katie. Eventually they realize they have romantic feelings for each other and, after Nathan sees them kissing, Ryan ends things with Katie and they start dating. Meanwhile, Mark and Faye were also planning to get back together but changed their minds, aware of the pain that would be caused. Natasha caught them kissing and confronted them, leading to a row. All three were horrified to see Ryan and Maisie come downstairs and announce their new relationship. They were relieved to hear that they hadn't slept together and Natasha told them that they were related. Neither took the news well so Faye and Natasha concentrated on taking care of their children and asked Mark to leave. Nathan was furious when he heard Ryan call Mark Dad but went to look after Maisie and his mother. Mark tried explaining but no one wanted to listen so when they left, he went to the woods with a shotgun. Natasha found him and, scared he would shoot himself, persuaded him to give her the gun. But listening to Mark talk about how he was tired of running, infuriated Natasha so much that she shot him and buried his body in the woods. Returning to the house, she told her children that Mark has left and she has no idea where he is. On 28 January, Faye reported Mark's disappearance. They question Natasha, who tells them about Mark's life as Daniel Lamb and that he is a bigamist. Nathan is suspicious of Natasha's erratic behaviour, following Mark's disappearance, and she eventually tells Nathan that she killed him. Initially furious, he tried digging up Mark's body but agreed to keep Natasha's secret for the sake of his siblings and on condition that Natasha gives him her money. She does and Nathan leaves the village for London. Businessman Declan Macey buys a 51% share of Home Farm Estate. He and Natasha later start dating. Nathan returns in May and takes an instant dislike of Declan. He demands that Natasha end things with Declan and buy him out but she refuses. Nathan threatens to report her to the police for Mark's murder but backs down when Natasha tells him she'll report him for helping cover the murder up. Nathan returns Natasha's money and starts running the Estate with Natasha and Declan. In June, Sam Dingle finds Mark's wallet. His half-brother, Cain, uses Mark's credit card to send the family some flowers. Natasha initially thinks Nathan sent the flowers and throws them at his car when he pulls up outside the house. Cain also sends one of Mark's suits to Declan, who demands the truth from the Wyldes. Natasha later arranges to meet Cain after Nathan tells her that he is the blackmailer and he demands money but she refuses. Will later goes missing and Natasha thinks that he has been kidnapped. She and Nathan later discover that Cain took Will and Belle to the cafe for ice cream. Thankful that Will is safe, Natasha pays Cain to stay away from them. In July 2010, Nathan and Natasha plan to frame Faye for Mark's murder. Natasha agrees to the plan, believing Mark's death would have never happened if Faye hadn't come to the village. On 26 July, Sam's dog, Alfie, finds Mark's body. The police found Mark's watch and other evidence to identify the body. The police ask Natasha if Mark had a pin in his knee, which she confirms and also confirms that the body is Mark's. Natasha tells her children that their father is dead and is devastated at the hurt and pain she has caused them. Framed by Nathan, Ryan is arrested and charged with murder. Later, Maisie leaves the village, believing Ryan is innocent. She thinks Nathan killed Mark, and Natasha is covering for him. Declan loses faith in Natasha and dumps her, agreeing with Maisie. Declan refuses Natasha and Nathan's offer to buy him out of Home Farm, believing that the Wyldes will soon be leaving. Maisie returns and visits Natasha, demanding she explain why she is covering for Nathan, staying with Faye. Natasha visits her but argues with Faye, telling her that Mark would still be alive if she hadn't come to the village. Faye slaps her and Natasha walks away but Faye shouts after her that she and Nathan will never be free of their guilt. Natasha gives evidence at Ryan's trial. She falters on reading the oath but gives a convincing performance as a grieving widow. During the trial, Nathan is kidnapped by Cain, who intended to torture him to get a confession. Natasha tries contacting Nathan but does not get a reply. On 26 October 2010, Ryan is found guilty and as she leaves the court, Maisie confronts Natasha and again accuses her of covering for Nathan, and as good as killing Ryan. Natasha goes home to discover Will has returned from staying with a family friend and finds Cain in the kitchen. He reveals he kidnapped Nathan and has left Maisie with him, taking Natasha and Will to the barn where he is holding Nathan captive and after hearing Nathan scream, Natasha finds Maisie about to hit Nathan with a piece of wood. Nathan told Maisie that Natasha had killed Mark but Maisie didn't believe him. Thinking Nathan committed the murder, she asks Natasha to stop covering for Nathan. Natasha then confesses that she killed Mark but Will overhears her confession. Natasha gives Maisie her mobile phone and tells her that her fate is in her hands. Maisie calls the police, despite Natasha and Nathan's suggestions of a fresh start and blaming Cain for forcing her to confess but she refuses. Natasha apologizes to Maisie and goes to hug Will to tell him that she still loves him but Will rejects her, saying he doesn't want her love, he wants his father back. The police arrive and Natasha is arrested and taken away. The following day, Maisie visits Natasha in prison and demands the whole truth. Natasha tells Maisie that she acted alone but Maisie refuses to believe her. Natasha asks Maisie to bring Will on her next visit but Maisie says that neither of them want to see her again. Natasha is then escorted to her cell by a prison guard. The door is shut and locked. Natasha sits down on a chair and resigns herself to her fate. On 24 November 2010, Natasha is sentenced to life imprisonment for Mark's murder and ordered by the judge to serve a minimum term of 21 years before being considered for parole. Nathan attends Natasha's sentencing and is shocked by the length of the sentence. Faye also attends the sentencing. As Natasha is led away, she mouths the word \\"sorry\\" to Nathan. Natasha is last seen being escorted into prison by guards. Reception Prior to the Wyldes' first appearance, the News of the World described their arrival in the village as a \\"Don't miss\\" TV moment of the week. Simon Swift, in his Soaplife blog criticised Emmerdale for not being \\"more radical\\" in their new characters, rather than having another \\"bitch\\" stereotype, although he said if Natasha was to \\"reach the heights of Kim Tate - we'll all be happy\\". Swift was, however, thankful that the character was not \\"another Dingle\\".

Having been abandoned in the library's drop box in January 1988, he was adopted by the library and gained local attention for his story shortly thereafter. His fame soon grew nationally, then internationally, and he was featured in a variety of mediums, including Paul Harvey's radio program The Rest of the Story and a Japanese documentary about cats. His story became so well known that, after his death in December 2006, his obituary was featured in more than 270 newspapers worldwide. Dewey's caretaker, head librarian Vicki Myron, published a book on Dewey's life in 2008, entitled Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World, which became a New York Times number one nonfiction bestseller. It was translated into numerous languages. She adapted it for two children's versions. In addition, she wrote a sequel Dewey's Nine Lives (2010) and that year also published a third children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library. Early life On January 18, 1988, Vicki Myron, a librarian at the Spencer Public Library, discovered an eight-week-old male kitten that had been left in the library's drop box the previous night. Myron nursed the cat, which was suffering from frostbite, back to health and named him Dewey, after Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal library classification system. The library decided to keep him as a library cat and his story first received publicity in the Spencer Daily Reporter a week after his discovery.Myron, pp. 19–20 A contest to name the cat received nearly 400 entries, the majority of which supported retaining the name \\"Dewey\\". The librarians added \\"Readmore Books\\" to his full name, inspired partially by the cartoon library cat Cap'n O. G. Readmore, although he was usually referred to as just \\"Dewey\\". Aside from a brief episode in August 1989, when he escaped and went missing for almost a week after a janitor left a side door open at night, Dewey spent the remainder of his life in the library.Myron, p. 153 He was given the title of staff supervisor and his birthday was celebrated on November 18. Worldwide fame In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into a charity pet photograph contest at Spencer's Shopko as a way to promote the library; Dewey won the contest by a landslide, after receiving more than 80% of the votes.Myron, pp. 159–160 Dewey's win was covered in The Des Moines Register, which led to increased local and state publicity in print and on television,Myron, pp. 163–164 and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area.Myron, p. 221 An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop as a way to protect him from the cold.Myron, p. 170 He gained further recognition when he was featured in Gary Roma's late 1990s documentary Puss in Books, and his fame spread internationally. He appeared in calendars, and was discussed on an episode of Paul Harvey's The Rest of the Story in June 1999. In 2004 he made an appearance in a Japanese documentary and gained a cult following in that country.Myron, pp. 243–250 Featured on postcards sold by the Friends of Spencer Public Library, by 2005 Dewey had helped raise $4000 for the institution. Later years and legacy Early in life, Dewey was diagnosed with megacolon, which was expected to shorten his lifespan. The condition was aggravated by his refusal to eat foods that would ease his condition, as he was a notoriously finicky eater.Myron, pp. 206–207 In later years he was also afflicted with arthritis. In October 2006 he was discovered to be suffering from hyperthyroidism.Myron, pp. 280–281 Shortly before November 18, he was diagnosed with a painful stomach tumor. Myron had Dewey euthanized on November 29. He had achieved an age equivalent to a human in his nineties. Dewey's obituary ran in over 270 national and international newspapers and his death was announced on Japanese television.Myron, pp. 294–295 A public memorial service was held in December 2006 and his cremated remains were buried outside of the library. Despite numerous offers, the library placed a two-year moratorium on getting a new cat.Myron, pp. 294–299 In January 2009, the library board voted to have a permanent prohibition against any other cats or pets at the library, to avoid problems for patrons with allergies. In 2008 Myron published Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World, written with the help of Bret Witter, which reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list of nonfiction books. The book told the story of Dewey's life at the library, interspersed with the difficulties faced by the town and Myron in her personal life, and how Dewey helped ease those burdens. Based on their first book, Myron and Witter published two children's books: Dewey: There's a Cat in the Library!, a picture book for young children and Dewey: The Library Cat, a book for middle-grade readers. Later in 2008, Meryl Streep was cast to star in a film based on the book. By May 2012, a final script had not been approved, and the film option was due to expire in June 2012. Myron and Witter published a sequel, Dewey's Nine Lives, in 2010, detailing previously unreleased stories about Dewey, as well as tales Myron heard about other cats after Dewey's death. That same year, Myron and Witter published a children's book, Dewey's Christmas at the Library, intended for 3–6 year-olds.

The state park was named in honor of General of the Armies John J. Pershing, who led the United States forces in Europe in World War I and who grew up in Laclede. History Long before John Pershing was born, or before any European immigrants reached the midwest, the land that encompasses Pershing State Park was the domain of Native Americans, mostly of the Sac and Fox tribes. The land in northern Missouri was used largely as hunting grounds for the tribes, but a few native settlements were established. Within the boundaries of Pershing State Park are two burial mounds and a former village site. The burial mounds are estimated to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old. Pershing State Park had its beginning in 1937 when the State of Missouri purchased a large tract of land, some 1,770 acres, a short distance west of Laclede for $20,000. Since the early 1930s a group from Laclede had petitioned the Federal government to create a national military memorial to Pershing in Linn county. However regulations prevented Congress from doing so for a person still living (Pershing did not die until 1948). A state park was seen as the next best alternative. Pershing's father had owned two farms in the vicinity, and Pershing himself had roamed the area in his youth, hunting and fishing along Locust Creek and within the Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site. Once purchased, the park was dedicated in 1940. The land however remained largely unused and undeveloped for several years save for two buildings constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps just prior to World War II. This lack of overdevelopment would later prove a plus as the meandering Locust Creek—with its wet prairie, marshes, and bottomland forests—reflects the natural wetland state of some northern Missouri lands before agricultural development and the channelization of large creeks and rivers. Features The park's War Mothers Memorial honors mothers who have lost their sons in war. It was dedicated in 1940 by the Missouri chapter of the American War Mothers organization. The Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site is across U.S. Route 36 from the main portion of the park. Activities and amenities Much of the park is undeveloped native habitat. Hiking trails include the 1.5-mile-long Boardwalk Trail that winds through shrub swam, wet prairie, marshland, and bottomland forest. The trail area has been designated an Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. The 6-mile-long Locust Creek Riparian Trail links the park to the Fountain Grove Conservation Area. The park also offers camping, fishing and boating on four small lakes, and picnicking facilities. See also *Gen. John J.

History Anticipating the forthcoming Second Reform Act under Benjamin Disraeli, numerous prospective electors decided to form a club closely aligned to the Conservative party. Adopting the model such other clubs as the Junior Athenaeum and the Junior Oxford and Cambridge Club, the Junior Carlton styled itself after the Carlton Club, which had a fixed number of members and a lengthy waiting list, and so was likely to remain out of the reach of these soon-to-be-enfranchised/newly enfranchised electors. According to Anthony Lejeune, the Junior Carlton was the only one of the many clubs with the 'Junior' prefix to achieve anything of the prestige of the longer- standing, more established clubs which they sought to emulate. Club building From 1869, the club was housed in sumptuous premises at 30 Pall Mall designed by David Brandon, which it occupied well into the twentieth century.Survey of London: volumes 29 and 30, Author F. H. W. Sheppard (General Editor) The club building was built by Lucas Brothers.Charles Thomas Lucas at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In the post-World War II era, the club was to be the victim of a planning decision by its ruling committee. The \\"senior\\" Carlton Club building at 94 Pall Mall had suffered a direct hit during the Blitz, and the site had proved difficult to sell for redevelopment. In 1963, the Junior Carlton's committee decided to proceed with the sale of the existing Junior Carlton building, and use part of the proceeds to purchase the site of the old Carlton. They opted to construct a bold new building described at the time as \\"the club of the future\\". The resulting concrete structure, luridly decorated to 1960s architectural tastes, opened in 1968 and is still in use today as an office building. It proved so unpopular with the membership of the time that many left, mainly joining the Carlton. By 1977, the club was wound down and its few remaining members formally merged with the Carlton.

Stefanics (born November 9, 1950), is an American politician from New Mexico, currently serving in the New Mexico Senate and previously on the Santa Fe County Commission. She was the first openly LGBT member of the New Mexico legislature, serving a single four-year term that began in January 1993. Early life and career  Stefanics was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio but moved to New Mexico to teach at the University of New Mexico in 1982. The daughter of an airplane mechanic and a secretary, she earned three college degrees. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from Eastern Kentucky University, before doing a masters in resource management at the University of Wisconsin and earning a doctorate in administration and law from the University of Minnesota. In addition, she has done post-doctoral work at the University of New Mexico in public administration and health care. She spent more than ten years as the executive director of Open Hands, a charity serving the elderly, disabled and poor, before it shutdown from a lack of funds and substantial debt. Before that, she was executive director of New Mexico AIDS Services. Professional careerState Senate= In 1992, Stefanics ran for the New Mexico Senate in the 39th district, a mostly rural district covering parts of six counties in northern New Mexico. She won the seat and took office in January 1993. During her four years in the senate, she co- chaired the Health and Human Services Interim Committee. In her race for re- election in 1996, she faced a primary challenge from Phil Griego, a former member of Santa Fe City Council. She lost the primary election by a margin of 54 votes and Griego went on to win the seat. In 1998, she ran for a seat on the newly created Public Regulation Commission from the 3rd district. In the primary election held on June 2, 1998 she faced fellow Democrat Jerome Block. The race was extremely close and Stefanics originally appeared to have won but final results, which included a number of originally uncounted ballots from Rio Arriba County, showed Block winning by approximately 0.2%. He went on to win the general election handily. In 2000, she mounted a rematch against Griego, aiming to win back the seat she'd previously held in the state senate. She lost the primary by 53% to 47%. Nearly 15 years after losing to Greigo, Stefanics announced in September 2015 that she would run again for the state senate in the 39th district. =Executive appointments= Stefanics spent several years as the director of the New Mexico Health Policy Commission, a post to which she was appointed by Governor Bill Richardson. She had previously spent three years as deputy secretary of the state Human Services Department. =County Commission= In 2008, Stefanics mounted a bid for the Santa Fe County Commission from the 5th district, which covers Eldorado and the Community College District south of the city. She won the Democratic primary election convincingly, garnering 52% of the vote in a five-way race. She was unopposed in the general election and took office on January 1, 2009. Stefanics was up for re-election in 2012 but drew no opponents in either the primary or general elections. She can not run again due to term limits. Personal life Stefanics is a lesbian and was the first openly gay person to serve in the New Mexico Legislature. She has spent almost two decades with her partner, Linda Siegle, a former chairman of the Santa Fe Community College Board of Trustees. Her campaigns have often won the support of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund.

The first single they produced for Dean was \\"Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)\\", which was originally titled \\"Dance Your Love Away\\" and reworked by Waterman when Dean was unhappy with the chorus. The engineer of the song had accidentally mixed the drum beats backwards, which produced an unusual juddering sound across the recording, but Waterman was so impressed with the result that it stayed on the song.

At the 1936 Big Ten Conference track championship, Osgood won the 120-yard high hurdles in 1936 with a time of 14.2 seconds. His time in the high hurdles tied Percy Beard's world record of 14.2 seconds.\\" He also placed second to Jesse Owens in the low hurdles. The 1936 race between Osgood and Owens is one of the most told stories about Jesse Owens. Owens started badly and was in last place (trailing by 18 to 20 yards). Osgood was leading and reportedly said that when Owens passed him, \\"it sounded like a thunderstorm.\\" At the end of the 1936 track season, Osgood was selected as the captain for the 1937 team. World record in the 120-yard high hurdles The 1937 Michigan track team led by Osgood won the Big Ten Conference championship. At the Big Ten championship held in May 1937 at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor, Osgood broke the world's record for the 120-yard high hurdles with a time of 14.0 seconds, one-tenth of a second under the previous world record set by 1936 Olympic gold medalist, Forrest Towns. The University of Michigan yearbook for 1937 noted that the race was run in the \\"driving rain, which soon turned the track into a miniature lake,\\" requiring the athletes to splash their way \\"through the mud.\\" The New York Times reported on Osgood's accomplishment as follows: \\"Captain Robert D. Osgood, a lanky senior from Lakewood, Ohio, scissored over the 120-yard high hurdles in the dazzling world-record time of 14 seconds today to embellish a smashing Michigan team triumph in the thirty-seventh annual Western Conference track and field championship meet.\\" Osgood's world record performance was cited at the end of 1937 as one of the highlights of the year's track season. One columnist described the performance as follows: \\"Driving through a sheet of rain that beat into his face with every stride, Bob Osgood shattered everything that had ever been done before in the 120-yard high hurdles in winning the Big Ten championship at Ann Arbor in 14 flat. This under miserable conditions on a wet and slow track.\\" Another columnist noted that the \\"bespectacled young man\\" had set the record \\"in the rain and puddles of water,\\" and asked, \\"What might Bob Osgood have done if the cinders had been dry and fast with no drizzle beating into his face?\\" Osgood's world record was broken in April 1938 when Rice Institute's Fred Wolcott ran the 120-yard high hurdles with a downwind burst of 13.9 seconds. Honors Osgood was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1983. And in 1992, he was also posthumously inducted into the Lakewood Athletic Hall of Fame.

It is the third book on the Gabriel Allon series.  Plot The Great synagogue of Rome, the location where the fictional pope Paul VII. in Daniel Silva's novel The Confessor plans to address the Jewish people Gabriel Allon is tasked to investigate the murder of scholar Benjamin Stern in Munich. The lack of Stern's computer and other documents indicate that he was not killed for being a Jew — but rather for his current research. But Stern kept his research secret, so that Allon must solve a homicide with almost no clues. Meanwhile, the death of Pope John Paul II has led to a conclave at the Vatican. The new pope, Pietro Lucchesi, who calls himself Paul VII, immediately angers powerful members of the Vatican by announcing his desire to speak at the synagogue of Rome. Opponents, such as Cardinal Marco Brindisi suspect that Paul VII intends to unearth candid and potentially damaging information about the role of the Catholic Church during the Holocaust. Cardinal Brindisi is also the spiritual leader of a group called Crux Vera, a secret society established to defend the reputation and power of the Catholic Church at all costs. Roberto Pucci serves as the financial executive while Carlo Cassagrande, a former general within the Carabinieri, sees to security matters. The society enjoys considerable power within the Vatican. Because of their zealous commitment to the church, they vehemently oppose any policy that could darken the church's reputation. Allon's independent homicide investigation further complicates this dilemma, for the clues that he seeks will connect the Crux Vera to Stern's death. As a result, the brotherhood must eliminate everyone that might inform Allon of Stern's death and of the society's existence. The search for a motive for Stern's death leads Allon to the village of Brenzone on Lake Garda in northern Italy. There he learns that Stern had visited the local Convent of the Sacred Heart and contacts its superior, Mother Vincenza. She affirms that Stern had met with her to research places where Jews sought refuge during the Holocaust and she shows Allon a basement where Jews purportedly stayed. However, an unidentified caller warns Allon that Mother Vincenza is lying and that the truth can only be found through Sister Regina and another person by the name of Martin Luther. Upon Allon's departure, Mother Vincenza secretly informs Crux Vera of Allon's visit. Stern's murderer is a professional hitman from Switzerland named Eric 'Leopard' Lange, from whom Cassagrande commissions yet another murder. To Achille Bartoletti of the Italian police, Cassagrande paints Allon as a would-be papal assassin. Cassagrande thus gains control not only over the Vatican police but also over its Italian counterpart. Allon meets with Rabbi Zolli in Venice and encounters his daughter Chiara Zolli for the first time. Zolli explains that to his knowledge no Jews were harboured in the Brenzone abbey. In fact, evidence seems to suggest the opposite: that the church expedited the removal of Jews and later helped Nazi leaders escape judgement. Allon then travels to Vienna to inform his colleague Eli Lavon of his findings. Eli reveals that the Martin Luther in question was the Nazi director of the German Foreign Office, which collaborated with European governments to track down and remove Jews. According to Eli, the Nazis especially wished to maintain positive relations with the Vatican, for any denunciation of the Holocaust by a pope would have certainly made the Nazis' work more difficult. Allon and Eli conclude that there must be some connection between Nazi leader Martin Luther and the Convent of the Sacred Heart. Upon discovering that Stern consulted with British journalist Peter Malone, Allon travels to London. Malone tells Allon that his recent book about Crux Vera had raised Stern's interest. Stern also hired Malone to track down two missing priests who were presumed dead and that the Roman police detective Alessio Rossi had been forced to close his files about their cases. Malone suggests that Crux Vera orchestrated Stern's death to keep further details about the society's identity and secrets from being published. Shortly after Allon leaves Malone, Eric Lange arrives and kills the journalist. As Lange leaves Malone's flat, an Israeli surveillance technician gets a picture of the elusive Leopard, who soon consults with the professional terrorist Rashid Husseini, from whom he learns Allon's true identity. Lange anticipates that Allon will seek out detective Alessio Rossi and hires Husseini to follow Rossi until Allon surfaces. Allon contacts Rossi in Rome, who surmises that the disappearance of the two missing priests points to a cover up within the Vatican. The arrival of a special police unit at Allon's hotel cuts short their discussion. Police shoot at the two fleeing men, killing Rossi and wounding Allon. Chiara Zolli rescues Allon and reveals that she also works for the Mossad and has been monitoring Allon throughout his investigation. The investigation of Stern's death now comes to the attention of Shimon Pazner, the Mossad's katsa in Rome, who sees no other option but to deport him to Israel. However, Zolli feels that Allon must not abandon the investigation. They board Allon's deportation boat, navigate to the Provence to meet with Antonia Huber, the daughter of Sister Regina Carcassi. The former delivers an account of a clandestine meeting between Nazi agents and members of the Vatican on the premises of the Brenzone abbey. In this meeting, members of the Curia assured the cooperation of the Vatican with Martin Luther's removal of the Jews. Sister Regina, who witnessed the meeting, did not share her knowledge with anyone, but instead, wrote the account. Huber confides to Allon that she also gave a copy of the letter to Stern. The letter proves that the missing priests were present at the meeting, and Huber adds that her mother was later murdered. Allon feels certain that the series of disappearances and murders relates to the pact between Nazi and Curia elements. Back in Munich, Allon finds a Nazi document that links the Holy See to Martin Luther's removal of the Jews. Both return to Vienna to meet with Eli and Shamron, Allon's superior at the Mossad. Shamron notifies Allon of the pope's intention to speak at the synagogue of Rome and surmises that the pope's mission and life is in danger from the same people that killed Stern. He urges Allon to personally share the documents with the pope and to safeguard the pope. Meanwhile, Crux Vera has again hired hitman Eric Lange, this time with the purpose of killing the pope at the synagogue. Through his contacts in the art restoration community, Allon secures a private audience with Pope Paul VII. The pope attests to the verity of the documents and cites his own personal testimony, for he himself, like Sister Regina, had overheard the terrible meeting at the Convent of the Sacred Heart while living as an orphan in the abbey. The pope's determination to speak at the synagogue stems from his conviction that the Catholic Church has many offenses to confess to the Jews. Paul VII ignores Allon's admonition to cancel the appointment at the synagogue and instead suggests that Allon personally accompany him within the pope's security team. Surprisingly, the pope's speech at the synagogue proves uneventful. But at the very same time Cassagrande secretly renounces his role in the pope's assassination and instead hires Lange to kill its instigator, Marco Brindisi. Cassagrande then commits suicide. Allon arrives a few seconds late at the crime scene but manages to pursue Lange on a motorbike. But in the narrow alleys of Trastevere Lange manages to escape, while Allon crashes on the street's pavement and tumbles hard. His wounds are critical and Paul VII himself provides him with the attention of the pope's personal medical staff. When Allon recovers, it is clear that he and Chiara have developed romantic feelings for each other. Meanwhile, details of Brindisi and Cassagrande's plot are leaked to the press. The story links Pucci to Crux Vera and eventually destroys his financial empire. Although the pope chooses to protect the church by denying the newspaper's findings, he seizes the opportunity to rid the Curia of members of the Crux Vera. Shamron returns to Tel Aviv and creates Team Leopard, a task force devoted to identifying and killing Eric Lange. The story ends months later when Allon personally locates and kills Lange.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw- Hill. .James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . The primary defect appears to be abnormal keratinization of the hair shaft in the keratogenous zone, allowing for intussusception of the fully keratinized and hard distal shaft into the incompletely keratinized and soft proximal portion of the shaft.  Genetessive genodermatosis characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, trichorrhexis invaginata, and atopic diathesis with failure to thrive. Chronic skin inflammation results in scaling and exfoliation, predisposing these patients to life-threatening infections, sepsis, and dehydration. The Netherton syndrome Mendelian Inheritance in Man is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations of both copies of the SPINK5 gene (localized to band 5q31-32), which encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor). LEKTI is expressed in epithelial and mucosal surfaces and in the thymus. Each SPINK5 mutation leads to a different length of LEKTI protein, resulting in genotype/phenotype correlations in cutaneous severity, susceptibility to atopic dermatitis, growth retardation, skin infection, increased stratum corneum protease activities, and elevated kallikrein levels in the stratum corneum. Trichorrhexis invaginata, or bamboo hair, is a hair shaft abnormality that occurs as a result of an intermittent keratinizing defect of the hair cortex. Incomplete conversion of the sulfhydryl –SH group onto S-S disulfide bonds in the protein of the cortical fibers leads to cortical softness and subsequent invagination of the fully keratinized distal hair shaft into the softer, abnormally keratinized proximal hair shaft. Intussusception of the distal hair shaft into the proximal hair shaft results in a distinctive ball- and-socket hair shaft deformity. The affected hairs are brittle and breakage is common, resulting in short hairs.http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/10712206 Migratory lesions of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa may be caused by a dermal influx of inflammatory cells that undergo phagocytosis and digestion by keratinocytes, resulting in disruption of keratinization.http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/3718867 Increased transepidermal water loss resulting from the disturbance of corneocyte barrier function in erythroderma may cause profound metabolic abnormalities and hypernatremia, particularly in neonates. Epidemiology Approximately 200 cases of trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) have been reported in the literature, but the true incidence is not known. The incidence of trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) may be as high as 1 case in 50,000 population. Girls are affected more often by trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) than boys, but is present in all races.Traupe H. The Ichthyoses. A Guide to Clinical Diagnosis, Genetic Counseling, and Therapy. Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1989.  History  In 1937, Touraine and Solente first noted the association between hair-shaft defects (bamboo node) and ichthyosiform erythroderma. Còme first coined the term ichthyosis linearis circumflexa in 1949, although Rille had previously recorded the distinctive features of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa by 1922.Ali M, Marks R, Young E, et al. Netherton's syndrome. A familial occurrence. Br J Dermatol. 1998. In 1958, Netherton described a young girl with generalized scaly dermatitis and fragile nodular hair-shaft deformities, which he termed trichorrhexis nodosa. Later, this was more appropriately renamed as trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair) for a ball-and-socket–type hair-shaft deformity at the suggestion of Wilkinson et al.http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/13582191Fruhwald R. Zur frage der comelschen krankheit. Dermatol Wochenschr. 1949;150:289.

Best known for his 1931 novel Saturday Night at the Greyhound – an unexpected success for the Hogarth Press – he was a member of the Birmingham Group of working class authors, which included Walter Allen, Leslie Halward, Walter Brierley and Peter Chamberlain. His elder brother was a motorcycle racer, Jimmy Simpson (James Hampson- Simpson). Early life Hampson was born in Handsworth in Birmingham. Prevented by ill health from completing his formal education, Hampson worked in a munitions factory in World War I and held a variety of jobs in Nottingham and Derbyshire in subsequent years, such as a waiter, a chef and a billiard- marker, and running a pub with his sister. A conviction for shoplifting books meant serving a prison term in Wormwood Scrubs. In 1925 he was offered employment by a wealthy family in Dorridge, Solihull, as a residential nurse and companion for their son Ronald, who had Down syndrome. The security provided allowed him to start writing. He made a number of literary friends, including Forrest Reid, J. R. Ackerley, William Plomer, John Lehmann, and E. M. Forster. Work On Plomer's advice Hampson sent three manuscripts to Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press. Despite considering the longer O Providence \\"much the better book\\", they selected Saturday Night at the Greyhound as most suitable as a first publication. The third manuscript was Go Seek a Stranger, the first novel Hampson had written, which remained unpublished due to its explicit homosexual subject-matter, although Virginia Woolf later remarked, \\"I still think his first purely sodomitic novel the best\\". Although the Woolfs considered Hampson a good writer, they had been pessimistic about his commercial potential, but Saturday Night at the Greyhound was to prove a success both critically and in terms of sales – quickly selling out its first print run and being reprinted twice in its first six months. Its later paperback edition by Penguin Books sold 80,000 copies, and it was published in the US by Alfred Knopf and in France by Gallimard and republished again in 1950 and 1986. His short stories were published in prestigious literary magazines throughout the 1930s but his second published novel O Providence sold less well than his first, and his next – Foreign English, based on his 1931 trip to Berlin – was rejected by the Hogarth Press, whom he subsequently left for Heinemann. He was to publish five more novels, but none matched the success of his first. In 1933, through the American critic Edward J. O'Brien, Hampson met Walter Allen and the other writers who came to be known as the Birmingham Group including Leslie Halward, Peter Chamberlain and Walter Brierley, whose novel Means Test Man Hampson provided assistance with. Hampson became a committed anti-Nazi after a visit to Berlin in 1933, and in 1936, at the suggestion of W. H. Auden, married the German actress Therese Giehse, so that she could obtain a British passport and escape from Nazi Germany. He worked for the BBC during World War II and visited India in 1948. Hampson had a notable appearance: very small stature, a protruding lower jaw, searching eyes, and invariably dressed all in brown. He also wrote in brown ink. Death The death of his employer in 1955 saw him leave the house in Dorridge when it was sold, and he died of a heart attack, lonely and virtually homeless, on 26 December.

History View of the Upper Angara River from the Baikal–Amur Mainline railway bridge near Novy Uoyan It was founded in the mid-1970s in conjunction with the construction of the Baikal–Amur Mainline (BAM), near the settlement of Uoyan on the left bank of the Upper Angara. The railway station and the settlement were constructed by workers from the then Lithuanian SSR, as sections of the track were given patronage of Komsomol brigades from various parts of the Soviet Union. Urban- type settlement status was granted to it in 1976. Regular traffic on the railway section between Severobaykalsk and Novaya Chara in northern Zabaykalsky Krai began in 1989. Completion of the BAM did not, however, bring the expected economic development, and with the economic crisis in the late 1980s, the population almost halved between 1989 and 2002.

The cemetery houses the graves of Dr. John Sappington and two of his sons-in-law, Meredith Miles Marmaduke and Claiborne Fox Jackson, who each served as governor of Missouri before the American Civil War. Dr. John Sappington (1776–1856) was a prominent early physician and businessman in Missouri. He was a proponent of using quinine in the treatment of malaria and was at the time the largest importer of the drug in the United States. Dr. Sappington also wrote the first medical book published west of the Mississippi River. Sappington and his family were deeply involved in antebellum Missouri Democratic politics. Two of his sons-in-law, Meredith Miles Marmaduke and Claiborne Fox Jackson, were elected as governors of Missouri. Grandson John Sappington Marmaduke was a noted Confederate General in the American Civil War; he also was elected as Missouri Governor in later years. Established by Dr. Sappington in 1831, the two-acre cemetery holds 111 headstones and grave markers. Sappington Cemetery became a part of the Missouri State Park system in 1967 by act of the Missouri General Assembly. In order to preserve its historic nature and appearance, the site has not been modified for ADA accessibility. No restrooms or other facilities are provided. The site is open sunrise to sunset year-round. The state historic site was expanded in 2014 to include the nearby \\"Sappington Negro Cemetery,\\" used initially for the burial of the family's enslaved African Americans before the war.

Development On 19 January 2007, newly established business venture Thor Cogeneration, a subsidiary of Teesside-based PX Group, announced plans for a new power station on Teesside. The station is proposed as a 1,020 megawatt (MW) combined heat and power combined cycle gas turbine plant. Stockton Borough Council gave their approval for the station in April 2007. The station's licence for the generation of electricity was also granted later in 2007. On 28 August 2008, government approval for the station to be built was granted by Energy minister Malcolm Wicks. Construction was expected to begin in 2009, with operations predicted for early in 2012. The development did not progress beyond the design stage. Thor Cogeneration Limited held an Electricity Generation licence under the Electricity Act 1989. In May 2013 Thor Cogeneration Limited applied to Ofgem to have the Licence revoked. The Licence was revoked with effect from 22 September 2013. Proposed specification The station would use two gas-fired generators, with excess heat being used to make steam to drive a further generator. Electricity generated would be distributed to the National Grid. As well as generating electricity, the station would provide heat to the nearby, SABIC operated North Tees Works oil refinery, in the form of steam. Natural gas, the station's fuel, would be supplied to the station by a pipeline, with a short connection to an existing pipeline to the north. The station will require 20% less gas per MW generated than current operating gas-fired stations. The station was expected to be able to achieve a 58% efficiency rating by using the latest gas turbine technology. It will create 60% less carbon emissions than current coal-fired power stations. It would be cooled by using an air cooled condenser, avoiding the need to extract from or discharge water into the nearby River Tees. 1,000 people would be employed during the construction and 60 would have been employed when the station is operational.

As vice president of Tōwa Trading, together with her husband and daughter Kazuko Kawakita she was influential in the development of the post- war Japanese film industry, sponsoring actors and actresses, and in promoting Japanese cinema to overseas audiences. page 125-128 Biography Kawakita was born in Osaka, and travelled widely as a child due to her father's business affairs. The family settled in Yokohama when she was 12 and she entered the Ferris Girls' School, to study the English language. She joined the Towa Trading Company in 1929 as a secretary to the president, her future husband, Nagamasa Kawakita. Her first work at Towa was to translate the script of Kenji Mizoguchi’s The Passion of a Woman Teacher from Japanese to English. After their marriage in 1932, the Kawakitas used their honeymoon to make the first of many trips to Europe to acquire movies for the Japanese market. The 1931 film Mädchen in Uniform by Leontine Sagan caught her attention, and she convinced her reluctant husband to acquire the rights for the Japanese market. It became an enormous hit, after its success at the box office, the Kawakitas always travelled to Europe together to select films. They selected the works of numerous European filmmakers, including Jean Renoir, René Clair, Jacques Feyder and Julien Duvivier. They also brought Japanese films to European venues, including Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa, which they took to the Venice Film Festival in 1951.\\"A Biography of Madame Kawakita\\" in: A wreath for Madame Kawakita, Kawakita Memorial Film Institute, Tokyo 2008 In 1948 the Kawakitas met Donald Richie and they formed a lifelong friendship. Kashiko Kawakita introduced him to Yasujirō Ozu and was his sponsor when he applied for permanent residency in Japan. In 1955, she moved to London for two years while her daughter, Kazuko Kawakita, studied there, and was popularly known as “Madame Kawakita”. She frequently visited the Cinémathèque Française in Paris and the British Film Institute in London, and developed an understanding of the importance of \\"film libraries\\" for preserving and screening films that would otherwise be in danger of being lost to posterity. When Henri Langlois, founder and head of the Cinemathèque Française, proposed an exchange of retrospectives of French and Japanese cinema; presenting Japanese classic films in France, and vice versa, she came to realize that the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo had almost no films in its collection. Determined to establish a public film library in Japan, she helped establish the Japan Film Library Council to preserve films as \\"cultural properties\\". This enabled the screening of 131 Japanese classical films at the Cinémathèque Française in 1963. From Berlin in 1956, Kawakita served as a juror at various international film festivals. She served as a juror 26 times, including the Cannes, Chicago, and Montreal film festivals. In 1960, Kawakita was a leading figure in forming the Japan Art Theatre Guild, to promote international art film to Japan that otherwise would otherwise never be commercially released in Japan. page 6 The Guild later began to produce Japanese artistie/experimental films, sponsoring directors, such as Nagisa Oshima, Masahiro Shinoda, Yoshishige Yoshida, Susumu Hani and Shuji Terayama. In the 1970s, she was active in organizing overseas retrospectives of great Japanese film makers, including with works of Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa and others. After her husband’s death in 1982, the Japan Film Library Council was transformed into the Kawakita Memorial Film Institute. Kawakita died in 1993.

James J. \\"Jim\\" Oneal (March 13, 1875 – December 12, 1962), a founding member of the Socialist Party of America (SPA), was a prominent socialist journalist, historian, and party activist who played a decisive role in the bitter party splits of 1919-21 and 1934-36\\\\. Early years Oneal was born March 13, 1875 in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of an iron worker. Upon the death of his father, Oneal was forced to leave school to go to work in a steel mill to help support his family.\\"Socialist Pioneer Dies,\\" New America [New York], vol. 3, no. 3 (December 24, 1962), pg. 8. Oneal attended public school only to the 6th grade, relying instead upon self-education.Solon DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925. Pg. 179. Oneal was an early convert to social democratic politics, joining the Socialist Labor Party of America in 1895 before leaving to join the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) of Victor L. Berger and Eugene V. Debs shortly after its founding in 1897. Long a resident of Terre Haute, Indiana, Oneal was a close personal friend of his neighbor Debs.James Oneal, Some Pages of Party History. New York: James Oneal, n.d. [1934]; pg. 31. Oneal was a delegate to the 1900 convention of the SDP and to the 1901 Unity Convention at which the Socialist Party of America (SPA) was born. He was also elected as the first State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Indiana, state affiliate of the SPA, shortly after establishment of the new party.\\"A Remarkable Growth,\\" Appeal to Reason [Girard, KS], whole no. 311 (Nov. 16, 1901), pg. 3. The following year Oneal was elected to the governing National Committee of the SPA as the representative of the Socialist Party of Indiana. In 1903, Oneal moved to Omaha and went to work in the party's National Office as an assistant to Executive Secretary William Mailly. He continued in that role until 1905, at which time he left to become the Associate Editor of the New York Worker, forerunner of the great Socialist daily, the New York Call. After leaving the Worker in 1908, Oneal returned home to Indiana, where he was elected the State Secretary of the SP of Indiana from 1911 to 1913. By 1915, Oneal had relocated again, this time to Massachusetts, where he was elected State Secretary of that party in 1915, continuing in that post until 1917.Oneal, Some Pages of Party History, pg. 31. Oneal attended virtually every convention of the SPA as a delegate, including the seminal Emergency National Conventions of 1917, as a delegate from Massachusetts, and 1919, as a delegate from New York. Oneal also ran for office on the Socialist ticket, standing for President of the Brooklyn Board of Aldermen in 1919.\\"How to Vote in Brooklyn,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 242 (Aug. 30, 1919), pg. 7. Oneal's main occupation in these years was that of Socialist journalist. From 1918 until the end of the publication in 1923, Oneal was the editorial writer for the SPA daily, the New York Call. In that role he was extremely influential during the factional party turmoil which erupted in 1919, a power made even more forceful when combined with the voice and vote which Oneal held on the party's governing 15 member National Executive Committee, to which he was elected in 1918. After the demise of the daily Call, Oneal was instrumental in starting its weekly successor, The New Leader, and he served as editor of that long-running publication from its establishment in 1924. 1919 controversy Jim Oneal as he appeared in the official group photo of the 1919 Socialist Party National Convention. The inner-party political situation during the war years has long been caricatured as a struggle between an ultra-revolutionary Left Wing and a \\"conservative\\" Right Wing. In actuality, the political views within the party's so-called Right Wing were more akin to a rainbow than a dichotomy. Perspectives among Party Regulars ranged from Christian socialism and tepid Sewer Socialism on the one hand to staunch support for the anti-militarism of the 1917 St. Louis program and an earnest desire to initiate socialist society via the ballot box. James Oneal's own orientation in these years was closer to the latter pole, along with other main political leaders of the party, such as Eugene V. Debs, Morris Hillquit, Adolph Germer, and John M. Work. The true \\"Right Wing\\" of the party (exemplified by a large section of the publicists associate with the party, including Allan L. Benson, Charles Edward Russell, John Spargo, Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, and Carl D. Thompson peeled away in 1917-18, as American participation in the European conflict became a reality and Woodrow Wilson's argument that this was indeed a \\"war to make the world safe for democracy\\" made converts. As the war drew to a close, accentuated with a Bolshevik victory in Russia in November 1917, the revolutionary socialist Left Wing began to organize with a view to transforming the Socialist Party of America into a form better able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and a soviet form of government, but by September 1919 they had been expelled and became the Communist Labor Party of America under the direction of Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld and the Communist Party of America headed by C. E. Ruthenberg. 1934-36 Old Guard controversy In 1934, Oneal played a role as a prominent member of the so-called \\"Old Guard\\" faction, which opposed the new Declaration of Principles passed by the party's Detroit Convention of 1934. Oneal used his positions as editor of The New Leader and official at the Rand School of Social Science effectively in bolstering the Old Guard's Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, working with Chairman of the Socialist Party of New York Louis Waldman to lock up these party assets in the hands of his faction. Oneal raised funds to publish a polemical pamphlet, issued under his own name in 1934, which took aim at his factional opponents.James Oneal, Some Pages of Party History. New York: James Oneal, n.d. [1934]. Oneal mocked the Thomasites as \\"'militant' liberals\\" capable only of winning the temporary allegiance of shallow college students,Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 6. dismissed the Militant faction as \\"pseudo-Marxists and phrasemongers,\\"Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 9. and alleged that the Revolutionary Policy Committee (U.S.) were nothing more or less than practitioners of \\"Lovestone Communism\\" and were acting as a \\"dual organization in the party.\\"Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 20. He furthermore lambasted the League for Industrial Democracy, a bastion of the Thomas faction, as \\"a parasite on the Socialist Party and a dangerous dual organization\\"Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 21. and specified instances in which the Thomas-dominated National Executive Committee of the SP had violated the party constitution.Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 25. Oneal's pamphlet included a coupon which readers could tear out, fill in, and mail to him, pledging the allegiance of the sender \\"as one with you for constructive party work and progress.\\"Oneal, Some Pages From Party History, pg. 29. The coupons accumulated doubtlessly proved invaluable as the Old Guard faction left the SP to establish itself as the Social Democratic Federation of America. The Old Guard-dominated Socialist Party of New York was expelled en bloc by the National Executive Committee of the SPA in 1936 and Oneal and The New Leader followed. The New York organization originally reconstituted itself as the \\"People's Party,\\" before becoming the New York state section of the Social Democratic Federation of America at a state convention held at the end of March 1937.\\"Peoples’ Party Name Dropped at Convention,\\" The New Leader [New York], vol. 20, no. 14 (April 3, 1937), pp. 1-2. A national convention to formally establish the SDF was scheduled for the end of May 1937, with Oneal named \\"Acting National Secretary\\" in the run up to this foundation meeting.James Oneal, et al., \\"Message of May Day to Social Democrats,\\" The New Leader [New York], vol. 20, no. 18 (May 1, 1937), pg. 8. Parting of ways with The New Leader The relationship between the New Leader staff and the SDF political leadership was never completely cordial because of differing opinions as to editorial policy. While Editor Oneal was a strong SDF partisan but he clashed personally and philosophically with the publication's business manager, Sol Levitas, a former Menshevik vice mayor of Vladivostok. In December 1937, Levitas persuaded the paper's board of directors to change his title to \\"Executive Editor,\\" a move which prompted a letter of resignation from the pugnacious Oneal. An uneasy truce continued between the two men, with Oneal working only 3 days a week owing to a slight stroke which he had suffered. Finally, in the spring of 1940, the differing orientations of Oneal and Levitas came to a head. Oneal charged that the \\"secrecy, deception and direct sabotage\\" of Levitas were undermining his editorial authority. Levitas sought to water down the social democratic element of a publication to such an extent that \\"the reader will have to use very powerful glasses to find it.\\" In April 1940, Oneal quit the publication for good, declaring that the paper had become a tepid liberal publication instead of a social democratic organ which worked to bolster the SDF organization.Tamiment Library staff, \\"Guide to the Social Democratic Federation of America Records, 1933-1956.\\" New York: New York University Libraries, 2003. http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/sdf.html Death Oneal died on December 12, 1962 in Seattle, Washington.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976. Description and history The Joplin House is located west of downtown St. Louis, near the southeast corner of Delmar Boulevard and North Beaumont Street. It is a two- story T-shaped brick house, with a gabled roof that has side parapet walls with engaged chimneys. The front facade is six bays wide, and symmetrically arranged, with entrances recessed in arched openings in the center two bays. The ground floor windows are set in round-arch openings, while those on the second floor are set in segmented-arch openings. An ell extends to the rear, and another to the right side. The small parcel on which the house stands has a small grassy area, and is fronted by a granite curb and iron fence. The exact construction date of the house is not known. Based on its style, it is estimated to have been built around 1860, and is known to have been standing in 1874. It is a typical tenant rowhouse built in the city during this period. It is significant as the only known surviving residence associated with African-American composer Scott Joplin (c. 1867-1917). Joplin lived here from 1900 to 1903. While living here, he wrote what is perhaps his best-known piece, \\"The Entertainer,\\" which earned new recognition for the composer, 56 years after his death, when it was used as theme music in the 1973 film, The Sting. The home Joplin rented was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and was saved from destruction by the local African American community. In 1983, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources made it the first state historic site in Missouri dedicated to African-American heritage. At first it focused entirely on Joplin and ragtime music, ignoring the urban milieu which shaped his musical compositions. A newer heritage project has expanded coverage to include the more complex social history of black urban migration and the transformation of a multi-ethnic neighborhood to the contemporary community. Part of this diverse narrative now includes coverage of uncomfortable topics of racial oppression, poverty, sanitation, prostitution, and sexually transmitted diseases.

Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the Patrie was completed in November 1906 and handed over to the military the following month. The Patrie bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the French army.The Patrie's predecessor, known as \\"Le Jaune\\" (\\"The Yellow (One)\\") because of its yellow lead chromate protective coating, was donated by Lebaudy Frères to the French army in September 1906 and was therefore the first airship to see military service in France. In 1907, from her base at Chalais-Meudon near Paris, a successful series of military manoeuvres was conducted with the airship by the military command, which included a visit by France's President of the Council Georges Clemenceau. Following the successful completion of these operations, in November 1907 the Patrie was transferred under her own power to her operational base at Verdun, near the German border. Due to a mechanical fault, the Patrie became stranded away from her base on 29 November 1907 in Souhesmes. During a storm on 30 November she was torn loose from her temporary moorings and, despite the efforts of some 200 soldiers who tried to restrain her, she was carried away by the high winds and lost from sight. Had the rope to the emergency gas-release system been attached, her loss could possibly have been avoided. After crossing the English Channel and passing unseen through English airspace during the night, the Patrie was sighted over Wales and Ireland on 1 December. She made a brief landfall near Belfast, before rising again to be blown out over the Atlantic Ocean. Following a sighting from a steamship off the Hebrides, she was never seen again. Despite the loss of the Patrie, the Lebaudy Brothers went on to complete a sister-ship to the Patrie, the République, for the French Army. Additionally, several airships of a similar design to the Patrie were ordered and delivered to export customers, these included the Russian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire. Development The military uses of airships at the time were considered to be the dropping of bombs (from an altitude at which they were deemed to be out of range of ground-based weapons) and reconnaissance. M. Julliot, the designer of the Patrie, stated that \\"each of the French ships can carry thirty, and on short journeys, even fifty torpedoes of 10 kilogrammes (22 lb) each.\\" For reconnaissance purposes the Patrie was equipped with \\"a mounting for a telephotographic apparatus, and for a 100-candlepower acetylene searchlight\\". A contemporary author related that \\"from a height of the Patrie observed the smallest movements of formed bodies of troops at the Satory camp and obtained very clear telephotographs of them.\\" Semi-rigid airships were considered more suitable for military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. The Patrie was a semi-rigid airship manufactured by the French sugar magnates Paul and Pierre Lebaudy and designed by their chief engineer, Henri Julliot. She was the second Lebaudy airship, and \\"surpassed her predecessor in both size and method of construction\\".Vivian (c1921) p.253. The company's first airship, simply known as the Lebaudy,The first Lebaudy airship, Lebaudy 1, underwent a series of reconstructions and was renamed 1bis, 2, 3 and 4 consecutively, thus making the Patrie only the second, completely new Lebaudy airship. and dubbed by the French public \\"Le Jaune\\" (\\"The Yellow (One)\\") because of the yellow colour of the lead chromate paint on its cloth exterior, was considered the most successful airship then in operation. DesignOverview= Close-up of the Patrie's gondola in 1906, showing fuel tank and the propeller The main structural components of the Patrie, like those of its predecessor, were the envelope (or \\"gas-bag\\"), a nickel-steel frame or keel, and a gondola suspended from the frame on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a ballonet, the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective of the degree of expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. Attached to both the gas-bag and the gondola were active and passive control surfaces to provide lateral and vertical stability and to give the pilot directional control over the airship. The gondola, constructed of nickel-steel tubing, was suspended some below an elliptical steel frame (or keel) attached to the bottom of the gas-bag, under the centre of lift. Between the frame and the envelope and linking the two was a small hemp net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and the frame was attached to the net by further toggles. This permitted the easy removal of the frame from the envelope. The frame itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport. The open gondola offered the crew and passengers little protection from the elements. It was common for there to have been two pilots, two engineers and two passengers on board during test flights and military missions. Ballast, in the form of 10- and 20-pound (4.5 and 9.1 kg) bags of sand, could be jettisoned through a pipe set into the floor of the gondola. Other equipment included \\"a 'siren' speaking trumpet, carrier pigeons, iron pins, ropes for anchoring the airship, a reserve supply of fuel and water, and a fire extinguisher\\". =Envelope and ballonet= The Patries envelope was composed of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG. The Patrie in Moisson, 1906 The lead chromate gave the envelope the same mustard-yellow colour as its precessor, \\"Le Jaune\\"; the remaining surfaces were coloured sky- blue, as is evident in a contemporary artist's impression of the Patrie. The Patries design as a semi-rigid airship required that the pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and the air in the ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one- fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved. To control the movement of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500 Pa, 0.723 psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78 inAq (195 Pa, 0.282 psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back- up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained in the event of an engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.Squier, G.O. (in Flight Magazine), p.121. A release mechanism was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a pull on the attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, so that it would also be activated automatically in the case of a catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie. Since a partially filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, due to the mass of air rolling fore or aft in the direction of pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.Squier, G.O. (in Flight Magazine), p.122. =Steering and propulsion= Close-up bow view of the gondola in 1906 Directional stability was achieved by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached at the rear of the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration. During trials it was decided that a greater degree of control over vertical motion was required, which would also allow the pilot to compensate for \\"involuntary rising or falling of the airship due to expansion or contraction of the gas, or to other causes\\". For this purpose a movable horizontal plane was installed above the car and near the centre of gravity, which resulted in the loss of gas and ballast being reduced to a minimum.Squier, G.O. (in Flight Magazine), p.123. Photographs showing changes to the Patrie empennage from 1906 to 1907 At a later date this single plane was replaced by two movable planes mounted either side of and above the gondola, attached to the bottom of the elliptical frame, as shown in the plan view published in the German \\"Jahrbuch der Luftfahrt\\" (\\"Aviation Yearbook\\") in 1911.Vorreiter (1911) These \\"ailerons d'ascension et de descente\\" as they were referred to at the time,Nacelle de Dirigeable. delcampe.com, Retrieved: 24 April 2012. are clearly visible in the still photograph taken from the short film \\"Decollage d'un ballon dirigeable\\" (\\"The Take-off of a Dirigible Balloon\\"), made in Moisson by the pioneering French film-maker Alice Guy- Blaché before her emigration to the United States in March 1907. The pilot operated the controls at the bows of the gondola, forward of the engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70 hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000 rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200 rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below the rear of the gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280 L (61.6 gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing. Operational historyNovember – December 1906= The first flight of the Patrie took place on 16 November 1906, at Lebaudy's Moisson headquarters, lasting 2 hours and 20 mins. After eight further test flights from Moisson, the Patrie flew the from Moisson to the French Aeronautical Department's centre at Chalais-Meudon near Paris on 15 December 1906 at an estimated speed in excess of 45 km/h (28.1 mph). A public relations flight over the centre of Paris was undertaken on 17 December 1906, passing over the Arc de Triomphe, the Place de la Concorde, the War Ministry buildings and Les Invalides. Following this flight, Patrie was deflated until flights resumed in June 1907. The information provided by this reference can be found in issue 154 (December 1959) of \\"FORCES AÉRIENNES FRANÇAISES\\", the weekly review of the French Air Force (\\"l'Armée de l'Air\\"), which featured one of the Patrie's pilots and later Controller General Théophile Bois. Details are also available in the archives of the \\"Service Historique de l'Armée de Terre\\" at the Château de Vincennes. =June – November 1907= Patrie landing on the plain at Antony-Fresnes, 26 October 1907 During the summer of 1907, 21 further flights were undertaken between 27 June and 7 August, including one on 22 July 1907 in which the President of the Council (Prime Minister) Georges Clemenceau, and the Minister of War Georges Picquart were passengers. Although a pipe became detached, showering the Premier with hot water, he reacted nonchalantly, saying \\"I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for this wonderful contrivance\\". The Patrie was then deflated for alterations that included the addition of a 500 cubic metre (17,660 ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of new propellers. The Patrie was reinflated and made ready for operational duty on 15 October 1907. Nine flights, totalling 18 hours, were undertaken from Chalais-Meudon between 21 October and 16 November, during one of which the left propeller was lost, causing the Patrie to ascend rapidly into the low clouds before returning safely but slowly to Chalais-Meudon under her own power. On 23 November 1907, the Patrie was flown to her operational base at Belleville-sur-Meuse near Verdun, close to the Franco-German border, a journey of 240 km (149 mi) in 6 hours 45 minutes, at an average speed of 36 km/h (22 mph) and a height of . =Final flight= Propeller and gear assembly knocked off Patrie during temporary landfall in Ballysallagh, Ireland on 1 December 1907 While based at Verdun, the Patrie was stranded on Friday, 29 November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes due to a mechanical problem caused by the clothing of one of the mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes. During that night, a storm blew up and approximately 200 soldiers were assigned to the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. However, an oversight led to this not being done. Thus, the troops were unable to keep control of her, and could not continue to hold her down in the storm. Approximate flight path taken by the Patrie based on recorded sightings Relieved of her ballast of and without a crew, she shot up to a great height (calculated by the constructor to have been some ), and was carried away in a north-westerly direction. Two days later there was still no news. In 2007, the French newspaper Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays reprinted a news item from 5 December 1907, which spoke of the \\"anxiety\\" caused in Paris by this \\"disaster\\".Reprint in \\"Journal l'Alsace / Le Pays\\" 5 December 2007: \\"Since the balloon's automatic valve only works slowly and only allows a slow rate of escape of gas, it is believed, and this is entirely possible, that the \\"Patrie\\" is still aloft at the time of writing. In addition, since the speed of the wind that night was about 60 km/h, the dirigible could have travelled a considerable distance. Since the telegram announcing the disaster arrived at the War Ministry, extreme anxiety reigns in Paris. We are now on the lookout for any type of information. Unfortunately so far no reports have been able to give a precise indication of the Patrie's route and the direction it took. There is every reason to believe that it will never be recovered or that only its wreckage will be found.\\" The original French: \\"La soupape automatique du ballon ne fonctionnant que lentement et ne permettant qu’un léger échappement du gaz, on croit, et cela est encore fort possible, que le « Patrie » est encore dans les airs à l’heure actuelle. D’autre part, la vitesse du vent ayant été cette nuit d’environ 60 km/h, le dirigeable a dû parcourir une distance considérable. Depuis que la dépêche officielle du désastre est parvenue au ministère de la guerre, une extrême anxiété règne à Paris. On est à l’affût de tous les renseignements. Malheureusement, aucun avertissement n’a encore pu donner une indication précise sur le passage du « Patrie » et de la direction prise. Il y a tout lieu de craindre qu’on ne le retrouve jamais ou du moins qu’on en retrouve que des débris.\\" It was feared that the Patrie could have risen into an eastward air current, crossed the nearby Franco-German border and fallen into \\"Prussian\\" hands, so news reports of her whereabouts were eagerly awaited. Finally news of sightings filtered back to France and spread around Europe and the United States. As was reported in The New York Times the following day, the Patrie had been observed on the morning of Sunday, 1 December 1907, over Cardigan (Wales). On the afternoon of the same day she made landfall at Ballysallagh, near Holywood, County Down in northern Ireland, where a propeller and bevel gear assembly were broken off (see photo). With the loss of this weight the Patrie once more ascended and was spotted by a Lloyd's signal station at Torr Head on the Antrim coast. The next sighting came soon after, over islands in St. Patrick's Channel, between Ireland and Scotland. The Patrie continued northwards, where the last sighting was reported by Captain Buchanan of the steamship Olivine at latitude 58°N near the Hebrides, after which she was lost without a trace.\\"The Times\\", London, 6 December 1907. Excerpt may be viewed via Times Online Archive using the search terms \\"French airship Patrie\\" =Aftermath= Despite the loss of the Patrie, the French army did not lose faith in the Lebaudy/Julliot design: A sister-ship to the Patrie, the République, was already under construction at Lebaudy's Moisson works, and another airship of the same type (La Liberté) was ordered in August 1908. In addition, two more airships of essentially the same design were ordered by the Russian Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The former, initially called La Russie and later known as Lebed, reportedly \\"an absolute copy of the French 'République'\\", flew for the first time on 29 May 1909. The inaugural flight of Lebed was hailed by Russia as a significant step forward in its aviation history.Palmer 2006, pp. 33–34. In its June 26, 1909 issue, Flight Magazine reported that the Austrian Government had ordered from Lebaudy \\"what appears to be a duplicate of the \\"Russie\\". This airship entered service with the Austrian Army in 1910.

It was located in the village of Veng near Skanderborg, Region of Southern Denmark. Veng Church, the former abbey church, is still in use as a parish church and is the oldest remaining in the country. Veng Church  History  Veng Abbey was established as a Benedictine monastery some time in the late 1060s, with connections to the royal forebears of King Valdemar I. By the 1160s the abbey had fallen into a severe decline: the original endowments failed to sustain it. Eventually Abbot Jens was brought before a church tribunal and forced to give up his office on the grounds of immorality and theft of the harvest. Three recalcitrant monks were all that remained at Veng. Sven, Bishop of Aarhus, received permission from Pope Alexander III to close the abbey. Just a year later Bishop Sven granted occupation of the empty premises to the Cistercian monks from Sminge Abbey, originally from Vitskøl Abbey, who were dissatisfied with the infertility of the soil at Sminge. They settled at Veng Abbey in 1166. Lady Margrethe, the widow of a local nobleman, had petitioned Bishop Sven to convert Veng Abbey into a nunnery with herself as the abbess, a position which would bring with it a guaranteed annual income. When the Cistercians were confirmed at Veng, she did everything she could to make life miserable for them. She had her servants occupy the rent- producing farms that had belonged to Veng, and was accused of ordering one of her servants to steal the vestments from the church so that mass could not be said. Without income, the Cistercians had no choice but to leave, and in 1168 moved to another site on the small isle of Kalvø in Skanderborg Lake. On Kalvø the soil proved useless for farming and in 1172 the monks moved yet again to found Øm Abbey (Øm Kloster), where at last they were able to develop a permanent site, so successfully that Øm Abbey soon overshadowed the earlier existence of Veng Abbey. The few archival letters regarding Veng were transferred to Øm Abbeyand the little information now available about Veng Abbey is due to their preservation there. The exact layout of the monastery complex has not been determined, but it is thought to have had at least two ranges, a dormitory, and a refectory attached to the church. Excavations in 1984 to determine the layout were unsuccessful. Veng Church Veng Church Veng Church (Veng Kirke) was constructed some time after 1100, probably as a replacement for an earlier wooden structure. It was built of limestone blocks, as were many early Danish monasteries, in the Romanesque style. It had a flat timber roof, a single nave, a choir, and an apse with two transepts, each with its own apse. The outside of the church retains several carved stones and other decorations from the original building. Even before the Danish Reformation there were no remains of Veng Abbey except for the church. Veng Church is now a parish church in the Diocese of Aarhus. ReferencesOther Sources  * Veng Abbey. Klosterriget ved Silkeborg.

It is believed to have been inhabited from c. 400-1350. The site is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site. The name Towosahgy is an Osage word which means \\"old town.\\" It is not known if members of the historic Osage, who dominated a large area of present- day Missouri at the beginning of encounter with European colonizers, occupied the site. (includes 7 photographs) The site was acquired by the Missouri state park system in 1967 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 as NRIS number 69000113,  History of Towosahgy  The earliest portion of Towosahgy State Historic Site is in the southern half, where a Late Woodland period village once stood. Wilkie dates this component to about 400 to 700 CE. Later the site was fortified and built up as a Mississippian village with seven platform mounds, most surrounding a central plaza area. During this time, the site was surrounded by a palisade wall of vertical logs and a moat. Like other Mississippian mound centers, Towosahgy also had a borrow pit, where earth was removed to create the mounds. The largest remaining mound is Mound 2, also known as the \\"temple mound\\". Excavations on this part of the site were conducted in 1989 by James Price. The site was abandoned during the late fourteenth century for unknown reasons, as were many similar Mississippian sites in the region. Ceramics from the site represent typical pottery found in the Missouri Bootheel region. Sherds from the Woodland occupation are typically grog tempered. The later Mississippian culture pottery is shell tempered. Type varieties identified include Baytown Plain and Mulberry Creek Cordmarked. Mississippian ceramics were also both plain and decorated. Punctuated, incised, fabric impressed, and red, black, and brown painted/slipped sherds, typical decorating methods, are all present. A large collection of ceramic vessels from the site are part of the Beckwith Collection displayed at the Rosemary Berkel and Harry L. Crisp II Museum at Southeast Missouri State University.

The film tells the story of the Australian Light Horse (mounted rifleman as distinct from cavalry) which operated in the desert at the Sinai and Palestine Campaign during World War I. It follows the adventures of three rowdy heroes in fighting and romance. The film culminates at the Battle of Beersheba which is reputedly \\"the last successful cavalry charge in history\\". The film was clearly a propaganda weapon, to aid in recruitment and lift the pride of Australians at home during World War II. It was one of the most successful Australian movies of its day.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 192. From the Prologue to the movie When Germany stretched greedy hands towards the Middle East in the war or 1914–1918, a great cavalry force came into being. They were the men from Australia and New Zealand – The ANZACS – the \\"Mad Bushmen\\" – the men from \\"Downunder\\". Call them what you will – their glories can never grow dim. They met the Germanised Army in the burning desert of Sinai. They fought and suffered to emerge triumphant – the greatest cavalry force of modern times. To these dauntless riders and their gallant horses this story is dedicated. To them with pride, their own sons are saying today - \\"The torch you threw to us, we caught and now our hands will hold it high. Its glorious light will never die!\\" Plot In 1916 Jerusalem, German troops led by Captain Von Schiller arrest French wine seller Paul Rouget for spying and hang him. His daughter Juliet goes into hiding dressed as a boy and starts spying on the Germans. Three members of the Australian Lighthorse, Red, Larry and Jim, are enjoying themselves (including a game of two-up) on leave in Cairo, when called to fight the Turks. They take part in several battles including the march to Ogratina and the Battle of Romani. Red is separated from the others after one battle and has his life saved by Juliet, who he thinks is an Arab boy. Red is reunited with his friends and they arrive at an Arab village. He meets Juliet and realises she was the boy who saved his life. They begin a romance. The Battle of Gaza takes place; Jim and Larry are mortally wounded and Red is captured. He is sent to Beersheba to work as slave labour and discovers the town is wired with explosives. Juliet rescues him and they spend the night together in a hut. Jim manages to rejoin his unit in time to participate in the charge of the Light Horse at the Battle of Beersheba, and stops Von Schiller before he detonates the explosives. The Germans and Turks are defeated and a wounded Red is reunited with Juliet.

It was originally to be titled Thunder Over the Desert.Copyright registration of Thunder Over the Desert at National Archives of Australia To raise funds for a movie, Chauvel shot a £5,000 \\"teaser\\" sequence, consisting of a cavalry charge based around the Battle of Beersheba. The cost for this was paid for by Herc McIntyre, managing director of Universal Pictures in Australia who was a long- time friend and associate of Chauvel's. Filming of this sequence took place on 1 February 1938 on the Cronulla sand dunes using a cavalry division of the Australian Light Horse, which had been performing in the New South Wales sesquicentenary celebrations. The charge was filmed by a four-camera unit, composed of Frank Hurley, Tasman Higgins, Bert Nicholas and John Heyer. A cavalryman was injured during the shoot. In 1939 Chauvel and McIntyre formed Famous Films Ltd to make the movie. Chauvel used the footage to raise the budget, which was originally announced at £25,000. £5,000 was provided by McIntyre and £10,000 from Hoyts. The New South Wales government agreed to guarantee a bank overdraft of £15,000 although they did not invest directly in the movie. =Casting= The movie marked the first lead role for Grant Taylor, who rose to prominence in Dad Rudd, MP (1940). It was the first sizeable role for Chips Rafferty, who had been cast after a screen test. Chauvel described him as \\"a cross between Slim Summerville and Jame Stewart, and has a variety of droll yet natural humour.\\" Joe Valli reprised his Scottish soldier from Pat Hanna's Digger Shows. Taylor was paid £15 a week, Rafferty £10 a week. Betty Bryant was a discovery of Elsa Chauvel's. She beat out Pat Firman for the role. =Shooting= Shooting began in May 1940. Interiors were shot in the Cinesound studios at Bondi which Chauvel leased from Cinesound Productions for a three-month period. A second unit was used to build a desert village at Cronulla. The battle scenes were shot there in July and August, using the First Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment. Censorship After the film's preview, the Commonwealth film censor, Creswell O'Reilly, requested three major cuts – display of the dancing girls in a cabaret, the love scene between Red and Juliette in a hut, and alleged cruelty to horses during the final charge. This threatened Chauvel's ability to export the film and screen it in Victoria. Eventually the Minister for Customs, Eric Harrison, overruled the decision and allowed the movie to be screened uncut. The movie was also passed uncut in Victoria. ReleaseCritical= Reviews were overwhelmingly positive. The critic from The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that \\"there have been some good Australian films before this one, but Forty Thousand Horsemen has every right to be regarded as the first really great Australian picture.\\" Filmink magazine later wrote \\"the film was Taylor's. There had been other notable leading men in Australian films – Snowy Baker, Errol Flynn – but it was really Taylor who was the first tough Aussie star type, that would be so exemplified by Rod Taylor, Jack Thompson, Mel Gibson and Bryan Brown. \\" =Box office= It was a massive success at the box office, grossing £10,000 within its first three weeks of release, enabling Famous Features Ltd to buy out the interest of the New South Wales government for £15,000. The film was seen by 287,000 in Sydney alone during a ten-week run on first release.'FILM WORLD Today's Shows', The West Australian (Perth), Friday 25 April 1941 p 10 Female lead Betty Bryant was sent to Singapore for the film's premiere in June 1941. While there she met MGM executive Maurice Silverstein, who she would later marry, leading to her retirement from acting. =Foreign release= The movie was released in the US by Sherman S. Krellberg for Monogram Pictures and was very well received. \\"Yippee for brawling, boisterous entertainment\\", wrote the critic for The New York Times, praising Betty Bryant (\\"whatever it is that leaps across the celluloid barrier, she has\\") although claiming the story was \\"foolish\\". The Los Angeles Times said the film was \\"conventional in formula but enlivened by stirring battle scenes – and new faces.\\" \\"Contains all the color and lusty vigor of the men themselves\\" said The Washington Post. It earned over £40,000 in the UK. In 1954 the film was cut down to 50 minutes for screening on US television.

McGuire was a founding member of the jazz fusion band, Ayers Rock from 1973 until he left in 1976. As a bass guitarist he appeared in several of Parkinson's groups including the Questions (1965–1968), Doug Parkinson in Focus (1968–1969) and the Southern Star Band (1978–1981). He went into music production in the early 1980s, in October 1980 he co-produced and engineered the debut self-titled album by Australian rock band, INXS. Duncan McGuire was diagnosed with lung cancer; and died in July 1989 of an associated brain tumour, aged 46. Early life and career Duncan Hazlett McGuire was born in about 1943. His music career began in 1959 with his first band, the Phantoms, in Sydney. By 1963, on bass guitar, he had joined, Roland Storm and the Statesmen, which included Storm on lead vocals, Mike Allen on drums, Peter Maxworthy on lead guitar, and Mark Rigney on drums. They recorded two singles, \\"It's the Stomp\\" (1963) and \\"The Swingaroo\\" (1964) for HMV Records. Without Storm, the Statesmen also recorded two of their own singles for HMV, \\"Beach Comber\\" (1963) and \\"Slow Stompin'\\" (1964). In 1964, band member Rigney left the Statesmen and Billy Green ( Wil Greenstreet) joined on guitar. The group became Roland Storm and the Epics, which recorded a single, \\"Zip a Dee Doo Dah\\" (1964), and then became simply the Epics upon Storm leaving. The Epics issued their own singles, \\"Caravan\\" (September 1964) and \\"Too Late\\" (June 1965). As a member of the Statesmen and of the Epics, McGuire backed Little Pattie live, as well as on her early singles and her first album, as well as backing other artists including Reg Lindsay, Johnny Ashcroft, Bryan Davies, Jay Justin and Johnny O'Keefe.  With Doug Parkinson  From late 1965 to 1968 McGuire was the bass guitarist, alongside Green on guitar, in the Questions, which were a \\"musically substantial bunch\\" and they released their debut album, What Is a Question?, in October 1966. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as containing \\"sub-Herb Alpert pastiches [which] failed to chart.\\" Early in 1967 Doug Parkinson joined on lead vocals, it was his first major band, the line up also included Ray Burton on guitar and Doug Lavery on drums – both later joined the Valentines and Axiom – and Rory Thomas on Hammond organ. The Questions entered the 1967 Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds and won the New South Wales state final, they competed in Melbourne for the Australian final finishing second to the Groop. McFarlane described the Questions' first three singles with Parkinson as \\"minor psychedelic pop classics\\": \\"Sally Go Round the Roses\\" (July 1967), \\"And Things Unsaid\\" (October) and \\"Something Wonderful\\" (February 1968). By January 1968 McGuire and Green had left the group. In March 1968 McGuire and Green returned to work with Parkinson for another group, Doug Parkinson in Focus, which included Lavery and Thomas. That group also won the New South Wales state final of the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, and finished third nationally: behind the Groove and the Masters Apprentices. McGuire, as a member of Doug Parkinson in Focus, shifted to Melbourne where they \\"were perfectly in sync with the tempo of the times ... [they] became one of the most popular outfits on the Melbourne suburban dance / inner-city discotheque circuit.\\" In May 1969 they issued a cover version of the Beatles' track, \\"Dear Prudence\\", which reached No. 5 on the Go-Set National Top 40 singles chart. Doug Parkinson in Focus, with McGuire aboard, entered the 1969 Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds as a Melbourne-based band. They won both the Victorian state and the national grand finals, both held at the Festival Hall, Melbourne. However, in November 1969, McGuire left Parkinson to form a new group, Rush, with Malcolm McGee on lead vocals (ex-Wild Cherries, Python Lee Jackson, Virgil Brothers), Kevin Murphy on drums (ex-Wild Cherries), and Steve Yates on keyboards. By February the following year Rush had disbanded and both McGuire and Green rejoined Parkinson until June.  King Harvest to Leo de Castro and Friends  In September 1970 McGuire was a founding member of a progressive rock band, King Harvest, with Leo de Castro on lead vocals and lead guitar (ex-Leo and the Browns, Leo and Friends); Jimmy Doyle on guitar (Silhouettes, Aesop's Fables, Moonstone); Mark Kennedy on drums (Spectrum); and Steve Yates on keyboards (ex-Rush, Expression). They performed cover versions of contemporary hits, including Jimmy Webb's \\"Wichita Lineman\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\", which appeared as singles in 1971 on Festival Records. He rejoined Parkinson for a few months before teaming with de Castro in Friends, another progressive rock group, by December that year. Also in Friends were Kennedy, with Charlie Tumahai on vocals and percussion (Aesop's Fables, Healing Force, Chain) and Tim Martin on saxophone and flute. By April 1972 Green had joined Friends on guitar and the group released their debut single, \\"B-B-Boogie\\", in August. The group performed at the Sunbury Pop Festival of 1973 in January and provided two tracks, \\"Bird on the Wire\\" and \\"La La Song\\", for the live album, Sunbury 1973 - The Great Australian Rock Festival. By April that year Friends line up of McGuire, de Castro, Kennedy and Burton on guitar, had recorded versions of \\"Lady Montego\\" and \\"Freedom Train\\" for the Various Artists' album, Garrison the Final Blow Unit I (June 1973). McGuire wrote \\"Lady Montego\\".  Ayers Rock, Windchase and the Southern Star Band  In June 1973, with two band mates from Friends, he formed Burton McGuire Kennedy, as a jazz fusion trio. In August they were renamed as Ayers Rock when Jimmy Doyle (ex-King Harvest guitarist, vocalist) joined. In October they recruited Col Loughnan on saxophone, flute, vocals, and piano (the Crescents, the Delltones , Kala) and by December they issued their debut single, \\"Rock'n'Roll Fight (Going On)\\", on Mushroom Records. Burton was replaced by Chris Brown (ex-Python Lee Jackson, Kala) on guitar and vocals in March 1974. The group released their debut album, Big Red Rock, in November, which peaked at No. 32 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. McGuire had written three tracks for the album, including a re-worked version of \\"Lady Montego\\" (1974), which was also their next single. At this time, journalists referred to McGuire's nickname as \\"The Wizard\\".\\"Export Big Red Rock\\". Juke (Melbourne). 4 June 1975. p. 21. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times caught their performance in October 1975 as they previewed material for a subsequent album, which \\"showed an improvement\\" over their previous work and noted that \\"McGuire's bass was always rock-solid but ready to fly at a moment's notice\\". McGuire remained with Ayers Rock until August 1976 leaving after their second album, Beyond (April), and their second tour of the United States (June–July). McGuire was replaced by John Young on bass guitar. In January 1977 McGuire briefly joined Windchase with Mario Millo on lead guitar, mandolin, and lead vocals; and Toivo Pilt on keyboards and guitar (both ex- Sebastian Hardie); and Doug Bligh on drums. As a member Windchase, McGuire helped to finish their debut album, Symphinity, which was issued in June; however he had already left before it appeared. From 1977 to 1980 McGuire joined Parkinson and Kennedy in the Southern Star Band which also had Tommy Emmanuel on guitar. Other members of the Southern Star Band were Frank Esler- Smith, Jim Gannon, and Keith Kirwan. Production and INXS In the late 1970s McGuire turned to production work, he was the mixer, engineer and co-producer of INXS, the debut album by the Australian rock band of the same name, which was released on 13 October 1980. It had been recorded from late 1979 to mid-1980 in midnight to dawn recording sessions at Trafalgar Studios, Annandale. Due to the late sessions, McGuire was often found, \\"slumped exhausted over the mixing panel.\\" The album provided the single, \\"Just Keep Walking\\", in September 1980. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, described it as the \\"first significant INXS landmark.\\" In January 1988 McGuire engineered an album, Long White Clouds, by former band mate de Castro, who used two different backing bands: the Dancehall Racketeers and Roger Janes Band. McGuire worked at the Rich Music Studios in Sydney, the album was eventually released in 2007 by Big Beat Music. Early in 1989 McGuire and David Cafe co-produced an album, Crazy, by Roger Janes Band, which was issued in 2006. Duncan McGuire died on 10 July 1989, aged 46, from a brain tumour, he had been previously diagnosed with lung cancer.

Population: History It was founded in connection to the construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline in the 1980s, near the older village of Chara, named for the river on which it stood. The station and settlement were built by workers from the Kazakh SSR; as part of the BAM project, sections of the route were placed under the patronage of Komsomol brigades from different parts of the Soviet Union. Regular rail traffic from Tynda in Amur Oblast to Novaya Chara began in 1988; traffic from the west of the settlement on the section from Severobaykalsk started in 1989. The completion of the BAM did not bring the expected economic development to the area, and with the economic crisis of the late 1980s, around half the population left. Nearby are the Udokan copper deposit, Chineysky vanadium deposit and Unkur silver-copper deposit. Tourism The Chara Sands, a \\"desert\\" in the middle of Siberia, near Novaya Chara.

Economy Novaya Chara's only real economic activity centers on its situation as an important station on the BAM. However, there is potential for the settlement to become the center for a mining region currently under development, with a branch line built between 1998 and 2002 from Novaya Chara to the titanium, vanadium, and iron ore mine Chineyskoye.Viktor Verti: China nachinayetsya s dorogi. In Trud, 28. September 2001 (Russian) The Chineyskoye mine contains both Russia's largest titanium deposit, and the world's largest recorded vanadium deposit. Due to financing problems with the mines, located at an altitude of over , the branch line has been poorly maintained and damaged by landslides, meaning that in 2008 only were in use; with trucks being used to transport ore to the railhead. Repair and reconstruction of the line is currently being undertaken. Also on this branch line are the rare-earth metal mine Katuginskoye, iron ore mine Sulumatskoye, and large anthracite deposits at Chitkanda.Article from Sergey Rinchinov from metaltorg.ru, October 17, 2008 (Russian) Around south of Novaya Chara is the Udokan copper deposit, which is planned to be mined in future. Around to the south west of Novaya Chara is the Unkur silver and copper deposit, which is currently under exploration. The settlement is also serviced by a small airport.

It houses and displays machinery and artifacts of the industrial revolution from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The building was originally built as part of the Boston Manufacturing Company, Francis Cabot Lowell's seminal, fully integrated textile mill. The museum, which was incorporated in 1980 and opened to the public in 1988, takes up only a small portion of the previous mill building complex.  History  The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as America's first factory. The earliest buildings on the site have been designated a National Historic Landmark. Though many mills existed before the Boston Manufacturing Company, Francis Cabot Lowell's mill was the first to combine all steps of cotton fabric manufacturing under one roof. Waltham received a $10 million urban revitalization grant, which allowed the site to be renovated and preserved. As part of the site's renovation, a group of cultural, civic, and business leaders led by Michael Folsom, an MIT professor, created the Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation in what had been the mill's massive steam-powered engine and boiler rooms. Following a monumental campaign of fundraising, cleaning, building, planning, and installation, the museum began operation in 1980. The museum is a nonprofit corporation governed by a Board of Trustees, and funded by private donations. The mission of the Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation is to encourage and inspire future innovation in America. The museum accomplishes this through its collections and programs, by exploring the historical impact of industry on American culture, by examining the dynamic process of innovation, by promoting its location in Waltham as a foundation of the American industrial revolution, by connecting the expertise of older generations with the inquisitiveness of young people, and by providing audiences of all ages with an engaging museum experience.  Collection  Museum interior; Waltham Watch gallery is on mezzanine. Core exhibits cover the area's role in the American Industrial Revolution, though the museum also has a dedicated gallery of the Waltham Watch Company to note the city's watch making history. The museum includes two revolving exhibit spaces that change out anywhere from 3–6 months, covering anything from science and math to cultural investigation. The museum also hosts many events and festivals in the Waltham area, and was the first to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival, which was the first steampunk festival to encompass an entire town. The Boston Globe in 2014 reported the museum \\"takes exploratory learning a step further.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Charles River Museum of Industry & Innovation official website Category:Towers in Massachusetts Category:Industry museums in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Technology museums in the United States Category:Steam museums in the United States Category:Textile museums in the United States Category:Museums established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in the United States ","title":"Charles River Museum of Industry &amp; Innovation"},{"id":"20919277","text":"The Union Covered Bridge State Historic Site in Monroe County, Missouri, is maintained by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources as a state historic site to preserve the Union covered bridge.

In 1968 a partial restoration was completed using materials from the Mexico Covered Bridge, which flood waters had destroyed the previous year. In 1970 the Union bridge was closed after structural timbers were damaged by overweight trucks. A total restoration was completed in 1988. The bridge was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The bridge is a Burr Arch span that is wide and high. Joseph C. Elliot built the bridge in 1871 from local oak. It is sided in clapboard and uses wood shingles. Two earlier uncovered bridges at this site were replaced in turn due to deterioration. Some siding was removed as an emergency measure in 2008 when the bridge was threatened by severe flooding. Removal of the lowest siding allowed the stream to flow freely through the understructure of the bridge, thus sparing it the full force of the current. The bridge was saved, but the removed siding is still missing while funds for repair are sought.

In addition to steadily increasing demand, two major supply-side trends have encouraged the development of the industry: (1) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, the Chinese government lowered entry barriers to foreign insurers, allowing them to establish joint-venture insurance firms in China; and (2) domestic insurers strengthened themselves through initial public offerings and other market developments. (For example, China Life Insurance at one point became the second largest insurance company in the world in terms of market capitalization although the value has kept declining since the stock market peak of 2008.) As of 2007, China had 100 insurance companies, 59 of which are domestic-funded and the rest 41 are foreign-funded. And five Chinese insurance companies including the People's Insurance Company of China, China Life Insurance, Ping An Insurance Company of China, China Insurance International Holdings Co., Ltd. (CIIH) and China Pacific Insurance have listed at home and abroad. China Life Insurance had about a 50% share of the life insurance market; Ping An Life Insurance and Ping An Property Insurance share 16% and 12% of corresponding insurance markets, respectively ranking 2nd and 3rd. Chinese insurers namely China Insurance International Holdings, China Life Insurance, Ping An Insurance, People's Insurance Company of China and China Pacific Insurance were the first wave of insurers to go public. In December 2011, New China Life began a second wave of IPOs for smaller tier 2 insurers.New China Life Plan's Dual IPO, Financial Times, Aug. 2011 In Jan-May 2007, the increased insurance assets reached RMB 450 billion, without calculation the value-added of substantive financial assets. At present, the gross assets of China Life Insurance have outnumbered RMB 1 trillion. And the total capital of the whole insurance industry has exceeded RMB 200 billion, 5.6 times that of 2002. During the first three quarters of 2009 China's insurance companies had generated profits 36.9 billion RMB of which the seven largest insurers accounted for 90% of these profits. Despite all this growth the industry is still considered in its infancy stage when looking at China's insurance penetration compared to its peers in the rest of Greater China and Asia.China's Insurance Market: Lessons Learned from Taiwan, by Sam Radwan, Bloomberg Businessweek, June 2010Sam Radwan's quote in The Economist article Insurance in China: Growing Pains, December 2011 Organizations ;Insurance Association of China (IAC) The IAC represents the collective interests of the China's insurance industry.

The Radio Years  Known as \\"Rockin' Rod\\", Rod was a disk jockey for radio station WEHH from 1959 to 1963. Rod Denson got his start in radio while a student at Thomas A. Edison High School in Elmira Heights. Station owner Frank Saia donated a half-hour of air time Saturday morning to both local High Schools. Known as \\"The Heights High School Show\\" and \\"The Horseheads High School Show\\". During each school's respective half-hour, a student from that school would play music from the Fabulous Fifty Chart, read announcements about upcoming school events, report sports scores etc. One Saturday morning Denson substituted for the school's regular host and his work so impressed owner Frank Saia,that he hired him part-time immediately after the show. Denson began working after that for one hour a week, the last hour before Sunday evening sign off. Denson eventually worked up to 20 hours a week part-time from October 1959 to 1961. He was then hired full-time for two years, and could be heard mornings from 6 to 10 on the morning show called \\"The Town Crier\\". He was back on the air from noon until 2 PM with the \\"Rod Denson Show\\". His last day on the job was in early November 1963. In August 1962 Denson interviewed Les Paul and Mary Ford at the original Latta Brook Studios. Originally the live interview was expected to run 10 minutes but lasted for more than one hour. Rod remembers Les and Mary picking on his wife Midge who was 4 months away from giving birth to Rod Jr. Rod left his tape recorder in the trunk of his car at Les and Mary's Motel while he and his wife Midge rode to the studio with them. Because of that Denson does not have a recording the interview, something he regrets to this day. Denson interviewed Chubby Checker at his Motel in Elmira when both were 21 years old, this time he had his recorder and still has the tape of the interview. When singer Conway Twitty was in Elmira to perform, Station owner Frank Saia came up with the idea of giving away pieces of Twitty's tee shirt as a promotion. Twitty supplied a tee shirt and dozens of pieces were given away and some probably survive to this day in area scrapbooks  The TV Years  Mr. Denson began his television broadcasting career on November 11, 1963 when he was hired as WSYE/Elmira's first full-time chief photographer by General Manager Art Kendall. Local news events of that era were filmed with 16mm cameras using negative film and Polaroid cameras with black-and-white prints. When the 16mm negative film was run through the projector in the control room the image was electronically reversed so it ended up a positive image on viewers home screens. To show the Polaroid prints they were taped to a board side by side, the board was then inserted into a slot on a wooden frame where the prints were moved horizontally. A studio camera was focused on a rectangular slot in the frame where the prints appeared one by one. As the anchor read news script the photos were moved in relation to the story. In the late 70s Denson was one of the first cameramen in New York State and the nation to use portable color video tape recorders to shoot news events. Denson anchored the Saturday 11PM Newscast alone, doing the local, state, sports, national news and weather from Hawley Hill. There were times when the Saturday newscast was done with only two people in the building, an engineer in the control room and Denson in the Studio. Most of the time there were four people for that newscast, a director, engineer, studio cameraman and Denson. Denson left WSYE in 1989, then known as WETM, after serving as an engineer for the station from 1987 to 1989. He later would join Elmira College's staff, managing the college's audio-visual department.

The state park features water recreation on six small lakes. History The park occupies one of the few remaining sand prairie areas found along the central and northern Mississippi River. During the last Ice Age, the glacial movement left large deposits of high-quality gravel and sand. Beginning in 1924, the Missouri Highway Commission contracted with private companies to remove gravel deposits for use in road surfacing. The depth of the gravel required open-pit mining techniques which eventually led to the creation of the six lakes that dot the park's landscape. By the 1980s, some 26 million tons of sand and gravel had been removed from the area. The park was established in 1960 on transferred from the Missouri Highway Commission. Its name \\"Wakonda\\" was taken from an Osage Indian word meaning something consecrated or spiritual. Further land purchases by the state included a tract added to the park in 1992. Activities and amenities The park's lakes are used for fishing, swimming, and small-motor and non-motorized boating. There are two campgrounds with a total of more than 100 campsites and trails for hiking and bicycling.

After they finally they get in, the witch tells them that in order to save Susie, they have to face off against a knight, and gives them a suit of armor so one of them will be the knight, resulting in Fleegle and Bingo being the horse and Drooper being the knight. however, they become helpless upon discovering the knight is a robot on a giant mechanical horse, which chases the trio. Eventually, Susie's able to outsmart the Witch, and makes the horse malfunction and throw the knight off of it, defeating it. Finally reuniting with Susie, the group uses the horse to escape and get back to the magic billboard, while they're unfortunately getting chased by the Wicked Witch. The witch uses her magic to make a wall to block the billboard, but the group jumps over the wall while the horse and Witch crash into it. The Banana Splits and Susie return to their world, say farewell to Hocus and Pocus, and the Splits perform their scheduled concert at the amusement park, where they sing \\"Doin' the Banana Split.\\" Cast * Paul Winchell as Fleegle and Tree * Daws Butler as Bingo, Frog, and Octopus * Allan Melvin as Drooper * Don Messick as Snorky, Dragon * Michele Tobin as Susie * Howard Morris as Hocus and Pocus * Joan Gerber as the Wicked Witch ReferencesExternal links  * Tribute site to The Banana Splits in Hocus Pocus Park Category:The Banana Splits Category:1972 films Category:The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie Category:Films scored by Hoyt Curtin Category:Films set in amusement parks Category:Films about apes Category:Films about dogs Category:Films about elephants Category:Films about lions ","title":"The Banana Splits in Hocus Pocus Park"},{"id":"20919330","text":"Memphis Guitars were guitars produced during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. Overview \\"Memphis\\"-branded guitars and signal processors were affordable music gear imported from Asia and distributed in the United States by C. Bruno and Sons from 1969 until November 1989. The product line included Fender- and Gibson-styled instruments as well as some original designs. In the early years, Memphis was a house brand were manufactured by Matsumoku Industrial of Nagoya, Japan. Later, original designs were apparently built by Yamaki [which also built guitars under its own Daion brand, as well as for Washburn and other guitar companies]. [Confirming information is difficult or impossible to find. However, the general consensus in the online guitar community, based upon the strong similarities between certain Memphis models and other guitars bearing the Washburn brand, is that both brands were built at least for a time by Yamaki gakki.] As recently as the early 1960s, the American retail-music industry had had little if any foreign competition. The legions of would-be Elvis Presley imitators found flat-top acoustic guitars similar enough to The King's Martin D-18 bearing names such as Harmony, Regal and Kay, all of which were American makes. Fender Musical Instruments of Fullerton, California had kept pace with the demand from those who would emulate Merle Travis or The Beach Boys. But late in 1963, like a gift of providence to the sagging music industry, the Beatles burst onto the world stage and, almost overnight, the once-flat market for electric guitars boomed like never before. Companies already in the guitar business were soon operating at full capacity; and by 1965, the American retail music industry was selling as many as 1,000 electric guitars and amplifiers a day. Demand was so strong that even companies that had never made a musical instrument got fat contracts to make them. The demand was beyond what the American guitar factories could meet, and the demand pushed the prices American guitar makers were able to charge upward and beyond the budgets of most American households. Guitar retailers had little or nothing to sell to the average first-guitar buyer. Meanwhile, across the wide Pacific, Japan was still rebuilding its economy from the devastation of World War II, and the average Japanese worker was putting in long days at low pay. Most Japanese guitar designs had been loosely based on the Fender Stratocaster; that is, they featured a neck that was screwed onto a body cut from a slab of solid wood or wooden laminate and a separately pre-wired module with most or all of the electronic components fit into a rout in the front of the body [as opposed to having a hollow or semi- hollow body, a glued-in neck and individually-mounted pickups like the Hofners, Rickenbackers and Gretsches favored by the Beatles]. Budding young American guitarists wanted to look like their British idols and to sound like them as nearly as possible, and the idiosyncratic Fender-ish Japanese guitars of the past simply would not do. Enter Bruno, St Louis Music, Unicord and other American importers of Japanese-made products: all of these were only too happy to provide American music retailers with reasonable facsimiles of the most-coveted instruments. These importers, in turn, contracted with various Japanese gakki [factories] to make the faux-Rickenbackers, faux-Hofners and faux-Gretsches for which, eventually, the teeming hordes of less-affluent guitarists would settle. The gaggles of screaming pubescent girls who filled the seats of the stadiums and theaters when their mop-haired idols came to play could not have cared less about the instruments with which their idols serenaded them. But the music scene was evolving and, by 1967, the distorted sounds pioneered by black American blues artists had become popular among young British musicians. By 1968 dawned the second wave of the British Invasion, the era of rock music and of the guitar hero. The louder, higher- gain tones favored by these young men required solid-bodied guitars rather than the hollow or semi-hollow models on which they had cut their teeth, because the latter tended to feed back—that is, to create a feedback loop of the sound coming back to their guitars from their amplifiers and thence being picked up and re-amplified until all that could be heard was an unpleasant, screeching howl. Pioneering blues-rock guitarists such as Mike Bloomfield, Peter Green and Billy Gibbons, searching for a more-manageable alternative, happened upon the solid-bodied guitars made by Gibson and bearing the name of legendary guitarist Les Paul. Owing to the example set by various British rock guitarists --- and a young American who went by the name Jimi Hendrix—the popularity—and therefore the prices—of American solid-bodied electric guitars were growing, and at an accelerating rate. Around the world, an entire generation of [mostly broke] young male guitarists yearned for \\"axes\\" like those their guitar heroes played. So retailers everywhere, in business to—what else? -- make as much money as possible, began contracting with their suppliers for guitars that the legions of poor players who hung around the stores, staring at the unreachable Gibsons and Fenders in their glass enclosures, could and would actually buy. So, beginning in the latter 1970s, Matsumoku made decent copies of American-made or -designed guitars bearing the Memphis label. Gibson Les Paul-styled guitars were the most popular models bearing the Memphis name, although even a glance at online marketplaces of used instruments, such as Reverb, turns up about as many Memphis-labeled guitars of designs apparently inspired by the Fender Stratocaster. By the late 1970s or early 1980s, Bruno had expanded its Memphis-branded line beyond the less-expensive Matsumoku models to include higher-end Yamaki-made guitars of Yamaki's own design. But, by the end of the '80s, the demand for Japanese- built products had pushed the wages of Japanese workers past the profit point of the gakki, so importers like Bruno awarded contracts for production of the more-affordable guitars to relatively cheap Korean makers such as Samick. [Note: As of this writing, production has been moved from Korea to China, and thence to Indonesia, and likely will end up in Africa, unless polar bears, penguins or elves can be persuaded to make guitars in exchange for candy canes, fish, paid medical leave, and a few weeks' annual vacation.] At least by the start of the 20th century, and likely earlier, manufacturers had been buying components—and even completed products—from other companies, and even from competitors. General Motors once made only chassis, buying car bodies made to order by Fisher, originally a coach maker. Ford bought Cleveland engines for its muscle cars. More recently, Fiat Chrysler has bought Cummins diesel engines for its Dodge trucks. Daimler-Benz and GM have bought identical transmissions from ZF, Getrag or other German manufacturers to install in Mercedes-Benz and Chevrolet SUVs. More to the point, Harmony Guitar Company and Regal Music swapped guitars and put their own brand names on them. Gibson sold guitar bodies to National, which attached its own necks to them. Sears Roebuck sold guitars made to order by Danelectro _and_ Harmony _and_ Kay so that Sears stores would have something to sell to the higher-, lower- _and_ mid-priced markets. Many guitarists know that, in 1957, Gibson's parent company, Chicago Musical Instruments, acquired the assets of its former competitor Epiphone and, by the end of the 1950s, was building Epiphone- branded guitars right alongside Gibsons in its original factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan; it sold these Epiphones through music retailers that had chosen not to be Gibson dealers rather than be forced to sell Gibson products at prices CMI determined. In other words, CMI turned Epiphone into a brand it could sell to buyers who wanted Gibson quality but didn't want to pay extra just for the \\"Gibson\\" name on the headstock. CMI covered the house-brand market, too, selling small batches of custom-order guitars to small midwestern department- store chains such as Dwight. And now, at last, to the point: Japanese guitar gakki, in the business of building guitars and other instruments [as opposed to retailing them], did the same thing: they built batches of guitars to order, applying decals with names specified by wholesale customers such as Bruno, while also retailing original designs under their own house brands, i.e., names the gakki themselves chose. And, at least until the late 1970s or early 1980s, most Japanese guitar gakki were happy to put whatever name a bulk importer like Bruno wanted on the headstock of the guitars it was buying from the gakki. Matsumoku, Yamaki, Nippon Gakki, Hoshino, Teisco and other gakki also made guitars with no label at all, leaving the labeling to their wholesale customers. [Generally, if a guitar's name-decal has a layer of translucent lacquer over it, the decal was applied in the factory.] As a result, a large number of Matsumoku- or Korean-manufactured guitars, although virtually identical to guitars bearing the Memphis waterslide decal, bear various other names instead, and a few bear no name at all. A few particularly time-consuming, labor-intensive steps in the manufacture of guitars can make the difference between profit and loss [as well as the difference between [1] instruments that keep working well long after they have been paid for, and [2] those that do not]. One such step is the making of the \\"nut\\", the string guide between the fretboard and the tuning pegs. Traditionally, nuts have been made out of bone, rough-cut one at a time with power tools and finished by hand, a high-precision process that has led some manufacturers to try various work- arounds. Some makers install nuts mass-extruded out of plastic. But another common solution has been the addition of a \\"zero\\" fret. The early, first- and second-generation [pre-1976 or so] lower-priced Japanese guitars [as well as many lower-end European-built guitars made by Eko, Framus, Hagstrom, Hofner, Selmer, Egmond and Burns] are easily recognized as lower-end models by the zero fret on their fingerboards next to the nut. [Gretsch appears to have originated this design feature, at least among American makers.] The zero fret is said to allow the open strings to ring as true as the fretted ones, as well as setting the string spacing and height at the lowest register of the fingerboard. Early and lower-priced Memphis-branded guitars can often be identified by this feature. Also, apparently because of the traditional design features of the most popular Gibson and Fender models, a bolted-on neck is a plus on a Fender-style guitar, but a minus on Gibson-style guitars, most of which feature a \\"set \\" [i.e., glued-in] neck. The Memphis name also appears on various guitar-effects pedals, including delays, reverbs, overdrives, and the Memphis Fuzz. One of the most common is the Memphis phase shifter, named \\"Roto Phase\\" [likely a hint that the pedal is aimed at guitarists who want the Leslie rotating-speaker effect without the bulky cabinet]. It is a simple-to- use stompbox featuring single monophonic input and output jacks, and a single knob that controls the speed of the rotating-speaker effect. For information about the current market value of Memphis-branded guitars, the reader is encouraged to consult guitar-related media such as Vintage Guitar magazine or Harmony Central, or call Gruhn Guitars of Nashville, Tennessee.

Designed by VPLP Yacht Design with consultation from Franck Cammas and his Groupama multi-hull sailing team, BOR90 is very light for her size being constructed almost entirely out of carbon fiber and epoxy resin, and exhibits very high performance being able to sail at 2.0 to 2.5 times the true wind speed. From the actual performance of the boat during the 2010 America's Cup races, it can be seen that she could achieve a velocity made good upwind of over twice the wind speed and downwind of over 2.5 times the wind speed. She can apparently sail at 20 degrees off the apparent wind. The boat sails so fast downwind that the apparent wind she generates is only 5-6 degrees different from that when she is racing upwind; that is, the boat is always sailing upwind with respect to the apparent wind. An explanation of this phenomenon can be found in the article on sailing faster than the wind. Design USA 17 was designed by VPLP. CareerLaunching and initial testing= BMW Oracle Racing's BOR 90 in original configuration, sailing in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego BOR 90 was launched in Anacortes, Washington in August 2008 after more than 9 months of construction. She underwent initial testing in Anacortes before being shipped to San Diego, California for additional sea trials and development. In March 2009, USA 17 (then referred to as BOR90) was pulled from the water for extensive modification in BMW Oracle Racing's San Diego shop. She emerged in early July, 2009, featuring wave-piercing hulls and other modifications. She was further modified subsequently, in particular in October 2009 to add an engine to power hydraulic winches. On November 8, 2009, the team announced that a rigid sail wing had been built for the yacht. The wingsail was initially tall and some 80 percent larger than the wing of a Boeing 747 airplane; it was later extended to . The wing has a very high aspect ratio, meaning that it is very tall and narrow. It can change camber to adjust lift in order to optimize performance. The wing consists of two main elements, separated by a vertical slot through which air can flow. The rear element is made up of several separate sections, whose angle can be adjusted separately, much like the flaps on an airplane's wing. Thus the lift of the sail can be controlled very finely, both overall, and for each section. The wing is more efficient than a traditional soft-sail rig setup. On November 10, BMW reported that they hit boat speed in a reported wind speed. During the first race of the 2010 America's Cup, USA 17 was able to sail upwind faster than Alinghi 5 even without a jib. Since the sail area of USA 17s wing is much larger than the sail area of Alinghi 5s mainsail and jib combined, it is clear that the rigid wing is much more efficient than even high-performance traditional sails. =America's Cup=Race 1 The first race of the 2010 America's Cup took place on February 12, 2010. USA 17 beat the defender, Alinghi 5. USA 17 started behind by 1:27 after start box maneuvering with Alinghi, but was ahead by 3:21 at the windward mark and by about 9 minutes at the finish. Her official finish time was 15:28 ahead of the loser because Alinghi 5 had to perform a penalty turn, having failed to stay clear at the start. Wind speeds were during the first race. USA 17 reached the windward mark in 1h29, so her velocity made good was about , or about 1.8 times wind speed. USA 17 took 63 minutes to reach the downwind mark, so her velocity made good downwind was about , or about 2.5 times wind speed. The measured wind velocity is taken at near sea level, and does not account for effects of wind gradient with reported true wind speed of at mast head height of over . The measured sea- level wind direction shifted away from 180 degrees between the time of setting of the course and commencement of sailing of the downwind leg, by which time wind direction was reported to be at around 160 degrees. As such the ratio between downwind velocity made good and wind speed is an approximation only. Race 2 On February 14, 2010, USA 17 also won the second race, and thus the America's Cup, again by a considerable margin. USA 17 was ahead by 0:24 at the start, by 0:28 at the windward mark, by 2:44 at the gybe mark, and by over 4 minutes at the finish. Her official finish time was 5:26 ahead of the defender because Alinghi 5 had to perform a penalty turn, having entered the pre-start area too soon. Wind speeds were during the second race. USA 17 reached the windward mark in 59 minutes, so her velocity made good was about , or about 1.65 times wind speed. The course was a triangle, so the velocity made good downwind was only , or about 1.4 times wind speed. USA 17 averaged , or about 3.6 times the wind speed, on the faster first triangular leg. Observers stated that the rigid wing had given USA a decisive advantage.

Later career From 2004, Wank started in the Continental Cup and achieved in his second jump in Rovaniemi, with his first podium place 3. Then Wank was in the National Group for World Cup jumping in Oberstdorf in the Four Hills Tournament 2004–05. In his first jump in the highest ski-series, he reached 45th Place. In 2005, he made German Junior Champion in singles and was also on the team. At the German Senior championships, he finished sixth overall. In 2007, his team won the gold medal at the German championships. On 27 February 2008 he placed 1st in Poland's Zakopane in the junior world champion in singles, the biggest success of his career. Two days later, he also won the title in the team jumping. In the season 2008–2009 he first belonged to the A-national squad for the World Cup ski jumping. In the end, he reached the 59th Place in the World Cup overall standings. On 19 July 2009 Wank won the individual competition of the German championship in ski jumping in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with complete surprise jumps of 135 meters and 139 meters in front of Michael Neumayer and Michael Uhrmann. His previous best finish in an individual jump, which he reached in the summer Grand Prix on 3 October 2009 in Klingenthal, was the 7th place. Personal life Wank is originally from Domnitz in Saxony-Anhalt. Since the age of ten he has lived in Oberhof, where he graduated from a sports school in 2007. In March 2008, he enrolled at the University of Ansbach to study international management in a program that has been adapted to the HS Anspach and designed specifically for top athletes.

The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or complete and ready-to-fly. Design and development The aircraft is marketed in the United States as a Light Sport Aircraft, and as an ultralight in most of Europe. It is a high-wing design, mostly using engines from the Rotax 912 family. It was developed from the similar Remos Gemini Ultra. The Mirage has the same layout, landing gear and structure but has a span reduced by 1.00 m (3 ft 3 in), is 170 mm ( 6.7 in) longer and is 34 kg (75 lb) heavier. The Mirage also adds an elevator trim tab and electrical flap operation. The Gemini's standard two-stroke 48 kW (64 hp) Rotax 582 engine was replaced in the Mirage by a 60 kW (80 hp) four-stroke Rotax 912UL. The wings of the G3 Mirage have a constant chord centre section with straight tapered outer panels. The inboard sections carry electrically operated flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. Behind the cabin the fuselage is slender and carries a low set, straight tapered tailplane with horn balanced elevators. The fin and rudder are straight edged and sharply tapered, the latter horn balanced and ending at the top of the fuselage. There is a small underfin. The GX version introduced a long, integrated dorsal fin. The G3 Mirage has a tricycle undercarriage with cantilever legs mounted to the fuselage and with faired wheels. The Remos is somewhat unusual among modern certificated/LSA aircraft in that it can be flown with the doors removed. The prototype and most production Mirages have been powered by 80 hp or 100 hp variants of the Rotax 912 flat four engine. The Mirage RS/L version had a Jabiru 2200 and one aircraft (D-MPCJ) had a two-cylinder, 72 hp Swiss Auto SAB 430 turbocharged car engine, which saved 30 kg (66 lb). The G3 Mirage first flew on 20 September 1997 with the lower powered Rotax. The first production aircraft also used this engine but had some small horizontal control surface modifications plus the addition of a horn balance to the rudder. The GX has been the current production model since 2006 and features folding wings and monocoque carbon fiber construction. Its wing has a different airfoil than the G3, improving roll rate and giving better penetration of turbulence. The GX is fitted with either a Junkers or BRS ballistic parachute recovery system. The GX2009 was introduced at the Sebring Expo. There were improvements to the instrument panel and interior and a new chromoly steel tube landing gear, which replaced the earlier composite undercarriage, is retrofitable to older models. Operational history Remos GXs over the seaport of Saint- Petersburg, Russia The G3 Mirage/GX has been produced to meet both European ultralight and US LSA regulations. By early 2009 over 300 of all variants had been sold worldwide. About half were in Europe: in mid-2010 there were 156 G3 and GX aircraft on European civil registers west of Russia. The rest went to countries including New Zealand, Thailand and the United States. Mirages were also sold to police forces in Argentina and to a military agency in Romania. An analysis of the operating economics by Aviation Consumer magazine of the G3 versus the Cessna 152 in flight school use during 2013 showed that the G3 cost 50% more to operate than the thirty-year-old Cessna did.

Career His career in music began as a guitarist and backup singer for Wes Dakus & The Rebels. In the early 1960s, producer Norman Petty noted his lead vocal abilities and just as he had done with having two entities for Buddy Holly & The Crickets, secured recording contracts recordings for both Wes Dakus & The Rebels, and solo releases for Barry. In 1965, Allen signed with Capitol Records in Canada, and Dot Records in the U.S.A; that year, he won Canada's Gold Leaf Award for Most Promising Male Vocalist. In 1966, the title track from his second album, Lovedrops, went gold. In 1967, he recorded two more singles; however, sales figures were not to Capitol's liking, and he was released from this contract. Barry's last project with Norman Petty was released on the Canadian 'Barry Records' label in 1969. In 1970, he released a third album, this time produced by Randy Bachman and Wes Dakus via MCA Records. In 1970 he also hosted a television show out of Calgary called 'Come Together' with various Canadian bands and his own band 'Cheyenne Winter'. By 1973 Barry was the rhythm guitarist and vocalist in the band Painter. The Painter album (released in the U.S. on Elektra Records) and the single from it, \\"West Coast Woman\\" were released in 1973. Shawn Nagy's Super Oldies label reissued Allen's original material along with unreleased tracks on a two-CD set \\"Clovis Collection\\" in 2012, with a CD Release Concert reuniting Barry with Stu Mitchell, Dennis Paul & Gerry Dere of \\"The Rebels\\" in their first show together in over 20 years. It was a sold-out event held at the Century Casino in Edmonton on March 10, 2012. Allen then formed the \\"New Rebels\\" with local musicians to do the occasional performance. A stereo reissue of \\"Goin' Places\\" was released in 2013, followed by \\"Love Drops\\" in 2016. He returned to solo recording with \\"Speed Of Dark\\" released in November 2019.

It is mainly located in the capital, Addis Ababa, and the city of Dire Dawa. History The name Ethiopia itself is Greek and means \\"of burned face\\". It is first attested in the Homeric epics but it is unlikely to have referred to any particular nation, but rather, to people of African descent in general. The Greek community in Ethiopia is first attested by the presence of craftsmen and sailors in the 18th century (1740) in what was then Abyssinia, who played a part in the commerce between the country and Europe. The explorer James Bruce reported that a number of Greek refugees from Smyrna arrived in Gondar during the reign of the Emperor Iyasu II, who included twelve silversmiths, whom the emperor put to work producing a variety of items for both his court and the churches of Gondar.Raymond Silverman and Neal Sobania, \\"Mining a Mother Lode: Early European Travel Literature and the History of Precious Metalworking in Highland Ethiopia\\", History in Africa, 31 (2004), p. 348 The community saw its heyday in the early part of the 20th century with the establishment of the Holy Metropolis of Axum by the Patriarchate of Alexandria in 1908 and of the Greek organizations in Addis Ababa (1918) and Dire Dawa (1921). In 1969, an Association of Ethio Hellenic Studies was formed. The Founder President of the Association was Greek Metropolitan Methodios Fouyas of Aksum and the Vice presidents were Rev. Fr. Dr. V.C. Samuel, Dean of the Faculty of Theology and Dr. P. Petrides of the French Academy of Science. The Very Rev. L.S. Babte Mariam Workeneh was the Secretary General and Nicolas Geoprgkas, President of the Greek Community in Addis Ababa was the Treasurer. H.I.H. Merid Asfa Wossen CrownPrince of Ethiopia was the Patron and H.B. Archbishop Theophilos of Harar and Acting Patriarch of Ethiopia was the Chairman. To promote the scholarly works concerning Ethiopia and Greece and their historical and ecclesiastical heritage and achievements the Year Book ABBA SLAMA was published from 1970 to 1976. ABBA SALAMA A review of the Association of Ethio Hellenic Studies Addis Ababa 1970. Present Situation In the post-war period the community grew to 3,000 persons. It suffered during the revolution that overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, when the hostility of the Derg towards all foreign communities drastically reduced its size to the current population of about 500. Today there is still a Greek school located in the capital as well as a Greek Orthodox church in the same city (St. Froumendios). The school has about 120 students, many of whom receive scholarships to continue their studies in Greece. However there is an increasing initiative by Greeks to take advantage of the investment opportunities currently available in Ethiopia. References Further reading  * *.

He served as a Liberal MP in 1923–24, and a Labour MP from 1929–30, when he resigned his seat ahead of a court case and bankruptcy proceedings. He left the country for the United States, where he changed his name and became a naturalised citizen, practising as an ophthalmologist. Spero was born in 1894 in Dover to Isidore Spero, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, and his wife Rachel. Isidore was a dentist, and George, along with his brothers Samuel and Leopold, trained in medicine. He studied at the London Hospital and Royal Dental Hospital from October 1912, joining the Royal Navy as a surgeon following the outbreak of the First World War, subsequently travelling around the world twice. Following the war, Spero returned to medicine and became active in politics. He contested the seat of Leicester West for the Liberal Party at the 1922 general election but failed to be elected. The same year, he married Rina Ansley, the daughter of a wealthy London stockbroker; the couple would have two daughters, born 1923 and 1928. In 1923 he was selected as the party's candidate to contest Stoke Newington at the general election. The sitting Conservative MP, George Jones, was seen as being safe. Spero, who was also supported by local Labour activists, ran a campaign seeking the votes of ex-servicemen, with the slogan \\"We were comrades during the war. Let us be pals in peace\\". He was successful, unexpectedly unseating the \\"impregnable\\" incumbent member. A further general election was held in the following year and the situation was reversed: Jones regained the seat, which he was to hold until 1945. In 1925 he joined the Labour Party. At the 1929 general election he was the party's candidate for the Fulham West constituency, and won the seat in a three-cornered contest against Conservative and Liberal opponents. On 9 April 1930 he informed his local Labour party that he was resigning from parliament through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, citing ill health. In May 1930 the reason for his resignation became clear when judgement was given against him in the High Court. Spero had owned a radio set manufacturing business which he had sold in February 1929. The business had been in debt, which he had given a personal guarantee to clear. He did this by issuing unauthorised company cheques to cover the amount which were not honoured. Spero did not attend the case, and evidence was given that he had in fact fled to the United States in January 1930. The court found that Spero was liable to pay over £10,000 to the plaintiffs. In June of the same year a bankruptcy petition was lodged against him. Spero again failed to appear in court, and he was declared bankrupt on 6 August, with his estate placed in the hands of a trustee. Spero and his family moved to New York City and then to Beverly Hills, California, where he became a naturalised American citizen in 1938; as part of the process, he changed his surname to Spears. They later returned to New York, where he practiced as an ophthalmologist.

The building is an important regional example of the Prairie Style, and it was one of the earliest residential structures in Kansas City to make extensive use of reinforced concrete. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Bernard Corrigan was born in Quebec in 1847, and he moved to Kansas City in 1858. Corrigan built his fortune as a contractor, street railway magnate, and real estate speculator. He hired architect Louis S. Curtiss to design his grand estate at the corner of 55th Street and Ward Parkway. Corrigan's own firm served as the contractor for the project, and construction began on the home in 1912. The house was completed the following year, but Corrigan died suddenly in January 1913, only two months before he was scheduled to move into his new house. Corrigan's widow sold the property to Patrick J. White in 1914 for $101,370.86. White owned the property until 1917, when he sold it to Joseph J. Heim. (includes 10 photographs) Joseph J. Heim was originally from St. Louis, Missouri, where he learned the techniques of brewing. Heim came to Kansas City in 1884 where he began building his brewery empire. By 1901, the Heim Brewery in the East Bottoms had become the largest brewery in Kansas City, producing in excess of 140,000 barrels annually. Heim and his brothers also opened an amusement park near the brewery in 1899. The amusement park featured Heim beer piped in directly from the nearby brewery. Heim was also involved with numerous other business ventures including real estate, banking, street railways, and telephone companies. Heim lived in the Corrigan for only six and a half years. He sold the house when his wife died. Robert Sutherland acquired the home from Heim in 1923 for $90,000. Sutherland was a native of the state of Kansas, who moved to Kansas City at age sixteen and began working in a lumber yard. Sutherland began to acquire numerous lumber yards in the early 1900s, which brought him considerable fortune. Sutherland died in 1941, but his widow continued to own and reside in the Corrigan House. ArchitectureExterior= Stairway in the first-floor main hall While the house incorporates elements from several architectural styles, the most obvious elements are in the Prairie School architecture, particularly in the emphasis on horizontal lines in the composition. The house is a three-story structure built over a full basement, and it is about long from north to south. The foundation is reinforced concrete, and the exterior walls are faced with gray shot-sawn limestone from Carthage, Missouri. The actual maker of the art glass used in numerous windows and doors is unknown, but the glass itself was most likely supplied by the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works of Kokomo, Indiana. =Interior= Stained glass and stairway in the first-floor main hall The full basement contains laundry, heating, and cooling facilities. The first floor entrance hall features two expanses of stained glass. The ceiling of the hall is two stories, with oak beams lining the ceiling. The main staircase is located in the main entrance hall. The east wing of the first floor contains the living room with large marble fireplace and the conservatory. The west wing contains the kitchen, dining room, butler's pantry, parlor, and a secondary staircase. The second floor contains at least five bedrooms and two bathrooms. The third floor originally contained a game room, additional servants quarters, and storage space.

The episode contrasts two relationships, one between Melissa Steadman (Melanie Mayron) and Lee Owens (Corey Parker) and the other between Russell Weller (David Marshall Grant) and Peter Montefiore (Peter Frechette). Melissa worries about the age difference between herself and Lee as she is several years older. Russell and Peter are in the very early stages of their relationship and are unsure whether even to attempt to build it. \\"Strangers\\" was the sixth episode of season three and originally aired on ABC on November 7, 1989. \\"Strangers\\" generated a great deal of controversy because it depicted two men, Russell and Peter, in bed together after having had sex. Even though the actors were forbidden to touch each other while in bed together, the controversy proved too much for a number of advertisers, who pulled their commercials from the episode. ABC withdrew the episode from rotation for rebroadcast. In 2005, TV Land included this episode as part of its \\"Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History\\", ranking it #27. Plot Melissa and Lee have been seeing each other since Lee painted the interior of Melissa's home. Melissa is nervous about introducing him to her friends because of the several year gap in their ages. Lee is beginning to get upset about not meeting her friends. Hope (Mel Harris) and Michael (Ken Olin) invite the couple for dinner. Melissa accepts, thinking it will be just the four of them. However, all of her friends are there and meet Lee. Melissa has flights of imagination at the party, envisioning her friends gossiping about her with Lee and Lee becoming ever more immature, to the point of imagining him in a baby's bib. She begins to distance herself from Lee, using work as an excuse. Eventually she invites Lee for dinner and contemplates breaking up with him. Lee pre-empts her and breaks up with her first. After several days, Melissa stops by the condominium that Lee is painting. She gives him a set of keys to her place and expresses her concerns about their relationship but tells him that whatever happens, she loves him. Lee tells her that he loves her too and, as she is about to leave, accepts her keys. Also in this episode, Russell, an artist, is preparing for his first solo gallery show. He meets Peter at the advertising agency that is designing the catalog for the show. They get together at Russell's for dinner and end up sleeping together. In the days following, Russell hesitates to call Peter. Melissa asks him why, and Russell says that (because of the AIDS epidemic), this is a bad time to start forming attachments. Melissa convinces him that there's never a \\"right time\\" to start forming attachments. Russell drops off a copy of the catalog for Peter and invites him to the opening. Production Openly gay screenwriter Richard Kramer wrote \\"Strangers\\", originally including hugging and kissing between Peter and Russell. ABC and the producers agreed to eliminate the physical contact between the men in negotiations. Episode director Peter O'Fallon recalled that the cast and crew anticipated controversy and took pains \\"to rehearse [the scene] in a normal way, to not make it too provocative or, honestly, too sexual\\".Quoted in Becker, p. 138 David Marshall Grant concurred: “We were told that if we touched each other in any way under the covers, that it wouldn’t go on the air. Watching the scene, all I see is how completely stiff we were. We were so afraid we might actually touch. But other than that, it was a very typical day. We shot it; it went fine.\\" Controversy There was no public outcry about the episode before it aired. Following the broadcast, ABC received around 400 telephone calls with about 90% of them being negative. TV Guide in its \\"Cheers & Jeers\\" column gave the episode a \\"Jeer\\", saying that having the men have sex on the first date perpetuated negative stereotypes about the promiscuity of gay men.

(also Messrs Napier & Miller) were Scottish shipbuilders based at Old Kilpatrick, Glasgow, Scotland. Company history The company was founded in 1898 at a yard at Yoker. In 1906 it moved to a new site a few miles downriver at Old Kilpatrick after its yard was acquired by the Clyde Navigation Trust to build a new dock (subsequently named Rothesay Dock). During World War I the company built sloops and minesweepers for the Royal Navy, along with merchant ships. It also assembled a number of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 aircraft. In the 1920s the company built passenger ships and Great Lakes traders for United States, Canadian and Norwegian companies. The company also did contract work for other shipbuilders, for example being subcontracted by A. & J. Inglis to build the hull for the paddle steamer for Buchanan Steamers. During the Great Depression the company went out of business, having built over 120 ships. The last ship was completed in 1930, and the yard was closed, sold, and demolished the following year. Ships The company built two double-ended steam passenger ferries for the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company Limited in Sydney, Australia, launched in 1927 and 1928. They were named Dee Why and Curl Curl and were in service until 1968 and 1960 respectively. Their triple-expansion, four-cylinder reciprocating engines were built by D & W Henderson.

Stanford White – a former AT&T; executive – brought this to the attention of Oftel. =Lobbying Oftel= After the Duopoly Review White Paper in 1991\\"Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy for the 1990s\\" Ofcom it was clear that there was now an opportunity for small niche players in the UK telecoms market. There followed a protracted period of lobbying of Oftel by Stanford White (of Numbering Viewed Worldwide Ltd) along with William Goodall (of Goodall Personal Numbering Ltd, renamed Flextel Ltd in 1994). Finally, in mid-1993, each company was issued with a licence by the DTI (now BERR), under section 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1984,\\"Telecommunications Act 1984\\" to provide telecommunications services. Together Stanford and William had effectively created the personal numbering market in the UK. =Company formation= In 1992 Flextel was formed by a team of management professionals, some of whom helped found and launch the Vodafone service. As a result of GSM roaming knowledge, Flextel was able to launch the UK's first commercial personal numbering service by December 1993,\\"Small Company Launches Caller Pays Service\\" Financial Times, 2 December 1993 piggy-backed onto the Mercury One2One GSM network on the One2One 0956 7xxxxx range.\\"0956 7 Flextel classic\\" Flextel was the only player in this challenging pre-market phase. =The market appears= In 1995 the UK telecoms regulator, Oftel (now Ofcom), reserved the whole of the 070 range exclusively for personal numbering, ensuring adequate number availability for the future. This move was fully supported by Flextel and, in June 1995, Flextel migrated its existing customers from 0956 7xxxxx to 070 107x xxxx numbers, the first UK personal number service in the specially designated 070 range. This was quickly followed by intense competition from a number of new personal numbering providers. Technological developments In 2001 Flextel was first to launch the ability to reroute a personal number using SMS.\\"Flextel launches ability to reroute a personal number using short message system text messaging\\", Newsbytes News Network, 8 March 2001 In 2002 Flextel deployed its own switches and real-time databases and gradually expanded its service proposition to non- geographic, mobile and geographic flexible telephone numbers. After over 15 years, the market now has numerous service providers of virtual telephone numbers, each with a different package of advanced features, e.g. conference calling, fax to email, voicemail to email, area routing, time of day routing.

It was built in 1375-1377 as an endowment of prince Lazar of Serbia, who is buried there. The Ravanica church is called the birthplace of the new artistic movement \\"Morava school\\" because of architectural and artistic features. It is original blend of the Mount Athos and the cross-in-square five-domed model that became standard in the time of King Milutin. Ravanica was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. History Ravanica Built between 1375 and 1377, Ravanica is the famous Prince Lazar's endowment, where he was buried after his death in the Kosovo battle. Since then, Ravanica has been a pilgrim's destination and an important center of cultural activities and the Serbian people's assemblies. The monastery has been assaulted and damaged by the Ottoman Turks several times, in 1386, 1398 and 1436. In the great war after the second siege of Vienna a number of monks were killed. The remaining monks, fleeing the Turkish offensive in 1690, took the relics of the Prince Lazar. a number of monks got killed and the rest of them took the relics of the canonized Prince Lazar and withdrew in face of the Ottoman's offensive in 1690. Only in 1717 was the sole survivor among the monks, teacher Stefan, to come back to Ravanica and find the monastery looted and deserted. With the help of local inhabitants he restored the monastery and built a new narthex. The monastery suffered repeated assaults during the Serbian revolution, at the beginnings of the 19th century. The new restoration took place in the mid-19th century. During the World War II, Germans violated and damaged the monastery once more, and detained, tortured and killed it's archimandrite Makarije on 24 February 1943. Architecture  Ravanica church detail The monastery church is dedicated to the Ascension of Jesus and was fortified with a strong defensive wall with seven towers, of which only a part is preserved. The Ravanica church is the first monument of the Morava school of the Serbian medieval art. Its ground plan has the form of an enlarged trefoil with a nine-sided dome in the middle and smaller octagonal domes above the corner bays. There are 62 window lights. The church was built in alternate courses of single-line stone and three-line bricks. Valuable ceramic decoration makes use of geometrical patterns, floral motifs, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic shapes. Art Tomb of Tsar Lazar. The frescoes were not carried out at the same time and by the same artists. They are dated between 1385 and 1387. The middle-register frescoes, which are of the highest artistic value were painted by two artists, one of them known as Constantine, who left his signature on a fresco of a warrior saint. The noteworthy compositions include the Communion of the Apostles and the Adoration of the Lamb in the altar apse, as well as the festival Cycle in the upper registers of the church. The Ktitor's composition was later repainted, and a fresco of Lazar's death was added.

They starred in a series of short films during the 1920s and 1930s. Bobby Clark was the fast-talking wisecracker with painted-on eyeglasses; Paul McCullough was his easygoing assistant named Blodgett. Bobby Clark & Paul McCullough, in Kickin' the Crown Around (1933) The two were childhood friends in Springfield, Ohio, and spent hours practicing tumbling and gymnastics in school. This led to their working as circus performers, then in vaudeville, and finally on Broadway. Their hit show The Ramblers (1926) was adapted as a Wheeler and Woolsey movie comedy, The Cuckoos. Clark and McCullough starred in the George Gershwin musical Strike Up the Band on Broadway in 1930. Motion pictures In 1928 Clark and McCullough entered the new field of talking pictures, with a series of short subjects and featurettes for Fox Film Corporation. In 1930 they signed with Radio Pictures (later RKO Radio Pictures) for six two-reel comedies annually. The RKO comedies are totally dominated by Clark, barging into every scene and monopolizing much of the conversation, with his good-natured buddy McCullough quietly embellishing his partner's antics with subtler gestures and actions. Each film cast the duo in different occupations, which they would tackle enthusiastically if not efficiently. The names of Clark's characters in their films were dictated by their jobs: as lawyers Clark and McCullough were Blackstone and Blodgett, as domestic help they were Cook and Blodgett, as photographers they were Flash and Blodgett. The films were re-released in the late 1940s. Clark and McCullough filmed most of their movies during the summer months, so they could be free to do stage revues during the rest of the year. They appeared in three Broadway shows while their film contract was in force. McCullough's death and beyond Clark and McCullough had completed their last series of comedies in 1935, and McCullough sought treatment for severe depression. After he was released from a sanitarium in March 1936, McCullough visited a barber shop where he grabbed a razor, and committed suicide by cutting his throat and wrists.

He originally specialised railway engines and later in dock gates and weirs Life He was born at Cloag Farm near Methven in Perthshire, the son of Patrick and Janet Stirling. He originally studied divinity, intending to be a minister in the Church of Scotland. However, inspired by his brother Robert, he instead decided to be an engineer, and was apprenticed to Claude Girdwood & Co in Glasgow as a mechanical engineer. The company specialised in making cotton gins.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/James_Stirling_(1800-1876) He then became manager of the Dundee Foundry, which built several locomotives for the Dundee and Newtyle Railway. In 1827 he patented, together with his brother Robert Stirling an Air engine. In 1842 he built the Dundee hot air engine. The first engine of this kind which, after various modifications, was efficiently constructed and heated, had a cylinder of 12 inches (approx. 30 cm) in diameter, with a length of stroke of 2 feet (approx. 61 cm), and made 40 strokes or revolutions in a minute (40 rpm). This engine moved all the machinery at the Dundee Foundry Company's works for eight or ten months, and was previously found capable of raising 700,000 lbs one foot in a minute (approx. 21 HP). James Stirling and Co was located at East Foundry/Victoria Foundry, Dundee. It is unclear whether it was a separate business from the Dundee Foundry. In 1846 James Stirling left Dundee and set up an engineering practice in Edinburgh. He lived at 11 Hill Street in Edinburgh's First New Town.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1875-6 He died in Edinburgh on 10 January 1876. He is buried in the south-west spur of Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh.

It is the second longest road in the Philippines, after Maharlika Highway. Route description MacArthur Highway is a toll-free, two- to eight-lane national road that stretches for from the Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan to the northern province of Ilocos Norte, passing through three cities in Metro Manila (Caloocan, Malabon, and Valenzuela), three provinces of Central Luzon (Bulacan, Pampanga and Tarlac), and four provinces of the Ilocos Region (Pangasinan, La Union, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte). The highway parallels the North Luzon Expressway from Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) to Mabalacat, the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway from Mabalacat to Tarlac City, and the Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway from Tarlac City to Rosario. The entire road consists of series of the new route numbering system by the Department of Public Works and Highways. From Caloocan to Guiguinto, it is the component of National Route 1 (N1), while the rest of the route up to Laoag is entirely designated as the National Route 2 (N2) of the Philippine highway network. It is also a component of R-9 of Manila's arterial road network. History MacArthur Highway was built in sections beginning in 1928 during the American colonial period. It followed much of the route of the old Manila Railroad line from Manila to Dagupan. It was named Highway 3 and was also called Route 3 in early U.S. military records. The highway eventually reached the Ilocos provinces in the north and became known as the Manila North Road spanning a distance of over .

She was a member of the girl group Luv' from 1989 to 1992. She scored with the female formation a Dutch and Flemish Top 30 hit with the single \\"Welcome to my Party\\" as well as another minor hit song \\"He's My Guy\\". After Luv' had disbanded in 1992, she formed with Carina Lemoine the short- lived girl duo Lady's D.C. In recent years, she has been a backing singer and has sung in dinner shows. Early years Diana van Berlo started a semi professional singing career in the 1980s in Dutch clubs using the stage name Sharon Vice. She took part in local talent shows. She worked in accountancy in a transport company before joining Luv'. Luv' (1989-1992) In late 1988 there were speculations about a reunion of Luv's original line-up (Patty Brard, José Hoebee and Marga Scheide). The British hitmakers Stock Aitken Waterman were planned to produce a comeback record. However, this project didn't come off. Moreover, Patty and José didn't want to be part of the trio anymore (but they would later participate in two reunions). Marga was the only member to carry on. Assisted by her partner (producer Jacques Zwart), she recruited two girls to launch a renewed version of the group: Michelle Gold (replaced by Carina Lemoine in the summer of 1990) and Diana van Berlo. The new Luv' act recorded an EP entitled For You mainly supervised by English producer Nigel Wright. The dance-pop songs on this recording were inspired by the sound of PWL (Kylie Minogue, Mel & Kim, Bananarama or Rick Astley...). Four tracks were taken from the EP to be released as singles (among them \\"Welcome to my Party\\", a Top 30 hit in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). Diana's first live show with Luv' took place in a discothèque (Four Roses) in Hilversum with special guests (including John de Mol) on September 10, 1989. Soon after, Diana and her colleagues were involved with other Dutch girl groups (Frizzle Sizzle, Mai Tai...) in the All Stars project to help Third World children with the single \\"Star Maker\\". In 1991, the album Sincerely Yours (including the minor hit single \\"He's My Guy\\") was released but didn't top the charts at all. Though the new formation wasn't as successful as the original one, the trio extensively toured the club circuit and often performed on TV (they even appeared in a special (\\"Luv' in Thailand\\") in 1991). Their busy schedule included a special performance in Dubai to support the Dutch troops during the Gulf War. In late 1992, Luv' disbanded. Post Luv' career After Luv', Diana teamed up with Carina Lemoine to form a female pop duo: Lady's D.C. The two singers recorded in 1994 a single (\\"Now is the time\\") released by RCA/BMG. They rapidly ended their professional relationship. Then Diana went solo. She later became a backing vocalist for other Dutch acts. She has recently taken part in \\"4 acts\\", a music and comedy show. In 2009, she is involved in a dinner show \\"Theater Op Het Water\\" in Rotterdam on a boat (\\"De Ameland\\") on the Meuse. In addition to her artistic activities, she currently works in Helmond at Fashionwheels, a warehousing and distribution company dedicated to the fashion industry.

The Bydgoszcz events soon became widely known across Poland, and on March 24, 1981, Solidarity decided to go on a nationwide strike in protest against the violence. The strike was planned for Tuesday, March 31, 1981. On March 25, Lech Wałęsa met Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski of the Polish United Workers' Party, but their talks were fruitless. Two days later, a four-hour national warning strike took place. It was the biggest strike in the history of not only Poland but of the Soviet Bloc itself.US Intelligence and the Confrontation in Poland, 1980–1981. Douglas J. MacEachin, page 120The Polish Revolution. Timothy Garton Ash, page 165From Solidarity to Martial Law. By Andrzej Paczkowski, page XXXVIII According to several sources, between 12 millionThe biggest strike in history of Poland, J. Polonus Kalendarium 1980 — 1981, Jaroslaw Szarek and 14 million Poles took part in it.Bydgoszcz March  Background  After the Bydgoszcz events, millions of Poles reacted angrily to the brutal beatings of the members of Solidarity. The atmosphere in the country got even more tense, when the government of the Polish People's Republic denied any wrongdoings, stating that the security services were simply doing their duty to restore order and the information on the beatings was described as \\"claims by Solidarity sources\\". The mass-media informed that Jan Rulewski, one of the beaten activists, had been hurt in a car accident, not as a result of the intervention of the police.Polish Radio Online, Fourteen days Furthermore, in early spring of 1981, the Soviet Army was carrying out huge military exercises named Soyuz 81, which were taking place in Poland. The manoeuvres were regarded by many Poles as the preparation of a Soviet invasion of their country and Marshall Viktor Kulikov, Commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, told Polish general staff that despite political situation, the exercises would continue indefinitely.A Secret Life. Benjamin Weiser, page 235 In Washington, the situation in Poland was described as \\"political tension at its highest level since last November\\". Soviet military exercises continued until April 7. Meanwhile, leaders of Solidarity, gathered in the meeting of National Coordinating Commission (Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza), ordered all regional offices of the organization to stay alert and be prepared for a national strike. In Bydgoszcz, a two-hour warning strike took place (March 21), and in a special communique, Solidarity announced that the Bydgoszcz events was a provocation, aimed at the government of Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski. The government responded by sending to Bydgoszcz a special commission, headed by General Jozef Zyto, Deputy Prosecutor-General, whose task was to clear up the situation and find out who was guilty of the beating of the Solidarity activists. However, its members were not interested in fulfilling their task and their inactivity was criticized by Solidarity. Opposition activists were personally insulted by the Bydgoszcz events, thinking that if the beatings could happen to Jan Rulewski, they could happen to any of them. A statement of the Polish United Workers' Party did not improve the situation, as it characterized the Bydgoszcz events as a \\"flagrant violation of law, which created new tensions\\". Most members of Solidarity's National Coordinating Commission (NCC) were in favor of an all-national, general strike, which would completely paralyze the country until all details of the Bydgoszcz events had been explained and those guilty punished. Only few were against such action, among others, Bronisław Geremek, who said that the decision for an unlimited general strike would be a decision for a national insurrection. Finally, during the March 23, 1981, meeting in Bydgoszcz, majority of members of the National Coordinating Commission voted in favor of the moderate proposal, suggested by Lech Wałęsa. According to this project, a four-hour national warning strike would take place on Friday, March 27, 1981, between 8 a.m. and 12 pm. Wałęsa's proposal was accepted only after a heated all-night session, during which the Solidarity leader threatened to walk out. On March 22, during the service transmitted by the Polish Radio, Bishop Stefan Wyszyński appealed both to the government and Solidarity to \\"work out mutual rights and duties\\", he also mentioned several times the danger of a 'foreign factor'.Tygodnik Powszechny online, Prymas Wyszyński, Mediator czy sojusznik? by Ryszard Gryz On March 26, Wyszyński personally talked with General Jaruzelski, two days later, he met Wałęsa and other Solidarity activists. The demands of the opposition were: # The immediate punishment or suspension of officials considered responsible for the Bydgoszcz incident; # Permission for the peasants to form their own union: Rural Solidarity; # Security for union members and activists in their activities and the unions' right of reply to any criticism of their work (this right is to be exercised through the media); # Annulment of a government directive giving only half pay to strikers; # The closure of all pending cases against people arrested for political opposition to government policies between 1976 and 1980, \\"even if in the light of existing laws their activities constituted offenses.\\" If no agreement between the government and Solidarity had been reached, the general strike was planned for Tuesday, March 31.The Polish Revolution. Timothy Garton Ash, page 162 In between, a meeting between representatives of the NCC, headed by Wałęsa, and members of the Council of Ministers' Committee for Trade Unions, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski took place in Warsaw, but it ended without agreement. During this meeting, a Solidarity activist from Szczecin, yelled at Rakowski: \\"What if your wife cheats on you once, twice, three times? Will you trust her? And we do not trust you any longer\\".  Strike  Timothy Garton Ash, who was in Poland at that time, wrote that Solidarity's mobilisation of its members was swift and effective, making it \\"the most impressive democratic mass mobilization of any modern European society in peacetime, against its rulers' wishes\\". In his opinion, Poland looked like a country going to war, with national red and white flags everywhere, and the women making red and white armbands for men who were to guard the occupied factories. The National Strike Committee was established in Gdańsk, in the cradle of Solidarity – the Lenin Shipyard. Its members were Lech Wałęsa, Andrzej Gwiazda, Zbigniew Bujak, Andrzej Cierniewski, Lech Dymarski, Krzysztof Gotowski, Marian Jurczyk, Ryszard Kalinowski, Antoni Kopczewski, Bogdan Lis and Andrzej Słowik.The Encyclopedia of Solidarity, March 1981 Soon came three Solidarity's instructions to the workers: # In case of a General Strike. It specified a countrywide occupation-strike, where worker guards would be on a 24-hour watch, forbidding possession or consumption of any alcoholic beverages; # In case of a State of Emergency. It specified steps to be taken in case of militarization of factories, urging the formations of shadow strike committees; # In case of a Foreign Intervention. It suggested possible means of passive resistance to foreign troops in case of an invasion. Apart from the National Strike Committee, several Interfactory Founding Committees (MKZ) were created in major cities. For security reasons, these offices were moved to large factories for the time of the strike, no matter how long it was planned to be. Therefore: * Białystok Committee was placed in the Factory of Instruments and Handles in Białystok, * Katowice Committee was placed in the Baildon Steelworks in Katowice, * Kraków Committee was placed in the Vladimir Lenin Steel Works in Nowa Huta, * Łódź Committee was placed in the Julian Marchlewski Cotton Plant in Łódź, * Lublin Committee was placed in the Automotive Factory in Lublin, * Opole Committee was placed in the Frotex Factory in Prudnik, * Poznań Committee was placed in the Cegielski Factory in Poznań, * Przemyśl Committee was placed in the Plywood Factory in Przemyśl, * Rzeszów Committee was placed in the Communications Equipment Factory in Rzeszów, * Sandomierz Land Committee was placed in the Steel Works in Stalowa Wola, * Szczecin Committee was placed in the Szczecin Shipyard, * Warsaw Committee was placed in the Ursus Factory in Warsaw, * Wrocław Committee was placed in the joined factories of Pafawag and Dolmel in Wrocław. The preparations of strike reflected an unprecedented level of planning, and in effect, Poland became dotted with worker fortresses, patrolled by round-the- clock guards and the strike itself is until today regarded as the biggest organizational success of Solidarity, with virtually all working people of Poland participating in it.History of Solidarity \\"In the strike, almost all working persons in Poland took part\\" Historians from the Institute of National Remembrance claim that in late March 1981, Solidarity was at the \\"peak of its popularity\\",The Bydgoszcz March 1981 — the time of the breakthrough and this fact was reflected on Friday, March 27, 1981. The strike itself took place \\"in an atmosphere of calm, order, and dignity.\\". Even though virtually all Polish workers took part in it, basic services and crucial industrial plants, such as steelworks and armament factories, were operating without breaks. Nevertheless, Solidarity announced that these plants would go on strike as well, in case of armed intervention. Almost all schools, universities and colleges joined the strike, as well as public TV (back then, there were no private TV stations in Poland). Television screens in Poland showed during the four hours of protest the words \\"Solidarity-Strike\\" and the whole country was brought to a halt. Those who had to keep working, like employees of hospitals, put on white-red armbands, to express their solidarity.  Aftermath  After four hours, at midday, the sirens across the country sounded and Poland went back to work. The magnitude of the strike shocked the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, especially when it turned out that members of the party had universally participated in it (at that time, Solidarity had some 9 million members, but 12–14 million people took part in the strike). Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa's advisors, such as Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Bronisław Geremek, told the leader of Solidarity that the general strike, planned for March 30, would mean civil war and the risk was too high. Diplomats from Western countries were also aware of the tense situation in Poland; therefore, military attaches from the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany were ordered not to leave Poland. In case of a Soviet invasion of Poland, the Americans were planning a military blockade of Cuba.Kalendarium 1980 – 1981, Jaroslaw Szarek On March 30, 1981, the government of Poland reached agreement with Solidarity. The government of Poland conceded to demands regarding police brutality but the agreement to legalize Rural Solidarity was postponed, as well as further steps on the issue of political prisoners. The government acknowledged its mishandling of the Bydgoszcz events, and in return, Lech Wałęsa agreed to postpone the general strike.

The film is set in 1890s Victoria, when Laura (Susannah Fowle) enters an exclusive Melbourne ladies' college based on Presbyterian Ladies' College. The film follows her struggle for acceptance, conformity, romance, friendship and achievement over the next four years. Lesbian overtones between two schoolgirls are made explicit in the film, more so than in Richardson’s novel. It also starred Barry Humphries, John Waters and Terence Donovan, and featured early career appearances by Kerry Armstrong, Sigrid Thornton, Noni Hazlehurst, Maggie Kirkpatrick and Julia Blake. A musical theme runs through the story, with piano works by Beethoven, Schubert and Thalberg played by Sarah Grunstein. Plot Laura Rambotham is sent to attend boarding school in Melbourne at the turn of the century. During her second year she tells everyone about a made-up romance between herself and the school's minister, Reverend Shepherd. She forms an attachment with an older girl, Evelyn. When Evelyn leaves, Laura throws herself into her studies and wins the school literary and music prizes.

Population: History The village of Fevralskoye () was founded in February 1896 by settlers from Central Russia; the name was derived from the Russian word \\"\\" (fevral), meaning \\"February\\". In 1974, the village became one of the most important support bases for construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM). The station and the settlement were built by workers from Krasnoyarsk Krai; as part of the construction of the BAM, various sections and towns along the route were placed under the patronage of Komsomol brigades from different parts of the Soviet Union. In 1982, the village was given its current name and was granted urban-type settlement status. Regular rail traffic on the BAM section from Tynda to Komsomolsk-on-Amur began in 1989. Many inhabitants left the settlement after completion of the rail line. However, in contrast to most other settlements along the BAM, the population has once again begun to increase, with a population of 4,904 according to the 2006 estimates. Economy Logging is conducted in the area around Fevralsk, mainly for export to nearby China. =Transportation= Fevralsk is an important station on the BAM, located from Tayshet, and is the biggest settlement on the over 1,000 km-long section between Tynda and Novy Urgal.

Together with a few other small islands, it forms part of the \\"outer islands\\" of the Marshalls. Kaben island is located in the east of the Likiep Atoll.  Geography  Kaben, Ocean Side Kaben is a small island, no more than 2.5 kilometers long and a kilometer across. The island has around in area. It is almost rectangularly-shaped, with a slight hooklike protuberance on the northeastern region of the island. Kaben is lightly inhabited, having had a few man-made structures erected along its southeast coast.  History  Historically, the island has been claimed by the Iroij, royalty of the islands, as their personal property prohibiting peasant islanders from fishing the island's waters. Fishing by local islanders only resumed when an official government for the islands was formed and fishing was officially declared permissible. As the largest island in the atoll, Iroij coronation events have traditionally taken place on Kaben. The island has several myths and legends surrounding it and its remote waters.  Fauna  The fauna of the island is similar to that of the other islands in the Marshalls. Terrestrial fauna is limited to small crustaceans such as the hermit crabs Coenobita and land crabs from the family Gecarcinidae. Historically, the island has been cited as the home for a large population of edible coconut crabs.  Airport  The island has an airport, Kaben Airport . However, airport is a misnomer. It is a simple airstrip without any major airport facilities. A 2000 Technical Assistance Report by the Asian Development Bank suggested that, for infrastructure development, the runways of several airstrips throughout the Marshall Islands, including the one on Kaben, be rehabilitated. This rehabilitation was suggested to include de-forestation of the vegetation surrounding the airstrip and the construction of adequate aero-navigational facilities.

The CP Cable Service usually appears as a dedicated cable channel, either as scrolling text or a series of text panels. However, the service does not have a uniform appearance, as its presentation varies from one cable company to the next, and it may appear with or without advertising. Typically it is accompanied with Muzak-type background music. As alphanumeric data, the CP Cable Service has never been subject to Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) licensing. In the early days of cable TV, many Canadian cable companies would carry the service on a \\"restricted\\" channel, i.e. a frequency on which a local TV station was broadcasting over- the-air. Since the broadcast station might interfere with whatever channel was placed at that position by the cable company, CableStream provided an easy, low-risk means of filling that position. However, with increased pressures on analog cable capacity since the late 1990s, many systems have dropped the channel or moved it to digital cable. In St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Cable Atlantic (and later Rogers Cable) used CableStream until 2006 in place of blacked-out commercial breaks on the regional cable channel ASN, due to a since-removed CRTC condition of licence intended to protect local station NTV.

The episode marked the series' return to television following a five-year hiatus, and saw the return of Alan Davies as the show's titular sleuth. Stuart Milligan returned to the series as Jonathan's boss, magician Adam Klaus, while the episode also introduced Sheridan Smith as Joey Ross, Jonathan's crime-solving assistant. The episode was written and directed by series creator David Renwick, who chose to revive the show as a means of delaying his retirement. The central mysteries of the episode focused on an attic room whose occupants disappeared without trace overnight, and the kidnapped partner of a stage magician. The episode was watched by 9.91 million viewersWeekly Viewing Summary. See week ending 4 Jan 2009. BARB. and attained a 36% audience share. Critical reaction to the episode from The Scotsman's Paul Whitelaw and The Northern Echo's Steve Pratt suggested that, at 120 minutes, the plot was overstretched. The Stage's Mark Wright compared Smith favourably to her predecessor in the assistant role, Julia Sawalha as Carla Borrego, while both Scotland on Sunday's Chitra Ramaswamy and Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury discussed the nostalgia invoked by the episode, as a result of the series having been off-air since 2004. Plot Set five years after the previous episode, \\"Gorgons Wood\\", \\"The Grinning Man\\" begins by introducing the Gothic mansion Metropolis. Since 1938, a number of visitors staying overnight in the mansion's attic \\"Nightmare Room\\" have disappeared without a trace. Originally owned by a spiritualist, the mansion is now the property of his grandson, stage magician Lance Gessler (Nicholas Boulton). Gessler lives with his mother, Constance (Judy Parfitt), his partner Elodie (Jenna Harrison), and their groundskeeper, Glenn (Ciarán McMenamin). They offer shelter to paranormal investigator Joey Ross and her friend Mina (Naomi Bentley) when the two are caught in a storm. Mina elects to sleep in the Nightmare Room, and has vanished by morning. Constance calls in sleuth Jonathan Creek to investigate Mina's disappearance. Jonathan has recently begun a relationship with an old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be too dangerous an occupation. Jonathan is still in the employment of the magician Adam Klaus, whose television series is receiving heavy criticism from viewers. To Jonathan's bemusement, Klaus invests in the 3D pornography industry and begins dating the porn actress Candy Mountains (Jemma Walker). Jonathan inspects the attic room, and the bedroom directly beneath it, but finds nothing suspicious, save for a small vent in the canopy of the room's four- poster bed, which is opened when pressure is put on the mattress, releasing dead flies. Investigating events at Metropolis, Jonathan deduces that Gessler's grandfather was a Nazi sympathiser, who laid a trap in the attic room to kill one of his enemies without arousing suspicion, and which has subsequently killed anyone else who stayed in that room. Jonathan and Joey spend the night in the room, but uncover nothing. The next morning, when trying to figure out what they had done differently to all the victims, Jonathan comes to the realisation that they would have all taken a bath in the adjoining bathroom. Upon realising the secret behind the disappearances, Jonathan races back up to the attic with Glenn. Unfortunately, Joey had already climbed into the bath, which has descended and released her into a water tank below the room, where the corpses of previous victims (including her friend Mina) remain, drowned and decomposing. The bath has not yet returned to its position so Jonathan and Glenn are able to rescue her. Confronting Constance, Jonathan explains that the room the disappearances occurred in was not the real attic room, but in fact located in a flat-roofed tower next to the real attic which had slanted ceilings built in to disguise it as the attic in order to stop people suspecting any traps beneath it. The vent in the canopy was designed to leak an ectoplasmic fluid on the first victim to ensure they would use the bath. The mystery resembles the real-life case of the Jarmans, the sixteenth-century owners of the Ostrich Inn in Slough (Berkshire), who killed wealthy travellers by tipping them into a barrel of boiling water via a hinged bed in one of the bedrooms. During the investigation, Gessler's partner, Elodie, is kidnapped. Joey follows Gessler from his stage show one night, and observes him slashing Elodie's throat. She, Jonathan, and Nicola later discover Elodie's dead body, but when they return with policemen, the corpse has been switched for a prop dummy. Glenn reveals that he and Elodie were in love, and had recently married in secret. He suspects that Gessler may have murdered Elodie out of jealousy after she confessed their marriage to him. The police, however, receive a video of Elodie walking through a park the morning after she was supposedly murdered, with the day's newspaper in plain view for validation. Jonathan realizes that Gessler had manipulated Delia Gunning (Ellen Ashley), the editor of the local newspaper, into printing a fake copy a week in advance. By making the video before killing Elodie, he could deflect suspicion from himself, leading the police to believe that she had faked her own death and run away. Gessler ensured the front page's authenticity by having Delia create the day's headline herself, releasing a briefcase full of bees in the middle of a local council meeting. Jonathan's suspicions became aroused as the following story about the construction of a motorway through six villages would have been far more engaging as a front-pager. Jonathan and Joey arrive at Delia's home just in time to save her from being murdered by Gessler, who later kills himself by gassing himself in his car. The \\"Grinning Man\\" the title refers to is the subject of a Hieronymous Bosch painting, which hangs in the attic Nightmare Room. Once the episode's mysteries are resolved, Constance confesses that she rescued the painting from a burning room decades previously, leaving an elderly uncle to die as she did so. She has Glenn assist her in burning the painting in Metropolis' grounds. The episode ends with Jonathan, Joey, and Adam arriving at a restaurant to celebrate with their significant others. Adam discovers that he has been conned by Candy, and will not be receiving any return on his pornography investment. Joey receives a call from her partner, Alec (Adam James), who reveals that he is in Miami with Nicola and the two are now seeing one another. As the maître d' (Graham Vanas) arrives to lead them to their private booth, Jonathan jests; \\"Three for the Nightmare Room\\". Production David Renwick made the decision to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of \\"deferring retirement\\". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the \\"safe decision\\". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an \\"agony\\" and a \\"torment\\", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly due to a lack of ideas. Renwick explained: \\"Inevitably, you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer. So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place.\\" As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; Jonathan Creek's former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek, the broadcaster \\"bit his hand off for it\\". \\"The Grinning Man\\" was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was \\"delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One\\". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: \\"People say, Oh Jonathan Creek's coming back. Fantastic.' And then they watch it and go: 'God, what a mistake.' Which is what happened with One Foot in the Grave. So I tend to expect the worst.\\" Alan Davies returned as Jonathan Creek after a five-year hiatus Davies had suspected that Renwick would one day revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Grave's Victor Meldrew, who was killed in a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of \\"The Grinning Man\\" was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: \\"For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve.\\" He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: \\"I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode.\\" He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: \\"Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'\\". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having \\"gone to seed\\". Davies, however, did not want to play a \\"fat Creek\\", and lost weight before filming began, stating: \\"it was my choice not to let him go too much\\". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: \\"We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill\\". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: \\"After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [theme] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years.\\" Cobstone Windmill, Ibstone, used for exterior shots of Jonathan's windmill home Previous series of Jonathan Creek had featured first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin departed from the show at the end of its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was \\"dragging [her]self out of bed\\" by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: \\"You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's somebody for Holmes to explain it to.\\" For \\"The Grinning Man\\", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to \\"detective talk\\" the hardest part of the role, explaining: \\"You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master.\\" Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: \\"He's [Renwick] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl.\\" Renwick has stated that the production of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to \\"The Grinning Man\\", as well as his own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: \\"If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing for the first time and I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see.\\" Reception \\"The Grinning Man\\" received a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% share of the total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time- slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times' AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: \\"because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head.\\" Of the episode itself, he wrote: \\"It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy in a way that defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story.\\" The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: \\"it really is difficult to tell the difference between the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight.\\" While The Scotsman's Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing \\"a slightly grumpier version\\" of himself, he was \\"quite impressed\\" by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that \\"the episode itself left a lot to be desired\\", writing that its central mystery was \\"solid\\" and its solution was \\"satisfyingly creepy\\", but that \\"At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs.\\" Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot \\"nonsense\\" which \\"could easily be removed without loss\\". Pratt suggested that \\"This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done.\\" The Observer's Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: Unlike McKay and Gill, however, Ferguson praised both Davies' acting and the episode as a whole, deeming it \\"the best thing on television all week\\". He opined that Davies: \\"plays Creek to easy perfection: mumbling, lugubrious, quietly brilliant\\", and called the plot \\"involving, intriguing, [and] original\\", stating that it \\"did the thing all good thrillers, books or films, do of getting you actively, cleverly involved in thinking you can see the answer before anyone else. You couldn't.\\" The List's Brian Donaldson was also positive about the episode, calling it \\"surprisingly splendid festive fare\\", in which \\"The twists and resolutions were, to this watcher at least, as well hidden as Davies’ ears underneath that shaggy bonce.\\" The Times' Tim Teeman deemed the episode \\"comfort television\\", commenting on its \\"rambling pace\\" and writing that: \\"Our hero was brainy and cranky and the show itself awkward, funny and idiosyncratic (as you'd expect from the creator, writer and director David Renwick).\\" The Daily Telegraph' Gerard O'Donovan agreed that the episode felt \\"comfy and familiar\\", but also found its run-time overstretched, writing that it: Of Smith's performance as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: \\"For most drama series the presence of a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new.\\" In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's performance as Joey, deeming her to be \\"a much more satisfying sidekick\\" than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: \\"it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special.\\" Scotland on Sunday's Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: \\"all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that is becoming more and more risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust.\\" Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: \\"Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate.\\" She deemed the episode: \\"Less a blast from the past as a shuffling \\"excuse me\\". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and \\"what we really wanted was a brand new series\\". Pickles said of the episode: \\"It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you can do better than that.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"The Grinning Man\\" at BBC One Programmes *\\"The Grinning Man\\" at TV.com *\\"The Grinning Man\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:2009 British television episodes ","title":"The Grinning Man"},{"id":"20920563","text":"BAMCEF is an acronym for \\"The all India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation\\". The term got its significance from the Constitution of India, which divides the oppressed and exploited Indians into categories on the basis of their namely: Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward class (OBC) and Minority Communities. The origins of BAMCEF lie in an organisation for employees of oppressed communities that was established in 1971 by Kanshi Ram, D. K. Khaparde and Dinabhai. This became BAMCEF at a convention held in Delhi in 1978, with an official launch on 6 December 1978, the anniversary of the death of B. R. Ambedkar. The ideology of BAMCEF is to fight the entrenched system of inequality that divides Indian society, and to abolish the caste system. History As an employee of the Defence Research and Development Laboratory in Pune, Kanshi Ram realized that the formation of a Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes bureaucracy was important to serve depressed class's interests. He set about forming a federation, through which he worked his way up the bureaucratic hierarchy. By identifying a few zealous officers, he was able to influence lower-ranked staff. The motto of this organisation is to 'Change the System', to inspire the Sc/St/OBC and Minority bureaucrats to do their bit for the moolnivasi (Sc/St/OBC and Minority) masses. In this way, a continuous supply of intellectual property, money and talent was ensured. Ram did not want to make BAMCEF an employees' union. He wanted it to become an organisation of educated Bahujan employees: \\"the think tank, talent bank, and financial bank of the Bahujan samaj\\". BAMCEF raised funds to promote their agenda and for training. Kanshi Ram appointed state- level conveners as well as mandal conveners to act as links between state and district levels. Suryakant Waghmore says it appealed to \\"the class among the indigenous moolnivasi bahujans that was comparatively well-off, mostly based in urban areas and small towns working as government servants and partially alienated from their untouchable identities\\". Others established the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS4) in 1981. This organization made an impact on people in North and South India. Later, this group was led by Ishaan Singh Tomar. Before the formation of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), DS4 entered local elections in Delhi and Haryana in the name of \\"Limited Political Action\\". Later on, Ram dissolved DS4 and formed BSP as a completely political wing. This caused strain within BAMCEF ranks. In early 1986, BAMCEF split. Kanshi Ram announced that he was no longer willing to work for any organisation other than BSP. One element of BAMCEF, which was associated with Kanshi Ram, became a shadow organisation to help BSP in electoral mobilisation. Those remaining in BAMCEF after Ram's departure registered BAMCEF as an independent non-political organisation in 1987. Current National President of BAMCEF is Waman Meshram References Notes  Sources =  * * External links *Bamcef homepage *India Today article about Kanshi Ram *BAMCEF Mulnivasi Twitter Category:Dalit politics Category:1978 establishments in India Category:Anti-Brahminism Category:Ambedkarite organisations ","title":"BAMCEF"},{"id":"20920567","title":"1968–69 Tercera División"},{"id":"20920602","text":"Jacek Lachowicz Jacek Lachowicz (born 15 November 1972 in Gostynin) is a Polish musician, author and producer.

She was also known as Julia Brystygier, Bristiger, Brustiger, Briestiger, Brystygierowa, Bristigierowa, and by her nicknames – given by the victims of torture: Luna, Bloody Luna, Daria, Ksenia, and Maria. The nickname Bloody Luna was a direct reference of her Gestapo-like methods during interrogations. Her pen name was Julia Preiss.CFP, \\"Devil's Choice. High-ranking Communist Agents in the Polish Catholic Church\\" By David Dastych, Canada Free Press, January 10, 2007 Author of several books.  Life  Brystiger was the daughter of a Jewish pharmacist from Stryj (now Ukraine). In 1920 she graduated from high school in Lwów (new Second Polish Republic) and married a Zionist activist Natan (Nathan) Brystiger. She studied history at the Lwów University while pregnant and a year later gave birth to a son, Michał Bristiger.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's holocaust: ethnic strife, collaboration with occupying forces and genocide... Page 60. McFarland, 1998, . 437 pages. After graduating from University, Brystiger went to Paris where she continued her education, receiving a PhD in philosophy. Upon their return, in 1928–1929, she got a job at a high school in Vilnius and in a Jewish Teacher's College Tarbuch. Since 1927, she was an active participant in the communist movement, and in 1929 was fired because of her communist agitation. Working for the Communist Party of Poland, she was arrested several times, and in 1937 was sentenced to 2 years in prison. =Stalinist agent= After the German and Soviet attack on Poland, Brystiger escaped to Samarkand, accepted Soviet citizenship and became an active member of the Soviet political administration. She created the so-called Committee of Political Prisoners, which helped the NKVD to imprison several members of the prewar Polish opposition movements.Z. Blazynski, Mowi Jozef Swiatlo. Za kulisami bezpieki i partii 1950-1955, London, 1986. She was \\"denouncing people on such scale, that she antagonized even Communist party members\\". Ironically, at one point Brystiger oversaw the interrogation and persecution of Bela and Józef Goldberg – her future colleague, the UB interrogator known as Józef Różański. Różańskis had committed \\"a crime\\" of accepting Western food-aid in the form of two kilograms of rice and a bag of flour from the Polish Government in Exile's embassy, in order to save their daughter from starvation. A few years later, Józef Różański joined the NKVD and eventually, became a high ranking functionary in the Polish secret police. He ended up working alongside Brystiger – his former interrogator – in the Ministry of Public Security of Poland under Stalinism.Ryszard Terlecki, \\"Miecz i Tarcza Komunizmu. Historia aparatu bezpieczenstwa w Polse, 1944-1990\\" (Sword and Shield of Communism. A history of the Polish security services, 1944-1990), Wydawnictwo Literackie, Kraków, 2007, pg. 72 Following German Operation Barbarossa Brystiger fled to Kharkov, then to Samarkand deep in the USSR. In 1943-44, she worked for the Union of Polish Patriots, and in October 1944, joined the new Polish Workers' Party. In December 1944, after returning behind the Soviet front, Brystygier began working for the infamous Ministry of Public Security of Poland, where she soon got promoted to the rank of Director of the Fifth Department created in July 1946 specifically for the purpose of persecution and torture of Polish religious personalities.Barbara Fijałkowska, RÓŻAŃSKI \\"LIBERAŁEM\\", 15 December 2002, Fundacja Orientacja abcnet; see also: B. Fijałkowska, Borejsza i Różański. Przyczynek do dziejów stalinizmu w Polsce, . Her career is believed to have been so rapid also because she was intimate with such high functionaries as Jakub Berman and Hilary Minc. In the Polish official archives, there is an instruction written by Brystygier to her subordinates, about the purpose of torture: > In fact, the Polish intelligentsia as such is against the Communist system > and basically, it is impossible to re-educate it. All that remains is to > liquidate it. However, since we must not repeat the mistake of the Russians > after the 1917 revolution, when all intelligentsia members were > exterminated, and the country did not develop correctly afterwards, we have > to create such a system of terror and pressure that the members of the > intelligentsia would not dare to be politically active.Czeslaw Leopold and > Krzysztof Lechicki, \\"Political Prisoners in Poland 1945-1956\\", Mloda Polska, > Gdańsk, page 20. Brystiger personally oversaw the first stages of each UB investigation at her place of employment. She would torture the captured persons using her own methods such as whipping male victims' genitals. One of her victims was a man named Szafarzynski – from the Olsztyn office of the Polish People's Party – who died as a result of interrogation carried out by Brystygier. One of the victims of her interrogation methods testified later: \\"She is a murderous monster, worse than German female guards of the concentration camps\\". Anna Roszkiewicz–Litwiniwiczowa, a former soldier of the Home Army, said about Brystygier: \\"She was famous for her sadistic tortures; she seemed to have been obsessed with sadistic treatment of genitalia and was fulfilling her libido in that way.\\".A. Rószkiewicz-Litwinowiczowa, Trudne decyzje. Kontrwywiad Okregu Warszawa AK 1943-1944, wiezienie 1949-1954, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, Warszawa, 1991. Page 106. Brystiger became the head of the 5th Department of UB sometime in the late 1940s. It specialized in the persecution of Polish religious leaders. Brystygier – a dogmatic Marxist – yearned to destroy all religion as an \\"opiate of the masses\\". She directed the operation to arrest and detain the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. The decision to arrest him had been made earlier in Moscow. Brystygier took an active part in the \\"war against religion\\" in the 1950s, in which only in 1950 (in one year), 123 Roman Catholic priests were imprisoned. She also persecuted other congregations, such as the 2,000 jailed Jehovah's Witnesses.David Dastych, Canada Free Press CFP, January 10, 2007. Retrieved from the Internet Archive, January 14, 2013. Julia Brystygier left the Ministry of Public Security (UB) in 1956 and tried to become a writer, authoring a novel \\"Crooked Letters\\". She worked in a publishing house under Jewish communist Jerzy Borejsza (Różański's brother), and was a frequent visitor to a boarding school for the vision impaired, in a village near Warsaw.

The plot centres on Queensland's Gold Coast in the early 1980s, when a disgraced former cop, Michael Stacey (Ray Barrett) writes a book exposing police corruption, does an investigation resulting in 2 murders, exposes a religious cult and watches the army begin a military coup. Cast *Ray Barrett as Michael Stacy *Paul Chubb as Curly *Guy Doleman as Quiney *Kate Fitzpatrick as Mrs. McCreadie *Lex Marinos as Con *Robyn Nevin as Kate *Don Pascoe as Senator McCredie *Janet Scrivener as Kathy Production The idea of doing a Raymond Chandler-type story set on the Gold Coast came from Denny Lawrence. His original idea was to have an ex police officer working as a private investigator who investigated a quasi-religious commune run by a charlatan that ended with the deaths of many of the communes' followers. Then the Jonestown Massacre happened and Lawrence backed away from this idea.Christine Cremen, \\"Denny Lawrence\\", Cinema Papers, May–June 1983 p 113-115 He then pitched the idea to Bob Ellis, who liked it and the two of them agreed to work together.David Stratton interview Bob Ellis at SBS Movie Show accessed 28 March 2015 They always envisioned Ray Barrett in the lead role as the private eye Stacey and the three of them got some money from the NSW Film Corporation to go up to Surfers Paradise for a week to research and write the script. Many of Ray Barrett's characteristics found their way into the character of Stacey. Barrett: > Bob is a great observer, and when I finally read the script, I thought \\"You > bugger; you've observed Barrett!\\" But I didn't mind. I was flattered because > Stacey is a living person. He is a failure, really, but a loveable failure; > a kind man at heart. Yet everything's slipped by him and he hasn't achieved > the things he's wanted to. The character relates to a lot of people, > including myself. Bob's put the finger on it. He's brilliant.Mark Stiles, > \\"Ray Barrett\\", Cinema Papers, October 1982 p439 According to Lawrence, he was more interested in a genre piece whereas Ellis tried to incorporate his personal politics, but the collaboration was a successful one and the two men would work again many times in the following years. The NSW Film Commission wanted Michael Thornhill to direct but he wanted several changes to the script and Ellis and Lawrence insisted that Carl Schultz direct. The movie was shot in the winter of 1981 in and around Surfers Paradise over eight weeks. The character of Quiney was meant to be played by Anthony Quayle but Guy Doleman was cast instead. Awards The film was nominated for 4 AFI Awards, won in the Best Actor in the Lead Role (Ray Barrett) and Best Screenplay, Original or Adapted (Bob Ellis, Denny Lawrence) categories. John Seale won the Cinematographer of the Year award of the Australian Cinematographers Society.IMDb awards Sequel Bob Ellis and Denny Lawrence wrote a sequel for the film called Goodbye Adelaide. The plot involved Stacy finishing the book he is writing in the first movie and visiting the Adelaide Festival to promote it, where he is caught up in an attempted defection by a Russian poet. In January 1985 The Age reported the film would be made that year with a budget of $3 million. However, the movie was never made.David Stratton, The Avacado Plantation, Pan Macmillan 1990 p 234-236 References * External links * *Goodbye Paradise at Australian Screen Online *Goodbye Paradise at Oz Movies Category:1983 films Category:Australian films Category:1983 drama films Category:Australian drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Carl Schultz Category:Films produced by Jane Scott ","title":"Goodbye Paradise"},{"id":"20920784","text":"Albert Ernest Zupek (January 12, 1922 - June 16, 1980) was a fullback in the National Football League who played for the Green Bay Packers.

It is a plant of arid regions across Africa and Asia, and has been introduced to other parts of the world. Description Panicum turgidum is a perennial bunchgrass, growing in dense bushes up to tall. The stems are long- jointed, hard and polished, with few leaves, resembling bamboo shoots. Side shoots branch out at the nodes, and the stems bend over and root when the nodes get buried. The inflorescence is a terminal panicle up to long with solitary spikelets some long. The roots are covered in hairs to which fine sand adheres creating a felted appearance. This is a drought- and salt- tolerant species, and used for flour, fodder, thatch and erosion control. Distribution and habitat It is common across the Sahara and Arabia, from Senegal to Pakistan, and known by a number of common names, most widely as Taman, tuman, or thaman in Egypt and Arabia; merkba or markouba in Mauritania and some Saharan Arabics; and afezu in Tamachek.Useful Plants of West Tropical Africa. Burkill, H.M. 1985. The useful plants of west tropical Africa, Vol 2. Panicum turgidum Forssk. (family POACEAE). Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Other common names include guinchi (eastern Sahara) and du-ghasi (Somalia). It grows on sand dunes in hot, dry climates, and will also grow in latosols. Ecology In the Nigerien Sahara, tussocks of Panicum turgidum act as a nurse plants for tree regeneration. They have been shown facilitating the regeneration of Acacia tortilis subsp. raddiana by protecting seedlings from drought and domestic herbivory. Accordingly, transplanting seedlings of Saharan trees inside Panicum’s tussocks may promote substantially reforestation in degraded areas on a long-term scale. The leaves and shoots of this grass are palatable to livestock, and camels and donkeys will also eat it in the dry state. References *p. 261.

Contents This 192-page book begins with a one-page introduction written from the perspective of the fictional character Khelben \\"Blackstaff\\" Arunsun. Chapter 1: Understanding Magic, on pages 4–11, describes the nature of magic in the Forgotten Realms, including the deities who most represent magic: Mystryl, Mystra, and Midnight, Azuth, Savras, Shar, and Velsharoon. This chapter also defines the terminology of magic, and explains the Weave—the barrier and the gate between raw magic and the world. Chapter 2: Magic Variants, on pages 12–19, presents several forms of magic beyond the standard types, including elemental magic, elven high magic, gem magic, the mageduel, moonfire, rune magic, spellfire, and spellpools. Chapter 3: Practitioners of Magic, on pages 20–41, gives information in increasing a player character's abilities, including new skills and feats, and ten new prestige classes. Chapter 4: Places of Power, on pages 42–67, describes exotic places to explore, including natural sites (mystic maelstroms, sparks, fey mounds, boomshroom patches, doom pits), magically enhanced sites (crossroads and backroads, mythals), nature venerated (ranger guilds, druidic circles), places of prayer (destinations of pilgrimage, monasteries, shrines, small chapels, rural churches, mid-sized churches, city churches, large or fortified cathedrals), bastions of the arcane (bardic colleges, wizard's guilds, mage fairs), and the magic item trade (the open market, specialty shops, the black market, trade wizards, antimagic organizations). Chapter 5: Spells, on pages 68–135, contains a spell list for several spellcasting classes, and presents over 130 magic spells. Chapter 6: Magic Items, on pages 136-181, presents hundreds of magic items, as well as sections on spellbooks, creating magic items, and extraordinary natural items. Chapter 7: Creatures, on pages 182-190, present statistics for six monsters. Lastly, pages 190-191 are an index to the topics in this book. Publication history The book was published in 2001, and was written by Sean K. Reynolds, Duane Maxwell, and Angel Leigh McCoy, with cover art by Justin Sweet and interior art by Carlo Arellano, Ted Beargeon, Carl Critchlow, Michael Dubisch, and Brian Snoddy.Reynolds, Sean K., Duane Maxwell, and Angel Leigh McCoy. Magic of Faerûn (TSR, 2001) Reception The reviewer from Pyramid felt that the \\"meat of the book for some would be chapter three where new feats and prestige classes are detailed\\" but noted that there was some \\"duplicate creep\\" of content from books that were still available.http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2475 In a review for RPGnet, Alan D. Kohler was impressed with the section on spells as it was both large and inclusive. The reviewer pointed out that many of them were updated versions of older Forgotten Realms spells, and he was rather disappointed with the amount of reprinted material in the book.http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4906.html ReferencesExternal links * Magic of Faerûn at Google Books Category:2001 books Category:Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ","title":"Magic of Faerûn"},{"id":"20921034","text":"Salvia carduacea, the thistle sage, is a herbaceous perennial shrub native to California and Baja California, found up to 1400 m elevation.

They are volatile precursors to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as PFOA and PFNA, and other compounds. Naming Commonly, an individual fluorotelomer alcohol molecule is named by the number of carbons that are fluorinated versus the number that are hydrocarbon-based. For example, 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol would represent a molecule with 8 fluorinated carbons and a 2 carbon ethyl alcohol group. The structure of a fluorotelomer alcohol is most commonly F(CF2)nCH2CH2OH, where n is an even number. Chemistry The synthesis of fluorotelomer alcohols requires a varying number of tetrafluoroethylene monomers that form an oligomer with a pentafluoroethyl iodide telogen. The fluorinated iodide then undergoes an addition with ethylene to form an organoiodine compound with increased synthesis possibilities. The terminal iodine is replaced by a hydroxyl group to yield the fluorotelomer alcohol. The fluorotelomer alcohol can then be used to produce acrylate polymers with the fluorotelomer alcohols attached via ester functional groups. Environmental and health concerns Fluorotelomer alcohols are volatile and widely detected in air. Acrylate polymers with fluorotelomer substituents are under investigation for their potential to degrade into environmental contaminants.\\" FTOHs can also be used as intermediates in the production of surfactants. Fluorotelomer alcohols can biodegrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, whichpersist in the environment and are found in the blood serum of populations and wildlife, such as the toxic PFOA and PFNA. The fluorotelomer alcohols 6:2 FTOH and 8:2 FTOH have been found to be estrogenic. 10:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (10:2 FTOH) The atmospheric oxidation of fluorotelomer alcohols can also result in anthropogenic perfluorinated carboxylic acids. In addition to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, fluorotelomer alcohols can degrade to form unsaturated carboxylic acids which have been detected in bottlenose dolphins. Fluorotelomer alcohols such as 4:2 FTOH, 6:2 FTOH, 8:2 FTOH, and 10:2 FTOH, have been identified as residuals in consumer products such as stain repellents, Zonyl FSE, and windshield wash, among others. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has asked eight chemical companies to reduce the amount of residuals, including fluorotelomer alcohols, from products.

It is based on published sources, interviews and extensive archival research in Europe and America. House of Exile was shortlisted for the Victorian Premier's Award for Non-Fiction (Nettie Palmer Prize for Non- fiction), the West Australian Book Awards, the National Biography Award, and the ALS Gold Medal. In 2009 it won the Prime Minister's Literary Awards in the non-fiction category.\\"2009 Prime Minister's Literary Awards winners\\" House of Exile is published in the US by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, in the UK by Allen Lane /Penguin, in France (Chemins d’Exil) by Autrement, and in Spain (La Casa del exilio) by Circe. In 1933 the author and political activist Heinrich Mann and his partner Nelly Kroeger (later ) fled Nazi Germany, finding refuge first in the south of France and later, in great despair, in Los Angeles, where Nelly committed suicide in 1944 and Heinrich died in 1950. Born into a wealthy middle-class family in Lübeck, Heinrich Mann was one of the leading representatives of Weimar culture. Nelly was 27 years younger – the adopted daughter of a fisherman, a hostess in a Berlin bar – as far as his family was concerned, she was from the wrong side of the tracks. Their story is crossed by others from their circle, Heinrich's brother Thomas Mann, his sister Carla, friends Bertolt Brecht, Alfred Döblin, Joseph Roth and Kurt Tucholsky, and beyond them, the writers Egon Kisch and Else Lasker-Schüler, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, Virginia Woolf and Nettie Palmer among others. In train compartments, ship's cabins and rented rooms, they called upon what was left to them – their bodies, their minds and if they were lucky, their books – and amidst the debris of an era of self-destruction, built their own annexes to the House of Exile. \\"Scintillating and rather magical... House of Exile is an extraordinary book, and a really rare accomplishment.\\"(Michael Hofmann, The Times Literary Supplement \\"Thomas Mann's house of exiles\\" )  The Recluse  The Recluse (2012) is a long biographical essay about Eliza Emily Donnithorne, who lived most of her life in isolation in a large house in the Sydney suburb of Newtown. She is thought to have been the model for the character of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, who was jilted at the altar, and became a recluse, wearing her wedding dress, and keeping her wedding banquet set, until the day she died. But did it really happen like this? The Recluse is the story of Juers’s quest to find the elusive Eliza Donnithorne, who was born in South Africa, and lived in India, England and Australia. It is a lace-work rich in connections and associations, at the heart of which her subject remains, irretrievable and dignified, an assertion of the value of the solitary life.

The car hit the headlines in 2009 when auctioned by Bonhams, after having been rediscovered in 2008, following 48 years of storage in a private owner's garage in Gosforth, England, with few people aware of its location. History Chassis number 57502 was completed at the Bugatti works on 5 May 1937, with the works number plate 1127-W5; it then wore the British number plate DYK 5, finally being re-registered as EWS 73, the number which it wore on rediscovery. The car was ordered new from the factory by Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe (1884–1964), a keen motor racing enthusiast, who took delivery of it on 9 June 1937 from Sorel of London, the UK agents for Bugatti. 57502 then passed through three intermediate owners before being bought in 1955 by Dr. Harold Carr (1917–2007), from Newcastle upon Tyne. Passionate for machinery, aviation and adventuring, Carr suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder, which in his later life caused him to become a recluse and a hoarder. In December 1960, after its last tax disc expired, Carr stored the Bugatti along with other classic carsKatz, Associated Press: \\"He also left behind an Aston Martin, which was sold, and a Jaguar sports car that was scrapped because it was in such poor condition\\". in a lock-up garage in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. There it remained unused and untouched until after Carr's death, when it was discovered by Carr's nephew clearing the garage of his uncle's possessions in 2008. 57502 still possessed its original chassis, engine, drive train and body, though it did contain some modifications: bespoke bumpers, rear-view mirrors on the A-pillars, and a luggage rack dating from the Earl Howe ownership, as well as a Marshall K200 supercharger fitted by a later owner. According to the nephew, notes found in the garage showed that some people had previously inquired about the car, and attempted to buy it from Carr. Other family members had known of the Bugatti and other cars in Dr. Carr's possession, but weren't aware of the car's true value. Auction house Bonhams, instructed to sell the car by the eight Carr heirs,Katz, Associated Press, \\"Knight and a small number of Bugatti enthusiasts knew of Carr's proudest possession, but not the eight relatives who inherited Carr's estate.\\" made it the centrepiece of their February 2009 sale at the Rétromobile car show in Paris. Due to its rarity, low mileage and original condition, it was speculated that it could become the most expensive car ever sold at auction, at around £6 million. However, it fell short of the £3 million reserve price, selling for £2,989,495 (3,417,500 euros, US$4,408,575).

History The history of the Makuleke tribe (Maluleke) can be traced to the time of the Bantu expansion between 100AD and 200AD when African tribes experienced attacks from Arabs from the North of the Great Lakes. The Beja Tonga tribes migrated from those parts and re-established themselves in countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique.Maluleke, V.M.

This led to the Makuleke tribe being forcefully removed from the Kruger National Park by the Apartheid regime to make way for the establishment of the conservation area in 1969. Game Reserve Management Under the new democracy of South Africa, the Makuleke tribe were afforded an opportunity to reclaim the land and filed a land-restitution claim which they won. They negotiated with the South African National Parks organization and reached a settlement under the Land Claims Court which they were given membership to the eco-tourism management of the area under the Makuleke Communal Property Association in 1998. The court order to recognize the Makuleke tribe as the rightful inhabitants of the land made this the first successful settlement of a land restitution claim involving a South African national park. The land restitution agreement includes the provision that the land of the Makuleke Region will be managed under a 20 to 50 year contractual agreement and thus it became the Makuleke Contractual Park. According to the contractual agreement, after the 20 years have elapsed either of the signatories can request for the Makuleke Region to be excluded from the demarcation of the Kruger National Park.Turner, R.L (nd.).

Doctor Eugène Ricklin (1862 – 4 September 1935) was a popular Alsatian politician known for his fiery opposition both to German and French assimilationist policies in Alsace.  Biography  Eugène Ricklin was born in Dannemarie(German: Dammerkirch) from a sundgauvian hotelier father and an Alsatian mother, Catherine Kayser. After his secondary education in Belfort, he attended the gymnasia of Altkirch and Colmar. He then went to Germany east of the Rhine, to Regensburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich and Erlangen where he studied medicine. From a young age, he showed a great interest in justice and defence of the common man, and was already noticed at 29 years old when it was suggested to him he might join the municipal council of his home town. At the age of 34, he succeeded Flury, and became mayor of Dannemarie in 1898. He was relieved of his duties as mayor in 1902 following a complaint about an insult to the Kaiser and as a sanction for having claimed the status of Bundesstaat (federal state) for Alsace-Lorraine. He was disliked by the German authorities and was replaced by the notary Centlivre, a supporter of the Germans. Nevertheless, Ricklin remained a member of the municipal council until 1908. In 1896, as Flury's successor, he joined the Bezirkstag of Upper Alsace of which he became president during World War I. In 1900, the Bezirkstag delegated him to the Landesausschuss - Alsace-Lorraine's quasi- parliament - in Strasbourg, in place of deselected Anton Cassal of Ferrette. In 1903, he was elected to the Reichstag in Berlin, having been elected deputy for the constituency of Thann-Altkirch. His rise continued. His authority, rectitude and competence earned him respect and acknowledgement within his party, the Catholic Zentrum (Centre Party), so that he was elected with some of his colleagues of the Zentrum (which obtained a relative majority) in the first election by universal suffrage for the Landtag in 1911. He subsequently became its first president. The Landtag of Alsace-Lorraine has been the only parliamentary institution in Alsatian history, elected by universal suffrage and representing the region as a whole, and succeeded the only indirectly- elected, partly appointed Landesausschuss. However, his relations with the Germans were problematic. Within his own family he spoke French. He stayed faithful to his fellow Alsatians for whom he did not cease to defend energetically their interests against the imperial administration . At this time he earned the nickname the Sundgau Lion (als: D’r sundgauer Leeb). He even refused the Roter Adlerorden from the imperial government. Before war broke out, he tirelessly worked for the preservation of peace and, in 1913 and 1914, went with Abbot Haegy to the interparliamentary peace conferences of Berne and Basel where he met again other active pacifists like Jean Jaurès. During the war, he was charged and transferred to northern France because he strenuously defended his friend Médard Brogly who had been accused of being francophile by a German military court. At the end of the war, he saw that the full autonomy granted by the Germans in 1918 had arrived too late and, on the abdication of the Kaiser, formed the Nationalrat (National Council) to try to save Alsatian political gains by means of negotiation with the French. He took the initiative and convened the council on 12 November 1918. Elected president of the Nationalrat, he proposed to the French authorities that they accept an agreement guaranteeing those Alsatian rights he knew were threatened by French Jacobinism. What happened next in Alsace proved to Ricklin that his fears were right. But the winds had changed and, with it, many coats within the veterans of the Landtag. He found himself in a minority, and a major part of the Zentrum parliamentarians, with the Social Democrats, didn't want to provoke France and opted to rely on the promises of the French generals such as Joffre. The Nationalrat became the National Council for Alsace-Lorraine shortly before its abolition. For the rest of his life, Ricklin reproached the other Nationalrat members for having acted too late to preserve Alsatian autonomy. With the arrival of the French on November 22, 1918, Ricklin knew he would face challenges. It was certain that they considered him as the man to be most feared in Alsace. So, they tried by all means to eliminate him from the political scene so as to give themselves a free hand in their policy of francization, which had already been prepared in Paris during the war years. They also tried to prevent him playing a role in the reconstruction of the Zentrumspartei Elsass-Lothringen for which debates began in February 1919. As a result, he was dragged in front of the Commissions de Triage (people sorting commissionsThese commissions had to sort people following their ancestry from class A : \\"pure\\" French or Alsatian to class D : \\"pure\\" German.) and, during March, this latter president of the Landtag of Alsace-Lorraine was sent into forced residence in the occupied zone near Kehl (at some point, he was even put in prison). In spite of the protest of every mayor and priest of Dannemarie and the French-speaking communes which he always defended during the German period, he was only permitted to return in November 1919, after the parliamentary elections in which he was prevented from standing. When he returned from exile to his native town, ruined, he had moreover to face a plot meant to bring him down professionally. But Ricklin was a fighter and didn't give up the political struggle. Disappointed, like many, in December 1925 by the behaviour of the French towards Alsace, he returned to public life, first by joining the editorial committee of the Zukunft, then by joining the team that initiated the manifest of the Heimatbund on 7 June 1926. Under his management, the committee of the Heimatbund went into relations with the Breton and Corse autonomists and developed the strategy of the Einheitsfront (unity front). With parliamentary elections of May 1928 approaching, Poincaré tried to prevent the autonomists participating. Six autonomists newspapers were then banned and the leaders arrested: among them, Joseph Rossé, Karl Hauss and Ricklin. On 16 March 1928, Ricklin, 66 years old, was led handcuffed through Mulhouse to be imprisoned. But Rossé and Ricklin fought back and whilst in prison applied as candidates for the Union populaire républicaine (Republican Popular Union). Their popularity had not declined; they were duly elected. After a show trial, they were sentenced, but owing to public outcry, released on 14 July on receiving a presidential pardon. Ricklin was triumphantly welcomed back to the whole of his native Sundgau where the people joined forces behind him, to the point of electing him again to the conseil général in October 1928. The French government tried again to block them, working for the invalidation of the mandate of the deputies Rossé and Ricklin, on the pretext that the presidential pardon had not granted their complete civic rights. The French deputies agreed with the government and voted for the invalidation with 195 votes for and 29 against with 416 abstentions. The government did the same for their departmental mandate which the Conseil d’État (State Council) invalidated on 22 March 1929. But Ricklin and Rossé struck back. They applied again as candidates and, one more time, were comfortably re-elected on 2 June 1930. The Conseil d’État had then to revive an organic decree dated 2 February 1852 to be able to pronounce a new invalidation. However, under constant public pressure, Ricklin was then promised an amnesty. During the election of the president of the Republic of May 1931, six Alsatian autonomist deputies voted for \\"Doctor Eugène Ricklin, last president of the Parliament of Alsace-Lorraine\\" as a protestation to effect a final pardon and rehabilitation for Ricklin. However, while he continued to enjoy enormous popularity, Ricklin never recovered from not being granted a full official pardon. Ricklin died on Wednesday 4 September 1935 at 20:20 after a long stay in the hospital of his native town, Dannemarie.

Patro was born in a rich and powerful family of Berhampur, Madras Presidency. He did his schooling in Berhampur and graduated in law from Madras Christian College. Patro actively participated in the Odia Movement and was a member of the Indian National Congress and later, the Justice Party. In 1920, he was elected to the Madras Legislative Council and served as the Minister of Public Works and Education from 1921 to 1926. In 1937, Patro was elected to the Odisha Legislative Council. He served as Speaker of the Assembly for a short time until his death in 1946. It was during Patro's tenure that the Andhra University was established. Patro was also responsible for creating the existing administrative system of Madras University.  Early life  Patro was born in Berhampur in Ganjam district, Madras Presidency. It is a matter of dispute whether he was born in 1875 or 1876. His father Narayan Patro was an affluent zamindar in Ganjam district. He had his schooling in Berhampur and graduated in law from the Madras Christian College. On graduation, Patro practised as an advocate during which his most important clients were the rajas and zamindars of Orissa. Patro gradually rose to become a district-level court pleader.  Odia movement  In the early years of the 20th century, Patro got involved in the Odia movement which demanded a separate Odisha province comprising all Odia-speaking districts of Madras, Bengal and Central Provinces. In 1902-03, he spearheaded agitations in Ganjam district. This marked the beginning of his involvement in politics. On 11 and 12 April 1902, an Utkal Union Conference was held at Berhampur presided over by the first college graduate from Berhampur. Patro was one of the important delegates representing Ganjam district at the Conference. During the First Round Table Conference held in London on 12 November 1930, the Raja of Paralakhemundi supported by the Utkal Provincial Congress Committee and the Indian National Congress, appealed to the Chairman of the Committee for a separate province on behalf of the Odia people. Patro, then a member of the Madras Legislative Council, supported his proposal and expressed his solidarity with the movement.  In the Indian National Congress  Patro joined the Indian National Congress in the early years of the second decade of the 20th century and in 1915, was the sole non-Brahmin in the All India Congress Committee. In 1917, Patro resigned from the Indian National Congress to found the South Indian Liberal Federation.  Minister of public works and education  Patro was one of the founder-members of the Justice Party. He contested in the first general elections in the Presidency held in November 1920 and was elected to the Madras Legislative Council. On 11 July 1921, when A. Subbarayalu Reddiar, the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency who held the portfolios of education and public works resigned citing health reasons, Patro was appointed in his stead, as the Minister of Education and Public Works.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 182 Patro served as the Minister of Education from 11 July 1921 to 3 December 1926. During his tenure as Education minister, Patro introduced the Madras University Act in 1923 Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 74 which democratized the management of the University of Madras. The bill asserted that the governing body would henceforth be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor who was usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, there was to be a Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor. The Andhra University Act of 1925 established the Andhra University on the same pattern as the Madras University. In August 1921, the First communal Government Order (G.O. No.613[31]), introducing reservations in the Madras Presidency, was passed. This G.O. had its impact mainly in the field of education. In 1923, the government passed a second order decreeing that endowments to universities would be cut if they did not permit the admission of scheduled castes. The admission procedure in the universities were also heavily altered removing the necessity of a knowledge of Sanskrit for admission to medical colleges. Patro patronized and promoted Telugu during his tenure as the Minister of Public Works and Education. On 12 October 1925, Patro inaugurated the Loyola College in Chennai.  Later political activism  Patro was an active leader in the Justice Party even after the end of his ministry. In the late 1920s, when two separate factions the Ministerialists and Constitutionalists evolved in the Justice Party, Patro supported the policies and objectives of the Ministerialists. In 1929, a resolution was passed by the Ministerialists recommending the removal of restrictions on Brahmins joining the organization.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 164 The Executive Committee of the party drafted a resolution to this effect and placed it before the Eleventh Confederation of the party at Nellore, for approval.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 165 This was followed by an eloquent speech by the President, P. Munuswamy Naidu. Patro supported the resolution and introduced the following amendment to it: The motion was however defeated by the orthodox sections of the Justice Party.Encyclopedia of Political Parties, Pg 166 In 1928, Patro led the Madras Legislative Council committee that welcomed the Simon Commission and submitted a memorandum seeking dominion status for India and more autonomy for the provinces. In the early 1930s, as the movement for a separate province of Odisha gained momentum, Patro actively supported the movement and worked for the unification of the Oriya speaking northern districts of the Presidency with the new province. In 1935, Patro resigned his membership of the Madras Legislative Council when the Ganjam district and parts of Vizagapatam district were officially transferred to Odisha.  In the Odisha Assembly  Patro was elected to the Odisha Legislative Council in 1937. He opposed the Quit India Movement and offered his full support to the British war-effort during the Second World War. He was re-elected to the assembly in 1946 and served as speaker of the Assembly. Patro died in 1946. He was approximately 70 years old at that time.  Religion  Little is known about Patro's religious affiliations. Patro built a Brahmo mandir in the Andhra region and organized theological discourses in the temple premises.  Honors  Patro received the title of Rao Bahadur, was knighted in the 1924 New Year Honours listThe London Gazette, 1 January 1924 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in the 1935 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours list.The London Gazette, 3 June 1935  Publications  * *  Notes  References  * Category:1876 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Odisha politicians Patro, A.

He came to power due to his association with Emperor Shunzong's close associate Wang Shuwen but later broke with Wang; he was nevertheless exiled once Emperor Xianzong became emperor due to his prior association with Wang and died in exile.  Background  It is not known when Wei Zhiyi was born, but it is known that his family was from Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the region of the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an). HIs family traced its ancestry to a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty. HIs grandfather Wei Zhongchang () served as a deputy mayor of Jingzhao, and his father Wei Mei () served as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 74. Wei Zhiyi himself was said to be handsome and talented in his youth.Old Book of Tang, vol. 135.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  During the reign of Emperor Dezong, Wei Zhiyi passed the imperial examinations and was particularly rated highly in the matter of offering strategies. He was made You Shiyi (), a low- level consultant at the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), and was subsequently made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi). At that time, he was in his 20s, and he was particularly favored by Emperor Dezong, who favored his writing; they often wrote poems that responded to each other. He became a part of a group of officials who were favored by Emperor Dezong — Pei Yanling, Li Qiyun (), Wang Shao (), Li Shi (), Wei Qumou (), and Wei Zhiyi himself and had easy access to the palace.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. On one occasion, on Emperor Dezong's birth, Emperor Dezong's son and crown prince Li Song offered a Buddharupa as a birthday gift to Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong had Wei Zhiyi write a text praising the statue, and under Emperor Dezong's direction, Li Song in turn gave Wei a gift of linen. When Wei went to the Crown Prince's palace to thank him, Li Song introduced him to a close associate, Wang Shuwen. Thereafter, Wei and Wang became friends. Later, Wei's mother died and he left governmental service to observe a mourning period for her. After the mourning period was over, he returned to government service to serve as a supervisorial official. In 803, there was an occasion when an official, Zhang Zhengyi () had offered suggestions to Emperor Dezong and received an audience with the emperor. Several of his colleagues visited him to congratulate him on this showing of imperial favor. Someone, however, informed Wei that Zhang was criticizing his association with Wang. Wei believed the informant and accused Zhang and his colleagues of partisanship. When Emperor Dezong sent an imperial guard to spy on Zhang and his colleagues, the guard saw that Zhang and his colleagues were feasting beyond their usual proper diet. As a result, Emperor Dezong exiled them, but at that time, no public reason was stated.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236.  During Emperor Shunzong's and Emperor Xianzong's reigns  In spring 805, Emperor Dezong died, and Li Song succeeded him (as Emperor Shunzong). At that time, Li Song was seriously ill, and a group of his close associates, headed by Wang Shuwen and Wang Pi, in association with his concubine Consort Niu and the eunuch Li Zhongyan (), became very powerful. Wang Shuwen, in order that his reform policies could be carried out, recommended Wei as chancellor. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Shunzong made Wei, who was then Libu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu), was promoted to be Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor. It was said that when important decisions were to be made, they would be given to Wang Shuwen to be decided at the office of the imperial scholars (翰林院, Hanlin Yuan) and then given to Wei to be executed. On an occasion, when the chancellors, as per custom, were having lunch together, Wang wanted to see Wei and went to the office of the chancellors to do so. When a guard refused to let Wang in, Wang rebuked the guard and ordered him away. Wei rose from his seat and walked away to confer with Wang. Wei's colleagues Zheng Xunyu, Du You, and Gao Ying stopped dining and waited for Wei to return. After a while, they sent the guard to see what the situation was, and the guard stated, \\"Wang Shuwen had requested food, and Chancellor Wei is dining with him.\\" Neither Du nor Gao dared to say anything, but Zheng stated, \\"How can I remain here still?\\" He had his attendants fetch horses, and he went home and refused to return to office. Meanwhile, as a result of Wei's rise to power, his father-in-law Du Huangchang, who had been trapped in positions with few actual powers, was made the minister of worship. On one occasion, Du Huangchang suggested that Wei lead some other officials in suggesting that Emperor Shunzong make his crown prince Li Chun regent. Wei refused, as his and Wang Shuwen's partisans at the time were apprehensive of Li Chun. Around this time, however, Wei and Wang began to break with each other, as Wei wanted not to be seen as a puppet of Wang's. For example, when Yang Shi'e (), a messenger from Xuanshe Circuit (宣歙, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Liu Pi, a messenger from Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), made demands on behalf of their superiors, Wang angrily wanted to execute both of them, but Wei opposed, and Yang was only exiled, while Liu fled back to Xichuan. Wei further threw himself off Wang's policies when Wang had to leave governmental service to observe a mourning period for his mother in summer 805. With several important eunuchs (including Ju Wenzhen () and Liu Guangqi (), in addition to Li Zhongyan) then in control of the very ill Emperor Shunzong, Wang Shuwen's party lost power quickly. Soon thereafter, Emperor Shunzong passed the throne to Li Chun, who took the throne as Emperor Xianzong, and thereafter, all associates of Wang Shuwen's were purged, and Wang Shuwen himself was soon thereafter ordered to commit suicide. Wei remained as chancellor for some time, and in fall 805, as the official in charge of editing the imperial history, had his subordinates draft a new calendar. By this point, though, he was constantly in fear of being exiled. Emperor Xianzong, who made Du Huangchang chancellor, did not immediately carry out any actions against Wei on Du's account, but in winter 805 demoted him to be the military advisor to the prefect of Yai Prefecture (崖州, in modern Sanya, Hainan). Wei died there of natural causes — as while Du was unable to save him from exile, Du made certain that he was not prosecuted further.Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. After Wei's death, Du requested Emperor Xianzong to allow his casket to be returned, and Du gave him a proper burial.As Du himself died in 808, Wei's death must be prior to that point. Grave and statue Grave of Wei Zhiyi Wei Zhiyi is buried around 20 km south of Haikou, the capitol city of Hainan province. His grave is located at the top of a small hill facing rice paddies. A little less than 1 km to the north () is a temple and statue commemorating him.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 135. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 235, 236.

BiographyEarly years= John Williamson was born on June 23, 1903 in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of a marine engineer who was severely injured in an accident at sea shortly after his child was born. A woodworker and shipbuilder by trade, Williamson only had 8 years of formal education, later attending high school at night. He came to the United States in July 1913, settling in Seattle. =Political career= Influenced by a Scottish co-worker, Williamson joined the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in August 1918. He was the SLP's State Secretary for Washington from 1921 to 1922. In his memoirs, Williamson recalls that he was deeply influenced by the move of the 1922 convention of the underground Communist Party of America to move towards legality and mass work and he joined that group in November or December 1922. He was active in the party's youth section, the Young Workers League (YWL) and was active as an organizer for the league in Seattle and was a member of the movement's \\"Legal Political Party,\\" the Workers Party of America (WPA) from the time of its formation at the end of 1922. Williamson was elected a delegate to the 2nd National Convention of the YWL in May 1923 and he made the long trip to New York for the gathering. He was there elected to the governing National Executive Committee of the YWL, moving to the headquarters city of Chicago after the convention at the NEC's request. The NEC named Williamson its \\"National Industrial Organizer,\\" attempting to build a mass movement of young communists among unionized workers. During this interval of organizational poverty, Williamson worked at various day jobs to make ends meet, conducting his political activities at night. Williamson was a delegate of the YWL to the 3rd National Convention of the WPA at the end of 1923 and was there voted to be one of two delegates to the 4th World Congress of the Young Communist International in Moscow. Throughout the 1920s, Williamson was a loyalist of the Chicago-centered majority faction of Foster-Cannon-Lore. After the 4th World Congress, Williamson returned home to Chicago, where he joined a 3-person Secretariat of the YWL, along with Martin Abern and Oliver Carlson. In 1924 he was made the YWL's representative to the YCI in Moscow. His time there was short, as he returned in September 1924 to assume the role of head of the YWL, a job which he maintained until August 1928, when he was replaced by Sam Darcy for factional reasons. After his removal as Secretary of the YWL, Williamson was again named Industrial Organizer for the group. Williamson was a delegate to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), held in April 1925. In the fall of 1926, Williamson married Lenore Sarney, a Polish émigré who was active in the Young Communist movement.John Williamson, Dangerous Scot: The Life and Work of an American \\"Undesirable.\\" New York: International Publishers, 1969; pg. 61. In 1930 their marriage came to an end, they remained friendly and Lenore remarried and subsequently settled in the Soviet Union.Williamson, Dangerous Scot,\\" pg. 80. From 1933 to 1940, Williamson was the CPUSA's District Organizer in Ohio, during which interval the membership of the district grew from 600 to 3,500.Louise Mitchell, \\"Mild Man with 'Dangerous Thoughts,'\\" The Worker, October 24, 1948. In 1935 Williamson met Mae Kuperman and in March 1936 they married. They would go on to have two boys, Robert (Bob) and Neil, and would remain together until his death.Williamson, Dangerous Scot,\\" pg. 122. Williamson was a supporter of James P. Cannon's faction during the period in which Cannon and William Z. Foster were at odds, but he managed to remain in the Communist Party after Cannon's expulsion for Trotskyism in 1928. That same year he spent 9 months in the Soviet Union with his wife. He was released by the Young Communist League (successor to the YWL) for work in the adult party after the 5th National Convention of that organization, held in April 1929. From 1930, Williamson sat as a member of the governing Central Committee of the Communist Party. =Smith Act Conviction= In 1949, John Williamson was convicted under the Smith Act in an attempt by the US Department of Justice to \\"decapitate\\" the leadership of the Communist Party USA. He served 5 years in prison and was promptly deported to the UK upon his release in 1955. There he was active in the Communist Party of Great Britain. Williamson suffered a serious heart attack in April 1963 and wrote a memoir of his life in the radical movement in 1965, a book eventually published by the Communist Party's International Publishers in 1969.

The name comes from a well known tongue-twister in the Catalan language: (\\"Sixteen judges of a court eat liver off a hangman\\"). The mission of the group was to promote the Nova Cançó movement and to normalize the use of Catalan in the world of modern music. They started out singing their own songs and Catalan versions of songs by French singers, especially Georges Brassens. From the original three members, the circle grew to sixteen: Delfí Abella, Francesc Pi de la Serra, Enric Barbat, Xavier Elies, Guillermina Motta, Maria del Carme Girau, Martí Llauradó, Maria Amèlia Pedrerol, Joan Ramon Bonet, Joan Manuel Serrat, Maria del Mar Bonet, Lluís Llach, and Rafael Subirachs. Els Setze Jutges began to dissolve at the end of the dictatorship and with the progressive professionalization of some of the group's members. With the appearance of professional Catalan-language singers, many of the group's earlier members, such as Miquel Porter i Moix and Josep Maria Espinàs, decided to retire from music. By the time the group ceased to exist in 1968, several of its members - most notably Serrat, but also Llach, Maria del Mar Bonet, Pi de la Serra, Barbat, Motta and Subirachs - had begun to enjoy success as individual musicians. On April 13, 2007, the group of singers received the Medal of Honor of the Parliament of Catalonia, in recognition of their work in favor of Catalan culture and language during the dictatorship. However, Maria del Mar Bonet used the occasion to criticize the lack of promotion of Catalan-language songs in the media during the three decades since the Spanish transition to democracy, and Guillermina Motta declined to attend the ceremony, objecting that the distinction was awarded too late, when two of the sixteen had already died: Miquel Porter in 2004 and Delfí Abella in February 2007.

It is one of the two municipalities, along with San Pedro Cholula, that make up the modern city of Cholula or Cholula de Rivadavia. The city of Cholula has been divided into two parts since the pre Hispanic period, when the Toltecs-Chichimecas revolted, took over and pushed the formerly dominant Olmec –Xicallancas to the eastern side of the city. This side is the city is defined as the Great Pyramid of Cholula and east. The city has remained more or less divided since under different political organizations. However, the two halves share a common religious and social tradition which binds the city as a whole. San Andrés is known for being historically indigenous and still contains a larger indigenous population. It is also home to a number of colonial era churches decorated in Talavera tile and in a style called Indigenous or Folk Baroque. The best known example of this is the church in the Santa María Tonatzintla community. San Andrés Cholula is a Pueblo Mágico listed with the name \\"Cholula (San Pedro y San Andrés)\\". Festivals There are both citywide and local festivals which are celebrated in San Andrés, which are the fabric of social and religious life. Citywide festivals are held in conjunction with San Pedro Cholula. These festivals are sponsored by a complicated rotation of share duties, carried out by \\"mayordomos\\" whose time and money brings them prestige in the community. The citywide events include Carnival, the Vaniloquio, when the bells of the city's churches ring in coordination) Holy Week, La Bajada, when the image of the Virgin of the Remedies comes down the pyramid to visit the various neighborhoods and the most important, the feast day of the Virgin of the Remedies on 8 September. There are events related to the last all over the city, but the main focus is on the pyramid.Cordero, p 19. Another annual event focused on the pyramid is the Quetzalcoatl Ritual, held each year on the spring equinox, with poetry, indigenous music and dance. Most local festivals in San Andrés focus on the various patron saints of the neighborhoods and outlying communities. Each has a church dedicated to its patron saint and some have more than one. The night before such a feast day, the church is decorated with lamps and then fireworks are set off to announce the event. The next day, Las Mañanitas is sung to the image, there are a number of Masses and it is possible to receive a \\"visit\\" by the image of another saint from another neighborhood. During one of the Masses, a new mayordomo, or sponsor of the festival for the following year is chosen, an event which is usually attended by mayordomos from other neighborhoods. After this mass, food is offered to all in attendance. If the saint's day falls during the week, it is moved to the following Sunday. For major festivals, the parish church of San Andres is richly decorated in flowers, and there are sand paintings called carpets on the ground in Biblical designs. During the week long feast of Saint Andrew on 30 November, there is also folk ballet, musical performances and firework shows at night. The outlying communities have a number of festivals as well. The Feria del Nopal (Nopal Cactus Fair) in San Bernardino Tlaxcalanzingo celebrates the main crop grown in the municipality. It occurs during the first week of June. The Feria del Queso (Cheese) Fair) is held in Santa Maria Tonantzintla and in held in honor of the Virgin of the Conception. There is an exposition and sale of local cheeses at the main plaza of the municipality on the first weekend of August. The neighborhoods' patron saints are celebrated on the following days: second Sunday in February in Santo Niño Macuila, 24 June in San Juan Aquiahuac, 29 June in San Pedro Colomoxco, 25 July in Santiago Xicotenco, 15 August in San Miguel Xochimihuacan and 8 December in San Andresito. Communities not within the city also have patron saints' day such as San Bernardino Tlaxcalancingo in July, San Luis Tehuiloyocan in August, San Antonio Cacalotepec in November, San Francisco Acatepec in October and San Rafael Comac in October.

It is estimated to be around 600 years old, and holds an annual 10-day celebration during the Dhanu festival. History Although there are no historical records of the early history of the temple, it is thought to have been founded around 600 years ago by the Ammachi Veedu family (\\"Ammachi Veedu\\" means \\"Ammachi home\\"), aristocrats from Kollam.Ammachiveedu Muhurthi Temple at kollamcity.comAmmachiveedu Muhurthi Temple at thekeralatemples.com Structure The Ammachiveedu Muhurthi's Garbhagriha is small, measuring only 4 feet by 4 feet, by 6 feet tall. The temple has a Peedam (small platform), clad with silver plate, upon which the deity stands. Two Shankha, in golden covers, are placed over the Peedam. The temple has a number of other deities seated outside, including Ganesha, Rektha Chamundi, Paramparu, Ykshi, Marutha, Rekshas, Gandharvan, Vethalam, and Yogeshwaran. Another deity, Djinn, is placed outside the temple premises and is worshipped by the Muslim community. Adjoining the temple there is a Sarpakavu, or snake grove, which houses images of Parappooramma Bhagavathi, Nagaraja, Nagayakshi, and Naga Kanyaka. Dedication The Ammachiveedu Muhurthi temple has no main idol, and is dedicated to the guru (teacher) of the Dharmaśāstra, of the Shasthamkotta temple, about 35 km away. The deity was entrusted to the elders of the Ammachi Veedu family as a recognition of the marriage ceremonies carried out at the temple, and they are now also revered as \\"Brahma Rakshas\\" on the right hand of the deity. Because the deity of the temple has the status of a guru, members of the family are prohibited from entering the premises of the Shasthamkotta temple. The Ammachiveedu Muhurthi temple has no caste bar, and is used by worshippers of various castes and creeds. ‘Ginnu’ (Jinn), a supernatural being in Arab folklore and Islamic teachings, is one of the sub- deities here at Ammachiveedu Muhurthi temple along with the Hindu sub-deities like Raktha Chamundi, Ganapathy, Marutha etc. Festivals and Ceremonies Various pujas (ceremonies, or festivals) are performed at the Ammachiveedu Muhurthi temple, at auspicious times. The ceremonies of Sarpa Bali (sacrifice for snakes) and Noorum Palum (making offerings to snakes) are conducted by the priest from the Pampummekkattu Mana, in Mala, in the Thrissur district. The temple's main annual festival has no specific date, but falls during Dhanu, which runs from mid-December to early January, and is always held after the Mandala Puja at the Sabarimala Dharma Shastra temple. By an agreement, members of Ammachiveedu must not make a pilgrimage to Sabarimala. On the 10th day the Karanavan (the eldest male in the family) conducts the puja in the Kalam specially prepared for the purpose, when boiled Ninam is offered to the deity.Ammachiveedu Muhurthi Temple at naturemagics.com See also * List of Hindu temples in Kerala * Temples of Kerala References Category:Hindu temples in Kollam district ","title":"Ammachiveedu Muhurthi"},{"id":"20921666","text":"Marc Victor North (29 May 1966 – 25 September 2001) was an English professional footballer who played as a striker from 1985 to 1993.

Generally blueish, pink-grey (cf. Latin veneta meaning \\"sea-blue\\") in color with a banded or striped appearance, the tips of their tails are often cream or pale yellow. When the species has not been feeding, it is pale pink. The species is usually found in deep woodland litter and garden soils that are rich in organic matter in European countries. E. hortensis is sold primarily as a bait worm, but its popularity as a composting worm is increasing. Etymology The genus Eisenia is named after Swedish scientist Gustav Eisen. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the specific name hortensis (\\"of the garden\\") is derived from Latin hortus meaning \\"garden\\". Usage Compared to Eisenia fetida, E. hortensis does best in an environment with a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio. This makes it well suited to compost pits high in fibrous materials commonly known as browns. European nightcrawlers can be invasive and should be used only in contained compost systems in parts of the world with northern deciduous and boreal forest ecosystems. Scanning electron micrograph of a newly hatched European nightcrawler (Eisenia hortensis) Reproduction E. hortensis, as a hermaphrodite, has both male and female reproductive organs. In mating, the weaker partner is forced into the female role, which is more expensive in terms of biological reproduction costs, for a sperm cell is generally less massive and energy-demanding than an ovum (egg cell), which is the female reproductive cell (gamete) in anisogamous organisms. Two worms join clitella, the large, lighter-colored bands that contain the worms' reproductive organs, and are only prominent during the reproduction process. The two worms exchange sperm. Both worms may secrete cocoons that contain an egg each. These cocoons are lemon-shaped and are pale yellow at first, becoming more brownish as the worms inside become mature. These cocoons are clearly visible to the naked eye. ;Statistics: * From egg to sexual maturity is about 20 weeks. * Net reproduction of 0.8 eggs per adult per week occurs. * Egg cells are oviposited in a cocoon. * One E. hortensis embryo per egg per cocoon occurs.

The company also started a (now defunct) group known as the Blue Crew, which consists of employees and other individuals from the community focused on environmental education and restoration efforts.  Animals  Many of the animals at Underwater World Guam are found in the waters surrounding the island. The main tank features many large animals, including Grey reef shark, green sea turtle, Blacktip reef shark, Zebra shark, and Whiptail stingray. There is also an exhibit featuring four giant Moray eels. The gallery exhibits at Underwater World Guam are home to many unique animals, including Corals and an exhibit featuring fish that can change gender. Since it opened, the aquarium has featured live shark feeds throughout the week. Scuba divers feed whitetip reef sharks, nurse sharks and zebra sharks, as well as the whiptail stingray and giant groupers by hand inside the main tank of the aquarium. The divers wear three sets of gloves including one cotton pair, a chainmail glove and one layer of Kevlar. The grey reef shark and blacktip reef shark population is fed from a floating platform above the main tank, as they are too dangerous and unpredictable to be fed by hand.  Conservation efforts  The aquarium has supported conservation efforts on Guam since the facility opened. In addition to being one of the major sponsors of the International Coastal Cleanup the company also provides free presentations for schools regarding marine life and environmental issues on Guam.

Population: History It was founded in 1974 in conjunction with the construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM), near the original village of Urgal, located on the river of the same name. The railway line connecting the Trans-Siberian Railway at Isvestokovaya to the nearby Chegdomyn coal fields had already run through the Urgal area since 1951, after an earlier construction project was dismantled before completion during World War II. A large junction station between the BAM and the old line was built, along with the settlement, by workers from the then Ukrainian SSR. As part of the BAM construction project, sections of the line were placed under the patronage of Komsomol brigades from different parts of the Soviet Union. In 1985, Novy Urgal was granted urban-type settlement status. 1989 saw the commencement of regular traffic between Tynda and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, after the completion of the railway a large proportion of the inhabitants left the settlement, its population dropping from 9,126 in 1989 to 6,779 in 2006.

The museum is operated and maintained by the Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation of New York and Asociata Memoralia Hebraica Nuşfalău - a Romanian NGO, with the support of the Claims Conference, Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania, among other philanthropic and pedagogical partners. History The old synagogue of Șimleu Silvaniei (Szilágysomlyó) was erected in 1876. During the height of its use, the synagogue was used for worship and religious ceremonies by Jewish families from the city of Șimleu Silvaniei as well as surrounding villages such as Giurtelecu Şimleului (Somlyógyőrtelek) and Nuşfalău (Szilágynagyfalu). In May/June 1944, when the city was part of Hungary (as a consequence of the territorial agreement known as the Second Vienna Award), the area's Jewish population was forced out of their homes into the brutal Cehei ghetto and from there packed into cattle cars and transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Over 160,000 Jews from the region perished.The Holocaust in Northern Transylvania Of those few remaining Jews who survived the Holocaust and remained in Romania (which, under the Paris Peace Treaties, regained Northern Transylvania), the last Jewish family emigrated from the region during the mid-1960s, while the country was still under Communist rule. The loss of its congregation left the Synagogue to fate, decaying silently over time. Through the inspiration of Mihaela Gross, New York Architect Adam Aaron Wapniak became interested in the abandoned synagogue's restoration on a 2003 visit, sparking the interest of Dr. Alex Hecht; a New York dentist and son of Holocaust survivors Zoltan and Stefania Hecht, native to the nearby village of Nuşfalău. Together, they launched a vigorous campaign driving the restoration project. Their efforts contributed to raising funds to complete construction, establishing educational criterion, and supported pedagogical training for the regional school systems. The Museum now functions as an educational hub and essential resource for Holocaust Education in the region. Guided tours tailored to students are offered daily by other students, project being started by Natalia Gross, a high school student back then. The museum centerpiece is the synagogue originally built in 1876.Sholam, Alex, Romania Opens Shoah Museum , Totally Jewish Holocaust Education Under communism, official history in Romania taught that Germans were the sole perpetrators of the Holocaust, thereby ignoring the role of the Romanian government in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews and tens of thousands of Roma (Gypsies), from the historical regions of Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and Transnistria, during the World War II. After the fall of communism in 1989, wartime leader Ion Antonescu was semi-rehabilitated and hailed as a hero by some Romanians, with monuments being erected across the country to honor the former dictator.Holocaust and Genocide Studies, The Use and Abuse of the Holocaust: Historiography and Politics in MoldovaDumitru Holocaust and Genocide Studies.2008; 22: 49-73 Following 15 years of setbacks, in November 2004, after the presentation of the Wiesel International Commission’s report to the Romanian President, Romania finally acknowledged in an official position the full dimensions of the Romanian Holocaust. Romanian authorities have begun efforts to educate the public about the Holocaust, it also banned pro-Nazi propaganda and the cult of war criminals. In March 2005, the newly elected government under President Traian Basescu and PM Calin Popescu Tariceanu made a firm commitment to implement the Wiesel Holocaust Commission’s recommendations on educating Romanians about the Holocaust and fighting racism in society.Speech given by Mr. ION ILIESCU, President of Romania, October 12, 2004 Thus, the Romanian authorities have taken decisive steps towards the implementation of a unitary national curriculum concerning Holocaust education. (Although Holocaust education was introduced as a mandatory topic in pre-university curricula as of 1998, for a long time history textbooks have included little (if any), divergent, and often inaccurate information on the subject). Holocaust education has been mandatory in Romanian schools, covering 2–4 hours of material in the context of World War II. In 2004, Holocaust history also became an optional course. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, EDUCATION ON THE HOLOCAUST AND ON ANTI-SEMITISM: An Overview and Analysis of Educational Approaches According to an ITF study, the three main obstacles for Holocaust education facing the Ministry of Education and Research (MEC), in Romania are: lack of information on the topic, lack of diversity of information, and too few teachers trained to teach the topic. Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education Remembrance and Research This shift in policy paved the way for the Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum to exercise its commitment to its educational program. In cooperation with the ministry of Education, the first ever Holocaust Education Olympiad was hosted at the Museum. The First Holocaust Remembrance Olympiad In the Spring of 2008, the Museum inaugurated the Şimleu Silvaniei Multicultural Holocaust Education and Research Center; used to host lectures and seminars on the subject, with programs geared to students, teachers and academics. The teacher program encourages and helps teachers to sensitively incorporate the subject of the Holocaust into their curriculum. a discipline sorely lacking in Romania's school system.

Early years Fresh out of John Glenn High School in Norwalk, California, Moore was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 28th round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. Seven months later, while a student at Cerritos College, the New York Mets drafted him in the tenth round of the January 1967 Secondary draft, and he signed. While a student at Cerritos, Moore toiled around in the lower levels of the Mets' farm system, going 14-18 with a 3.59 earned run average (ERA) until he had a standout season with the Mets' triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides. Moore went 11-5 with a 2.80 ERA to earn a September call-up to the big league club. Major league careerNew York Mets= Moore made his Major League debut in \\"mop up duty\\" following a poor outing by Gary Gentry. With the Mets already trailing 6-0 to the Chicago Cubs, he took the mound in the third inning. Moore successfully stopped the bleeding until the sixth inning. With one out, Billy Williams hit a home run. The next two batters followed with a double and a triple. A sacrifice fly and a ground out to the pitcher later, Moore escaped the inning a single shy of giving up a cycle. He was far more successful in his second appearance, when he pitched two innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and only surrendered one single. Moore made his first start on October 2, and was in line for the 1-0 win when he exited the game in the eighth inning with one out, and runners on first and third. Former minor league teammate Ken Singleton, now with the Montreal Expos, drove in the tying run to give Moore the no-decision. Moore spent most of with Tidewater, with the exception of a brief call-up in May for the injury-riddled club. He suffered his first career loss against the San Francisco Giants in his last outing before returning to Tidewater. Following a season spent entirely at Tidewater, Moore was traded by the Mets, along with Ray Sadecki, to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joe Torre. =St. Louis Cardinals= Cardinal manager Red Schoendienst did not seem to have much faith in Moore, as he was used strictly in mop up duty for the entirety of his two month stay with the club. Despite a respectable 3.86 ERA posted during his tenure in St. Louis, every time he was called upon to pitch, the Redbirds were already losing, and usually by several runs. On June 4, , the St. Louis sent Moore and Ed Brinkman to the Texas Rangers for Willie Davis. =Texas Rangers= Moore had a similar role in Texas; however, after pitching innings over five appearances, and only allowing one earned run, he was given more responsibility. Moore entered a save situation on July 28, but was unable to convert, and ended up being credited with the loss. A week later, despite pitching well, he suffered a hard luck loss on his record against the California Angels, and once again found himself in mop up duty for the remainder of the season. Moore spent all of with the Rangers' triple A affiliate, the Sacramento Solons. =Seattle Mariners= On October 24, 1976 Moore‘s contract was purchased by the expansion Seattle Mariners. His first appearance for the M's came on April 8, with the opportunity to save the franchise's first win. Ineffectiveness and sloppy play on the field prevented that from happening; however, Seattle did manage to mount a comeback in the ninth inning for the historic victory. On April 13, Moore earned his first career win. He entered an extra innings game against the Minnesota Twins with the bases loaded, and only one out. Moore retired the next two batters to end the threat, and pitched two more scoreless innings. In the bottom of the thirteenth, Steve Braun drove in Larry Milbourne with the winning run for the Mariners. Moore lost his only start with Seattle. Facing the Twins, he only allowed two hits through his first four innings. Moore then allowed a lone run in each of the fifth and sixth innings, before the wheels fell off in the seventh. On May 12, he earned his second, and final, career win, by defeating the New York Yankees. Moore would make just one more appearance before spending the rest of the season in the minors. After the season, Moore and Carlos López were dealt to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Parrott, but Moore was cut during Spring training . Through four MLB seasons, his career statistics posted include making 42 game appearances, going 2-4, with 40 strikeouts, 40 walks, and a 5.40 ERA, in 88 innings pitched.

It destroyed the Wall Street building in less than 20 minutes, killing at least fifty of the more than 100 people inside. Though not as deadly as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, it put even more pressure on New York officials to strengthen life safety codes, increase funding for more inspectors, and increase penalties for violations. Fire The Binghamton Clothing Company was located in a former cigar factory on Wall Street, and produced men's overalls. The employees, mostly young women, were hard at work in the four-story building on that Tuesday afternoon. The exact number of workers is uncertain; early reports claimed as many as 150 were working, but after a few days the number settled between 110 and 125. Almost all the doors and windows were open due to the July heat, and a strong wind was blowing. Even so, the building was unusually hot. One of the employees noticed it at about 1 pm, and claimed she smelled smoke an hour later. The fire likely began after lunch when an employee carelessly tossed a cigarette down into the second floor stairwell, where it landed on a pile of highly flammable plush material on the first floor. The high wind and the great ventilation provided by the open windows and doors combined to start a conflagration. The stairways quickly became chimneys for the smoke and flames, leading to the greatest loss of life on the third and fourth floors. A fire alarm sounded at about 2:30 but many workers, lightly clothed due to the summer heat, initially refused to take the fire alarm seriously, believing it to be just another of the frequent fire drills. Unlike the serial rings of the fire drill gong, the actual alarm was sounding continuously, which may have confused some workers. Nellie Connor was recognized for her efforts to save the lives of her co-workers. Employed by the company for 31 years, Nellie was looked upon as a mother figure by many of the girls at the factory. Although she did her best to hurry others out of the building, Nellie herself never made it out alive. A 16-year company foreman, Sidney Dimmock, was credited with carrying two women to safety before returning to the building to attempt to rescue others from the flames. He did not escape the smoke and flames. Reed Freeman, owner of the company, attempted to douse the flames with buckets of water, to no avail. He and his wife were able to raise the alarm and escaped along with many of the workers on the first and second floors. At the time of the fire, the nearest fire company was busy on another call. By the time the Binghamton Fire Department arrived, the heat from the fire was so intense they were unable to get anywhere close to the building to attempt rescue. The structure was completely consumed and was a total loss by 4 pm, about 20 minutes after the first report of smoke. Firefighters were kept busy trying to save nearby structures that were endangered by flames fed by the steady breeze. Their efforts were hindered by low water pressure due to a continuing drought. The stone exterior of the post office building on Wall Street suffered severe scorching from the fire. Aftermath In the coming days, thousands of mourners attended the funeral procession, and some of the remains, charred beyond recognition, were placed in a common grave at Spring Forest Cemetery.Aswad, E. and Meredith, S.: Broome County 1850-1940, page 34. Arcadia Publishing, 2002. The fire is the largest loss of life from a single event to take place in Binghamton. A memorial to the victims is located in Spring Forest Cemetery, and a memorial plaque on Wall Street marks the location of the tragic fire.

Carlino Brothers  Pete and Sam Carlino were southern Colorado's most notorious bootleggers. From 1922 to 1931, they controlled most of the bootlegging territories south of Denver. By the late 1920s, the Carlino brothers had moved to Denver and planned on expanding their liquor empire to encompass the entire state of Colorado. On January 25, 1931, Denver bootlegger Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Roma set up a \\"Bootleggers Convention\\" to avert an all-out war between the Carlinos and the other bootleggers. Police arrested 29 people at the meeting; all but one of these had prior arrests. Pete Carlino and the others were charged but released; Roma was not at the meeting. District Attorney Carr publicly condemned Mayor Stapleton for not prosecuting the bootleggers. On March 17, 1931, Pete Carlino's opulent home at 3357 Federal Boulevard exploded. Initially, police suspected it was members of rival gangs who had set the blast. Federal undercover agent Lawrence Baldesareli informed police that it had been Pete Carlino himself who had planned the arson, in order to collect the insurance money for the blast. His empire was flagging and he was quickly running out of money. Joe Petralia, Chris Murkuri, and Carlino's cousin Dan Colletti were convicted for setting the blast. On May 8, 1931, Sam Carlino was killed in his home by Bruno Mauro. Carlino cousin James Colletti was wounded in the attack but survived. Sam Carlino's wife and Colletti initially informed police that Mauro was the shooter. When the trial approached, Colletti had fled the area and Mrs. Carlino refused to testify in court against Mauro for fear for her family's lives. After his brother's assassination, Pete Carlino went into hiding. According to police testimony on an unrelated matter, Lucille Crupi claimed that she met Carlino while in Milwaukee in early June 1931. She claimed that he was dropping off a shipment of booze and was picking up another load to return to Colorado. On June 19, 1931, Carlino was captured hiding in his cousin's farmhouse outside Pueblo. On June 25, 1931. Joe Roma posted Pete Carlino's $5,000 bond, using his house as collateral. Contrary to popular belief, Roma and Carlino were not enemies; rather, they had a working relationship that spanned over eight years. On September 10, 1931, Pete Carlino was killed, shot twice in the back and once in the head at close range. He was on his way to visit Joe Petralia at the prison in Canon City. Carlino's body was placed under the Siloam Road bridge just outside Pueblo. After two days, the body had not been discovered so the killers returned and dragged it onto the road. An anonymous phone call made to Carlino's wife informed her where the body could be found. This ended the Carlinos' reign of control of the Colorado bootlegging era.  Joseph Roma  Guissepi Roma became Joseph Roma. In the prohibition era from 1920 to 1933, the crime families formed all over the country to profit from bootlegging. Operating from his grocery store as a front business, Roma became the de facto boss of criminal activity in Denver.  Smaldone Brothers  The three brothers, Eugene, Clyde, and Clarence owned and operated Gaetano's Italian restaurant, a popular spot in north Denver, for years. The rise of the family began in 1933 after crime boss bootlegger Joe Roma was found riddled by seven bullets in the front parlor of his North Denver home. Six of the shots were to Roma's head. His wife, Nettie, found him slumped in his favorite overstuffed chair.Smaldone, The Untold Story of an American Crime Family, by Dick Kreck The Smaldones were questioned but not charged. = Clyde Smaldone = Clyde was born in 1906; his lengthy criminal record began with a burglary charge in 1920. He served 18 months in Leavenworth for bootlegging in 1933. Three years later he served time for the attempted bombing murder of a local man named Leon Barnes. Paroled in 1949, he confessed to paying protection money for his Central City gambling enterprises. In 1953, Clyde and Eugene made headlines after a publicized raid of one of their gambling dens in Brighton, Colorado. Later that year both brothers were found guilty of jury tampering, fined $24,000 each, and sentenced to 60 years in prison. After spending 13 months in jail, the brothers received a new trial. Clyde pleaded guilty to a lesser tampering charge and was sentenced to 12 years and fined $10,000. He was paroled in 1962. In 1967, Clyde and several others, including Eugene's son, were arrested on gambling charges and for running a $100,000-a-week bookmaking operation. Clyde died at the Cedars Nursing Home at the age of 91, in January 1998. His son told reporters that despite his father's criminal past, he had a soft side and donated to local orphanages, churches, and schools. = Eugene Smaldone = Eugene was recognized as Northern Colorado's leading crime figure and described as the patriarch of the Denver Crime Family. Although suspected of taking part in, or being behind, several killings, Eugene was never indicted for murder. Eugene's arrest record showed entries for auto theft, bootlegging and income tax evasion. A local law official described Eugene as \\"the schoolteacher type. He wore glasses. Very polite. Very civil.\\" His final prison sentence was in 1983. The charges were for operating a loan shark business out of Gaetano's. Eugene along with Clarence, and a nephew, Paul Clyde \\"Fat Paulie\\" Villano, pleaded guilty to the charges which also included illegal gun possession. Eugene Smaldone died in March 1992 of a heart attack at the age of 81. After Eugene's funeral, a relative wrote to the Denver newspapers complaining of the pain the media had caused the family and pleaded to be left alone. = Clarence Smaldone = Clarence was born in 1916, he died in 2006, and was considered the underboss of a two-member mob family. In 1991, Clarence was released from a Fort Worth prison hospital after serving eight years for the 1983 loan sharking conviction. The FBI had no one listed as boss at this time.  Current status  In November 2006, Denver Boss Clarence \\"Chauncey\\" Smaldone died. Eugene Smaldone's grandson, also named Eugene Smaldone, is the last surviving member of the Smaldone crime family. Although not substantiated by officials, rumors as recent as 2016 have suggested the existence of the Smaldone Family in various mountain towns in Colorado.

Music career Maximum Bob and his friend, guitarist Buckethead started a musical collaboration in 1987 that would eventually take the name Deli Creeps. The Deli Creeps played live at Madame Wong\\"s West in 1988. Maximum Bob first attracted wide public attention when performing backup vocals for the band Mr. Bungle. This was a guest appearance, recording on only one album with them, their debut album Mr. Bungle in 1991. During this time, he was still the full-time lead singer for the Deli Creeps, living in San Francisco and playing live often with Mr. Bungle, Sausage, Limbomaniacs and other successful acts in the Bay Area. Combining hard rock with shock factors based on the Sawyer family from the movie The Texas Chain Saw massacre, they played shows to dumbfounded audiences that slowly grew to a rabid following.Mr. Bungle/Deli Creeps show poster, a poster for one of their early shows with Mr. Bungle.

Retrieved 6 October 2019. Performance style Maximum Bob is known for his unorthodox behavior on stage. Among the things he has done, he has stopped songs to ask the audience a question (though it usually doesn't interrupt the overall flow of the song), erratically moving around on the stage making strange gestures and noises, and making extremely dark and sexual jokes with the audience, usually about sex and murder. These all play into the dark and psychotic theme of the band. He also uses a form of recitative with onomatopoeic stuttering as part of the act. Musical style Maximum Bob uses a wide range, using deep and high pitched singing. He usually delivers lyrics in either slow short sections or long fast spoken segments in a deep bass range. His delivery of the chorus uses either deep or high pitched singing or, in studio recorded material, both at the same time, usually creating octaves.  Personal life  Prior to a surprise appearance on the reality show Trick My Trucker, little to nothing was known about Barnum's past, apart from the musical projects he had been involved with. Before the album Enter the Chicken, the only album that refers to him by his birthname, he was only known by his stage name, and remains out of the public eye. Despite this, the official biography of Buckethead states that Maximum Bob was the one who took Buckethead in. Barnum is not to be confused with artist Robert L. Barnum. =Appearance on CMT/Trick my Trucker= In 2007, Barnum was a selected contestant on the fourth episode of the CMT reality series Trick My Trucker. During the show, many of the unknown elements of his life were revealed and made public. It was revealed that he currently lives in Hesperia, California with his wife of six years (as of 2007) Angelique, and their three children, however his current career was never mentioned. The episode also never mentions his work as a musician, other than an allusion to it when host Bob Guiney tells the audience to \\"see if spending time with us has brought him back to rock star status\\".

He was a four-year starter and was selected as both the captain and Most Valuable Player of the National Champion 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team. High school A native of Flint, Michigan, Tomasi attended Flint Northern High School. In 1944, at age 16, the 5 foot, 8 inch, 178 pound Tomasi was selected by the Associated Press to its All-Michigan football team at the guard position. University of Michigan In 1945, Tomasi enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played both football for Fritz Crisler and baseball for Ray Fischer. Tomasi was a four-year starter for the 1945, 1946, 1947 and 1948 Michigan Wolverines football teams that won 23 straight games (including undefeated seasons in 1947 and 1948), defeated USC, 49-0, in the 1948 Rose Bowl. During his sophomore year, Tomasi's photograph was published in newspapers across the country with a caption calling him \\"a charging block of granite for the Michigan Wolverines,\\" and he was selected as a second-team All-Big Ten guard by the conference coaches. Before the 1947 season got underway, one writer noted that Tomasi \\"is back for more and will give anyone a race for All-America honors.\\" The 1947 Michigan Wolverines team completed the season undefeated. The Wolverines outscored their opponents 394-53, and Coach Fritz Crisler credited Tomasi \\"for much of his team's offensive punch.\\" Tomasi was again named to the second-team All-Big Ten team. Tomasi's blocking in the 1948 Rose Bowl helped Michigan outscore the USC Trojans 49-0, and in March 1948, his teammates elected him to be captain of the 1948 team—the first time a guard had been selected as Michigan's captain in 33 years. In 1948, Tomasi was both team captain and one of the top performers on Michigan's second consecutive undefeated team. In October 1948, one columnist described Tomasi's role as follows: > \\"As long as Michigan has operatives like Dominic Tomasi, the hard-hitting > guard who captains the team, the Wolverines will give a good account of > themselves. Tomasi isn't big as linemen of the Western Conference run, but > he is one of the very best guards in intercollegiate circles. He stands only > five, ten and weighs 180 pounds, tops, yet he has been a regular since he > began playing as a 17-year-old freshman. Extremely fast, and a deadly > blocker, 'Tommy' is the key man of the Wolverine offense. His ability to > 'turn corners' at full speed and block with split-second precision means as > much yardage to Michigan as if he were an All-America ball carrier. Tomasi > is also an outstanding second baseman on Michigan's championship baseball > team and his work has attracted several big league scouts. As in football, > he has been a regular since 1946. He shows the same hustle and keen > competitive instinct on the diamond as he does on the gridiron.\\" The 1948 Wolverine team was undefeated for the second consecutive season and was selected as the National Championship team in the final Associated Press poll. At the conclusion of the 1948 season, Tomasi was selected as the team's Most Valuable Player, a first-team All-Big Ten guard, and a third-team All- American by the Football Writers Association of America, and the Central Press Association and Newspaper Enterprise Association.http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/awards/allamerica/alltime.pdf Later years In 1949, Tomasi passed on a chance to play professional football for the Chicago Bears and instead joined Michigan's coaching staff as a line coach. He also played baseball in the Northern loop, batting .340 and hitting 27 home runs. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1994. The University of Michigan Club of Greater Flint awards an annual Dominic Tomasi Scholarship to a resident of Genesee County, Michigan who played a varsity sport and will attend the University of Michigan as a full-time undergraduate student.

It is located in the valley of the Chegdomyn River, near its confluence with the Urgal. Chegdomyn is located about northwest of the krai's administrative center of Khabarovsk. Climate Chegdomyn has a monsoon- influenced humid continental/subarctic climate (Köppen Dwb/Dwc) with severely cold, dry winters and very warm, rainy summers. Temperatures in the area of the city typically change by over over the course of the year, with a daily average of in January, compared to in July. History It was founded in 1939, with the beginning of black coal mining in the area. At the same time, construction of a branch line from the Trans- Siberian Railway at Isvestkovaya to Chegdomyn was begun, although it was dismantled during World War II and its tracks reused in construction projects closer to the front. After the end of the war, the railway was rebuilt, opening in 1951. Coal mining resumed in 1948, and Chegdomyn was granted urban- type settlement status in 1949.

Alling Kloster was located north of Silkeborg in the parish of Svostrup in Viborg County.  History  Alling Abbey was built at the lower end of Alling Lake sometime before 1250. There was a connection between the closure of the monastery at Vejerslev in 1231 and the building of the abbey at Alling which was partially filled with monks from Vejerslev. The constructed abbey is mentioned first in 1250. The abbey was constructed in the familiar pattern. Three ranges adjoined St. Hans Church forming a four-sided enclosure to separate the monks from the world. The east range contained the chapter hall and dormitory. The north range was the refectory, work area, perhaps scriptorium, and cellars for storage. The west range housed the lay brothers who lived in the abbey and performed much of the worldly work required to keep the monastery operating. To the south was St. Hans Church, with a single nave, choir and angular apse. Since the abbey was isolated from any town, the church was used only by the monks or occasional travellers. Women were not permitted, except on holy days. A canal was dug from Grønbæk to bring fresh water to the monastery and then carry it off to Alling Lake. Over the centuries the abbey came into possession of many farms and owned the rights to most of the churches in the area. For much of the time, the abbey had running disputes with the Bishops of Aarhus over income properties. Post Reformation The Danish Reformation in 1536 brought all religious institutions and their income properties to the crown. In 1538 the last Abbot, Hans Lauridsen, turned the keys over to Johannes Hŏcken, a secular nobleman (lensmand) to look after the king's interest in the property. He then took off his habit and became the first Lutheran priest in Grønbæk and Svostrup parishes. The monks were permitted to remain for a time until the abbey was closed sometime before 1540. The property was mortgaged to Johan Hŏcken in 1539 and 1543. The mortgage was redeemed by Jakob Berthelsen, bailiff of Silkeborg Castle (Silkeborg Slot) in 1573 and the entire abbey was razed for the building materials that could be sold from the site. The archives of the abbey were moved to Silkeborg Castle, inventoried in the late 16th century, and then disappeared. A few letters between abbots and other church leaders exist in the State Archive. Excavations Several excavations identified the abbey's precise location, so that it has been completely mapped. The ruins of the monastery were exposed through archaeological investigations conducted by the National Museum of Denmark in 1894 and 1942. In 1989 the monastery's floor plan was clarified with protective turf ramparts, which now hide the otherwise exposed masonry. The site has been protected as a national historic location since 1901. Portions of the foundation have been left exposed so visitors can see how the abbey was laid out. ReferencesOther Sources  *Martin Berntson (2003) Klostren och reformationen.

The aim of its founders was to aid a number of governmental agencies and through the efforts of liberal head of state, Valentín Gómez Farías. It was the first geographical society in the Americas and the fourth in the world. From the beginning, the scope of projects was very broad, covering not only the physiography of the territory but also its natural resources and their potential for development. Also included in their study was the nature of the population, its size, age distribution, ethnic and linguistic makeup. One of the first publications was in 1850, the work of geographer , followed by an atlas of the republic, started in 1841 and completed in 1850, but not published for several years due to lack of funds. Among the achievements of the Society were: * Initiatives within the Mexican government to issue laws providing a process for determining the official names of cities and towns. * Promoted legislation for the care of forests and conservation of archaeological monuments as a national priority. * Produced a report on the metric system, which allowed Mexico to be among the first countries in Latin America to adopt it. * Proposed the laying out of a telegraph system for Mexico City. * Sponsoring the publication of the Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística (Bulletin of the Society) for the dissemination of all the reports and data that the Society accumulated. Currently the Society contributes to the research, analysis and understanding of the major problems of Mexico through its 55 specialized academies and local societies involved in the various Mexican states.

He was the head of the psychology department at Stanford and later dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences there, continued the long- term I.Q. studies of Lewis Madison Terman at Stanford, and authored many pivotal papers and books on various aspects of psychology. Early life He was born in Palo Alto, California to Jesse Brundage Sears, a professor at Stanford University, and Stella Louise (Richardson) Sears. As a child Sears attended Palo Alto Union High School. He received his Artium Baccalaureus degree from Stanford in 1929 and a Ph. D. from Yale University in 1932. He was married on June 25, 1932 to Pauline Kirkpatrick Snedden, who co-authored a book with him and with whom he shared APA gold medal for achievement in psychology late in their lives. Professional life After leaving Yale, Sears was first an instructor in psychology at the University of Illinois from 1932 to 1936 and at the same time was a clinical psychologist at the Institute for Juvenile Research there. He returned to Yale as an associate professor of psychology in 1936 and remained there until 1942. From 1942 until 1949 he was director of the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station at the University of Iowa. Sears focused on the personalities of children and the different socialization pressure parents place on their child. He also said that the root of personalities in children stemmed from their family. Sears became the first person to have the child’s own parent present in the experiments conducted. He wrote two books, Patterns of Child Rearing (1957) and Identification and Child Rearing (1965), where he explained some of his findings on the personality of a child. Sears established many research centers and institutions that allowed students and colleagues to study more. One of Sears’ biggest achievements was founding the Bing Nursery School. This was a model preschool with a research facility for the child development unit at Stanford. From 1949 until 1953 he directed the Laboratory of Human Development at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In 1953 Sears returned to Stanford where he served as chair of the Psychology department until 1961, Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences from 1961 to 1970, and David Starr Jordan Professor of Psychology from 1970 until 1975. At Stanford, Sears did studies using the Terman sample of gifted children. He was very involved in follow-up studies of the group of gifted children that had begun by Lewis Terman in 1922. He had taken on the responsibility of working with these individuals after Terman's death in 1956. Sears found a national planning committee that investigated later maturity in these children. He said that the earlier records could predict development in the later years of life. He followed 700 people over 60 years. He did this with the help of his systematic recording that he created to capture large amounts of previously unexamined material and coded it. This was the first archive in the history of psychology. Many psychologists and researchers today use this method. Robert and his wife, Pauline, published a set of papers on the late-life careers of gifted children based on the Terman study. These papers were named, The Gifted in Later Maturity. Sears was president of the American Psychological Association in 1951.

He was an Irish Republican Army (IRA) officer in his native County Mayo during the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War. Subsequently, he was a Sinn Féin and later Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo South. Guerrilla leader Michael Kilroy was born in Derrylahan townland, Newport, County Mayo on 14 September 1884. He was the son of Edward and Matilda Kilroy and one of ten in the family. He was a carpenter and coachbuilder and learned his trade in Claremorris when he was 16 years and lodged with the Stratford Family in Mount Street, Claremorris. He was married to Ann Leonard of Crossmolina and they had eight in family. As a child he was raised with his maternal grandmother who was also Kilroy in the townland of Carrickaneady, Newport and went to school in Culmore in the 1890s where he was greatly influenced by the nationalistically minded Martin Casey, the Head Master. Mr. Casey instilled in his pupils a great love of Irish history that would remain with Kilroy all his life. A booklet on the life of Michael Kilroy was published in 2008, Michael Kilroy – A Life 1884 – 1962 and is available in Mayo County Libraries. The IRA in West Mayo was relatively quiet until January 1921, when Michael Kilroy, who was described as, \\"a puritanical and ascetic blacksmith\\"Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p134 took over command of the brigade after the previous leader Thomas Derrig was arrested by the British. There were four Battalions in the West Mayo Brigade, The First Battalion was in Castlebar, the Second Battalion was in Newport, the Third Battalion was in Westport and the Fourth Battalion was in Louisburgh. In his earlier career with the Movement for Independence, Kilroy had been an organiser for the IRB in the west and had been one of the founder members of the Volunteer Company in Newport in February 1914 and was the O/C and also Quarter Master of the Mayo Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. Kilroy formed a flying column of 40–50 men to carry out attacks on British forces in the area. On 6 May 1921, they suffered a reverse at Islandeady, when a British patrol came upon the IRA men cutting a road, 3 IRA members were killed and 2 captured. Another setback was to follow; at the Kilmeena ambush on 19 May 1921, 6 IRA men were killed and 7 wounded. One Royal Irish Constabulary and one Black and Tans policemen were also killed in the action. After the ambush at Kilmeena the column retreated to the hill country of Skirdagh to the north east of Newport where they were forced to retreat when a patrol from Newport came into the village the gallant men of the West Mayo Brigade held them off and the wounded were got away to safety. This was on 23 May 1921 and the column was hidden in the hills of the Nephin range and in the Glenisland area until the RIC, Tans and the Border regiment lifted the cordon. One volunteer Jim Browne from Drumgarve, Kilmeena was killed at Skirdagh and a number of the RIC including a District Inspector was killed. It was a crucial week in the survival of the column because they were attacked from the rear at Kilmeena and could have been wiped out during this action. The Crown forces burned houses including the home of Michael Kilroy on 20 May 1921 and the same would happen after the Carrowkennedy Ambush in June 1921. The south west Mayo area suffered greatly during these months of 1921 due to the ambushes. On 2 June 1921 in an action at Carrowkennedy, they killed 8 Tans and captured 16 members of the RIC along with a Lewis Machine gun and rifles and ammunition. The ambush began after the convoy or patrol left Darby Hastings pub at Carrowkennedy and one of the column fired early hitting the driver of the first vehicle and after a protracted period of firing in which a number of Tans were killed, an explosion in one of the lorries brought an end to the firing. Two of the wounded Tans died later. The 16 RIC referred to earlier surrendered in a nearby cottage. The Column went on the run for the next six weeks until the Truce. The first casualty in the ambush was District Inspector Stevenson. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 and sided with the Anti- Treaty IRA during the Civil War with the Irish Free State forces in 1922–23. He served on the Army Executive of the IRA in this period. In October 1922 he was appointed O/C of the 4th Western Division and later the Western Command in September 1922, the 4th Western Division covered North Mayo, West Mayo and West Connemara. In the early months of the Civil War, he and his men dominated the West Mayo area and successfully ambushed Free State Army troops on several occasions. The Government forces also had to evacuate their garrison at Newport and carried out a successful attack on Clifden, capturing the Army post there on 29 October 1922. They also captured Ballina in September 1922. They fought a battle at Glenamoy on 16 September 1922 where 6 Free State Troops were killed and five wounded, one Republican Officer was wounded. However the Free State then sent an expedition to the North Mayo/Connemara area, which succeeded after some fighting, in capturing Michael Kilroy and many of his men at Carrowbeg House on 23 November 1922. Kilroy was badly wounded and interned at Athlone and Mountjoy where he went on Hunger Strike and would escape in late 1923 when the Civil War was over. Politician Kilroy entered politics in August 1923 while still in jail. He was elected for the Republicans for South Mayo but due to the Oath of Allegiance he did not take his seat. Michael Kilroy was elected for Fianna Fáil in South Mayo in June 1927 and would be TD for South Mayo until 1937 when he lost his seat when contesting the General election in North Mayo. He did not take his seat in the 4th Dáil due to Sinn Féin's abstentionist policy. He was the Chairman of Mayo County Council from 1934 to 1945, the longest-serving member in this position in the history of the Council. He retired from politics in 1945. From 1945 until his death on 23 December 1962 he was a Member of the Hospitals Commission. His funeral was one of the largest seen in Newport and along with many politicians, the then President Éamon de Valera was present. The graveside oration was given by his comrade and fellow TD Edward Moane from Westport. The Fianna Fáil Cumann in Newport is named in his honour and his son Peadar also was in local politics as a member of Mayo County Council. He was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD at the June 1927 general election. He was re- elected at the September 1927, 1932 and 1933 general elections. He lost his seat at the 1937 general election.

They are regarded as seed ferns because they are seed-bearing plants with fern-like leaves. Although at one time considered angiosperms because of their berry-like cupules, that hypothesis was later disproven. Nevertheless, some authorities consider them likely ancestors of angiosperms, whereas others consider angiosperms more likely derived from Glossopteridales. The origin of angiosperms remains an intriguing puzzle (see Evolutionary history of plants).  History  The first fossils identified in this order were discovered in the Middle Jurassic Gristhorpe bed of the Cloughton formation in Cayton Bay, Yorkshire – hence the name CAYTONiales. They have since been found in Mesozoic rocks all over world. It is likely that Caytoniales flourished in wetland areas, because they are often found with other moisture-loving plants such as horsetails in waterlogged paleosols. The first fossil Caytoniales were preserved as compressions in shale with excellent preservation of cuticles allowing study of cellular histology.  Description  The woody nature of associated stalks and preserved short shoots are evidence that Caytoniales were seasonally deciduous, shrubs and trees. Caytoniales had fertile branches with seed- bearing cupules . The ovules were located inside fleshy cupules with tough outer cuticle. Individual ovules had an apical tube called a micropylar canal, that allowed pollen to pass into the pollen chamber. The outer layers of the cupules were fleshy and fruit-like; it is possible this was to aid in animal dispersal. The cupules are 4-5mm in diameter and about 3 mm long (Fig 1-2), and resemble a blueberry. The extra protection of the reproductive organs gave rise to the idea that Caytoniales were predecessors to angiosperms, which have completely enclosed seeds. The pollen grains were small, between 25 and 30 μm in diameter. The size of the pollen grains supports the idea that they were wind-pollinated, and their bisaccate wings may have enabled entry into the seed by a pollination drop mechanism. In both respects they were like pollen of pine trees. They were produced in pollen sacs in coalesced groups of four, attached to branching structures. The pollen sacs hang off the structure in clusters, and are typically 2 cm in length. The most common and widespread part found fossilized are leaves of Sagenopteris (Fig. 3). These are compound leaves consisting of, usually, 4 leaflets arrayed in a palmate manner. The individual leaflets are up to 6 cm in length. The leaflets have anastomosing veins, like those of some ferns, but lacking orders of venation found in angiosperm leaves.  Relationship to Angiosperms  Caytonia was first described by Hamshaw Thomas in 1925. His close examination of the cupules led him to believe this was one of the earliest examples of angiosperms. He mistakenly thought the entire ovule was enclosed in the cupule, unlike typical gymnosperms. He worked meticulously, collecting and cleaning specimens to get the best understanding. He spent weeks boiling fruits in different solutions to try to make them resemble their living states. He proposed that the fruits contained a stigma with a funnel shaped opening in the center in which the pollen grains would get lodged. The entire pollen grain would not be able to enter into the ovule, a defining trait in angiosperms. This theory was disproved 1933 by Thomas' student Tom Harris, who studied the same reproductive organs and found different results. \\"Most of the fruits were obtained by dissolving in hydrofluoric acid a single very small fragment of shale collected from Cape Stewart\\" The maceration of the fruits dissolves the main cells wall and leave the cuticle and interior cell organs. This allowed Harris to look closely at the ovules located inside. Upon close inspection of the ovule, whole pollen grains were found inside the micropylar canal. This is typical of a gymnosperm reproduction, not an angiosperm. Presumably pollination was at an early stage of cupule and ovule development, before full inflation of the cupules. While Thomas's original idea led many scientist to believe that Caytoniales may have been angiosperms, Harris's further research disproved this theory. The enclosure of ovules in Caytoniales has nevertheless been considered an early stage in evolution of the angiosperm double integument, and the carpels formed from an elaboration of their stalk (Fig. 5). Other theories for the origin of angiosperms derive them from Glossopteridales (Fig.5), among other groups (see Evolutionary history of plants).

William \\"Will\\" Mailly (1871–1912) was an American socialist political functionary, journalist, and trade union activist. He is best remembered as the second National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America and as the first managing editor of the socialist daily newspaper, the New York Call. BiographyEarly years= William Mailly was born November 22, 1871 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Mailly's parents emigrated to Liverpool, England when the boy was 2, and so the American-born Mailly was raised in English schools — an extremely rare pattern of emigration for an American radical activist.A close parallel may be found in the biography of Leonard D. Abbott, who was born in Liverpool of American parents, with him only arriving in America around the age of maturity. The young Will worked in Liverpool from a very early age as an errand boy.\\"William Mailly,\\" The Socialist [Seattle], whole no. 132 (February 15, 1903), pg. 3. Mailly returned to the United States in July 1889, working briefly in a brickyard and on a railway before moving to Alabama in 1890 to take up work as a coal miner. Mailly became involved in the trade union movement as a member of the United Mine Workers of America in 1893.William D.P. Bliss with Rudolph M. Binder (eds.), The New Cyclopedia of Social Reform. New edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1908; pg. 745. Mailly took part in a coal strike in 1894, activity which resulted in his blacklisting from the Alabama coal mines. =Political career= William Mailly as he appeared in a drawing in the Appeal to Reason in 1903. Following his blacklisting from the mines, Mailly began to work as an organizer on behalf of the UMWA and the Socialist Party of America. Mailly was first a member of the People's Party, serving as a delegate to the Alabama state convention of that party and to its national convention in 1894.William M. Feigenbaum, \\"Socialist Profiles: No. 13, William Mailly,\\" The New Leader, vol. 15, no. 11 (March 18, 1933), pp. 8-9. Mailly turned his hand to labor journalism, taking a job as Associate Editor of the Birmingham Labor Advocate in May 1895, and serving at that post for about a year. Thereafter he moved to Nashville, Tennessee. In 1896, he joined the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), but his stay in that organization proved to be short-lived, as he left the SLP in July of the subsequent year to join the Social Democracy of America, an organization which included Victor L. Berger and Eugene V. Debs. Mailly organized a branch of the Social Democracy in July 1897 and was a delegate from Alabama to the 1898 Convention of this organization. From there Mailly moved to the socialist enclave of Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he served as secretary of the SDP's state and municipal campaign committees. Mailly also worked as the Editor of the Haverhill Social Democrat in 1898. He was elected State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Massachusetts in 1902. After his time in Massachusetts, Mailly moved on to New York City, remaining engaged in politics there. He was a founding member of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1901. That same year he attended the Annual Convention of the American Federation of Labor.\\"Socialists Who Attended the Convention of the American Federation of Labor: Scranton, December 1901,\\" The Comrade (New York), January 1902, pg. 117. The January 1903 meeting of the governing National Committee of the SPA elected Mailly as the new Nati Secretary of the party and he assumed these duties the following month.\\"National Office News: William Mailly,\\" Cleveland Socialist, whole no. 47 (September 14, 1912), pg. 3. The same meeting moved the headquarters of the party to Omaha, Nebraska, and so Mailly moved there forthwith. Mailly was reelected as National Secretary of the Socialist Party in 1904 and continued in that position until 1905. After declining to run for National Secretary in 1905, Mailly went to work for the Left Wing Socialist Hermon F. Titus as Business Manager of The Socialist, Titus' weekly which he had recently relocated to Toledo, Ohio from Washington state. Mailly left that publication sometime around the first of June 1906, thereafter moving to New York City.\\"Biggest and Best Socialist Convention Held in New York,\\" The Worker, vol. 16, no. 10 (June 9, 1906), pg. 1. Mailly also served as a member of the National Executive Committee of the SPA from 1905 to 1906. Mailly finished up his life back in New York City, first as Associate Editor of the socialist weekly The Worker (1906–1907) before becoming Managing Editor of its successor the New York Call (1908–1909).William M. Fiegenbaum, The New York Call: Ten Years of Service, 1908-1918. New York: New York Call, 1918; pg. 18. He then moved to the mass- circulation monthly The Metropolitan Magazine where he was to contribute an article each month on the topic of socialism. =Death and legacy= Shortly after his move to The Metropolitan Magazine, Will Mailly's health began to fail. Will Mailly died September 4, 1912, at the age of 40. Mailly was survived by his wife, Bertha Howell Mailly, whom he married in 1898.

Early life Hutchinson, better known as the Mad Master and Mad Doctor of Edinburgh Castle, was born in Scotland in 1733 where he is believed to have studied medicine. Criminal career In the 1760s, he came to Jamaica to head an estate called Edinburgh Castle. He was said to have legally obtained the house (now a ruin) but to have maintained his group of cattle through the theft of strays from neighbors. This would not be the only accusation made of Hutchinson. Shortly after Hutchinson's arrival in Jamaica, travelers began to disappear, and suspicion started to mount. For many miles, Edinburgh Castle was the only populated location on the way from Saint Ann's Bay, and, not knowing that they would become the target of Hutchinson's rifle, travelers would rest at the castle, only to succumb to the Mad Doctor's attack. Hutchinson murdered for pure sport, what may be described as a thrill killing, as passers-by from all races, shapes, sizes, and incomes were fair game. What is true about Hutchinson's killings is debatable. He would shoot lone travelers and was said to feed on the flow of his victims' blood as well as dismember them. He or, according to some sources, his slaves would then toss the remains in a cotton tree or a sinkhole for animals to feast on. That sinkhole became known as Hutchinson's Hole. At the height of his villainy, he would invite guests to his castle to be entertained before killing them. Capture Hutchinson's reputation for debauchery made him notable as many would avoid him out of fear. His slaves' tales of terrible treatment and the gruesome details of the murders made him legendary. This is why he was allowed to roam free for a time, until he shot an English soldier by the name of John Calendar, who attempted to apprehend Hutchinson. After Hutchinson shot Calendar, he bolted south to Old Harbour and boarded a ship. The Royal Navy, commanded by Admiral Rodney, caught Hutchinson before he could escape. Trial and execution Shortly after being caught, he was tried and found guilty. In 1773, he was hanged in Spanish Town Square. Although the final toll is unknown, upon searching his home after his arrest, approximately 43 watches and a large amount of clothing was found. The records of his trial stand in the National Archives and in the Jamaican Archives.C.V. Black, \\"History of Jamaica\\" (London: Collins, 1975), p. 115. Accomplices During the trial, slaves' stories revealed he did not act alone. Planter James Walker and Roger Maddix were sentenced to death for participating in the murder of farmer William Lickley and schoolmaster Timothy Cronin. Maddix's wife, Dorcas, Miss Susanna Cole and Miss Elizabeth Thomas watched schoolmaster Cronin's death by strangulation while pinioned in stocks. Cronin's watch and seal were found in Thomas' possession. Miss Thomas was found not guilty. In popular culture * In Assassin's Creed III, fictional protagonist Connor Kenway visits Hutchinson's abandoned Edinburgh Castle, Jamaica in 1776 (three years after Hutchinson was hanged) in search of Joseph Palmer's piece of Captain Kidd's treasure map, which was implied to have ended up in Hutchinson's private museum.

The band was formed in 1999 by frontman and native Louisvillian \\"Dirty\\" Dave Johnson in hopes of giving a better alternative to the classic and hard rock played over-and-over on the radio. The Glasspack has since recorded 1 garage ep, 2 garage LPs, 2 studio LPs, and numerous cover songs as well as toured the U.S. relentlessly. Three of the LPs were released on Detroit's Small Stone Records, also known for such bands as Men of Porn, Honky, and Five Horse Johnson. The band takes its name from the high-flow fiber-glass filled automobile muffler known as a glasspack, which are known for being remarkably louder than traditional mufflers. The band's music from their 2004 release Bridgeburner[] has been featured in MTV shows Viva La Bam (Season 3, Episodes 7&8)http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/157955/sleep-in-the-mall.jhtml#id=1562939 and Homewrecker (Season 1, Episodes 104&107).http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/homewrecker/series.jhtml Also the band's music from their 2007 release Dirty Women[] was used in FX's motorcycle club television show Sons of Anarchy (Season 2, Episode 209).http://fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/soa/episode.php The band also has tracks from its 2002 Powderkeg[] release in video games MLB 2K5 (2K Sports Major League Baseball series) and Amped 3, both made by 2K Sports. Amped 3 came with the package release of the Xbox 360. The bands' latest full-length LP, Dirty Women[] from Small Stone Records, landed them a sold-out headlining spot for their first trip to Europe at Netherlands' Roadburn Festival on Sunday April 20, 2008. The festival is sponsored by Roadburn Magazine and Terrorizer Magazine and takes place annually at the 013 Pop Centre in Tilburg. The Glasspack was included in the internationally distributed book Rock Detector: A to Z of Doom, Gothic & Stoner Metal, published 2003 by Cherry Red Books. History In 1999, The Glasspack started playing in their hometown of Louisville, Kentucky opening for such known bands as My Own Victim, The Frogs, and Melt Banana. A few months later with only 4 songs, The Glasspack recorded a demo with Crain's Jon Cook in the infamous Rocket House in Old Louisville. They immediately sent the demo to Man's Ruin Records. Owned by well-known graphic artist Frank Kozik and operated in San Francisco, CA, the label had a reputation of putting out unknown psychedelic rock bands of all sorts. Kozik responded warmly to the band and proposed to release their first record. The band enthusiastically accepted the offer and began recording their first full- length recording, American Exhaust in late 1999. Unfortunately for the band, Man's Ruin Records started to fold soon after, leaving the band with a hefty engineering bill. \\"Dirty\\" Dave decided to take out a high rate loan and start the record label Riverock Records with the only intentions being that of releasing The Glasspack record, in hopes of repaying the bills. American Exhaust was released Jan. 1, 2001 and received amazing international press reviews from such as Maximum RocknRoll, Stonerrock.com, Aardschok, and Louisville's newspaper The Courier-Journal. The record then received some global distribution despite the fact that it was on a new record label with only one record. All copies sold-out in less than a year. The record, a following U.S. tour, and hype gained the attention of the developing stoner rock community and Detroit's Small Stone Records, which was soaking up some of the band residue left from the collapse of Man's Ruin Records. The band recorded the Road Warriors E.P. during 2000 in waiting for Man's Ruin Records to put out American Exhaust. The ep was released in 2000 by local Louisville record store/label Better Days Records. The band later yanked the ep from the market for poor sound quality. In late 2001, The Glasspack signed on to Small Stone Records claiming they were the Hunter S. Thompson/Muhammad Ali of rock and roll (both are natives of Louisville). Around the end of 2001, The Glasspack was invited to play the label's showcase at CBGB's in Manhattan for the CMJ Music Marathon (College Music Journal). The showcase was featured on national television on ESPN2. Right before the CMJ gig, the band had just finished a U.S. tour (some gigs with Nebula) and recorded their second full- length release Powderkeg for Small Stone Records. Powderkeg was released in spring of 2002, followed by more and more shows. The band was working extensively during this period and leaving a scar of hell-raising, drug- taking, and loud rock and roll all over the United States. Near the end of 2002, the band grew tired and took a long break (long break for them) until the spring of 2003. In the spring of 2003 the band decided to record in an actual studio in another city. They chose Detroit's Rustbelt Studios upon suggestion from Small Stone Records. The band spent a weekend and exactly 36 hours making a very confused record entitled Bridgeburner. In the studio, fellow songwriter and bassist/guitarist Marcus Moody fell ill with what would later become a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This prevented the band member from finishing the recording, leaving drummer Brett Holsclaw and guitarist/singer \\"Dirty\\" Dave Johnson with no other choice but a fill-in bassist. The record was scheduled for release in fall of 2003 and the band booked another tour to promote the release of the record. Small Stone Records at the time of scheduled release had changed distribution in the U.S. to Nail/Allegro. Distribution details and negotiation delayed the release to spring of 2004. However, the band went ahead and toured for the record before its release. The Glasspack's third full-length release Bridgeburner was released in spring 2004. Shortly thereafter, the band accepted an invite to play WFPK Public Radio Louisville's Live Lunch Series to promote the record. The live radio session was recorded as well (with bassist Todd Cook). The Bridgeburner fell short of The Glasspack releases before it in the U.S. press and market. However, at this time, the band was gaining ground with legendary live shows and starting to sell more records in Europe. The Bridgeburner record, a blur of guitars and psychedelic confusion, was actually well received in Europe. The record was also well received by music placement managers, gaining them a spot in MTV Jackass spin-off shows Viva La Bam and Homewrecker as well other television spots. They also were included in several video games around this time for the Xbox and the release of the Xbox 360. The Bridgeburner was mixed by Monster Magnet's Bobby Pantella who also filled a couple gaps in the bass area. The record also contained a blistering lead guitar solo guest appearance on the track \\"Peepshow\\" by Monster Magnet's Ed Mundell. Phil Durr of the Sub-Pop act Big Chief graced the record as well with several guest guitar tracks. The band continued playing local gigs, weekend Midwest trips, and small tours for the remainder of 2004. The year is also noted for the re-release of The Glasspack's first full-length American Exhaust on red 12\\" vinyl from a small label in Chicago (4 Walls Records) and The Glasspack's endorsement with Fender Music (representative Alex Perez). By this time, \\"Dirty\\" was playing guitar behind his back, between his legs, and even with his teeth. One account of a 2004 SXSW Day Party performance in the Detroit Metro Times claims that the frontman did a backflip while playing guitar from the ground to the stage at the Austin, TX gig. With acts such as this and his loyalty to his red American Telecaster, he was a no-brainer for Fender. In 2005, \\"Dirty\\" and The Glasspack slowed down a bit. The band members pursued side projects and college. Both \\"Dirty\\" Dave and drummer Brett Holsclaw began working more intensely towards graphic design degrees and settling for occasional side-project gigs instead of the intense work The Glasspack had become by then. \\"Dirty\\" eventually finished schooling as Brett remained in school. It was during this time \\"Dirty\\" began to right the tracks that would later become The Glasspack's brilliant third Small Stone Records release, Dirty Women. In 2006, Dirty rounded the band up again and the help of guests from such notable Kentucky acts as Coliseum (band) and The Hookers. They finished their fourth full-length record in downtown Louisville at a multimillion-dollar studio, Downtown Recording, completely analog with vintage equipment. In the Spring of 2007, The Glasspack's fourth full-length release, Dirty Women, was unleashed and the band headed to Austin, TX to officially play the South By Southwest Music Festival as part of the 2007 Small Stone Records SXSW Showcase. The record was well received and a fresh come-back after the somewhat questionable Bridgeburner record. The band did an extensive set of U.S. tours for the release of Dirty Women in 2007. They also received their first paid invite to Europe in the form of the 13th Annual 2008 Roadburn Magazine Festival, also sponsored by Terrorizer Magazine. In the Winter of 2007, the band was announced as the Sunday headliner of the festival for an exclusive first show in Europe. The show sold out in 1 week during pre-sales in December 2007. Also in 2007, the band released a split 10\\" vinyl on a small Detroit label (Sleeping Village Records). The record was a split ep with one of \\"Dirty\\" Dave's side-projects, Muddy Nasty River. The Glasspack side was a public radio performance they had done on 91.9FM WFPK Public Radio Louisville for the release of Bridgeburner in 2004, featuring bassist Todd Cook (Slint, The For Carnation, Crain). Todd had taken on bass duties for some time after Marcus Moody was diagnosed with MS. In 2008, the band focused on rehearsing an ear-bleeding 1 hour set exclusively for the people of the Roadburn Festival. The festival was also recorded and placed into a Dutch public audio archive website for free listening. 2008 also saw the re-release of The Glasspack's Powderkeg record on vinyl from Sleeping Village Records. The Glasspack is still residing in Louisville, Kentucky and taking, yet again, another long break (long break for them). This band is one of the hardest working bands in the current indie rock scene as well as the Louisville scene which is known for its unique, incestuous, and thriving music community. In 2009, The Glasspack's music was featured in FX's television program Sons of Anarchy. Also that year, a reissue of The Glasspack's first full-length American Exhaust was remastered by Jack Endino for Los Angeles label Poison Tree Records (iTunes digital only). The release includes a special remastered bonus of the band's 1991 demo recordings, entitled \\"The Polaris Demos.\\" The demos were previously released only on cassette with request from the band. In 2010, The Glasspack played a ten-year anniversary show in Louisville, Kentucky at the Zanzabar supporting the release of an orange seven inch vinyl split (with Louisville band the Trophy Wives) on Louisville label Noise Pollution. Writer Michael Jones did a cover story on the band's history in support of the show and release in the LEO Weekly (Louisville Eccentric Observer). The release includes a free download card with a good portion of the Glasspack's 2008 performance at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg. Peter Searcy of the influential Louisville act Squirrel Bait joined the band on the seven inch vinyl title track, \\"If You Don't Have Anything Nice to Say,\\" and is credited as The Glasspack's current bass player. In 2014, The Glasspack announced plans to record a fifth full-length album, \\"Moon Patrol,\\" intended to be essentially one song roughly 45 minutes long. According to frontman \\"Dirty\\" Dave Johnson, the record is to be a space rock departure from the more predominant punk sound of the band's past. No release date has been declared and likely because Johnson is also attending law school and playing with The Decline Effect, a punk band featuring former Kinghorse (Caroline Records/Produced by Danzig) guitarist Mark Abromavage.

Use of anabolic steroids for purposes other than treating medical conditions is controversial and, in some cases, illegal. Major sports organizations have moved to ban the use of anabolic steroids. There is a wide range of health concerns for users. Legislation in many countries restricts and criminalizes AAS possession and trade.  History  Performance-enhancing substances have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine by societies around the world, with the aim of promoting vitality and strength. The use of gonadal hormones pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of testicle extract began in the late 19th century, while its effects on strength were still being studied. In 1889, the 72-year-old Mauritian neurologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard injected himself with an extract of dog and guinea pig testicles, and reported at a scientific meeting that these injections had led to a variety of beneficial effects. However, almost all experts, including some of Brown-Sequard's contemporaries, had agreed that these positive effects were induced by Brown-Séquard himself. In 2002, a study replicating Brown-Séquard's method determined that the amount of testosterone obtained was too low to have any clinical effect. Testosterone, the most active anabolic-androgenic steroid produced by Leydig cells in the testes, was first isolated in 1935 and chemically synthesized later in the same year. Synthetic derivatives of testosterone quickly followed. By the end of the following decade, both testosterone and its derivatives were applied with varying degrees of success for a number of medical conditions. It was not until the 1950s, however, that athletes began to discover that anabolic steroids could increase their muscle mass. According to sports physician John Ziegler, the first confirmed use of an anabolic steroid in an international athletic competition was at the weightlifting championships in Vienna in 1954, when the Russians weightlifters used testosterone. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was confined largely to the professional levels of sport. In the Eastern bloc, programs of training went as far as forcing some athletes to take anabolic steroids.Ungerleider, Steven \\"Faust's gold : inside the East German doping machine\\" New York : Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press, 2001. In the United States, sports physicians, including Ziegler, and medical texts were still widely proclaiming that anabolic steroids were ineffective in helping athletes gain muscle. These doctors did acknowledge the usefulness of anabolic steroids for debilitated patients. The package insert for Dianabol, a common anabolic steroid used at the time, stated, \\"Anabolic steroids do not enhance athletic ability.\\" Despite these warnings, use of anabolic steroids began in competition bodybuilding, in track and field events, such as the shot put, and in other sports where performance depended on muscle strength or speed of recovery during training. At the end of the 1960s, Science published a study on the effects of Dianabol on athletes. This open label study, conducted by J.P. O'Shea and colleagues at Oregon State University, confirmed the muscle building effects of anabolic steroids on athletes that followed a high protein diet.L. C. Johnson and J. P. O'Shea, Science 164, 957 (1969) Two years later, O'Shea replicated the results in a double blind design.J. P. O'Shea, Nutr. Rep. Int. 4, 363 (1971) At the beginning of the 1970s, sporting organizations, including the IOC and NCAA, declared the use of anabolic steroids unethical, but with no effective means of testing athletes, the issue remained academic.  Prevalence and user profiles  General population = It is difficult to determine what percent of the population have used anabolic steroids due to the fact that most studies are based on self-reporting. Studies in the United States have shown anabolic steroid users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non- athletes. They cite using the drugs for cosmetic purposes. Another study found that non-medical use of anabolic steroids among college students was at, or less than, 1%. According to a 2006 survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes. About 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multi-dose vials, though a 2007 study found sharing of needles was extremely uncommon (less than 1%) among individuals using anabolic steroids for non- medical purposes. Another 2007 study found that 74% of non-medical anabolic steroid users had secondary college degrees and more had completed college and less had failed to complete high school than is expected from the general population. The same study found that individuals using anabolic steroids for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. Anabolic steroid users research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users ; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. According to a 1998 study, 2.7% of middle school (age 9-13) students in the United States reported using steroids, with 2.8% being female and 2.6% being male. A 1988 study found that 6.6% of 12th grade (17 or 18 years old) students use or have used steroids. Anabolic steroid users tend to be disillusioned by the portrayal of anabolic steroids as deadly in the media and in politics. According to one study, anabolic steroid users also distrust their physicians, and in the sample, 56% had not disclosed their anabolic steroid use to their physicians. Another 2007 study showed that while 66% of individuals using anabolic steroids for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical anabolic steroid use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side effects of anabolic steroid use. A 2006 study has showed that long-term anabolic steroid users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more traditional male roles. = Sports = Anabolic steroids have been used by athletes in many professional sports, including [track and field], weightlifting, bodybuilding, shot put, cycling, baseball, wrestling, mixed martial arts, boxing, and football. Such use is prohibited by many of the professional and amateur associations that organize these sports. Anabolic steroid use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%. Male students used anabolic steroids more frequently than female students and, on average, those who participated in sports used steroids more often than those who did not. = Celebrity controversies = In 1992, NFL football player Lyle Alzado died from brain cancer, which he said was caused by his steroid use. Although steroids have been known to cause liver cancer, there is no published evidence that anabolic steroids cause either brain cancer or the specific type of T-cell lymphoma that caused Alzado's death. However, Alzado also stated that he felt addicted to steroids and that he had become increasingly violent. Arnold Schwarzenegger acknowledged using anabolic steroids for many years during his bodybuilding career, although steroids were legal in the US during the time he used them. In 1997, he underwent surgery to correct a heart defect. Some have assumed this was because of his use of anabolic steroids. Although the use of anabolic steroids can sometimes cause enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle, Schwarzenegger was born with a congenital genetic defect in which his heart had a bicuspid aortic valve, a condition that rendered his aortic valve with two cusps instead of three, which can occasionally cause problems later in life.  Doping  The use of anabolic steroids is banned by all major sporting associations, including the International Olympic Committee, Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, WWE, ICC, ITF, FIFA, World Rugby, FINA, UEFA, the European Athletic Association, and the Brazilian Football Confederation. Anabolic steroids are controlled substances in many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (U.S.). The Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and the National Football League also ban the use of anabolic steroids. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains the list of performance-enhancing substances used by many major sports associations and includes all anabolic agents, which includes all anabolic steroids and precursors as well as all hormones and related substances. Spain passed an anti-doping law that created a national anti- doping agency. Italy passed a law in 2000 where penalties range up to three years in prison if an athlete has tested positive for banned substances. In 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law ratification of the International Convention Against Doping in Sport, which would encourage cooperation with WADA. Many other countries have similar legislation prohibiting anabolic steroids in sports, including Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden.  Legal status and politics  The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country. In the U.S., anabolic steroids are listed as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, which makes the possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to seven years in prison. In Canada, anabolic steroids and their derivatives are part of the Controlled drugs and substances act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription. However, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling anabolic steroids in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months. Importing or exporting anabolic steroids also carry similar penalties. Anabolic steroids are also illegal without prescription in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and Portugal, and are listed as Schedule 4 Controlled Drugs in the United Kingdom. = United States = The United States first considered classifying anabolic steroids as a controlled substance in the late 1980s after a controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. During deliberations, the American Medical Association (AMA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) all opposed listing anabolic steroids as controlled substances. These organizations argued that use of these drugs does not lead to the physical or psychological dependence required for such scheduling under the Controlled Substance Act. However, anabolic steroids were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after non-medical use of anabolic steroids was criminalized in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products. Some brand names included Ciba, Searle, and Syntex. In the Controlled Substances Act, anabolic steroids are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, all anabolic steroids are illegal, anabolic steroids are classified as class C drugs for their abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as benzodiazepines. In 2008, a study published in the Lancet suggested that anabolic steroids are less dangerous than most other illegal substances, and some legal ones.  Economics and law enforcement Illegal trade= DEA raid In countries where anabolic steroids are illegal or controlled, the majority of steroids are obtained illegally through black market trade.Yesalis, Charles. (2000). Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise These steroids are usually manufactured in other countries, and therefore must be smuggled across international borders. A large stash of anabolic steroid vials confiscated during \\"Operation Gear Grinder\\" undertaken by the Drug Enforcement Administration which ended in September 2007. In September 2007, the DEA completed an 18-month international investigation of illicit anabolic steroid use in which 124 arrests were made. The investigation targeted more than 25 Chinese companies which produced raw materials for producing steroids and human growth hormone. The companies exported raw products to Mexico, where the consumer products were packaged. The investigation, dubbed \\"Operation Gear Grinder,\\" was the largest anabolic steroid operation in the United States, and involved China, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Thailand, among other countries. The investigation also focused on online message boards where advice was given on how to use anabolic steroids. The DEA also intercepted thousands of e-mails in the course of the investigation. The DEA has stated that the e-mails intercepted were compiled into a massive database of names which could lead to months or years of future arrests of steroid users. =Production= Anabolic steroids are produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small homemade laboratories. Common problems associated with illegal drug trades, such as chemical substitutions, cutting, and diluting, affect illegal anabolic steroids, so that when they reach the distribution level, the quality may be compromised and the drugs may be dangerous. In the 1990s, most U.S. producers such as Ciba, Searle and Syntex stopped making and marketing anabolic steroids within the U.S. However, in many other regions, particularly Eastern Europe, they are still mass- produced. Anabolic steroids are still in wide use for veterinary purposes, and often contain the same components as those prepared for humans, but without the same quality control. These can also be dangerous, as they may have been produced and handled in cruder and less sterile environments. =Distribution= In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, illicit steroids are purchased just like any other illegal drug. Dealers are able to obtain the steroids from a number of sources. Illegal anabolic steroids are sometimes sold at gyms, competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians. In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as anabolic steroids, particularly via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies. In the U.S., black market importation continues from Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where steroids are not illegal.

Teatro Degollado (, Degollado Theater) is a neoclassical\\" Guadalajara Historic District Teatro Degollado \\", \\"gDLtours\\". Mexican theater known for its diverse performances and artistic design. It is located in the central plaza of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico on Belen Street between Hidalgo Avenue and Morelos Avenue. Many performances (from cultural Mexican dances to international operas) take place in this building.“Teatro Degollado” , \\"Discover Mexico Adventures\\". Meant to be a monument of Guadalajara's culture, the theater was inaugurated in September 1866; breathing life to the city through its innovative artistic beauty.  Original plans  Side View of the Teatro Degollado Guadalajara, Jalisco Degollado Theater was constructed during Mexico's 1800s theatrical movement. There was a high demand for a great theater in Guadalajara, Jalisco that displayed the cultural arts of the city. In response to the demand, on October 1, 1855, Antonio Perez Verdia proposed the construction of Alarcon Theater (after the classic dramatist Juan Ruiz de Alarcón)\\"Teatro Degollado\\", \\"Costa Alegre & Mexico Practical Travel Guide\\", Tuesday July 06, 2008. to the current governor of the time, Santos Degollado. On December 12 of that same year, Degollado signed the official decree to build the structure, and in March, 1856, Degollado set the first cornerstone of the building. In April 1856, Jacobo Galvez was appointed to lead the initial construction of the theater.Pizano y Saucedo, Carlos. \\"Centenario del “Teatro Degollado” De Guadalajara\\", \\"El Colegio de México\\", Guadalajara. Due to a three-year war in Mexico, and a change of government during the dispute, the completion of the project was slow. On November 12, 1861, Governor Pedro Amazon changed the proposed name of the project from the \\"Alarcon Theater\\" to the \\"Degollado Theater\\", after ex-governor and general at the time of his death, Santos Degollado (killed in a battle on June 16, 1861). This change of name was not acknowledged at the time of inauguration, but was adopted on December 18, 1866, when Mexican liberal troops regained control of the plaza where the theater is located.  First inauguration  The theater's first inauguration was on September 13, 1866, with the opera \\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\", performed by Ángela Peralta, opera soprano noted as the \\"Mexican Nightingale\\". At this point in time the theater had not been completed. Subsequently, there were many renovations and four more inaugurations.  Inauguration dates  These are the dates of all the inaugurations following renovations of the structure: * September 13, 1866 * October 30, 1880 * September 15, 1910 * June 28, 1941 * September 8, 1964  Artistic design  Degollado Theater is famous for its beautiful paintings along its golden walls on the interior of the building and its symbolic mosaic on the exterior. =Interior = Most of the theater's renovations were made to improve the interior design by adding paintings and giving it its current red and golden color. Before the theater's first inauguration, Gerardo Suarez and Carlos Villasenor decorated the theater with a mural representing Dante Alighieri's fourth song in the Divine Comedy. On 1877, Fermin Riestra was ordered to continue with the construction of the building; a three-year process on which a gilded eagle holding a Mexican flag on its talons and a chain on its beak was placed on the center of the inner arch of the building. Within the three year construction, Felipe Castro painted the murals Time and Hours and The Fame on the proscenium arch. Between 1880 and 1890, the stucco on the concert hall was completed and a golden color was added to the interior walls. By 1893, tiles were removed from the stage, due to the lack of support they provided for the structure, and were replaced by a metal arch on 1905. Between 1909 and 1910 artist Roberto Montenegro focused on the reconstruction and decoration of the interior of the building which included the addition of a crystal lamp on the theater's vault. Fifty years later, architect Ignacio Diaz Morales was in charge of a complete restoration of the building where sculptures by Benito Castaneda replaced Venetian mosaics. On May 2001, a chamber hall that can hold 200 people was added to the inside of the building. =Exterior= With fewer renovations than the interior, the exterior of the building still retains its artistic beauty. Between 1953 and 1959 Montenegro painted the mosaic of Apollo and the nine muses on the pediment of the theater. The portico supporting the pediment consists of 16 Corinthian columns. When Ignacio Diaz was in charge of the renovation of the theater, he ordered the engraving of the phrase \\"May we never hear a hint of discord\\" along Montenegro's mosaic on the main entrance. Building's dimensions Several measurements of the Theater: *Building measures 97 m long, 36.4 m wide, and 22.5 m high. *Stage measures 54 m by 18 m. *Oval hall measures 10 m × 6.5 m wide. *Building capacity of 1,015 spectators.

He served as Bishop of Providence from 1921 until his death. Biography William Hickey was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to William (d. 1917) and Margaret (née Troy) Hickey. His father served in both the army and the navy during the Civil War. Hickey attended Holy Cross College, and also studied at St. Sulpice Seminary in Paris. Upon his return to the United States, he attended St. John's Seminary and was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Williams on December 22, 1893.\\"Most Rev. William A. Hickey, D.D.\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence He then held a variety of pastoral roles throughout Worcester County. From 1903 to 1917, Hickey served as a pastor in Gilbertville, where he would preach in four different languages (English, French, Polish, and Lithuanian) every Sunday. He was then transferred to St. John's Church in Clinton, where he became much beloved for erecting a new parochial school and parish hall. His work in Clinton even earned him the praise of U.S. Senator David I. Walsh, who said, \\"Father Hickey has...been a soldier camping in the homes of the sick and the poor under the white banner of the Church, fighting for salvation; has battled for Christ in the trenches of humanity. Not a day has passed over his head since our boys first left Clinton that he has not prayed for his people.\\" On January 16, 1919, Hickey was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island and Titular Bishop of Claudiopolis in Isauria by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 10 from Bishop Thomas Beaven, with Bishops Louis Walsh and Daniel Feehan serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. He was immediately pronounced Apostolic Administrator for the diocese by the incumbent Bishop Matthew Harkins, whom Hickey succeeded as the third Bishop of Providence upon Harkin's death on May 25, 1921. In 1923, the Bishop initiated an ultimately successful, three-year-long drive to raise a million dollars to improve and create solely English-speaking diocesan high schools. He also led fundraising efforts for the support of the diocesan newspaper, the widely popular Providence Visitor. However, a number of French Canadians in the diocese saw the Bishop's endeavor as a threat to the continuation of their distinct traditions and, in 1924, founded the newspaper La Sentinelle, which became the major organ of opposition to Hickey. The Sentinellists, as the group became known, contested Hickey's fundraising procedures before both ecclesiastical and civil courts, leading to their excommunication in 1927 and the placement of their paper on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Hickey later lifted the excommunication after the group sought reconciliation. Hickey later died from a heart attack, aged 64.

Life and work  Vay was the elder daughter of Count Ernst von Wurmbrand- Stuppach and his wife, Countess Rosa Teleki von Szék (later wife of Friedrich, Prince of Solms-Baruth). She was born at Tarnopol, Galicia, today Ternopil, Ukraine, where her father Count Ernst von Wurmbrand-Stuppach was serving as first lieutenant in the local garrison. In her early youth, she lived on the family estate near Schwarzau, Lower Austria. Her father died in 1846; when her mother married again in 1851, she left Austria and moved with her to Prussia for 10 years.Adelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 9) On March 12, 1860, she married baron Ödön (Edmond, Eugen or Otto) Vay de Vaya, a Hungarian magnate. They enjoyed 60 years of marriage, but without having children. The couple lived at first at Tiszalök for some years, near the Hungarian-Ukrainian border, and later moved to Slovenske Konjice (Gonobitz), where they bought a mansion at Prevrat, still known as \\"Baronvaj\\" (\\"Baron Vay's\\").Adelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 10) Ödön was a retired senior officer of the Austro-Hungarian army. On August 9, 1877, the Militar-Veteranen-Verein in Gonobitz (Association of Army Veterans in Gonobitz) was founded, primarily for ex-soldiers regardless of nationality. The association's first president was Hugo Veriand von Windisch-Graetz, and his deputy was Vay de Vaya.Ožinger Anton, Pajk Ivan: Konjiško ob 850-letnici pražupnije The couple were both members of the local Red Cross Society committee, which in 1897 built a hospital named the Christiane-Lazarett after Christiane Habsburg, president of the Austro- Hungarian Red Cross Society.Adelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 18) Baron Vay de Vaya decided in 1908 to have another building constructed (at his own cost) specifically for infectious disease patients. The hospital continued in operation until the beginning of World War II. Adelma was well known as a great humanitarian, and never charged for her medical advice and assistance. Adelma Vay's grave in St. Anna's cemetery, Slovenske Konjice On March 1, 1921, Ödön died at Mali Lošinj, where the couple had a summer villa. After his death, the widowed Adelma continued to live in the mansion, surrounded by servants. She died on May 24, 1925 at her home. Although she was a Lutheran, Franc Hrastelj, the priest of the Catholic parish, approved her burial in the churchyard of St. Anna's in Slovenske Konjice.  Spiritualism  Adelma had the reputation of possessing mystical powers, probably inherited from her mother. She was reputed to have prophetic gifts and to be clairvoyant. She wrote, spoke and drew in an apparent trance- like state. She was a homeopath and attempted to cure people using magnetism.Nena Židov: An overview of the history of homeopathy in Slovenia in the 19th century In 1873, she and her husband founded the Verein spiriter Forscher (Hungarian Spiritualist Association), of which they became the first presidents. In An Encyclopaedia of Occultism (1920) by Lewis Spence (1874–1955), she was noted as the initiator of spiritualism in Austria- Hungary. Adelma von Vay once described her book Spirit, Power and MatterAdelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija) as an example of pure Christian Spiritualism. The newly formed association was not thought of as a dogmatic Spiritualistic sect but was anchored in a framework of Christian religion, stated by its association's statutes.Adelma von Vay: Duh, sila, snov (Jan Ciglenečki: Štajerska Pitija, page 13)  Publications  Vay was author of many books, written in German and translated into English: * Geist-Kraft- Stoff (Spirit, Power, and Matter) (1869), Spirit, Power, and Matter * Studien über die Geisterwelt (Studies on the Spirit World), (1874) * From My Life (1900) * Pictures from the Beyond (1905) * Die Sphären zwischen der Erde und Sonne NotesSources * Boldin Aleksandra, Ciglenečki Jan: Adelma von Vay, The Mysterious Baroness from Konjice, 2012.

It was established on 19 May 1868 by the New South Wales politician, William Tunks, and is one of the oldest and most significant remaining cemeteries in metropolitan Sydney. The first interment was in 1877, and until its closure for burials in 1974, 14,456 burials took place. Most burials took place between 1900 and 1930. It is also known as the Gore Hill Cemetery. The cemetery is situated on Crown land and is managed by a not for profit community organisation, Northern Cemeteries, through a Board of Trustees. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 May 2001. There are 17 war graves of Commonwealth service personnel of World War I, registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.  History Development, establishments and early operations= In 1864, William Tunks, prominent Parramatta businessman, who owned land in the North Shore area, was elected member for St Leonards in the Legislative Assembly of NSW. Tunks soon moved to North Sydney and began an interest in local affairs, in particular the establishment of a general cemetery in the area. In 1867 the Surveyor General instructed licensed surveyor Armstrong to confer with Tunks and examine locations for a general cemetery. A plan was submitted by Armstrong for a 14-acre area of Crown Land at Gore Hill, with burial areas for the religious denominations allocated in proportion to the total population. Areas were also allocated for a general cemetery, future extensions and a central road. The plan gained approval from the Minister for Lands despite some opposition by local residents. The following year Tunks sought protection for the site from the Secretary of Lands following repeated incidents of cutting and removal of timber. He expressed the opinion that a number of the existing trees \\"...ought to be left standing for the purpose of shade and ornamentation...\\". Subsequently, Willoughby Council agreed to protect the land pending the appointment of trustees. The first part of the Cemetery was dedicated on 19 May 1868 and in 1870 The Borough Councils of St Leonards, East St Leonards and North Willoughby were appointed trustees of the cemetery. In 1871 the Borough of Victoria was appointed as the fourth trustee. It is likely that a cemetery committee was appointed around this time. Tunks was named as the chairman of the cemetery trust. A grant was received from Treasury for the erection of a four-rail pig-proof fence enclosing the site. In 1875 responsibility for Gore Hill Cemetery was transferred from the four boroughs to lay trustees of the authorities who had been allocated land. This resulted in the formation of seven separate and independent cemeteries sharing a common carriage way. In 1877 burials commenced and minor landscape works were carried out in some sections by individual trusts. William Tunks died in 1883 and was buried at the entrance to the Church of England section, the first burial in this section. A monument was erected. In 1884 the first combined Committee of trustees was formed. The following year the Committee put forward plans to improve the cemetery grounds, build a caretaker's residence, make a wide avenue, kerb and gutter, clear stumps and undergrowth, trench around the site to 16 feet, and plant evergreen shrubs. The NSW Department of Justice authorised the Trustees to build a caretaker's cottage on half an acre of the Extension Reserve, west of the Carriageway. In 1886 the caretaker's cottage was constructed, the driveway cleared, and grounds cleared. James Kennedy was appointed caretaker by the Committee of Trustees with responsibilities including grave digging, planting trees, maintaining borders and weeding. Discussions took place on having the carriageway planted with an avenue of trees. A total of 56 burials were recorded to December 1886. In 1887 the Trustees received a Treasury grant to undertake improvements to the cemetery grounds, including planting, provision of seats and gates, trenching and asphalting. A sub-committee was formed to carry out the works. In 1890 a picket fence, high, was erected and painted along the Lane Cove Road (now the Pacific Highway) boundary. Four years later the General Section east of the Carriageway was redesigned for extensions to the Wesleyan, Presbyterian and Congregational sections. By 1899 an estimated 2096 burials had been performed at Gore Hill Cemetery. Between 1898 and 1900 the Carriageway was regraded and guttered, and a shelter shed erected and between 1900 and 1901 the Carriageway was surfaced with blue metal. Some monuments and remains from the Devonshire Street (Sandhills) Cemetery, in use 1819 to 1901, were relocated to Gore Hill Cemetery at the time of construction of Central railway station. The remains were transferred before the redevelopment of Devonshire Street Cemetery in 1901. =1902 to closure in 1974 = In 1902 iron gates with stone piers were erected at the main entrance on Lane Cove Road (now the Pacific Highway). The sandstone was from Waverley Quarry and the piers were constructed by W. E. Parry of Gordon. The iron work was by Mr George Wales of Clarence Street, Sydney. East of the Carriageway the General Section and Extension area were eliminated. The Jewish area was relocated. New burial areas for Roman Catholics and Unsectarians were allocated. Extensions were given to the Presbyterian, Wesleyan-Methodist and Independent areas. Trustees of the General Section became the Trustees of the Unsectarian Section. West of the Carriageway, the Extension area was eliminated in 1903 to provide for extensions to the Church of England burial area and the establishment of a Baptist burial area. East of the Carriageway, the Roman Catholic, Methodist, Jewish and Unsectarian burial areas were redesigned. The present brick retaining walls along the Carriageway were erected by the Combined Committee of Trustees. A timber, Gothic style Robing Room and Chapel was erected in the new Church of England extension, near the Carriageway; it was destroyed by fire in 1975. The Dalton vault was erected in the first Roman Catholic Section. In 1904 the Trustees were informed by the Department of Lands of the discontinuation of government subsidies for general maintenance and improvements. In 1906 the Trustees produced \\"Regulations for the Management of the Portions of the General Cemetery at Gore Hill\\" and in 1908 the portion of the Cemetery east of the Carriageway was revoked and re-dedicated for General Cemetery. In 1910 Mr Kennedy was succeeded as Sexton by Frederick Crowe. In 1917 east of the Carriageway, the Roman Catholic and Unsectarian areas were redesigned and the Jewish Area eliminated and in 1919 east of the Carriageway the Methodist and Presbyterian burial areas were redesigned to increase the Presbyterian area. Internal boundaries of burial areas were finalised. In 1922 the stone archway at the entrance to the Baptist Section was presented to the Trustees of that section by T. E. Rofe of Wahroonga. All burial plots were sold by this time. In 1926 a portion of the western boundary was claimed by the Main Roads Board (now the Roads and Traffic Authority) for the widening of Lane Cove Road. The change did not encroach upon the burial areas of the Baptist, Church of England, and Roman Catholic Trusts. A dividing fence between the public recreation area and the cemetery was erected in 1926 and two roods and 26 perches were taken from the Lane Cove Road boundary. The existing metal and wire fence was possibly erected at about this time, with the cost being borne by the relevant government authority. The Carriageway was resurfaced with tar and macadam in about 1930. The following year a new Code of Regulations was prepared and adopted by the Trustees. There is little information available about the cemetery for the Depression and World War II years. In 1948 two sandstone monuments to members of the Hordern family were transferred to Gore Hill Cemetery from St Stephen's, Newtown (Camperdown Cemetery) when the latter was converted to a Rest Park. In 1949 a new sexton's cottage was built at the southern end of the cemetery, adjoining the highway. By the 1950s burials had decreased, and in 1974 the cemetery ceased operating. To signify its closure and change of status from a working to a memorial cemetery, it was renamed the Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery. In 1965 a combined Trust was set up to carry out administration of the Cemetery. The following year the NSW Government passed Act No. 52, 1966, to provide for the care, control and management of cemeteries by municipal councils. However, the Act did not apply to Gore Hill. Willoughby Council expressed no interest in the acquisition of the Cemetery. In 1967, due to concerns over funding arrangements for maintenance the Trustees proposed a future policy to the Minister for Lands that the Cemetery be converted to a botanical garden with significant monuments and vaults to be conserved and others removed. On 27 May 1971, a special meeting of Trustees heard a report from the Mayor of Willoughby on the Government's proposal to close Gore Hill Cemetery and convert it to a \\"rest park\\". The meeting resolved to accept the proposals. All Cemetery staff were dismissed on 12 November and no further maintenance was carried out. The Sexton, Mr Vandine, was permitted to remain in the cottage in a caretaker role. The last burials in the Cemetery occurred early in 1974. On 24 April, the Minister for Lands informed the Trust that the Gore Hill Cemetery Bill 1974 would be enacted and the Cemetery closed to burials from the 18 May 1974. Under the Act the land was to be dedicated as a public park, with Willoughby Council as trustees who were required to \\"improve\\" the Cemetery as a rest park and garden. The Act also required Council to consider the views of the Royal Australian Historical Society with respect to the historical aspects of the Cemetery. = 1975 to 1989 = Concerns over the future of the cemetery and fears over its demolition resulted in a public meeting of protest being held in 1975. The meeting resolved to request Willoughby Council to rescind its motion adopting the \\"rest park\\" plan. It also resolved to form a group to be known as The Friends of Gore Hill Cemetery to work for the conservation of the Cemetery. In 1976 Willoughby Council requested the Minister for Lands to repeal the Gore Hill Act 1974. The Society of Australian Genealogists completed transcriptions of the inscriptions on all the monuments and Gore Hill Cemetery was Classified by the National Trust as an historic cemetery. The Heritage Bill was enacted in 1977, providing for the Heritage Council of New South Wales as the Government's advisory body on conservation of the State's environmental heritage. Established in 1978, the Heritage Council of New South Wales recognised Gore Hill Cemetery as an item of the State's environmental heritage, although no conservation order was made in respect of the site. In 1979 The Heritage Council made available a grant of $35,000 for specific conservation works. The Department of Lands received a Treasury allocation of $50,000 for conservation works at the Cemetery, with an indication of further contributions of $50,000 over each of the next five years. A working committee was established in December comprising Department of Lands (convenor), Willoughby Municipal Council, and the Heritage Council. The Working Committee released a Discussion Paper in May 1981, and in July engaged consultant, Lesley Gulson to implement the conservation strategies outlined in the Paper, over a six-month period. In November the same year the Working Committee staged a public exhibition and associated lectures to seek comment on the strategies. Restoration work commenced on the Cemetery drainage system. By the end of 1981/82 membership of the Friends was 290. The following year kerbing and guttering was laid along the Cemetery side of Westbourne Street. Between 1982 and 1984 the following projects were completed under the supervision of the Working Committee : *Repair of fence along Pacific Highway boundary; *Turfing of the Carriageway and extension of brick paving along western side; *Restoration of the main gates at Pacific Highway end; *Landscape improvements to the entrances at Pacific Hwy and Westbourne St; *Restoration of the Lych Gate (grant of $2664 to Friends) and Shelter Shed; *Removal of dead trees, replanting of shrubs, restoration of brickwork ($50,000 grant from Department of Lands) and clearing of paths. (Most of the new plantings and spray heads for watering system were stolen). *Marker pegs installed to identify denominational sections. In 1984 The NSW Minister for Planning and Environment approved land rezoning to permit Community and Commercial Use of the Sexton's Cottage site. Income from a proposed lease of the site would be used for maintenance and restoration of the Cemetery. A forty-year lease of the site was granted to the architectural firm, Edwards, Madigan, Torzillo, Briggs International Pty Ltd, with rent tied to CPI variations and reviewable every five years (the lease runs from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 2024). By the end of 1983/84 the Friends' membership was approximately 300. In 1985 Edith Sims' history of Gore Hill Cemetery was published by the Friends. In 1986 the Friends expressed concern at the lack of a gardener and the amount of overgrowth in the Cemetery. The Friends did the only maintenance for a number of years until a trust was formed. The Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery Act was assented to in 1986, repealing the Gore Hill Cemetery Act 1974. The Roman Catholic Robing Room ($17,000 grant to Friends) and the metal arbour beside the Carriageway were restored. The National Trust of Australia (New South Wales) proposed that a Permanent Conservation Order be made over the Cemetery. In 1987 Trustees were appointed to manage the Cemetery in accordance with the new Act. Appointees were nominated by the Heritage Council, the National Trust, Willoughby, with Richard Mackay as Chairman. Municipal Council, Lane Cove Municipal Council and the Friends of Gore Hill Cemetery. The following year the Trust requested that a Permanent Conservation Order under the Heritage Act be made in respect of the Cemetery, but this request was not acted on. In 1989 Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery was featured in a light-hearted look at cemeteries on the TV lifestyle program \\"Burke's Backyard\\". Local State Member of Parliament, John Dowd presented the Trust with a cheque for funds remaining from the Crown Lands grant of 1985. =1990 to date= In 1990 a grant from the National Estate Grants Program and a loan from the Crown Lands Office were made to enable major landscape conservation works to be carried out. Consultant horticulturalists carried out a program of rubbish removal, weeding, repair of damaged paths, clearing and repair of drains. The Department of Planning's \\"Heritage Conservation in Action\\" Education Kit was launched at Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery. Plumbing and bottled gas were connected to the gardener's shed/office. A Memorial Garden was established along part of the eastern side of the Carriageway for several placement of ashes, with fees to supplement Trust income. In 1991 dead palms were removed from the old Catholic section and tree surgery was performed on major trees. One of the toilets was repaired, with a new door. Interpretive signs were erected on the shed/office. The boundary fence along the Pacific Highway were repaired. The Cemetery was featured in John Stowar's garden segment on the TV program \\"Good Morning Australia\\". In 1992 Chris Betteridge assumed the role of Chairman of the Trust for a period of five years. The Trust received a grant of $7,500 for conservation of the Wilson and Skene vaults. The lessee of the Sexton's Cottage site sought an extension of the lease to 99 years but this was refused by the Minister for Lands. The Trust published a brochure promoting the placement of ashes and the annual care of graves. Venturer Scouts carried out a program of research and surveys for World Environment Day and Queen's Scout awards. The five-year term of the first trustees expired. The Treasurer reported that the Trust's capital had been reduced by 50% in that time. In 1993 a new monument to David Gregory, Australia's first Test Cricket captain was unveiled and the Shed in the Methodist section of the Cemetery was restored. In 1994 the Trust appointed a Coordinator to supervise contractors and Community Service workers and to coordinate gardening tasks. The Department of Conservation and Land Management provided a grant of $4,000. The Carroll Vault was repaired. In 1995 A monument was erected on the original burial site of Mother Mary MacKillop, commemorating her beatification. This monument was funded by Government grants and commercial and private donations. The Trust adopted a Visitor Code for the Cemetery. The Trust again sought a Permanent Conservation Order over the Cemetery, to no avail. A State Government grant was obtained for the preparation of a Plan of Management. A large Sydney Blue Gum tree in the Church of England section came down in a severe storm on 25 September, smashing several monuments. The Plan of Management was prepared in 1996 and adopted by the Trust. The third set of Trustees were appointed in 1997, with David Gray appointed Chairman. Since that time the Trust has been successful in obtaining further financial assistance to conserve the incinerator and the Cornwell vault. Funds have also been obtained for privet eradication and other landscape maintenance works. In 2000 the Trust mounted an exhibition at Willoughby Council to showcase the progress achieved in the 25 years since the Cemetery was closed to burials. New signs were erected at the corner of the Pacific Highway and Westbourne Street and at the southern entrance gates. The Friends continued their invaluable assistance with publication of further biographies of those buried at Gore Hill, and with a program of activities, including open days, guided walks, working bees and their annual Pilgrimage. A proposal by Royal North Shore Hospital for new buildings adjacent to the eastern boundary posed a threat to the visual qualities of the cemetery and to mature vegetation growing along the boundary. A new plan of management prepared by Caroline Tallents of DEM to replace the 1996 plan by Chris Betteridge & David Beaver, will be put on public exhibition shortly. Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery is now under the administration of the Northern Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust, formed by the NSW State Government to combine the operations of Macquarie Park (North Ryde), Field of Mars (Ryde), Frenchs Forest (Davidson) and Gore Hill Cemetery (St. Leonards). A new monument to commemorate the Sisters of Mercy has been erected in the Roman Catholic section which lists the names of the 115 sisters who were buried here from 1916-63. This is in addition to the monument in the Old Roman Catholic Section which lists the names of the 49 sisters buried there from 1886-1963. The Sisters of Mercy, North Sydney established a presence in Sydney at Church Hill in 1865. Led by Mother Mary Ignatrius McQuoin they established their convent and a school for girls which became Monte Sant' Angelo in Miller Street, North Sydney.Friends of Gore Hill Cemetery, newsletter 73, June 2013 Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery had been administered by the Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery Trust until 29 June 2012 when the Northern Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust took over the administration.  Description  Gore Hill Memorial Cemetery is located adjacent to the Pacific Highway, just north of St Leonards and approximately six kilometres north of the Sydney CBD. The Cemetery is divided into two major spaces by the central Carriageway. Further spaces are created by hedge plantings between denominational sections, particularly between the old Roman Catholic and Church of England sections. The landscape character is one of enclosed space, defined by dense evergreen tree plantings along the Cemetery boundaries and down either side of the Carriageway. Rows of mature palms along the main pathways are a distinctive landscape feature of the western portion of the Cemetery. Historic photographic evidence suggests that the major internal spaces were largely devoid of trees. However, in the last twenty or thirty years reduced levels of maintenance have resulted in considerable overgrowth. Recent management policy has been to remove woody self-sown plants but the landscape is still more heavily vegetated than in the past. The layout of the paths on a grid pattern enabled the creation of focal points at a number of intersections. Most prominent of these in the western part of the Cemetery are the octagonal Jesuit plot in the Old Catholic section, and the circular Hordern plot in the Church of England section. In the eastern part, the most prominent focal point is the Catholic Robing Room. The older sections, particularly on the western side of the Cemetery, are characterised by a concentration of grand monuments and vaults, featuring a variety of materials and designs. By contrast the low-lying Baptist section is more uniform in character, with simpler layout and monuments. The architectural design studio, built on the site of the former Sexton's Cottage, is of distinctive modern design, but has been landscaped to minimise its visual impact on the Cemetery. The cemetery contains a number of buildings associated with its use as a burial place. In addition, on the site of the former Sexton's Cottage, there is a modern building, designed as a studio and offices for a firm of architects who have a long-term lease on that part of the site. ;Buildings in the Cemetery are: *The Lich Gate, at the entrance to the Old Roman Catholic section, close to the Carriageway. This structure served as a place where the funeral party traditionally stopped and rested the coffin while they waited for the priest to arrive. It has a brick base, with timber posts supporting a gabled roof, clad with shingles. The Lich Gate was restored in 1983, only to be damaged soon afterwards by a truck associated with a film crew shooting a picture in the Cemetery. The damage was repaired with insurance funds provided by the film company. The Lich Gate is in good condition and is used by visitors as a shelter (it has seats on either side of the central path) particularly by the Friends during their regular working bees and annual pilgrimage. *The Shelter Shed, in the Methodist section, adjacent to the Carriageway, is a timber framed and clad building approximately 4 metres long and 2.5 metres wide. It has lattice panels either side of the north facing opening with a shingle clad awning. The gabled roof is clad with Marseilles pattern tiles and has decorative timber barge boards. The interior features benches on three sides, an internal lining of ripple iron and tessellated tile floor. The shed was erected to provide shelter for Cemetery visitors and at that time featured a stained glass window in its southern elevation and displayed Cemetery notices on its western exterior wall. The building has undergone staged repairs in recent years and is in generally good condition. *The Catholic Robing Room, was built around the turn of the Century and served as a changing room for priests attending funerals. It is built in the Arts and Crafts style, of masonry construction with rough cast render applied to the exterior walls and is painted cream. The pyramidal roof is clad in timber shingles and capped with a copper-clad cross. Two black slate steps lead into an in situ terrazzo floor, the centre of which is decorated with a black wreath pattern. The interior features two large wardrobes / cupboards built in to the western corners. Casement windows on three sides are shuttered with timber louvred screens. The building is approximately 5 metres square and is in good condition. The robing room is used for meetings by the Friends and the Trust during the summer months when there is sufficient ambient light available. It is in good condition. *The Methodist Workers Shed, is a very simple utilitarian structure with brick walls and a Marseilles pattern tiled roof. It is 3.5 metres long and 2.5 metres wide. This building has been restored recently, is in good condition and is used for storage. *The Site Office/Storage Shed, located between the Carriageway and Gore Hill Park consists of two parts, a timber framed, weatherboard clad shed with a more recent brick annexe, the latter at a lower level and containing a shower recess and storage area. The overall size of the building is approximately 5.5 metres long and 2 metres deep. The whole building is painted Mid Brunswick Green to reduce its visual impact. The brick part is of a style inconsistent with other structures and the timber section, apart from the floor boards, is in very poor condition as a result of termite attack. *The Toilets, located near the southern end of the Carriageway adjoining Gore Hill Park, are simple, brick structures, approximately one metre square, with gabled roofs clad with tiles. One has been restored and contains a single water closet. The other is in a ruinous state. *The Incinerator, located on the western side of the Carriageway in the Baptist Section, is a brick structure approximately 2 metres wide and 3 metres deep with concrete cover to the fire box and a tall brick chimney. The structure has been vandalised in recent times and requires stabilisation and repointing to render its safe. The Cemetery contains a wealth of funerary monuments exhibiting a wide range of styles and construction materials. The greatest number of burials date from the period 1900 to 1930, and are modest memorials. There are also many earlier monuments which are excellent examples of craftsmanship and religious symbolism. Included among the memorials are plots containing the remains of members of religious orders, such as Jesuit Priests and the Sisters of St Joseph. A number of family vaults are located in various parts of the cemetery. Marble, sandstone, granite, trachyte and brick are the main materials used for monuments in the Cemetery and some have cast or wrought iron surrounds. The dramatic landscape of funerary architecture, particularly in the older sections of the Cemetery is dominated by elaborate crosses, pillars, and sculptures. Common monument types from the late 19th and early 20th Centuries found in the Cemetery include: * Calvary and Celtic crosses * Pedestals * Obelisks * Columns / Broken columns * Urns / Draped urns * Angels * Composite - angel and cross Since the end of World War I there has been a trend towards more modest \\"slab and desk\\" type monuments. The Cemetery is divided into two main areas by a central avenue, historically known as The Carriageway, which runs from Westbourne Street in the north to the Pacific Highway in the south. Originally gravel, the Carriageway was surfaced with blue metal in 1901 and then bitumen in 1930. A length along the boundary with the old Roman Catholic and Church of England sections was paved in brick. By the late 1970s the condition of the bitumen paving had deteriorated considerably and a decision was taken by the Gore Hill Cemetery Steering Committee to remove the bitumen and resurface the Carriageway with turf. At the same time, the brick paving along the western side was extended along the entire length to facilitate movement of motor vehicles (e.g. trucks for garbage collection) and to provide a hard surface exit into the Gore Hill Oval carpark. The Carriageway is edged with deep, brick-lined drains, and has low brick walls along much of its length. Condition of the turf varies with season but the condition of the grassed and paved sections of the Carriageway is generally good. Denominational sections within the Cemetery are served by a gridwork of brick-paved paths which provide access to the burial plots and the means of movement throughout the Cemetery. It is likely that the bricks used for paving in the Cemetery were produced in the brickworks that adjoined the site during the early twentieth century. The paths vary in width, but are mostly around one metre wide. Condition varies but management has made a point of keeping the paths cleared of weed growth and sediment buildup to allow reasonable public access to all parts of the site. There are a number of bench-type seats, dating from the 1980s, at various locations in the Cemetery, mostly on brick-paved areas adjacent to the Carriageway. The northern boundary, with Westbourne Street, is fenced with a steel post and chain-wire mesh fence erected in the 1980s to control public access and intrusion of motor vehicles into the Cemetery from Westbourne Street which is used heavily by students at the TAFE College and by visitors to Royal North Shore Hospital. The northern entry to the Carriageway is controlled by a lockable steel chain strung between timber posts, with a removable central timber bollard. The western boundary, along the Pacific Highway, from the corner of Westbourne Street, to the corner of Gore Hill Park, is fenced with a steel fence, comprising tubular steel posts with decorative finial caps and intervening panels of chain-wire mesh supported on tubular steel; frames. The panels are surmounted by decorative serrated cappings of cast iron. This fence has been damaged in places from time to time by motor vehicles losing control on the Highway and crashing into the fence or by vandals removing panels to gain access to the Cemetery. Management, including the Trust, have made every effort to keep this perimeter fence in good order and its condition is generally good. Many of the decorative cappings and post finials have been lost over the years. The southern end of the Carriageway is controlled by a pair of wrought iron vehicular gates, supported on massive sandstone posts, with pedestrian gates either side. These gates, erected in 1902, were conserved in the 1980s and are in generally good condition. The vehicular gates are kept locked for security reasons and to prevent vehicular egress onto the Highway at a dangerous spot on a curve with poor lines of sight. The eastern boundary, with the Royal North Shore Hospital and Gore Hill Park, and part of the southern boundary, with Gore Hill Park, are unfenced. The Carriageway has low brick walls constructed along much of its length. These date from 1903 and were restored during the 1980s. Other structures include a steel arbour over a path into the Congregational section, a stone arch into the Baptist section, and the incinerator at the north eastern corner of the Baptist section. The vegetation of Gore Hill Cemetery comprises original plantings of ornamental species, self-sown plants derived from these over the years, invasive weeds, and remnants of indigenous vegetation, also with self- sown offspring. As with many historic cemeteries, the original ornamental plantings at Gore Hill Cemetery were evergreen species of trees and shrubs, many with symbolic meanings associated with religious beliefs such as everlasting life, victory over death, undying love, eternal friendship, mourning and remembrance. = Condition = As at 19 February 2001, the cemetery is maintained in a state of \\"controlled overgrowth\\", a management regime in which paths are kept clear, invasive woody weeds are controlled, all buildings are maintained, some graves are maintained under care agreements. The Cemetery is largely intact, except for the loss of the Church of England Robing Room/Chapel (burned down 1975), the Sexton's Cottages (first demolished c.1949, second demolished 1984) and damage due to vandalism and natural decay. = Modifications and dates = *Caretaker's Residence constructed 1886. *Picket fence high erected along Lane Cove Road (now Pacific Highway) boundary 1890. *General Section east of Carriageway redesigned 1894. *Carriageway regraded and guttered 1898-1900. *Carriageway surfaced with blue metal 1900-01. *Some monuments from Devonshire Street (Sandhills) Cemetery relocated to Gore Hill 1900-01. *Iron gates with stone piers erected at southern end of Cemetery 1902. *Extensions to Church of England Section and creation of a Baptist Section 1903. *Brick retaining walls constructed along Carriageway. *New Sexton's Cottage built 1949. *Cemetery closed to burials from 18 May 1974. *Pacific Highway boundary fence repaired 1982-84. *Turfing of Carriageway and extension of brick paving down western side of Carriageway 1982-84. *Restoration of main gates at southern end of Cemetery 1982-84. *Landscape improvements at both ends of Carriageway 1982-84. *Restoration of Lych Gate and Shelter Shed 1982-84. *Removal of dead trees, replanting of shrubs, restoration of brickwork and clearing of paths 1982-84. *Marker pegs installed to identify denominational sections 1982-84. *Architectural design studio and offices for Edwards Madigan Torzillo Briggs built on site of former Sexton's Cottage 1984. *Major program of rubbish removal, weeding, repair of damaged paths and clearing of blocked drains 1990. *Plumbing and bottled gas connected to Gardener's Shed 1990. *Memorial garden established along eastern side of Carriageway wall 1991. *Dead palms removed from old Catholic section and tree surgery on several major trees 1991. *One of toilets repaired, with new door 1991. *Interpretive signs erected at Gardener's Shed/Office 1991. *Boundary fence along Pacific Highway repaired 1991. *Wilson and Skene vaults conserved 1992. *Monument to David Gregory, Australia's first test cricket captain erected 1993. *Methodist Shed restored 1993. *Carroll Vault repaired 1994. *Monument erected on original burial site of Mother Mary MacKillop 1995. *Incinerator repaired 1996. *New signs erected at each end of the Cemetery 2000. *Cornwell Vault conserved 2000.

He was twelve years old when he was enrolled at the Seminary of San Luis Potosi (Seminario Conciliar Guadalupano Josefino), and he graduated in 1878, took an advanced degree in 1879, and passed his law examination there in October 1880. Subsequently, he assumed the Latin chair and the Civil Law chair there. In 1883, he published La Voz de San Luis (The Voice of San Luis), a series of broadsides to celebrate the centennial of the birth of Agustín de Iturbide. The next year, he joined with Ambrosio Ramirez and Juan N. Ruelas to found the newspaper El Estandarte (The Standard) in San Luis Potosi which proceeded to publish articles critical of the government, as well as literary and historical articles, written mostly by Velázquez. Velázquez espoused Christian social doctrine in his editorials, and encouraged others to submit articles on local history and folklore. El Estandarte was very successful going from biweekly to daily in 1890 and continuing to be published until the end of 1911. Velázquez made his home a gathering point for those interested in the history of San Luis Potosi, and impromptu seminars were regular occurrences. He was a pioneer in archaeological research in San Luis Potosi, not only excavating himself, but encouraging the work of others. Velázquez belonged to a number of organizations, local, national, and international, among them were: Academia Mexicana de la Historia, Real Academia de la Lengua, and Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística.

He is most notable for his translation of the Tao Te Ching. Many of these translations appeared in his 1884 Taoist Texts: Ethical, Political and Speculative, also known simply as Taoist Texts.Tao Te Ching at Sacred Texts Sinology The Chinese character 道 Tao or Dao in Taoism Comparing translations of the same passages in the Tao Te Ching by two sinologists, separated by a century, shows the tendency away from literal exposition in favor of figurative, artistic prose in Taoist studies. *Frederic H. Balfour, 1884: ::Although the Great Principle of Nature – Tao – has no form, it brought forth and nourishes Heaven and Earth; though it has no passions, it causes the Sun and Moon to revolve; though it has no name, it produces the growth and nurture of all things. As I do not know its name, I am compelled to call it simply, Tao. :::Now this Principle includes the pure and the turbid; the active and the motionless. For instance, Heaven is pure, and Earth turbid; Heaven moves, and the Earth is still. The Masculine is pure, the feminine turbid; the Masculine is active and the Feminine at rest. Emerging from its source and flowing on to all its developments, it produced the visible creation. The pure is the origin of the turbid, and the active of the motionless. If a man is able to remain permanently pure and motionless, Heaven and Earth will both at once come and dwell in him. (tr. Balfour 1884) *Livia Kohn, 1993: ::The Great Tao has no form; It brings forth and raises heaven and earth. The Great Tao has no feelings; It regulates the course of the sun and the moon. The Great Tao has no name; It raises and nourishes the myriad beings. I do not know its name – So I call it Tao. :::The Tao can be pure or turbid; moving or tranquil. Heaven is pure, earth is turbid; Heaven is moving, earth is tranquil. The male is moving, the female is tranquil. Descending from the origin, Flowing toward the end, The myriad beings are being born. Purity – the source of turbidity, Movement – the root of tranquility. Always be pure and tranquil; Heaven and earth Return to the primordial. (tr. Kohn 1993) Frederic H. Balfour also was sceptical that Laozi was the author of the Taoist book Tao Te Ching; notably writing in Leaves from my Chinese Scrapbook that Laozi \\"is a philosopher who never lived.\\" Balfour believed that Laozi was an amalgam of wise ministers, or perhaps a literary device which Chuang Tzu used, as he expounded on his philosophy to students; very similar to the academic debate over the Greek philosopher Socrates.Balfour, Frederic H. Leaves from my Chinese Scrapbook in \\"Biographies of Immortals – Legends of China,\\" ELPN Press (February, 2010) Man of letters Frederic H. Balfour was a prolific religious scholar, and published several volumes discussing the implications of theism on emerging societies. He also wrote several lengthy discourses on agnosticism. His letters about famine conditions in China were highly regarded, as little credible news regularly made it out of China during this period. Many of these letters appeared in Harper's Magazine.Harper's Magazine Restored Archives Balfour published several novels; under his own name, as well as under the pseudonym Ross George Dering.Publisher's Weekly For most of his time in China, Balfour worked as editor-in-chief for North China Daily News, The Shanghai Evening Courier, and The Celestial Empire newspapers.The Returns of Trade at the Treaty Ports in China Frederick H.

They were Shoodars before independence, as it's in history, they were forced to accept Islam, while some historians state that they were sex slaves of Mughals. Others believe they're descendants of Clan Loot. It developed as a port around the 15th century AD. The port was used for the coastal trade between northern Odisha and Kolkata to the northeast, and continued to be used to a small extent after independence in 1947. During April, 1998, an agreement was signed to develop the Port of Dhamara, about seven kilometers away on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, as a deep water port. The temple of the Goddess Maa Dhamrai is located in the town. Some say that the goddess was brought from Sri Lanka by a local merchant who frequently traded with that island.
