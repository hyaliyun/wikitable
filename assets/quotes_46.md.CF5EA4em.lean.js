It can be defined as the intracellular accumulation of a radioactive tracer based on the relative metabolic activity of the body's tissues. It is a basic principle of the design of radiopharmaceuticals as metabolic probesprobe in biochemistry is: Any group of atoms or molecules radioactively labeled in order to study a given molecule or other structure for functional studies or tumor location.. Gallagher, Brian M and et al. Metabolic Trapping as a Principle of Radiopharmaceutical Design: Some Factors Responsible for the Biodistribution of [18F 2-Deoxy-2-Fluoro-D- Glucose] The Journal of Nuclear Medicine 19:1154-1161,1978 Metabolic trapping is the mechanism underlying the (PET) scan,(Miele, E.; Spinelli, G. P.; Tomao, F.; Zullo, A.; De Marinis, F.; Pasciuti, G.; Rossi, L.; Zoratto, F.; Tomao, S. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiotracers in oncology‚Äìutility of 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET in the management of patients with non- small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2008, 27, 52.) an effective tool for detecting tumors, as there is a greater uptake of the target molecule by tumor tissue than by normal tissue. In order to use it as a diagnostic tool in medicine, scientists have studied the trapping of radioactive molecules within different tissues throughout the body. In 1978, Gallagher et al. studied glucose tagged with Fluorine-18 (F-18) to see how it metabolized in the tissues of different organs. This group studied how long it took the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, and brain to metabolize radioactive glucose. They found the molecule distributed uniformly, and then, after two hours, only the heart and the brain had significant levels of radioactivity from the F-18 due to metabolic trapping. This trapping occurred because once the glucose was pulled into the cells, the glucose was phosphorylated to cause the concentration of glucose in the cell to appear lower than it is, which then promotes the transport of more glucose. This phosphorylation of the radioactive glucose caused the metabolic trapping in the heart and the brain. The lungs, liver, and kidneys did not experience metabolic trapping, and the radioactive glucose that was not trapped was excreted in the urine. F-18 radiolabeled glucose did not get collected by the kidneys and cycled back into the system, as it would do for normal glucose. This suggests that the active transporter requires the hydroxyl (-OH) group found on the C-2 position of the sugar, where the F-18 atom was placed. Without the active transport, the radiolabeled glucose that was not trapped was then excreted as waste instead of being phosphorylated in the cell.. Gallagher, Brian M and et al. Metabolic Trapping as a Principle of Radiopharmaceutical Design: Some Factors Responsible for the Biodistribution of [18F 2-Deoxy-2-Fluoro-D-Glucose] The Journal of Nuclear Medicine 19:1154-1161,1978 A 2001 study of metabolic trapping used choline derivatives, which were synthesized using F-18, to label prostate cancer. The experiments were conducted first in mice and then in human patients. Choline (CH) and choline radiolabeled with F-18 (FCH) were both found to primarily migrate to the kidneys and liver in their experiment. This is different from the earlier experiment with glucose due to the difference in mechanism and metabolic need of glucose versus choline in the body. Phosphorylation was again found to be responsible for the trapping of the tracer in the tissues.DeGrado, T. R.; Coleman, R. E.; Wang, S.; Baldwin, S. W.; Orr, M. D.; Robertson, C. N.; Polascik, T.

She represented her nation at the 2007 and 2008 UCI Road World Championships. Athletic career Butterfield first began competing in triathlon becoming the Australian Junior Triathlon Champion in 2001 and the Under 23 World Triathlon Champion in 2003. In 2005, she switched from ITU racing to non-drafting where she raced two Ironman competitions, several half Ironman races and the 2005 ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships where she placed fifth. Feeling overtrained, burned out and injured she switched to cycling in 2006. Butterfield raced as a cyclist for 4 years. In 2006, while racing in Europe, she won five races and had 15 podium placings. However, she was not selected to represent Australia at the World Championships that year due to her \\"lack of experience.\\" She continued to compete in World Cup races over the next two years with some success despite battling external iliac artery endofibrosis. In 2008, she had surgery to correct this and focused on making the Australian cycling team for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Despite strong results she was left off the Olympic team due to concern over how well she had recovered from her surgery. At the 2008 UCI Road World Championships she took 15th in the women's road race, the highest placing female Australian. The following year she was left off of the 2009 UCI World Championships. Expressing disappointment with the political process she took time off to have her first baby, Savana. Five months after giving birth she switched back to triathlon where she took fourth place at the Hy-Vee Triathlon and then won the 2011 Ironman 70.3 Syracuse. She followed that up with a win the 2012 Abu Dhabi International Triathlon. She made a second return to the sport in 2014, finishing third at the Ironman 70.3 Mandurah Australian Pro Championship less than 10 months after the birth of the couple's son Walker, but she subsequently announced her decision to step back from professional competition in January 2015. In July 2015 she returned to race Ironman 70.3 Racine and subsequently accepted a slot to compete at the 2015 Ironman 70.3 World Championship where she placed 17th.

Life  Siebert studied mathematics starting 1984 at the University of Erlangen. In 1986, he changed to the University of Bonn and in 1987 to the University of G√∂ttingen where he finished his Diplom in 1989 under the supervision of Hans Grauert with distinction. He became Grauert's PhD student and assistant in G√∂ttingen. He received his PhD in 1992 (Faserzykelr√§ume, geometrische Plattifikation und meromorphe √Ñquivalenzrelationen). A stay at the Courant Institute followed in 1993‚Äì94 after which we went to Bochum. In 1997‚Äì98 he spent some time at the MIT as a visiting scholar before completing his habilitation in Bochum in 1998 (Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants for general symplectic manifolds). As a DFG- Heisenberg Fellow, he went to the Universit√§t Paris VI/Universit√§t Paris VII from 2000 to 2002. From there, he was called to a professorship at the Albert- Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg in 2002. He moved on to the Universit√§t Hamburg in 2008, and in 2011, he became the head of the Graduiertenkolleg Mathematics Inspired by String Theory and QFT. In 2018, Siebert joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin as a professor of mathematics and holds the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair in Mathematics #4. In his research, Bernd Siebert contributed substantially to the theory of Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants. Around 2002 by his insights in logarithmic geometry, he entered into an ongoing joint research program with Mark Gross. This generated a sequence of relevant papers that relate to Mirror Symmetry and tropical geometry. In 2014, jointly with Mark Gross, he became an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematics in Seoul for the section complex geometry (Local mirror symmetry in the tropics).

Description  Generally 5x5 table used, while there are possible variations with different dimensions, coloured cells and values. Focus on the grid centre and find all the numbers (letters) with your peripheral vision, i.e. without moving your eyes.  Interpretation of results  Completion speed and number of mistakes are the measurement of the efficiency. From the results of each table the ‚Äúexhausting curve‚Äù could be built which reflects attention stability and peripheral vision functionality. Other measurements which could be calculated based on Schulte Table performance include: *work efficiency (WE); *work warming-up (WU); *psychological stability (PS). WE = (T1 + T2 + ‚Ä¶ + Tn) / n, where Ti - completion time of table i. WU = T1 / WE The result of 1,0 and lower shows good warming-up, while 1,0 and more means that one needs more time to prepare for the main work (warm-up). PS = Tn-1 / WE The result of 1,0 and less shown good psychological stability. Positive effects include attention stability, improved visual perception, improved peripheral vision, and development of speed reading.  History  The Schulte Table was developed originally as a psycho-diagnostic test to study the properties of attention, by German psychiatrist and psychotherapist Walter Schulte (1910 ‚Äî 1972)). From 1962 to 1972 Professor Schulte worked in T√ºbingen, where he worked in psychopathology and psychotherapy research.

It is approximately long and flows through Hazle Township. The stream is in the Eastern Middle Anthracite Field and a number of anticlinals are situated near it. In the early 1900s, it was a clear stream with a slight sulfur contamination. Coal is found in the stream's vicinity. Course Long Run has no flow for its entire length. It begins on a hill just north of Harwood, to the north of Pennsylvania Route 924 and to the east of Interstate 81. The stream flows north for a few tenths of a mile, flowing off the hill and into a valley. It continues flowing north for a short distance, passing several small ponds. The stream then reaches its confluence with Cranberry Creek. Long Run arrives at its confluence with Cranberry Creek on the latter creek's left bank. Hydrology Long Run was described as being a clear stream in a 1916 report by the Pennsylvania Water Supply Commission. However, the same report noted that the stream had traces of sulfur contamination within its waters. This was due to the fact that the stream flowed over a coal outcrop. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Long Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. An anticlinal known as Cranberry Ridge crosses the headwaters of Long Run. An anticlinal known as Tomhicken Ridge is situated to the north of the stream. The stream is in the Hazleton Basin, which is the largest coal basin in the Eastern Middle Anthracite Field. Long Run flows over an outcrop of coal in one location. There are coal measures near the source of the stream. Watershed Long Run is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Conyngham. Pennsylvania Route 924 and Interstate 81 are near the headwaters of the stream. The communities of Hollars Hill, Harwood, and Green Ridge are all within a mile (two kilometers) of it. Long Run is one of eleven officially named streams in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek that has not been assessed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. History Long Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202234. The stream appears in the Atlas of the Anthracite Coalfields of Pennsylvania and was entered into the Geographic Names Information System for that reason.

Located near the mouth of the Sebec River where it meets the Piscataquis River, these sites include several deeply stratified sites covering 5,000 years of history dating back to 8,300 BCE. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description Milo is located in central Maine, about north of the coast. The Sebec River flows roughly south through the town, meeting the Piscataquis near its southern border. The Piscataquis River flows east, joining the Penobscot River at Howland. The area lies at the junction of the coastal lowlands and the more mountainous upland areas to the north. The confluence of the two rivers is an area that has seen regular sedimentary deposits along its banks. The area was first briefly surveyed by the pioneering archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead in the 1920s, and was probably also studied by amateur archaeologists in the 1930s. An amateur affiliated with the Maine Archaeological Society performed a test excavation in 1982, which exposed the deeply-stratified nature of the site and yielded date of c. 8300 BCE in the lowest layer that had datable cultural materials. These findings prompted professional investigation in subsequent years under the general auspices of a program to survey the entire Piscataquis rivershed for archaeological sites. This later work identified additional sites in the area. The stratifications of these sites show layers of deposited sediment, with evidence of hearths in between. Along with the fire-cracked stone of the hearths, stone tools, bone fragments, and ceramic remains were found. The Brigham Site, the most intensively investigated, had six separate layers of datable cultural materials, the youngest at c. 1100 CE, and the oldest at c. 8300 BCE. The most common identifiable animal remains were of beaver.

The reverse post-material thesis or reverse post-materialism thesisCarroll, W. (2014) Far Right Parties and Movements in Europe, Japan, and the Tea Party in the U.S.: A Comparative Analysis, Journal of Power, Politics & Governance, June 2014, Vol. 2, No. 2, p 220 is an academic theory used to explain support for far-right political parties and right-wing populist political parties. The thesis is modelled on the post-material thesis from sociology that has been used to explain the shift in Western societies from traditional economic interests towards issues such as environmentalism and feminism.Pisoiu, D. and Ahmed, R. (2016), 'Capitalising on Fear: The Rise of Right-Wing Populist Movements in Western Europe', OSCE Yearbook 2015, Baden-Baden 2016, p. 172 Core premise The thesis begins from the premise that, during the 1970s and 1980s, centre-left parties embraced a post-material agenda, with less concern for traditional class and economic interests and greater concern for issues such as feminism, environmentalism, liberal internationalist values, and LGBT rights and other sexual freedoms. Bornschier argues that the \\"populist right‚Äôs ideological core consists of opposition to the process of societal modernization that has accelerated since the 1960s\\". According to this thesis, this post-material agenda, while more likely to appeal to the young and the more educated voters, is seen as irrelevant to material concerns, particularly of working-class unskilled males.Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 52-53 Criticism Roger Eatwell argues that the reverse post-material thesis is insufficient to explain local variations in support for extreme-right parties ‚Äî for instance, to explain why the British National Party did well in Oldham at the 2001 General Election but relatively poorly in neighbouring Blackburn. See Eatwell, R. (2017) 'Ten Theories of the Extreme Right' in 'The Populist Radical Right: A Reader', Mudde, C. (ed), Routledge: Abingdon, pp. 409-410 Merkel and Weinberg argue that, in Europe, post-material values are strongest in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Netherlands, but as the extreme-right is generally weaker in these countries, the post-material thesis is insufficient on its own as an explanation for far-right support.Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) Right- wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century, Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 53 Pisoiu and Ahmed argue that the French National Front and Flemish Interest (Vlaams Belang) in fact have an anti-materialist philosophy that prioritises political issues over economic concerns.

The founder of Handful of Films, he produces and hosts one-off and series documentaries in partnership with CBC's science-and-nature program The Nature of Things. He has won three Canadian Screen Awards for \\"Best Science and Nature Documentary\\" (Code Breakers, 2011; The Great Human Odyssey, 2015; Equus - Story of the Horse, 2019), his films have won 32 Alberta Film Awards, and he is a two-time winner of the Edmonton Film Prize. Thompson studied Russian at the University of Alberta and McGill University before completing a masters at London's School of Slavonic and East European Studies. For his PhD at University of Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute he lived in Russia's remote Chukotka region, following the impact of Roman Abramovich's modernization program in the early 2000s. Four of his documentaries were partly filmed with indigenous people in Chukotka. Thompson was raised partly in the northern Alberta Cree community of Wabasca-Desmarais, where his father Jamie Thompson made wood-canvas canoes. He speaks Russian, Danish and French. His mother Sharon Poetker Thompson is a landscape painter. Thompson described his ambition in film making, stating \\"I want my children to grow up in a scientifically literate society, where films that explore the natural world play a central role\\" Thompson credits conservationist David Suzuki and veteran Canadian filmmaker Tom Radford for his introduction to film. He also works with the Canadian verit√© specialist Rosie Dransfeld.  Documentaries  Thompson's Equus - Story of the Horse launched CBC's 2018/19 season of The Nature of Things. In this three-part series, Thompson explored the impact of horsepower on human history and joined in the lives of horse cultures in Siberia, Arabia, Mongolia and the Canadian Rockies. Filmed over two years with a small Canadian crew, this series had unique access to the discovery of a human skeleton in Kazakhstan belonging to the Botai culture, the earliest humans to domesticate horses. Thompson also collaborated with Martin Fischer at the University of Jena (Germany) to create the first accurate animation of \\"Dawn Horse\\", the ancestor of modern horses, using the 40m year old fossil remains of Eurohippus messelensis. The film crew was the first to capture the winter migration of Kazakh nomads living Mongolia's Altai Mountains, living and travelling with a family of herders over two weeks in early 2017. In 2016, Thompson directed two related documentaries on organ transplant medicine, in collaboration with ID:Productions and the National Film Board of Canada. The feature-length Memento Mori and the one-hour Vital Bonds are based on exceptional access to one of Canada's busiest organ transplant hospitals, and feature sequences with a family losing their son to a fentanyl poisoning and making the decision to donate his organs. Vital Bonds debuted on CBC's The Nature of Things in November 2016. For the three-part series on human origins, The Great Human Odyssey (2015), Thompson followed the emergence of modern humans in Africa and our subsequent settlement of the planet. Over 18 months of shooting, the crew worked in 17 countries on 5 continents, filming with the Badjao of the Philippines, the San Bushmen of the Namibian Kalahari, Chukchi nomads in Arctic Russia, and the Crocodile People of Papua New Guinea. In 2016, working with film composer Darren Fung, Thompson produced a live orchestral performance of Great Human Odyssey for the stage, which premiered with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. For the feature documentary Tipping Point: Age of the Oil Sands (2011), Thompson featured Dene Elder Francois Paulette and director James Cameron. Code Breakers (2011), about the peopling of the Americas, features the renowned geneticist Eske Willerslev. For The Perfect Runner (2012), Thompson attempted the 125-km Canadian Death Race and featured the ultrarunner Diane Van Deren.

Built in 1903-04 for John Innes Kane, a wealthy grandsonBar Harbor Cottages - MDIHistory.com of John Jacob Astor and designed by local architect Fred L. Savage, it is one of a small number of estate houses to escape Bar Harbor's devastating 1947 fire. An imposing example of Tudor Revival architecture, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Kane Cottage is set on a nearly parcel of land on a bluff overlooking Frenchman Bay, near the village of Bar Harbor. It is a large 2-1/2 story structure, built of stone through the first floor, and of wood frame construction finished in the half-timbered Tudor Revival style on the upper floors. It is roughly L-shaped with a complex cross-gabled roof configuration. Gable ends are typically decorated with vergeboard and pendants below the roofline and finials above, and the eaves of the roofline are flared. The western facade presents the land-side entrance, which is set under a projecting gable-roofed portico supported by heavy wooden timbers. The eastern facade faces the water, and is composed symmetrically, with outer cross gables flanking a porch area in the center. A servant's wing extends west from the northern end of the building. Although the exterior is clearly Tudor Revival in character, the interior has essentially Colonial Revival styling applied to a Tudor Revival layout. The entry leads into a great hall, from which other living areas are accessed via stairs and hallways. The great hall is lavishly decorated with Colonial Revival woodwork, including Tuscan columns, paneling, and crown molding. Similar details, although less elaborate, are also found in the private spaces upstairs. A parlor space lies on the ocean side south of the great hall, with a library behind. The dining room is north of the great hall, with the giant hearth obscuring the entry into the butler's pantry, which connects the dining room to the kitchen spaces in the service wing. The estate includes the original carriage house and caretaker's house, which were built at the same time as the main house. The Kane Cottage was designed by local architect Fred L. Savage and built in 1903-04 for John Innes Kane, a wealthy socialite who was a great-grandson of John Jacob Astor. It remained in the hands of Astor descendants until 1955, and deteriorated in condition in the later decades of the 20th century. It has since been restored, and is available for summer rentals.

He won the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1962. Early life Crahay was born in Li√®ge. His mother, Francoise Crahay, was a Belgian couturier who gave her son his first experience as a sketcher for her when he was 13. Between 1934 and 1936, he studied art and fashion in Paris before rejoining his mother in the business. During the Second World War Crahay was a non-commissioned officer in the Belgian Army before being captured and spending five years as a prisoner-of-war in Germany. Career After the War, Crahay opened his own haute couture house in Paris in 1951, but it was unsuccessful. In Crahay's words, it was a \\"financial flop after one year,\\" but he was subsequently employed by Robert Ricci as a designer for his mother's couture house. In 1959, he was made chief designer for Nina Ricci. While at Ricci, his bell-skirted suits and small-waisted dresses were described as having \\"charm,\\" and described as the \\"youngest, most feminine thing in Paris.\\" Crahay joined Lanvin in 1964. Following his first collection, the journalist Eugenia Sheppard declared \\"Crahay's gay, wisecracking style and Lanvin's elegant workroom get together like bread and butter. Lanvin calms down Crahay and Crahay peps up the conservative old house.\\" She also described how his colours stood out among that season's \\"terribly washed-out\\" palette, praised his use of abstract, \\"unromantic\\" prints, and noted his inventive coatdresses. Crahay was known for combining a wide range of influences and sources of inspiration in his designs, rather than focusing on single sources. Two 1971 ensembles called M√°laga (after the Spanish municipality) and Djerba (after the North African island) were made up in exclusive fabrics by the Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi. A 1977 collection combined references to Russia, Tibet and North Africa. Crahay's last collection at Lanvin before he retired in 1984 won the Golden Thimble award for the season's best couture collection.

She currently lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand. She represented Thailand at the 51st Venice Biennale (2005), and exhibited at dOCUMENTA(13) in Kassel, 2012. In January 2015 her first retrospective in the United States opened at SculptureCenter, New York. She received a Fine Art degree from Silpakorn University, Bangkok in 1986, and Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste Braunschweig in Germany. Araya listed the death date of her parents and her grandmother on her curriculum vitae, indicating the importance of including autobiographical and collective experience in her work.  Artworks  Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook experimented with intaglio printmaking and sculptural installations in the 1980s and 1990s, before starting to focus in on film and video. Several of her early sculptural installations have been interpreted as speaking to the position of women in Thai society. In Isolated Hands (1992) and Departure of Thai Country Girls (1995), dismembered parts of female-coded bodies are presented in isolation; in the former, a pair of hands rest on a plate of water, and in the latter, pairs of upside-down legs are lined up on a wooden boat. In Isolated Moral Female Object, in a Relationship with a Male Bird II (1995), an isolated woman's head gazes out through a circular frame containing an image of the sky, while a sculptural bird flies freely through the frame. In the late 1990s and 2000s, Rasdjarmrearnsook began to bring the rituals of the dead into her practice, accompanied by a shift to video work. She created a series of video works dealing with human corpses. This involved her filming her own rituals for the dead at morgues, in collaboration with the medical community. This includes works like A Walk (1996, 2003), Reading for Corpses, (2002), Chant for Female Corpse (2001, 2002), Sudsiri and Araya (2002), I'm Living (2003), Wind Princess, White Birds (2006), the Conversation series (2005) and The Class series (2005). In The Class (2005), for example, she gives a tutorial to six corpses who are lined up in morgue trays. In her series Two Planets (2008) and Village and Elsewhere (2011), Rasdjarmrearnsook looked at the interactions between viewers and artworks when placing reproductions of iconic Western paintings in rural areas in Thailand. In Two Planets (2007‚Äì08), a group of locals in a Thai countryside are presented with reproductions of 19th-century European paintings. They sit with their backs to the camera and their unpretentious reflections on the artworks are subtitled in English. Rasdjarmrearnsook is well-known for her writing as well as for her visual art. The artist has said, \\"I write and make visual art for my spiritual survival. Both help me approach states of mind that I cannot attain in real life. The difference between writing and making art is a question of process, time and the way both reach the viewers and readers.\\" = Solo Exhibitions = * SculptureCenter, New York (2015) * National Gallery, Bangkok (1987, 1992, 1994, 1995, and 2002) * Tensta Konsthall, Stockholm (2003) * Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach (2012) * Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (2012) = Group Exhibitions = * 2012 dOCUMENTA (13), Kassel * 2012 Phantoms of Asia, San Francisco, United States * 2010 17th Biennale of Sydney, Sydney, Australia * 2006 Gwangju Biennale, Gwangju * 2005 51st Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy * 2004 Carnegie International, Pittsburgh * 2003 8.

These living quarters would be visited by the wives of missionaries as part of mission work. The zenana missions were outreach programmes established in British India with the aim of converting women to Christianity. From the mid 19th century, they sent female missionaries into the homes of Indian women, including the private areas of houses - known as zenana - that male visitors were not allowed to see. Gradually these missions expanded from purely evangelical work to providing medical and education services. Hospitals and schools established by these missions are still active, making the zenana missions an important part of the history of Christianity in India. Background Women in India at this time were segregated under the purdah system, being confined to women's quarters known as a zenana, which men unrelated to them were forbidden to enter. The zenana missions were made up of female missionaries who could visit Indian women in their own homes with the aim of converting them to Christianity. The purdah system made it impossible for many Indian women, especially high status women, to access health care, and many were needlessly dying and suffering. By training as doctors and nurses, the women of the zenana missions could be accepted by the women of India in a way that men would not have been. History Lady missionaries in the court of the Zenana Mission House, Peshawar (above); The station class at Sa-yong, Fuhkien, China (below) The Baptist Missionary Society inaugurated zenana missions in India in the mid 19th century. The first zenana mission resulted from a proposal by Thomas Smith in 1840, with the mission beginning in 1854, under the supervision of John Fordyce.\\"When he [Thomas Smith] went to India, it was impossible for male missionaries to reach the women, all of whom above the very lowest class were shut off from the society of men. Smith's proposal in the 'Christian Observer' in 1840 to send lady missionaries and governesses, both European and Indian, into the zenana bore fruit in the first Zenana mission, which was started in 1854.\\"--William Forbes Gray Smith, Thomas (1817-1906) (DNB12) Hana Catherine Mullens is known as one of the most efficient zenana workers in India, and won the title of \\"the Apostle of the Zenanas.\\" In 1856, Mrs. Mullens set up a small school at Bhawanipur, with twenty three students aged between eight and twenty. The Calcutta Normal school was established in the same year, to train native women for zenana work. By the 1880s, the zenana missions had expanded their ministry, opening schools to provide education for girls, including the principles of the Christian faith. This programme also included home visits, the establishment women's hospitals and the opening of segregated women's wards in general hospitals. One society, the Zenana Bible and Medical Mission, was involved in recruiting female doctors, both by persuading female doctors in Europe to come to India and by encouraging Indian women to study medicine in their pursuit of conversion. As a result, the Zenana missions helped break down the male bias against colonial medicine in India to a small extent. The work of the Baptists inspired the formation of a British Anglican missionary society, the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society (founded 1880), which was involved in sending missionaries to mission stations in countries such as India (19th and 20th centuries) and late Qing dynasty China, beginning in 1884. Zenana missionaries had their establishments at Trivandrum, Palamcotta (Sarah Tucker College), Masulipatnam and Madras in South India, and Meerut, Jabalpur, Calcutta and Amritsar in North India.  Bible women in India  Educated Indian Christian women, who worked as assistants to the zenana missionaries were known as Bible women. They came from notable families and worked among poor women in villages, towns, hospitals, schools, etc. The Bible women, helped bridge the vast cultural differences between the English missionaries and the village folk. The Bible women used indigenous ideas to teach and preach their ideals of a Christian God to the women of the subcontinent. They used music to reach out to its wide audience - to attract more women and to provide a commentary on the verses from Bible. Bible women wore white saris and carried cloth covered Bibles, representative of their virtuous identity. They stopped wearing jewellery and deprived themselves of all forms of vanity. Bible women took up various roles in the zenana missions. They taught in girls' schools, which were attended by all classes. Bible women visited the zenana, taught women and girls there, preached religious values and worked for the general good of the women. They also visited native women in hospitals and homes, providing healthcare services and facilities. References External links *Emma Raymond Pitman Indian Zenana Missions.

It is associated with Lord Narasimha, an incarnation (avatar) of Hindu god Vishnu. The ancient temple is excavated in a 300 m tunnel under the Manichoola hill range situated at around 4.8 km from the city.

Bats can be seen hanging on the roof of the cave and flying throughout the tunnel. It is a wonder that no one has been harmed by the bats till date. People utter the words govinda-govinda and narasimha hari-hari with devotion as mantras. The end of the cave temple is the sanctum sanctorum which houses two deities ‚Äì Lord Narasimha and a Shiva Linga which the demon Jharasura (Jalasura) had worshipped. Around eight people can stand and watch this spectacular sight as there is very little space in there. Others need to wait in the water for their turn. Since the water flows continuously and people walk in it, the water does not remain crystal clear. People carry kids into the temple on their shoulder. The water has sulphur in it and is said to have healing properties for people having skin problems. This temple is especially visited by many child seeking couples. As this is one of its kind temple, the overall experience can be thrilling & adventurous. Narasimha Avatar Lord Vishnu guarded the child devotee Prahlada, who was put to endless torture by his father Hiranyakashipu, a Demon, for repeating God's name instead of his own. But Prahlada withstood all these tortures with steadfast devotion. Finally God appeared in the terrible form as Man-Lion, and killed the Hiranyakashipu. In this Man-Lion incarnation, the God's emphasis is on devotion.  Mythology  The fourth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, Lord Narasimha, is half human and half lion. Legend says that Narasimha after killing Hiranyakashipu, slew another giant named Jharasura (Jalasura) who was a staunch devotee of Lord Shiva. While breathing his last, Jharasura beseeched Vishnu (or rather, his incarnation) to reside in the cave in which he was living and to grant boons to devotees. Granting last wish of his, Narasimha came to live in the cave. There is a roughly carved image of Narasimha on a stone wall at the end of the cave. After being killed, the demon turned into water and started flowing down the feet of the Lord Narasimha. The flow of water in the cave tunnel is continuous since then. The spring has never dried out. Geology Narasimha Jharni is a tubular spring. Though Bidar is at an elevation, the temple is at a lower level. It is located amidst the slopes of the hilly terrain. The lateritic rock formation under the plateau enables percolation of surface water. Bidar urban plateau is of irregular shape, land stretching about 35.4 km in length and 19.3 km in width. The plateau consists of red laterite rocky crust, of a depth varying from 30.5 m to 152.4 m supported on impervious trap base. This has resulted in springs at the cleavages between trap and laterite rocks. Such water springs can be observed in Bidar also at Guru Nanak Jhira Sahib Gurudwara, Papanasha Shiva Temple etc. Significance People throng to this temple because it is believed that the Deity at the Narasimha Jharni Cave temple is a swayambhu roopam ‚Äì in other words, the deity is self manifested and is very powerful. Recent developments To facilitate the devotees, the cave temple has been Air conditioned and Electrified for lighting systems. The temple is open from 8AM to 6PM. The facilities at the temple are planned in a systematic way to draw more visitors. Creation of parking space, multi-purpose hall, rooms, overhead tank to ensure adequate water supply to the devotees and a percolation tank to make use of the water coming out of the cave has been taken up. A new approach road to the temple is being constructed to make a \\"systematic\\" entry to the temple. The pre-existing entry was not according to Vaastu. Now they are not allowing pilgrims to enter the cave as the water flow is slow.

Yellowley, 272 U.S. 581 (1926), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that reaffirmed the National Prohibition Act's limitation on the dispensation of alcoholic medicines. The five-to-four decision, written by Justice Louis D. Brandeis, affirmed the dismissal of a suit in which New York City physician Samuel Lambert sought to prevent Edward Yellowley, the acting federal prohibition director, from enforcing the Prohibition Act so as to preclude him from prescribing alcoholic medicines. The decision affirmed the police powers of the individual states, as well as the power of the Necessary and Proper Clause of the United States Constitution, which was cited in upholding the Prohibition Act's limitations as a necessary and proper implementation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Background  The Eighteenth Amendment, which made illegal in the United States the production, transport and sale of alcohol, went into effect on January 17, 1920. Accompanying legislation under the National Prohibition Act stated that physicians with appropriate permits could prescribe alcoholic medicines, but not more than once every 10 days to the same patient. In November 1922, Lambert brought suit in federal court to prevent Yellowley and other officials from interfering with him prescribing liquors to his patients in excess of those allowed under the act, claiming that prescribing liquors more frequently than once every 10 days was sometimes necessary for treating patients, and that the ability to do so was a part of his rights as a physician.. In May 1923, the district court issued an injunction for Lambert, which was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in December 1924. Lambert's appeal contended that in passing the disputed provision of the National Prohibition Act, Congress exceeded the authority granted by the Eighteenth Amendment, and that the provision was thus unconstitutional.  Decision  In ruling against Lambert, the court rejected his claim that the prescription of medicinal liquors was unrelated to the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, stating that such prescriptions opened the door to \\"frauds, subterfuges and artifices\\" that hampered enforcement of the amendment. The court also rejected a right to practice medicine that trumped police power in the United States, or the right of Congress to enact laws that are necessary and proper for fulfilling the intent of the 18th Amendment: Four Justices dissented, in an opinion authored by Justice George Sutherland. The dissent focused on the wording of the 18th Amendment, which provided that \\"... the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors ... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\\" In his view, the amendment left any regulation of liquor sales other than \\"for beverage purposes\\" to state law.Lambert, 272 U.S. at 597 (Sutherland, J., dissenting).  Later history  The ruling was later cited in cases upholding state prohibitions on birth control, such as in Commonwealth v. Gardner (1938), where the Supreme Court unanimously upheld Massachusetts' complete ban on contraceptives, rejecting claims that physicians should be able to prescribe contraceptives to patients in order to save their lives or protect their well-being, and declaring that physicians should not in any way be excepted from enforcement of the statute. Connecticut's contraception ban was similarly upheld by the Connecticut Supreme Court in State v. Nelson (1940), which also cited Lambert in its ruling. As in Massachusetts, the court recalled Lambert in saying such laws were \\"a legitimate exercise of the state's police power to preserve and protect public morals.\\" More recently, Lambert has been cited in Supreme Court cases by justices arguing for the legitimacy of state laws banning late term abortions..

Felines led the club to an impressive second place in the 1988‚Äì89 campaign, but was sacked in January 1990 after a poor season in the main category overall. Shortly after he was named Racing de Santander manager, achieving another promotion in 1991. After two years at Talavera CF Felines re-joined Rayo for a third spell, but his reign only lasted two months. He subsequently returned to Talavera, narrowly missing out the play-offs in two consecutive seasons. Felines subsequently resumed his career in Segunda Divisi√≥n B and Tercera Divisi√≥n, managing UD Marbella, CF Fuenlabrada, CD Guadalajara, Real Balomp√©dica Linense and Getafe CF. With the latter he achieved promotion to the second level in 2002, but was relieved from his duties on 19 January 2003.El Getafe destituye a Felines y Pepe Mel confirma que lo sustituir√° (Getafe sacks Felines and Pepe Mel confirms he will replace him); Diario AS, 19 January 2003 In August 2003 Felines was appointed at the helm of Badajoz,Felines ya da √≥rdenes a la plantilla del Badajoz (Felines already rules Badajoz's squad); El Peri√≥dico de Extremadura, 10 August 2003 but was sacked in February of the following year.

With a floor space of 60,000 square meters and about 135 specialty shops, it was according to a survey for the year 2002, the most profitable shopping center in Germany, the average revenue per square meter was twice as high as the national average. In designing the state capital, it is recognized as an integrated site with the function of a district center, and through its size has an important role for the entire southeast of the metropolitan Munich.  History  The shopping center was - like the surrounding district of Neuperlach - built by the real estate developer Neue Heimat Bayern. It summed up three existing neighborhood centers at the time, Quiddezentrum, Plettenbergzentrum and Marxzentrum as a central community center for non-daily needs. At its opening on March 5, 1981, after three years of construction, it represented 65 shops on a total area of 30,000 square meters at that time. The realization was taken over by architect Ernst H√ºrlimann, to which design elements were integrated, including a five-meter high stone oak tree in the center of the building and a red brick floor. In 1984 the property was purchased, for the equivalent of ‚Ç¨54 million, by Deutsche Grundbesitz-Investment Gesellschaft mbH (DGI) - a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. The previously planned acquisition of the new home by a medium-sized tenants consortium, which also included the member of parliament Henry Traublinger did not materialize. On November 23, 1989, the DGI opened the expansion at the Thomas-Dehler-Str. with 30 additional shops. The key component of the new building was a glass dome with 24 meters in diameter. Two loading zones that were created through the expansion, both of which are created as a roundel and are connected by a central block, still exists today. A further expansion and modernization took place in October 2000. The operation of the shopping center was taken over in 1990 by the ECE project management. In 2003, the store sales in the PEP amounted to ‚Ç¨336 million. Developers and operators thought out a further extension, which extends beyond the multilane Thomas Dehler road on the opposite Hanns-Seidel-Platz and should create 24,000 square feet of additional retail space. Which will border a municipal cultural and community center to be built at the expense of the developer. A planning expert commissioned by the city spoke out against the extension because no local demand was evident and, among other things, the area, which a significant proportion purchasing power is skimmed off, extended along the Bundesautobahn 8 until well into the foothills of the Alps. The expansion plans were not pursued after another shopping center in the east of Munich had been opened in the proposed area with the Riem Arcaden in Messestadt Riem. In November 2011, Reeff investment, the former DGI, sold the property for ‚Ç¨408 million to an institutional investor in the US, the teachers pension fund TIAA-CREF.  Transportation connection  The pep is located on the subway station Neuperlach Zentrum of the U5 line. A large bus terminal with local and regional bus routes is located east of Thomas Dehler street, at the Hanns-Seidl-Platz. Where the bus lines 55, 139, 192, 196, 197, 198 and 199 make a stop. In addition, there is a taxi stand in the forecourt. By car the pep is accessible via the St√§ndlerstra√üe in the north or the Putzbrunner road in the south (both east- west direction) and the Thomas Dehler road (north-south). Directly on the pep there are two car parks with a total of only 2000-space (formerly 3000). There is a fee for the use of both car parks since the beginning of June 2012.

The operation mechanism of the engine can be described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The first realization of a quantum heat engine was pointed out by Scovil and Schulz-DuBois in 1959, showing the connection of efficiency of the Carnot engine and the 3-level maser. Quantum refrigerators share the structure of quantum heat engines with the purpose of pumping heat from a cold to a hot bath consuming power first suggested by Geusic, Schulz-DuBois, De Grasse and Scovil. When the power is supplied by a laser the process is termed optical pumping or laser cooling, suggested by Weinland and Hench.D. J. Wineland and H. Dehmelt, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 20, 637 (1975) Surprisingly heat engines and refrigerators can operate up to the scale of a single particle thus justifying the need for a quantum theory termed quantum thermodynamics. The 3-level amplifier as a quantum heat engine The three level amplifier. Levels 1 and 3 are coupled to the hot reservoir. Levels 1 and 2 are coupled to the cold reservoir. Power is obtained when there is population inversion between levels 3 and 2. The three-level-amplifier is the template of a quantum device. It operates by employing a hot and cold bath to maintain population inversion between two energy levels which is used to amplify light by stimulated emissionYariv, Amnon (1989). Quantum Electronics, 3rd ed., Wiley. The ground state level (1-g) and the excited level (3-h) are coupled to a hot bath of temperature T_h. The energy gap is \\\\hbar \\\\omega_h = E_3-E_1 . When the population on the levels equilibrate ::\\\\frac{N_h}{N_g}=e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_h}{k_bT_h}} where \\\\hbar=\\\\frac{h}{2 \\\\pi } is Planck's constant and k_b is Boltzmann's constant. The cold bath of temperature T_c couples the ground (1-g) to an intermediate level (2-c) with energy gap E_2-E_1=\\\\hbar \\\\omega_c . When levels 2-c and 1-g equilibrate then :: \\\\frac{N_c}{N_g}=e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_c}{k_bT_c}} . The device operates as an amplifier when levels (3-h) and (2-c) are coupled to an external field of frequency u. For optimal resonance conditions u=\\\\omega_h-\\\\omega_c. The efficiency of the amplifier in converting heat to power is the ratio of work output to heat input: :: \\\\eta=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar u}{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_h} =1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{\\\\omega_h}. Amplification of the field is possible only for positive gain (population inversion) G =N_h-N_c \\\\ge 0 . This is equivalent to \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_c}{k_b T_c} \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_h}{k_b T_h}. Inserting this expression into the efficiency formula leads to: ::\\\\eta =1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{\\\\omega_h} \\\\le 1- \\\\frac{T_c}{T_h} = \\\\eta_c where \\\\eta_c is the Carnot cycle efficiency. Equality is obtained under a zero gain condition G =0 . The relation between the quantum amplifier and the Carnot efficiency was first pointed out by Scovil and Schultz-DuBois.: Reversing the operation driving heat from the cold bath to the hot bath by consuming power constitutes a refrigerator. The efficiency of the refrigerator defined as the coefficient of performance (COP) for the reversed device is: :: \\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{ u} \\\\le \\\\frac{T_c}{T_h-T_c} Types Quantum devices can operate either continuously or by a reciprocating cycle. Continuous devices include solar cells converting solar radiation to electrical power, thermoelectric where the output is current and lasers where the output power is coherent light. The primary example of a continuous refrigerator is optical pumping and laser cooling. Similarly to classical reciprocating engines, quantum heat engines also have a cycle that is divided into different strokes. A stroke is time segment in which a certain operation takes place (e.g. thermalization, or work extraction). Two adjacent strokes do not commute with each other. The most common reciprocating heat machines are the four-stroke machine, and the two-stroke machine. Reciprocating devices have been suggested operating either by the Carnot cycle or the Otto cycle. In both types the quantum description allows to obtain equation of motion for the working medium and the heat flow from the reservoirs. Quantum reciprocating heat engine and refrigerator Quantum versions of most of the common thermodynamic cycles have been studied, for example the Carnot cycle, Stirling cycle and Otto cycle. The Otto cycle can serve as a template for other reciprocating cycles. thumbQuantum Otto cycle shown in the Entropy \\\\Omega plane where the energy entropy and the Von Neumann entropy are displayed. \\\\Omega is the internal frequency of the device and is controlled externally. It mimics the inverse volume in the Otto cycle. The red and blue lines are the hot and cold isochores. The cycle represents a heat pump. It is composed of the following four segments: *Segment A \\\\rightarrow B isomagnetic or isochoric process, partial equilibration with the cold bath under constant Hamiltonian. The dynamics of the working medium is characterized by the propagator { U}_c . *Segment B \\\\rightarrow C magnetization or adiabatic compression, the external field changes expanding the gap between energy levels of the Hamiltonian. The dynamics is characterized by the propagator { U}_{ch} . *Segment C \\\\rightarrow D isomagnetic, or isochoric process partial equilibration with the hot bath described by the propagator U_h . *Segment D \\\\rightarrow A demagnetization or adiabatic expansion reducing the energy gaps in the Hamiltonian, characterized by the propagator U_{hc} . The propagator of the four stroke cycle becomes U_{global}, which is the ordered product of the segment propagators: :: {U}_{global}~~=~~ { U}_{hc} { U}_h {U}_{ch} {U}_c The propagators are linear operators defined on a vector space which completely determines the state of the working medium. Common to all thermodynamic cycles the consecutive segment propagators do not commute [{\\\\ U}_i,{ U}_j] e 0. Commuting propagators will lead to zero power. In a reciprocating quantum heat engine the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or an harmonic oscillator. For maximum power the cycle time should be optimized. There are two basic timescales in the reciprocating refrigerator the cycle time \\\\tau_{cyc} and the internal timescale 2 \\\\pi /\\\\omega . In general when \\\\tau_{cyc} \\\\gg 2\\\\pi/\\\\omega the engine operates in quasi-adiabatic conditions. The only quantum effect can be found at low temperatures where the unit of energy of the device becomes \\\\hbar \\\\omega instead of k_b T. The efficiency at this limit is \\\\eta = 1 -\\\\frac{\\\\omega_c}{\\\\omega_h}, always smaller than the Carnot efficiency \\\\eta_c. At high temperature and for the harmonic working medium the efficiency at maximum power becomes \\\\eta = 1-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{T_c}{T_h}} which is the endoreversible thermodynamics result. For shorter cycle times the working medium cannot follow adiabatically the change in the external parameter. This leads to friction-like phenomena. Extra power is required to drive the system faster. The signature of such dynamics is the development of coherence causing extra dissipation. Surprisingly the dynamics leading to friction is quantized meaning that frictionless solutions to the adiabatic expansion/compression can be found in finite time. As a result, optimization has to be carried out only with respect to the time allocated to heat transport. In this regime the quantum feature of coherence degrades the performance. Optimal frictionless performance is obtained when the coherence can be cancelled. The shortest cycle times \\\\tau_{cyc} \\\\ll 2\\\\pi/\\\\omega , sometimes termed sudden cycles, have universal features. In this case coherence contributes to the cycles power. A two-stroke engine quantum cycle equivalent to the Otto cycle based on two qubits has been proposed. The first qubit has frequency \\\\omega_h and the second \\\\omega_c . The cycle is composed of a first stroke of partial equilibration of the two qubits with the hot and cold bath in parallel. The second power stroke is composed of a partial or full swap between the qubits. The swap operation is generated by a unitary transformation which preserves the entropy as a result it is a pure power stroke. The quantum Otto cycle refrigerators shares the same cycle with magnetic refrigeration. Continuous quantum engines Continuous quantum engines are the quantum analogues of turbines. The work output mechanism is coupling to an external periodic field, typically the electromagnetic field. Thus the heat engine is a model for a laser. The models differ by the choice of their working substance and heat source and sink. Externally driven two-level, three level four-level and coupled harmonic oscillators have been studied. The periodic driving splits the energy level structure of the working medium. This splitting allows the two level engine to couple selectively to the hot and cold baths and produce power. On the other hand, ignoring this splitting in the derivation of the equation of motion will violate the second law of thermodynamics. Non thermal fuels have been considered for quantum heat engines. The idea is to increase the energy content of the hot bath without increasing its entropy. This can be achieved by employing coherence or a squeezed thermal bath. These devices do not violate the second law of thermodynamics. Equivalence of reciprocating and continuous heat machines in the quantum regime Two-stroke, Four-stroke, and continuous machine are very different from each other. However it was shown that there is a quantum regime where all these machines become thermodynamically equivalent to each other. While the intra cycle dynamics in the equivalence regime is very different in different engine types, when the cycle is completed they all turn out to provide the same amount of work and consume the same amount of heat (hence they share the same efficiency as well). This equivalence is associated with a coherent work extraction mechanism and has no classical analogue. These quantum features have been demonstrated experimentally . Heat engines and open quantum systems The elementary example operates under quasi equilibrium conditions. Its main quantum feature is the discrete energy level structure. More realistic devices operate out of equilibrium possessing friction heat leaks and finite heat flow. Quantum thermodynamics supplies a dynamical theory required for systems out of equilibrium such as heat engines, thus, inserting dynamics into thermodynamics. The theory of open quantum systems constitutes the basic theory. For heat engines a reduced description of the dynamics of the working substance is sought, tracing out the hot and cold baths. The starting point is the general Hamiltonian of the combined systems: :: H = H_s + H_c + H_h + H_{sc}+H_{sh} and the system Hamiltonian H_s(t) is time dependent. A reduced description leads to the equation of motion of the system: :: \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\rho = -\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}[H_s,\\\\rho] + L_h (\\\\rho)+L_c(\\\\rho) where \\\\rho is the density operator describing the state of the working medium and L_{h/c} is the generator of dissipative dynamics which includes the heat transport terms from the baths. Using this construction, the total change in energy of the sub-system becomes: :: \\\\frac{d}{dt} E = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial H_s}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\langle L_h (H_s) \\\\rangle+\\\\langle L_c (H_s) \\\\rangle leading to the dynamical version of the first law of thermodynamics: * The power P =\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right\\\\rangle * Heat currents J_h = \\\\langle L_h (H_s) \\\\rangle and J_c = \\\\langle L_c (H_s) \\\\rangle . The rate of entropy production becomes: :: \\\\frac{d S}{dt} = -\\\\frac{J_h}{T_h}-\\\\frac{J_c}{T_c} \\\\ge 0 The global structure of quantum mechanics is reflected in the derivation of the reduced description. A derivation which is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics is based on the weak coupling limit. A thermodynamical idealization assumes that the system and the baths are uncorrelated, meaning that the total state of the combined system becomes a tensor product at all times: :: \\\\rho = \\\\rho_s \\\\otimes \\\\rho_{h} \\\\otimes \\\\rho_{c} ~. Under these conditions the dynamical equations of motion become: \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\rho_s = {L} \\\\rho_s~, where { L} is the Liouville superoperaor described in terms of the system's Hilbert space, where the reservoirs are described implicitly. Within the formalism of quantum open system, L can take the form of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan- Lindblad (GKS-L) Markovian generator or also known just as Lindblad equation . Theories beyond the weak coupling regime have been proposed. The quantum absorption refrigerator The absorption refrigerator is of unique importance in setting an autonomous quantum device. Such a device requires no external power and operates without external intervention in scheduling the operations . The basic construct includes three baths; a power bath, a hot bath and a cold bath. The tricycle model is the template for the absorption refrigerator. Quantum tricycle absorption refrigerator. The device is composed from three baths where T_d \\\\ge T_h \\\\ge T_c . Heat flows from the power reservoir and cold bath to the hot bath. The tricycle engine has a generic structure. The basic model consists of three thermal baths: A hot bath with temperature T_h, a cold bath with temperature T_c and a work bath with temperature T_d. Each bath is connected to the engine via a frequency filter which can be modeled by three oscillators: :: H_0 = \\\\hbar \\\\omega_h a^{\\\\dagger} a +\\\\hbar \\\\omega_c b^{\\\\dagger} b + \\\\hbar \\\\omega_d c^{\\\\dagger} c~~, where \\\\omega_h , \\\\omega_c and \\\\omega_d are the filter frequencies on resonance \\\\omega_d=\\\\omega_h-\\\\omega_c . The device operates as a refrigerator by removing an excitation from the cold bath as well as from the work bath and generating an excitation in the hot bath. The term a^{\\\\dagger} b c in the Hamiltonian is non linear and crucial for an engine or a refrigerator. :: H_I = \\\\hbar \\\\epsilon \\\\left( a b^{\\\\dagger} c^{\\\\dagger} + a^{\\\\dagger} b c \\\\right)~~, where \\\\epsilon is the coupling strength. The first-law of thermodynamics represents the energy balance of heat currents originating from the three baths and collimating on the system: :: \\\\frac{dE_s}{dt}= { J}_h + { J}_c +{J}_d ~~. At steady state no heat is accumulated in the tricycle, thus \\\\frac{dE_s}{dt}= 0 . In addition, in steady state the entropy is only generated in the baths, leading to the second law of thermodynamics: :: \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\Delta { S}_u~=~-\\\\frac{{J}_h}{T_h} - \\\\frac{{ J}_c}{T_c} -\\\\frac{{ J}_d }{T_d}~\\\\ge~0~~. This version of the second-law is a generalisation of the statement of Clausius theorem; heat does not flow spontaneously from cold to hot bodies. When the temperature T_d \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty , no entropy is generated in the power bath. An energy current with no accompanying entropy production is equivalent to generating pure power: { P}={J}_d , where { P} is the power output. Quantum refrigerators and the third law of thermodynamics There are seemingly two independent formulations of the third law of thermodynamics both originally were stated by Walther Nernst. The first formulation is known as the Nernst heat theorem, and can be phrased as: *The entropy of any pure substance in thermodynamic equilibrium approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero. The second formulation is dynamical, known as the unattainability principle *It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any assembly to absolute zero temperature in a finite number of operations. At steady state the second law of thermodynamics implies that the total entropy production is non-negative. When the cold bath approaches the absolute zero temperature, it is necessary to eliminate the entropy production divergence at the cold side when T_c \\\\rightarrow 0 , therefore :: \\\\dot S_c \\\\propto - T_c^{\\\\alpha}~~~,~~~~\\\\alpha \\\\geq 0~~. For \\\\alpha=0 the fulfillment of the second law depends on the entropy production of the other baths, which should compensate for the negative entropy production of the cold bath. The first formulation of the third law modifies this restriction. Instead of \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0 the third law imposes \\\\alpha > 0 , guaranteeing that at absolute zero the entropy production at the cold bath is zero: \\\\dot S_c = 0. This requirement leads to the scaling condition of the heat current { J}_c \\\\propto T_c^{\\\\alpha+1}. The second formulation, known as the unattainability principle can be rephrased as; *No refrigerator can cool a system to absolute zero temperature at finite time. The dynamics of the cooling process is governed by the equation :: { J}_c(T_c(t)) = -c_V(T_c(t))\\\\frac{dT_c(t)}{dt}~~. where c_V(T_c) is the heat capacity of the bath. Taking { J}_c \\\\propto T_c^{\\\\alpha+1} and c_V \\\\sim T_c^{\\\\eta} with {\\\\eta} \\\\geq 0 , we can quantify this formulation by evaluating the characteristic exponent \\\\zeta of the cooling process, :: \\\\frac{dT_c(t)}{dt} \\\\propto -T_c^{\\\\zeta}, ~~~~~ T_c\\\\rightarrow 0, ~~~~~ {\\\\zeta=\\\\alpha-\\\\eta+1} This equation introduce the relation between the characteristic exponents \\\\zeta and \\\\alpha. When \\\\zeta < 0 then the bath is cooled to zero temperature in a finite time, which implies a violation of the third law. It is apparent from the last equation, that the unattainability principle is more restrictive than the Nernst heat theorem.

During this period Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Italy invaded Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War broke out. Although some of the women involved were Communists whose priority was preventing attacks on the Soviet Union, many prominent pacifists with different ideologies were members or supporters of the committee. The World Committee sponsored subcommittees for Women and Students, and national committees in countries that included Spain, Britain, Mexico and Argentina. The Women's branches were particularly active and included feminist leaders such as Gabrielle Duch√™ne of France, Sylvia Pankhurst of Britain and Dolores Ib√°rruri of Spain. Background Willi M√ºnzenberg, who orchestrated creation of the World Committee against Imperialist War Japan conquered Manchuria in 1932 and support for the Nazis was growing in Germany that year, making the Soviet Union fear encirclement and attack by the capitalist powers. The German Communist Willi M√ºnzenberg had founded the League against Imperialism in 1927, but it had collapsed in 1931. M√ºnzenberg organized the World Congress Against Imperialist War in Amsterdam in late August 1932. He was careful to avoid including any Russian names in the advance notices other than Maxim Gorky, head of the convening committee. The congress was advertised as the World Congress Against Imperialist War in Communist publications, but simply as the World Congress Against War elsewhere. Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse issued the invitations. The World Congress Against War was held in Amsterdam on 27‚Äì29 August 1932, and was attended by more than 2,000 delegates from 27 countries. The majority of the delegates were not Communists. However, many belonged to organizations associated with the Communist party, or were known to by sympathetic to Russia. Most of the discussion was about the need to protect the Soviet Union. The Amsterdam meeting founded the World Committee against Imperialist War. Willi M√ºnzenberg was the force behind organizing the World Committee, which at first was based in Berlin. M√ºnzenberg managed to convince many prominent pacifists to join the committee. In addition to Barbusse, Rolland and Gorky the members included Albert Einstein, Heinrich Mann, Bertrand Russell, Havelock Ellis, Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, Upton Sinclair and Sherwood Anderson. Romain Rolland criticized the control M√ºnzenberg assumed over the committee and was against basing it in Berlin. The Executive Committee of the Communist International was also uncomfortable with M√ºnzenberg's views and replaced him by Georgi Dimitrov. Early the next year Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany and the World Committee had to move its headquarters to Paris. Dimitrov was jailed on a charge of responsibility for the Reichstag fire, and M√ºnzenberg again assumed the leadership. Foundation Henri Barbusse, one of the founding members The European Workers' Anti-Fascist Union was formed in June 1933 at the European Anti-Fascist Workers' Congress, held in the Salle Pleyel in Paris. This organization merged with the World Committee in August 1933 to become the Joint World Committee against Imperialist War and Fascism, later shortened to the World Committee against War and Fascism. The committee was called \\"Amsterdam‚ÄìPleyel\\" after the founding meeting places. The combined organization was led by Henri Barbusse, Andr√© Gide and Andr√© Malraux as co- chairs. Two German communists, Alfred Kurella and Albert Norden, looked after routine operations. The World Committee against War and Fascism defined its goal as \\"to co-ordinate the actions in the whole world against war and fascism.\\" It called on \\"the hand and brain workers in all parties, the trade unions of all tendencies, the peasants and members of the middle classes, the youth and women.\\" The World Committee's close ties to communism were common knowledge, but the Committee was able to attract support outside this movement. Activities In 1933 and 1934 the World Committee organized congresses to coordinate the anti-fascist activities of youth, women and students. The World Students' Committee against War and Fascism was the offshoot of one congress, as was the World Committee of Women against War and Fascism. On 27 April 1934 the heads of Communist parties in Europe met in Moscow where they received fresh directions from the Comintern. After August 1934 the World Committee was supported by these parties and by Comintern. With this funding, it was able to sponsor new organizations against war and fascism. It founded the periodicals Vendredi in France, Futuro in Mexico and Claridad in Buenos Aires. In 1939 the committee's letterhead showed Henri Barbusse as Founder, Romain Rolland as Honorary President, and Francis Jourdain as Secretary General. The council included Paul Langevin, Jean Longuet and Andr√© Malraux of France, Sir Norman Angell of England, Heinrich Mann of Germany, Harry F. Ward, Sherwood Anderson and John dos Passos of the United States and A. A. MacLeod of Canada. Francis Jourdain invited Professor J. B. S. Haldane to attend a great International Conference in Defence of Peace and Humanity that was to be held in Paris on 13‚Äì14 May 1939. Haldane expressed his support but declined the invitation. =Women's World Committee= The French feminist Gabrielle Duch√™ne was sponsored by Romain Rolland and Henri Barbusse in the Amsterdam congress. She became one of the secretaries of the World Committee. In 1934 Gabrielle Duch√™ne organized the World Assembly of Women, and chaired its World Committee of Women against War and Fascism (CMF: Comit√© mondial des femmes contre la guerre et le fascisme). British Sponsors of the women's committee included non-Communists such as Charlotte Despard, Sylvia Pankhurst, Ellen Wilkinson, Vera Brittain and Storm Jameson. The Women's World Committee published its manifesto in 1934. In 1935 the World Committee of Women Against War and Fascism pooled resources with the League against Imperialism and the Negro Workers Union (UTN: Union des Travailleurs N√®gres) to promote freedom of speech and to end violence in the colonies of France and other European powers. Denise Moran Savineau presided over a meeting of the Women's Committee which was addressed by the communist St√©phane Rosso. The Women's World Committee was active in support of the International Committee for the Defense of the Ethiopian People, which held its first meeting on 2 September 1935 before the Italian invasion of Ethiopia was launched in October 1935. The Women's World Committee held another congress in Paris in 1937. =Spain= Dolores Ib√°rruri of Spain in 1936 In mid-1933 a delegate of the World Committee visited women's groups in Spain to investigate the potential for a Spanish women's committee aligned with the World Committee. Dolores Ib√°rruri told her \\"she would have no difficulty with communist women.\\" The French delegate said she wanted to also interview Socialist women, but did not have time. The Spanish Committee of Women against War and Fascism was created with a committee controlled by the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). In August 1934 the Spanish committee sent a delegation to the World Congress of Women against War and Fascism in Paris. Dolores Ib√°rruri led the group, which included two Republicans and two Communists, Encarnaci√≥n Fuyola and Irene Falc√≥n. The Spanish committee was dissolved in October 1934 during the repression that followed the Asturian miners' strike. On 13 August 1936 the World Committee against War and Fascism organized a general European conference in Paris to arrange support for the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). =Britain= John Strachey of the British section Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) organized a large rally at the Olympia hall in London in June 1934. A counter-demonstration was organized, and the rally turned into a fight in which many were injured. A Committee for Coordinating Anti-Fascist Activities was formed, with John Strachey as secretary, sponsored by the World Committee Against War and Fascism (Amsterdam-Pleyel). When the BUF staged another demonstration of 3,000 Fascists in Hyde Park, London on 9 September 1934, Strachey's committee organized a major counter-demonstration by 20,000 anti-Fascists. The British Section of Women Against War and Fascism published a \\"Women's Charter\\" that demanded the right for married women to work and for local birth control clinics before calling for all Fascist organizations to be dissolved and supporting the call for total disarmament made by the Soviet Union. The left- wing militant Melita Norwood pushed through a resolution by the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries under which the union would work in association with the Women's World Committee. The Six Point Group and the National Union of Women Teachers were also affiliated to the British section of the Women's World Committee. The British Labour Party, led from 1935 by Clement Attlee, proscribed the Committee as a Communist front. The British section of the Women's World Committee Against War and Fascism published the monthly magazine Women To-day. Its target audience were \\"thinking\\" women who were interested in world affairs and social issues, although it included some articles on domestic subjects. The British section called for armaments factories to be converted to making socially useful goods. This caused serious internal tension when the left-leaning members began to support the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. The Women's World Committee helped British women to work to help women in Spain during the civil war. The British section of the Women's Committee dissolved soon after the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45). =America= The American delegates to the 1932 Amsterdam congress established the American Committee for Struggle Against War, soon afterwards renamed the American League Against War and Fascism. This group was backed by many prominent American intellectuals, and claimed millions of members. Most of the American pacifists who supported the League understood its close connection to the Communists and goal of protecting Soviet Russia, but were willing to tolerate this given the growing risk of war. Ella Reeve Bloor (1862-1951) of the American Communist Party attended the women's congress in Paris in 1934 and was elected to the World Committee. She became a member of the National Executive Committee of the American League Against War and Fascism, and in this role tried to bring together the labor and pacifist movements. Clara Shavelson Lemlich was an organizer for the American League Against War and Fascism who often spoke against nuclear weapons and the arms race. After she visited the Soviet Union in 1949 her passport was revoked, and in 1951 she was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Packets are commonly opened by making a small rip or tear in part of the package, and then squeezing out the contents.  Uses  Condiments distributed in packets include ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, salad cream, HP sauce, relish, tartar sauce, vinegar and soy sauce. They provide a simple and low-cost way of distributing small amounts of condiment with ready-to-eat packaged food such as hot dogs, French fries, or hamburgers, and are common in fast food restaurants. The packets produce less contamination and mess than freely available condiments dispensed into small disposable cups or other containers, especially if the food will be in transit before dining. Potpourri fragrances are also sold in sachets. Potpourri sachet envelopes are filled with scented herbs and flowers or use vermiculite containing aromatic fragrance oil. These are known as potpourri wardrobe sachets. In Argentina and Uruguay, milk and yogurts are also sold in packets. In 1983, the Indian company Cavin Kare began selling shampoo in small plastic packets instead of large bottles in order to make it more affordable to the poor. Sale of small amounts of shampoo and detergents in plastic packets is very popular throughout the Philippines, India and other Eastern countries. In 2011, 87% of shampoo sold in India was in sachets.

The No. 52 car earned 8 points with one sixth-place finish and a retirement, and the No. 53 car earned 26 points with fifth and sixth- place finishes. The team announced an official withdrawal from the championship on 11 June, with only a skeleton crew remaining in employment. A six-month hiatus from racing was ended by an announcement in late December that a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 would be fielded at the 2015 24H Dubai. The goal of the switch to Mercedes-Benz was to reduce cost and gain a foothold for budgeting. On 9 December, the FIA granted the six-round 24H Series championship status. =2015= Ram Racing began the 2015 season with an announcement of a full foray into the 24H Series, continuing to field the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3. The opening race in Dubai resulted in a second- place finish 4 laps behind the Black Falcon Mercedes-Benz. This ended a six- month drought started by the team's financial trouble during the 2014 WEC. On 11 March, the team entered the 2015 British GT Championship with the Mercedes- Benz SLS AMG GT3, driven by Lewis Plato and Alistair MacKinnon.

It was written by Karolis Dineika in 1922. It is a modest, but significant book for cognition of basketball at that period in Lithuania. During these times, basketball in Lithuania was still called \\"Krep≈°iasvydis\\".Stanislovas Stonkus \\"Krep≈°inio kelias ƒØ LietuvƒÖ\\" (pages: 1-2) It is a mixture of two Lithuanian words: \\"krep≈°ys\\" (basket) and \\"sviesti\\" (throw). Yet later it was renamed to \\"Krep≈°inis\\". This name is still used nowadays. Excerpts Karolis Dineika in his book described the basketball like that: ‚ÄúKrep≈°iasvydis is a handheld game. <...> Player by running or walking throws, catches or repulses the ball with his hands. <...> Don‚Äòt try to stand with your head surly lowered. The chest is held protrudingly during the most of the playing time. <...> Participants number in krep≈°iasvydis depends on the court size. As a result, the participants may be 10, 14 or 18. We recommend first number as the most comfortable number for the flow of the game. <...> The participants are divided into two parts (teams). <...> So, if the participants number is 10, every part gets 5. <...> From these five, at least one will be guard (defends the basket), one keeper (tries to return the ball to the attackers) and three attackers, who aims at the opponents basket. <...> To distinguish the parts members, one part members ties bands on their hands. <...> The ball accurately shoot from the free-throw line (free-throw) gives a winning eye (point).

Munson (sic), MPA.\\" Sickle Cell Cure Foundation. 2018. Accessed June 17, 2018. Early life Angela Monson was born on July 31, 1955, to parents Herman and Epron Monson in Oklahoma City. Monson was educated in Oklahoma City public schools and graduated from Douglass High School. Monson attended her first year at the University of Oklahoma (OU) on a President's Leadership Class scholarship. Since OU did not have the degree program she desired, Monson transferred to Oklahoma City University where she received her undergraduate degree in law enforcement corrections (criminal justice). Career After graduation, Monson worked as a probation/parole officer for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections in Shawnee, Oklahoma. After a year in Shawnee, Monson returned to Oklahoma City, where she worked with the Council for Resocialization of Ex-Offenders (CREO), a community corrections organization. While serving in this role, Monson decided she did not only want to implement the law, but instead wanted to help make the law. She returned to school and received her Master's of Science in public administration from the University of Oklahoma. After graduation, Monson was hired as a traveling city manager for six primarily African-American towns in Oklahoma. Later she was hired as a fiscal analyst for the state legislature. Monson initially ran for office in 1984 but lost by a margin of approximately 132 votes to the incumbent. After her first campaign, she was out of a job and went to work for the Equitable Life Insurance Company selling insurance. In 1986, Monson was offered a job with the Oklahoma Health Care Campaign or the Oklahoma Healthcare Project, where she went on to become the executive director. Monson ran again for the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1988 and was again unsuccessful in her campaign. Finally in 1990, Angela ran for the legislature again and was elected into the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Political career From 1990‚Äì1993, Monson served as a legislator in District 99. From 1993 to 2005, she served as an Oklahoma senator representing District 48, which encompasses portions of northeastern Oklahoma County. In office, Monson sponsored many health care bills and was largely involved with the Oklahoma Healthcare Authority. In 1998, U.S. Secretary of Health Donna Shalala appointed Monson to the National Advisory Council to the National Health Service Corps, later appointing her as chair of the council until her term expired in 2002. From 2002‚Äì2003, she was the president of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the first African-American woman to lead this organization. She also was the first African-American woman to fill the role of assistant majority floor leader in the Oklahoma legislature in 2003. =Senate committees= *Chair of Education committee *Chair of Finance committee *Chair of the Appropriations Sub-committee on Group Health and Employee Benefits, and Appropriations *Vice-Chair of the Sub-Committee on Health and Social Services =The Mental Health Parity Bill (1996)= Monson was nationally recognized for her involvement with the Mental Health Parity Act. She was the primary sponsor of a large portion of the legislation dealing with health care coverage in Oklahoma. With the Mental Health Parity Act, Monson strove to require inclusion of mental health benefits that were of the same dollar amount as medical or surgical benefits. Post-political career After her time in the senate, Monson became employed by the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center as Director of Health Policy Development and Analysis. She is also a member of the OU Medical Center board of trustees, and the Oklahoma City/County board of health.

Biography Carlo Pietzner spent his youth in Vienna in the years between the two wars and completed his art studies at the Kunstgewerbschule, (today the University of Applied Arts Vienna), meeting there, amongst others Robert Musil and Oskar Kokoshka. His family ran a photographic studio, which his sister later took over. Through his friend Peter Roth he was introduced to Dr Karl K√∂nig and joined the youth group that had gathered around him. This group met for the last time in Vienna on March 11, 1938 at the time of the Nazi occupation. The members left Austria along various routes to come together again in Aberdeen and found Camphill. Carlo arrived there in 1941 and was shortly thereafter interned in Canada.‚Äò‚ÄôThe Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders‚Äô‚Äô Edited by Friedwart Bock, Floris Books, 2004 He became the Principal of Heachcot School that cared for about 50 severely handicapped individuals and already there pioneered a color and light therapy that he later developed together with Edmund Pracht.Article by Cornelius Peitzner in the Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls - Biographien Dokumentation retrieved 2015.03.05 In 1954 he was asked to start the Camphill work in Glencraig, Northern Ireland, becoming increasingly involved in the training and administrative work of the international Camphill movement. In 1961 he moved to the United States with his family and a small group of co-workers to lead the expansion of Camphill on that continent beginning with Camphill Village Copake. In 1963 he helped found Camphill Beaver Run focusing his attention on community development work, artistic activity and lecturing. Besides his work in Camphill, he was active in building up the local and international work of the Anthroposophical Society, serving on its American Council in the 1960s and again between 1981-1983 and supporting the founding of the Section for Curative Education and Social Therapy in Dornach, Switzerland within the Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science. In the 1970s Carlo initiated art retreats for Camphill coworkers, wrote and directed plays to develop the cultural life of the communities, wrote books and poetry, produced a large number of paintings and sketches and took on stained glass commissions for Camphill Halls in Germany, Switzerland, Norway and other countries. He provided architectural guidance for many buildings and concerned himself with the artistic and innovative formation of social and community life in Camphill. Under his leadership the Camphill Association of North America was formed in 1983, which he directed until his death in 1986. He had already begun to withdraw from active involvement in Copake, making way for a younger generation of leaders. His lecturing and training activities continued amongst a growing circle of friends and acquaintances all over the world.

Background  In 1997, child welfare agency NIL/TU,O was created pursuant to the British Columbia Society Act. NIL/TU,O's mandate was to provide child care services to First Nations children in a \\"culturally appropriate\\" context.SCC, par. 5 NIL/TU,O was subject to a tripartite agreement under which the province delegated control over certain child welfare services to NIL/TU,O; the federal government provided around 65% of NIL/TU,O's funding.SCC, par. 24, 35 The British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union (BCGSEU) applied to the British Columbia Labour Relations Board for certification as NIL/TU,O's collective bargaining agent. The Board certified the BCGSEU despite NIL/TU,O's argument that labour relations were subject to federal jurisdiction. The Board rejected an appeal.SCC, par. 7  The courts below  The issue was judicially reviewed at the Supreme Court of British Columbia, where the judge overturned the Board's decision, holding that NIL/TU,O's labour relations were subject to federal jurisdiction.SCC, par. 8 In response, NIL/TU,O applied for and received certification under the Canada Labour Code. The BCGSEU appealed the judge's decision to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, who reversed the earlier decision, finding that NIL/TU,O was instead subject to provincial jurisdiction.SCC, par. 9  Decision of the Supreme Court  The court unanimously held that NIL/TU,O fell under provincial jurisdiction. However, the court was split as to the application of the test used to determine whether labour relations fell under provincial or federal jurisdiction. = Majority = The majority, led by Abella J, affirmed the Court of Appeal's decision. The majority noted that although labour relations do not fall within section 91 or section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, Toronto Electric Commissioners v Snider created the presumption that labour relations fall within provincial jurisdiction. In deciding whether NIL/TU,O was a federal work or undertaking, the majority noted that the labour relations functional test traditionally did not undertake an interjurisdictional immunity analysis by determining whether \\"provincial regulation of the entity's labour relations would impair the core of the federal head of power\\".SCC, par. 18 The majority held that the same traditional approach should be applied to cases where section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which grants federal jurisdiction over \\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\\", was at issue. This approach would make it unnecessary to undertake an \\"impairing core\\" analysis unless the traditional functional test was not determinative of the issue. Applying the traditional functional labour relations test to the facts, the majority held that NIL/TU,O was regulated solely by the province of British Columbia, that its function was \\"unquestionably a provincial one\\",SCC, par. 39 since NIL/TU,O was obligated to adhere to the province's statutory standards, and that the province retained \\"ultimate decision-making control\\" over NIL/TU,O.SCC, par. 38 Further, the majority found that the federal government's financial contributions were insufficient to make NIL/TU,O a federal undertaking.SCC, par. 41 = Minority = The minority, led by McLachlin CJ and Fish J, affirmed the result of the Court of Appeal but disagreed with the majority's decision on the test to be used in an Aboriginal context. The minority preferred a test that determined whether NIL/TU,O's operations fell within the \\"protected core of Indianness\\" found in s 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, in accordance with the interjurisdictional immunity doctrine.SCC, par. 56 Their approach would restrict federal jurisdiction over Indian labour relations situations to those where the \\"ordinary and habitual activities of the operation affect core aspects of Indian status, or are conducted pursuant to federal delegated authority\\".SCC, par. 68 The minority agreed in result with the majority, however, holding that NIL/TU,O's operations did not sufficiently implicate Indian issues as to infringe upon the \\"protected core of Indianness\\".SCC, par. 56  Impact  The decision was criticized by law blog The Court, suggesting that \\"both versions of the‚Ä¶ test are equally perplexing\\" and that the majority's application of the traditional functional test in an Aboriginal context \\"resulted in a final analysis that became disengaged with the facts\\". Maggie Wente, writing in the Indigenous Law Journal, noted that \\"There are myriad other kinds of Aboriginal organizations that will not fit into the neatly defined box of ‚Äúunquestionably provincial‚Äù activities defined by the Supreme Court\\", which could lead to future litigation.

The History of the Building The tenement was built in 1844 by the then proprietor‚Äìmanufacturer Karl Gebhart according to the design of Louis Bethiera and Stanislaw Balinski. In the late 1940s of the 19th century the building was considered the most beautiful one in Piotrkowska Street. An elegant building with a neoclassical elevation adorned with eight pilasters separating windows and a gable roof. Since 1853 the proprietor of the building was a printer Leonard Fessler who lived in it for nearly thirty consecutive years. In 1880 Karol Scheibler repurchased the most elegant neoclassical residential building in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ for his family. Without a doubt the location of the tenement played a vital role here. It closed the west side of the Scheibler's property and was quite a landmark when looking from the main city road. It may have been initially destined for Scheibler‚Äôs daughter Emma and her husband George von Kramst, but since 1886 it was inhabited by his son Karol Scheibler Jr., the heir-general to the company, whereas The Krams left ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and went to live in Katowice. A year after its acquisition it became the property of Karol Scheibler's Wool Manufacture Joint Stock Company set up around that time. In 1921, however, it was excluded from the newly established Scheibler & Grohman Company and again became a private property of Karol Sheibler‚Äôs heirs. After Karol Scheibler‚Äôs death the house was rebuilt in 1891. Several architects (H. Majewski, F. Che≈Çmi≈Ñski) contributed to its modern look. Over the years it was reconstructed a few times by The Scheiblers (e.g. a tower was added in the southern part), which transformed the building into a city palace of neo- renaissance character. Its present eclectic form was the result of two subsequent alterations between 1884-1897. The alteration in 1894, according to the design of Franciszek Chelminski, expanded it in the southern direction by 3 more axes. In the corner, a tower topped with a tented roof in the form of a pyramid covered with scales of galvanized sheeting, was raised. The tent roof was topped with a flagpole and a flag dated 1894. 1897 saw another expansion. The palace was enlarged on the north side by a one-storey extension, housing a living room on the side facing the street and a winter garden adjoining the courtyard. The interiors were richly decorated, and stucco ceilings were covered with polychrome, which preserved to this day only in some areas. The main staircase with wooden stairs and a balustrade was decorated with fragmentarily preserved stained glass. The interiors were almost completely destroyed, but in some areas mouldings, furnaces and fireplaces are still to be seen. The layout of the interior is difficult to grasp because some actions taken by the oncoming users (e.g. former Military Study Centre of Lodz University of Technology), have contributed to the loss of its original character and function. Since 1956 the building has been used by Lodz University of Technology (TUL). Today it houses The Faculty of Organization and Management of TUL.

He actively participated in various activities of the opposition against the former regime whilst in Iraq and in exile. He returned to Iraq shortly after the fall of the former regime, and participated in numerous political initiatives to rebuild what was destroyed by the previous regime.

In less than two years, he managed to initiate some of the most strenuous projects including but not limited to: * Building the Iraqi Federal Police forces and developing their combat capabilities, arming and re- training. This was reflected in their overwhelming performance and role in the battles against Daesh; of which liberation of key cities such as Fallujah and Mosul was the most prominent. * Implementation of the Iraqi national ID card project which was stalled for decades. * Priming and qualifying the Interior Ministry to assume its responsibility of national security by working with the Joint Higher Committees at the Ministry of Defense, the Joint Operations Command and the National Security Advisers. (Since 2003, responsibility and management of Iraq's national/ interior security is directly aligned under the Prime Minister via the Joint Operations Command (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿπŸÖŸÑŸäÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ), the Interior Ministry is currently (April 2018) absolved from this authority).

It was the first jet aircraft designed in China, with Xu Shunshou as the chief designer. Two prototypes flew, but further development was abandoned. Design and development Due to differences in ideology the Soviet Union severed relations with the PRC in the early 1950s, robbing the PRC of access to modern Soviet technology, particularly aircraft and aviation- related items. To ensure that the People's Liberation Army Air Force could re- equip and train to fly jet fighters Shenyang Aircraft Corporation were approached by the PLAAF to design and build a prototype jet trainer. Xu Shunshou served as the director designer, and Huang Zhiqian and Ye Zhengda were deputy designers. Xu led a team of 108 people, whose average age was only 22. Most team members were recent university graduates, and only three people: Xu, Huang, and Lu Xiaopeng, had any aircraft design experience. To fill the PLAAF requirement, the designers at Shenyang produced the JJ-1, a straight- winged aircraft, with a retractable tricycle undercarriage, tandem cockpits with a side hinged canopy over the front cockpit and rearward sliding canopy over the rear cockpit (very similar to the Shenyang JJ-5) and intakes either side of the front cockpit. Power was supplied by a Shenyang Aircraft Development Office PF-1A, (Chinese copy of the Klimov RD-500 itself a copy of the Rolls-Royce Derwent), centrifugal compressor turbojet fitted in the centre fuselage, exhausting through a jet pipe extending to the tail of the fuselage. Armament was to have been a single calibre automatic cannon. Production was not carried out as it was found that pilots could transition to basic jet fighters from propeller driven fighters with few problems. Nevertheless, as the first jet aircraft designed in China, the JJ-1 marked a new era of China's aircraft manufacturing industry. Operational history Testing was carried out on the two prototypes and static test airframe before development was cancelled.

A collaboration with the band Aqua Nebula Oscillator resulted in the release of the White Ring album in November 2012. Due to visa problems, a planned U.S. tour could not take place, although the band did appear at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas on 15 March 2013. While in Texas, the band recorded various video clips of themselves which were later used to create the music video for their song \\"Come Back Life\\",http://theheavychronicles.com/2013/04/interview-kadavar-with-wolf- lindemann/?lang=en which was produced by Bartelt. In July 2013, Lippitz left the band to concentrate on his new group the Loranes. He was replaced by Bouteloup, previously of metal band the Oath.

Career While in Chicago, she had to have an operation on her leg, which led to her returning home as an invalid. Whilst recuperating, Voris came across a piece of soft chamois leather, which inspired her to use it to make up clothing. She made a golf skirt for a Spokane woman to wear in a tournament. Other players and spectators noticed the skirt, and asked Voris to make them leather garments too. She founded her business, Suedes by Voris, in 1933, and by 1940, had shops in Hollywood (where she sold garments to many actors) and across the Southwest, selling a wide range of clothing entirely made in suede. Her range included day and evening wear, hats, jewelry, and men's jackets, shirts, and ties, made in a wide range of colors. One noted design was a gold-plated evening jacket. When the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli visited Neiman Marcus and was invited to choose any one thing she wanted from the store; she chose a Voris coat as \\"the most distinctive fashion she had ever seen by an American designer.\\" It has been suggested that this inspired the decision to award Voris the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942. Voris later gave up the business to dedicate herself to sculpting. Following her receipt of the Neiman Marcus award, she was commissioned to create a bronze portrait of Herbert Marcus, the co-founder of the store. She made a memorial bust of Gary Cooper for the Friars Club of Beverly Hills in 1961. Personal life On 29 November 1936, Voris married Clifford H.

It is operated by the Mars Express Flight Control Team at ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany. Originally, VMC was a technical camera to monitor the separation of the Beagle 2 lander, but after a few years, it was repurposed into Mars Webcam, streaming its data to the web and even being used for science. Starting in 2007, the VMC was used for the Mars Webcam project, where it takes global views of Mars at a high cadence and they are posted online. The VMC is a camera-on-chip design, using the IRIS-1 system. Originally used as engineering monitoring camera for the Beagle 2 lander, it has a wide 40¬∞ field of view and limited imaging controls and it has no focus mechanism. In 2016, it was used for professional science in addition to its roles as a technical monitoring camera and public outreach.  History  The camera was included on the Mars Express mission with the singular goal of monitoring the deployment of the Beagle 2 lander, which occurred on 19 December 2003 at 08:31 UTC. After performing this task, the VMC remained unused, having no intended scientific purpose. In 2007, it was checked out and turned on for educational and science outreach. The Mars Webcam project was born and proved popular with the public, offering wide- angle shots of Mars on a regular basis. The VMC was adopted as a science instrument in early 2016, in a collaboration between ESA and the University of the Basque Country Planetary Sciences Group. This collaboration will conduct a two-year study of the images returned by VMC, which provide a global view of the planet and allow for the study of planetary phenomena, including changes in the ice caps, dust storms and cloud activity.

He lived from 1935 onwards at 51 Rue du Commerce, Brussels, which is also where he set up his studio. From the outset, it was a place where young musicians came to perform. Today there are two prizes bearing his name which are awarded by the Acad√©mie Royale de Belgique (Belgian Royal Academy), one for music and one for painting.  Biography  Marcel Hastir was a pupil of artists Constand Montald, Emile Fabry and Jean Delville and of the sculptor Victor Rousseau. During his military service, he took part in preparing the celebrations to mark the centenary of the birth of Belgium (1930). Later he designed the d√©cor of the Chemistry Pavilion at the 1935 Brussels Universal Exhibition. In 1935, he moved to 51 rue du Commerce in the part of Brussels known as \\"Quartier L√©opold\\". In 1940, he managed to secure permission from the German occupying authorities to use his studio for drawing and painting lessons. But this \\"art school\\" was above all a cover which enabled young people to meet in relative safety. These people included Alexandre and Youra Livchitz, and Jean Franklemon, who apart from other acts of defiance came up with a particularly bold plan ‚Äì to stop a train which was deporting Jews to Auschwitz. Youra Livchitz, Jean Franklemon and their friend Robert Maistriau did so successfully during the night of 19 April 1943, at Boortmeerbeek, enabling many to escape.  The Marcel Hastir Workshop  When the war was over, he resumed painting, teaching art and restoring older paintings. At this time too, he and his wife Ginette van Rijkevorsel van Kessel (they married in 1946) became more and more active in organizing events of a musical, literary, theatrical and intellectual nature at the Atelier. They formalized these activities in 1949 by setting up a not-for-profit organisation called \\"L'Atelier ‚Äì Maison des Arts Coordonn√©s\\". The arts which over the years have found a home at the Atelier are indeed extremely diverse: the Hastirs were among the earliest to appreciate the talents of artists such as Charles Trenet, Jacques Brel, Barbara, Maurice B√©jart, Lola Bobesco, Carlo Van Neste, and Narciso Yepes, to name but a few hosts of the Atelier. They provided a podium from which these artists, but also intellectuals and men of action, e.g. Lanza del Vasto, P√®re Dominique Pire and Abb√© Pierre, could address the public. Marcel Hastir‚Äôs biography contains many anecdotes from this culturally thriving period (\\"Une Vie\\", to be republished in 2013). Ginette died in 1983. Quartier L√©opold became a target for real estate brokers and developers and ‚Äì possessing only a tenancy of two floors of the building ‚Äì Marcel Hastir had to battle for years with attempts to evict him from his home and studio. The most recent attempts were in 2002 (demolition was threatening) and 2004 (a notice to quit was served on him). Both were defeated thanks to the mobilization of citizens and associations in support of the aged painter, cultural icon and resistance fighter. In 2005, Hastir asked his helpers to set up a foundation to bear the name of his Atelier, to be known as the \\"Fondation Atelier Marcel Hastir\\" and to which he bequeathed all his works. On 22 March 2006, his 100th birthday, the City of Brussels made him an Honorary Citizen, and Brussels Region officially classed his studio as part of the historic and cultural heritage of Brussels. RTBF broadcast a documentary by Caroline Hack entitled 51, Rue du Commerce, about Marcel Hastir‚Äôs life and work. On 24 April 2008, the Jewish Community of Brussels awarded him the accolade of \\"Mensch of the Year\\" in recognition of his actions to assist his Jewish fellow citizens during the war years. And the Belgian State, represented by Deputy Prime Minister Laurette Onkelinx, announced its decision to support Fondation Atelier Marcel Hastir in its efforts to prevent the building at 51 rue du Commerce from being purchased with speculative aims. With this backing, the City of Brussels was able to purchase it in February 2010. Fondation Atelier Marcel Hastir was granted a 99 year long-lease over the whole building as of 1 October 2010. All the works of Marcel Hastir, in all their manifestations, have thus been saved and are in the care of the volunteers who support the Foundation. Atelier Marcel Hastir remains a very active place; it hosts concerts of classical and world music, theatrical events, film shows, lectures as well as classes in music, art, writing, languages and dance. Grave of Carl Sternheim (1878‚Äì1942) and Marcel Hastir in Ixelles Marcel Hastir died on 2 July 2011, at the age of 105. He was buried in Carl Sternheims grave, who was a friend of his.

Another example is their 1980 satellite relay project Hole-in-Space which connected public spaces in New York and Los Angeles with live audio and life-sized video. Rabinowitz coined the phrase \\"We must create at the same scale that we can destroy\\" which would become the headline of Mobile Image's manifesto for their Electronic Cafe Network Project (1984) commissioned for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics Art Festival.

She works across disciplines engaging technology and science as an artist, educator, and collaborator. Her work exists in the form of websites, photography, maps, installations, workshops, and performances that involve public participation with an eye to social change. She is also co-founder and president of South Williamsburg community garden La Casita Verde in Brooklyn, one of 11 sites in the borough, as of April 2015, slated to be developed for \\"affordable\\" housing. She was a former fellow at Eyebeam and recipient of an Open Society Foundations grant, a NYSCA Individual Artist grant, among several other awards. Background and education Born in 1972 in Chicago, Illinois, she grew up in Washington, D.C. She received her BA from Wesleyan University in Photography and her MFA in studio art from Carnegie Mellon University.  Preemptive Media  Preemptive Media was an organization that existed from 2002 to 2008 of artists, activists and the technologically inclined who formed their own style of trial runs and beta tests. At its core were Singer, interdisciplinary artist Beatriz da Costa (1974‚Äì2012), and engineer and robotics researcher Jamie Schulte. =Swipe= Swipe was a demo/workshop which premiered in 2003 that evolved into a performance and installation, Swipe Bar, an actual bar serving alcohol from which one received not only a drink but a printed receipt with all of the information \\"swiped from his or her driver's license at point of sale, plus any additional personal information glean[ed by the artists] off the Internet and archived databases while the ... drink was being prepared.\\" The piece sheds light on the invisible practice of personal data collection via the state driver's license sold to commercial bidders in the US. Da Costa, Schulte, and Singer also wrote a paper on the topic entitled \\"Surveillance Creep! New Manifestations of Data Surveillance at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century\\" published in the Spring 2006 issue of Radical History Review (published by Duke University Press). Other iterations of Swipe include an online toolkit, by which users could read the barcode on a license and calculate the market value of their personal information, and a set of stickers commissioned by Whitney Museum Artport which users could place on top of the bar code or magnetic strip on their drivers' licenses to temporarily disable it. The performance-with-installation such as the one presented in 2004 at the Beall Center for Art + Technology in Irvine, California is the most well-known form of Swipe but these other forms were used to distribute the project and ideas further. = Zapped! and AIR= The collective organized a workshop on making a simple RFID detector on a keychain and an art installation around the idea called Zapped! They exhibited it as an installation in a Houston gallery with a contextualizing video and Madagascan hissing cockroaches with the reprogrammed RFID strapped on their backs for viewers to take home (to presumably let loose in a store of their choosing that employs RFID technology to jam such a system). Carl DiSalvo of Georgia Tech wrote of Zapped! in Design Issues that it \\"demonstrates the blurring of contemporary practices between art and design.... [which] results in a productive confusion between art and design in that it makes it easier to exchange forms, methods, and effects. Such exchanges are particularly fruitful to design, because arts practices and discourse have made much more significant inroads into the issues and sites of the public over the past several decades than has been witnessed within design.\\" Preemptive Media also presented the work in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Next, Area's Immediate Reading (AIR) was the group's prototyping of portable air quality measurement kits to monitor air pollutants in Lower Manhattan, and to create data visualizations of its finds. An early prototype was developed in San Francisco, with a public workshop taking place in June 2006 in New York City and the full project launching that September. Each device measured carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides levels, indicators for street-level pollution, and contained a GPS unit to pinpoint the reading's location, and could also reveal the location and emissions levels of major culprits, such as a power plant. For its development, AIR received the first and only Social Sculpture Commission offered jointly by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and Eyebeam in summer 2005. It was presented in an art festival in Brazil's Belo Horizonte, a collaborative workshop in California's Riverside County, and art exhibitions in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and New York City, and covered by a wider range of media.  The U.S. Oil Fix and Our Chemically Modified Organisms Using data from the CIA World Factbook, the Solar Energy Administration, the Solar Energy Initiative, the UN Human Development Report, and the Energy Information Administration, in 2006‚Äì07, she composed a map that charted the flow of the world's oil supplies to the US which also outlined other facts of the supplying countries, such as average life expectancy, GDP, literacy rates, carbon dioxide emissions levels, and poverty levels. A reworked version of the map was included in Lize Mogel and Alexis Bhagat's Atlas of Radical Cartography, which was presented at the 2008 European Social Forum in Malmo, Sweden and exhibited in university galleries at San Francisco State University, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, University of Illinois Chicago, College of New Jersey, those in Troy and Cortland, New York and art centers and venues in Montreal; Utrecht, Netherlands; Providence, Rhode Island; Syracuse, New York; Baltimore; and Philadelphia. It was also included in the 2010 Greater New York Show at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens. Several years later Singer created a \\"periodic table\\" of chemically modified organisms she learned about from her Superfund research. From looking at US landscapes and vast toxic sites within them these animals were another way to make evident the presence of forgotten but extant chemicals. Working with New York City-based illustrator John Kitses, she created a chart that showed a variety of 28 species‚Äîfrom blue- green algae to green frogs of the Connecticut River Valley to the male Florida panther‚Äîdirectly affected by exposure to pesticides, mercury, and other hazardous manmade chemicals, also naming some of the companies involved in making the chemicals, such as P&G;, Dow, and Ciba.  Excedentes/Excess NYC and Field Guide to the Electric Underground  In 2011, she and artist and husband Ricardo Miranda Z√∫√±iga participated in a cross-cultural residency with Madrid-based artists Beatriz Marcos, Jos√© Luis Bongore, and Sissa Verde. The work that resulted, Excedentes, was the development of a cart system during the economic downturn in Spain to allow scavengers to bypass dumpsters. The artists wheeled the cart with edible but unsaleable food from the mercardo destined for the trash into a public space and displayed it for people to take‚Äîa more humane way of picking up free food than dumpster diving. The project became a discussion about liability issues for the merchants and a group proposing legislation so a cart like this could be a more permanent solution and not a temporary intervention in Madrid. Upon their return to the States, the couple evolved a Brooklyn component of Excedentes, building a mobile bodega and composting machine, communicating with small businesses in their Prospect Heights/Crown Heights community, to help keep, educate, and encourage others about keeping food out of landfills. (According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a quarter of the methane gas the U.S. emits is created by unconsumed organics in landfills.) The performance-demonstration entitled Excess NYC travelled to Stamford and New Haven, Connecticut, and Singer talked about it at her 2013 lecture at Cornell's School of Architecture Art and Planning. The website for Excess NYC includes video and still documentation of Singer and Z√∫√±iga's performances and the two tons of organic waste they were able to hold off in their neighborhood, as well as interviews with area food activists like a founding member of the Park Slope Food Coop and the director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. It also includes a link to a related project by Singer, Field Guide to the Electric Underground, an online catalog of video footage of microscopic samples taken in 2012‚Äì13 that compares dirt from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Casita Verde, a Harlem community garden, and a boutique reseller of Brooklyn compost. La Casita Verde community garden  In November 2013, Singer helped clear and establish with nine others a community garden in a vacant lot administered by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development at the corner of Bedford and Division Avenues in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The goal of the garden's administrators (Singer is president) is for its participation in the soil food web as well as it being the site of soil rehabilitation, educating the community and others about ecology and science, and for local employment. As of April 2015, it is one of 11 sites in the borough slated to be developed under Mayor Bill de Blasio's drive for \\"affordable\\" housing.  Self-Portrait version 2.0 (SPv2)  Self-Portrait version 2.0 (SPv2) is an online application originally conceived by Singer in 2002 as her MFA thesis project and implemented in collaboration with programmer Paul Cunningham. SPv2 explores how identity can be constructed and perceived through data collection in cyberspace. Some data in cyberspace we consciously create to represent ourselves (emails and web sites, for instance). Other bits of data accumulate without our efforts‚Äîand many times without our knowledge‚Äîtracing certain of our interactions both in the physical and virtual worlds. Because of this data we do not willingly disperse, our cyber image is not always in our control nor ever fully knowable to us. SPv2 explores to what extent we are accessible online and what we may look like through mining Internet data.

After hours of intense fighting, Georgians won a decisive victory over the Turks.  Description  After a brief campaign conducted by Melik-Shah I of Seljuq Empire in southern Georgia, the emperor handed the duchies of Samshvilde and Arran to a certain \\"Sarang of Gandza\\", referred to as Savthang in Arabic sources. Leaving 48,000 cavalrymen to Sarang, he ordered another campaign to bring Georgia fully under the dominion of Seljuq Empire. The ruler of Arran, aided by the Muslim rulers of Dmanisi, Dvin and Ganja marched his army into Georgia.Chronicle of Kartli, 786‚Äì1072, pg 317. The dating of the invasion is disputed among modern Georgian scholars. While the battle is mostly dated in 1074 (Lortkipanidze, Berdzenishvili, Papaskiri), Prof. Ivane Javakhishvili puts the time somewhere around 1073 and 1074. 19th-century Georgian historian Tedo Jordania dates the battle in 1077. According to the latest research, the battle happened either in August or in September 1075 A.D.Metreveli, Samushia, King of Kings Giorgi II, pg. 77-82. Giorgi II, with military support of Aghsartan I of Kakheti, met the invaders near the castle of Partskhisi. Although the details of the battle remain largely unstudied, it is known that one of the most powerful Georgian nobles, Ivane Baghuashi of Kldekari, allied to the Seljuks, handing them his son, Liparit, as a political prisoner as a pledge of loyalty. The battle raged on for an entire day, finally ending with a decisive victory for Giorgi II of Georgia. The momentum gained after the victory of an important battle fought in Partskhisi allowed the Georgians to recapture all the territories lost to the Seljuk Empire (Kars, Samshvilde) as well as the Byzantine Empire (Anacopia, Klarjeti, Shavsheti, Ardahan, Javakheti).Studi bizantini e neoellenici: Compte-rendu, Volume 15, Issue 4, 1980, pg. 194-195  References  Partskhisi Partskhisi Partskhisi Category:11th century in the Kingdom of Georgia Category:1070s in Asia Category:1070s in Europe ","title":"Battle of Partskhisi"},{"id":"45596925","title":"Greece at the 2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships"},{"id":"45596937","text":"The Former City Hall of Rogers, Arkansas is located at 202 West Elm Street.

She lives and works in Glasgow, Scotland. Life and education Donachie studied Fine art from 1987 to 1991 at The Glasgow School of Art. She graduated from The Glasgow School of Art's Environmental Art department, which encouraged artists to place their work in a variety of public contexts out-with the gallery space. She completed a Masters of Fine Art at Hunter College, New York in 1996. Work = Themes = Donachie creates socially-engaged art, often occupying public space. She explores biomedical research and ideas of communication, participation and how public spaces are designed, managed and used in her work. Books, written by Donachie, often accompany each work. She has also created unique ways to visualize public problems which can then be later discussed by those in government. One example of this was in the town of Huntly where issues about who bikes and where were in debate. Donachie's solution to visualizing the problem involved all bikers to attach chalk to their ride and then go about their business. The chalk would then record residents' progress in a visual manner throughout the town. = Early career = Donachie was one of a group of artists who helped establish Glasgow in the 1990s as one of the world's most dynamic contemporary art communities. There has been a retrospective exploring this body of work in Glasgow, which was called Generation. = Recent and current projects = Speedwork is a work at House for an Art-lover in Glasgow, which has been created after Donachie spent time with running groups using the park. Tomorrow Belongs to Me was a collaboration with Darren Monckton, a professor of human genetics at the University of Glasgow. It is a research project and film installation, which examines the personal impact of illness on individuals and families and Donachie also engaged with the scientific community whose research sought to explain how such illness arose. New Weather Coming, Donachie's work for the 2014 GENERATION festival, included three green trailer sculptures that toured Scotland and were accompanied by the handing out of a \\"book of Stories and Pictures\\" to daytrippers. The mobile sculpture in Oban was ill-received.

It was released on 15 October 1990 on 4AD. Featuring a less abrasive sound than the band's earlier releases, the title track was also released as Lush's first single and included the B-side \\"Breeze\\". Tim Friese- Greene produced Sweetness and Light over a six-week period at the Greenhouse and Wessex Sound Studios in London. The recording sessions took considerably longer than Lush's previous sessions with Robin Guthrie and John Fryer, but resulted in a more atmospheric dream pop sound. Sweetness and Light received mixed reviews upon release, but led to Lush's first major headlining national tour and placed in the national charts. The single was particularly successful in the United States, where it placed at No. 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and received heavy rotation on radio. Background and recording In 1989, Lush released their debut mini album Scar to warm reviews, and followed up the album with the Mad Love EP in February 1990. Mad Love brought a large amount of attention to the band from both the alternative and mainstream British press, with vocalist-guitarist Miki Berenyi and guitarist Emma Anderson becoming the subject of several gossip columns in national weeklies. Lush also began performing to larger audiences, performing at the Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts and opening as support for the Cure at the Crystal Palace Bowl in London, England in summer 1990. Lush began searching for a producer for their next set of material, and Talk Talk producer Friese-Greene was recommended. The band were unfamiliar with his work‚Äîthough Anderson and Berenyi purchased copies of Talk Talk albums just prior to the initial recording sessions‚Äîwhile Friese-Greene was already a fan of Lush. Sweetness and Light was recorded at the Greenhouse, a mid-range studio in London, in August 1990 with Friese-Greene and engineer Ed Buller. The sessions were unusually long for Lush; overall production was done over a six-week period, with mixing completed at Wessex Sound Studios. Greene's approach was considered as \\"enthusiastic\\" by Berenyi, and Anderson regarded his techniques as significantly different than Mad Love producer Guthrie and Scar producer Fryer. According to Anderson, Friese-Greene changed the original drum tracks to \\"Sweetness and Light\\", as well making several edits to the song's overall structure. Lyrics and music \\"Sweetness and Light\\" is regarded as one of Lush's signature songs. It is less \\"heavy\\" than the band's earlier post-punk-oriented material and has a \\"looser, lighter air\\" in its composition and production. Stylistically, \\"Sweetness and Light\\" is a dream pop song featuring elements of shoegazing music. Described as a \\"pure pop song\\", it uses feedback and several effects units on Anderson and Berenyi's guitar tracks. Both Berenyi's lead vocal and Anderson's backing vocal (which drew comparisons to Bilinda Butcher of My Bloody Valentine) are mixed low and obscured. According to NME writer Steve Lamacq, the vocals were \\"half-hidden\\" as they were symbolic of the band's \\"withdrawn\\" approach towards pop music and their \\"reluctance to become a \\"blatant\\" part of the current 'indie' rush to the charts.\\" Drummer Chris Acland (pictured in 1994) performed \\"Sweetness and Light\\" in a style reminiscent of Madchester music. \\"Sweetness and Light\\"s drum and bass instrumentation‚Äîperformed by Chris Acland and Steve Rippon respectively‚Äîare arranged in a Madchester style and drew comparison to the Stone Roses. Additional percussion on the track was performed by Phil Overhead. Acland and Rippon's rhythm section was made more prominent and \\"dancefloor-worthy\\" in Kevin Shields \\"Orange Squash\\" remix, included on the soundtrack to the 1999 film Splendor. Packaging and music video Sweetness and Lights packaging was commissioned by 4AD. Vaughan Oliver, who had designed the album sleeves for Scar and Mad Love, was head of direction and designed Sweetness and Lights artwork. The artwork features photography by Jim Friedman. The run-out matrix codes on the groove of the 12-inch record pressing of Sweetness and Light included two obscure messages: \\"Cool, fresh, milk float\\" on side 1 and \\"What's hiding under the sheets?\\" on side 2. Similar messages were hidden on the vinyl pressings of Scar and Mad Love. A promotional music video for \\"Sweetness and Light\\" was released in 1990. At the time of its release, the video received acclaim. Release and reception Sweetness and Light was released on 15 October 1990 on 4AD in the United Kingdom. Featuring \\"Sweetness and Light\\", \\"Sunbathing\\" and \\"Breeze\\", it was issued as a 12-inch and CD and was later made available as a digital download. The EP's title track was also released as Lush's first single, pressed as both a 7-inch and cassette single. For the single release, \\"Sunbathing\\" was omitted from the track listing and a shortened version of \\"Sweetness and Light\\" was used for the 7-inch's A-side. A promotional single, featuring both edits of the song, was released to radio in the United States to support the release of the compilation album Gala in December. Upon its release, Sweetness and Light entered in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 47 in its first week of release. The title song was a considerable independent success in the US, receiving heavy radio airplay and peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart as a result. Critical reception to Sweetness and Light was mixed. Melody Maker considered the single \\"sorely over-produced\\", while NMEs Terry Staunton considered the EP \\"glorious\\" and \\"pure Lush\\". A 13-date headlining British tour was announced in support of Sweetness and Light, featuring support from Faith over Reason. The tour began on 21 October 1990 at Zap Club in Brighton and concluded on 5 November at the Town & Country Club in London. On the tour, \\"Sweetness and Light\\" became a fan favourite and a staple of Lush's setlists for the subsequent 1990 tours in both the US and Japan. Lush were signed to Reprise Records on a licensing and distribution deal in the US a week after the release of Sweetness and Light, and the EP was reissued as part of Gala in November 1990. A remastered version of the title track was included on Ciao! Best of Lush, a compilation album released in March 2001, and the song was made available as downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series in July 2009.

Early Life and education Heather Phillipson was born in 1978 in the borough of Haringey in North London and then brought up in Greenwich, South East London. The youngest of three children, her mother was a social worker and feminist activist and her father a teacher, artist, jazz musician and writer. Phillipson and her siblings were all raised with an interest in the arts and music and Phillipson, while still a child, was awarded Grade 7 from the ABRSM on both violin and piano. At the age of nine, Phillipson won a London-wide poetry competition for the borough of Lewisham. As a teenager, Phillipson and her family moved to Glandwr, a village in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, where Phillipson attended Ysgol Dyffryn Taf School in Whitland. She later went on to study Art & Design at Pembrokeshire College in the town of Haverfordwest where she also worked part-time in a record shop, building up her collection and knowledge of UK dance and electronic music, which later informed her practice as a DJ, playing house, jungle and drum and bass. Phillipson went on to become very active in the late-90s UK rave and free party scene. As Phillipson has acknowledged, this has had a significant impact on the sampling, rhythmic and tonal structures of her work. In 1997, Phillipson moved to Hackney in East London to study Fashion Design at Central St Martins College of Art & Design. Dissatisfied with the course, Phillipson left after a year to study for an Undergraduate degree in art and philosophy at University of Wales Institute Cardiff, which she completed with 1st Class honours. Subsequently, she undertook a Postgraduate diploma in Drawing at Central St Martins College of Art & Design, London. Phillipson holds a PhD in Fine Art practice from Middlesex University, London, which she completed in 2007.  Personal life  Phillipson lives in Hackney, East London, where her studio is also based. Since 2016, she has volunteered as a mentor with Arts Emergency, a UK-based charity working to increase access to the arts for 16-19-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds.

They originally stood outside the fort at Agra The Mughal Emperor Akbar shoots the Rajput warrior Jaimal during the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 Jaimal Meratia (1507‚Äì1568) was the ruler of Merta. He was the half-brother of Meera and became the ruler of Merta after the death of his father, Rao Veeram Dev. His father was perceived as the strongest king of the east in his time. The Amar Kavya records that Udai Singh II granted Badnor along with 210 villages to Rao Jaimal. In 1553, Jaimal resisted falling under the chakri (service relationship) of Maldeo of Marwar. The Siege of Chittorgarh In 1567, when Akbar encamped outside Chittorgarh, in hopes of conquering the fortress, the ruler of Mewar, Udai Singh II, was advised by his chieftains to shift to Gogunda, and left the fortress in charge of 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 musketeers, who were in command of Jaimal and Patta. Jaimal died in Chittorgarh on 22 February 1568 by a musket shot fired by Akbar himself. This turned the tide of battle in the Siege of Chittorgarh and the Rajputs' morale decreased. Jaimal's name is commonly mentioned with his partner leader of chittor, Patta. These two were given the command of the army when Udai Singh, along with the royal family, had to leave the fort and go to the hills. Their attempts to repulse the Mughal Emperor himself was such that Akbar himself ordered the construction of their statues outside his fort in Agra to honour their courage. \\"At this time H.M.(Akbar) perceived that a person clothed in a cuirass known as the hazƒÅr mƒ´khƒ´ (thousand nails) which is a mark of chieftainship among them, came to the breach and superintended the proceedings.

The historical manor whose origins are dated back to the 14th century by the historian De Coston, is surrounded by a vast park with bassins and ornamental lakes. Southern facade of the Manoir le Roure  History  According to the historian de Coston the genealogy of the Roure family can be traced back into the 14th century: There is Pons in 1385, Jean in 1400, Guillaume in 1450, Pierre in 1471, Mathieu in 1500, Antoine in 1512, Christophe in 1530 and Claude in 1544. The latter leaves the estate called \\"Roure\\" to his daughter Claudine and her husband Arnand Pertuis. Each of the first born sons of the following generations, Hector, Samuel, Josserand, Jacques und Joseph Pertuis are one after the other owner of the Manoir le Roure. According to several genealogists, bankruptcy led the Pertuis family to sell the Roure to the noble Alexande de Piolenc de Thoury, president of the parliament in Grenoble, who resold it in 1758 to Jacques-Daniel Nicolas. According to Coston, Zacharie Pascal was the owner of the Roure in 1652. He died in the same year and his heir, his son Florent, adopts the name Florent Pascal du Roure. When he dies childless, his brother Alexande Pascal du Roure inherits the property. Also childless, the Manoir is left to his sister Madelaine Pascal du Roure, wife of Daniel Livache, judge of the feudal court of Duc de Lesdigui√®res. Jacques- Daniel Nicolas, born August 24, 1719, son of Daniel Nicolas, bought the estate in 1758 and also added the \\"Roure\\" to his family name. With his wife Jeanne- Monique Laurans he had around ten children, amongst them Daniel and Joseph. February 1, 1785, Daniel Nicolas du Roure, born on July 9th 1759, marries Marie Rousset, daughter of Pirre Gaspard Rousset and Marie Faujas, who gave birth to six children, amongst them Daniel, who is born March 22, 1796. To differentiate himself, Joseph Nicolas du Roure, born November 1761, brother of Daniel Nicolas, adopts the name of \\"Jonquet\\", also for his property not far from the Manoir. January 14, 1793 he marries Clotilde Richon with whom he has to son who dies unmarried and a daughter, Clotilde Nicolas-Jonquet, born around 1800. The bassin in the park of the Manoir le Roure The two properties and names are joined on September 27, 1824 when Daniel Nicolas du Roure, son of Daniel and Marie Rousset, marries his cousin Clotilde Nicolas-Jonquet, daughter of Joseph Nicolas-Jonquet and Clotilde Richon. Daniel is elected maire of Montelimar in 1830 and dies in 1863. His wife outlives him by 18 years. She inherits the Jonquet property, but not the Roure that she rebuys in 1879 from Jean-Baptiste-Fr√©d√©ric Chare (as marked in a newspaper article from September 4, 1879). She dies two years later without heirs. Her fortune of an estimated 306 000 Francs are donated to the Mont√©limar hospital, only the Manoir Le Roure is made over to her cousin Charles Rousset. The Rousset family is one of Mont√©limar's long-established communal families dating back into the 12th century. The for the history of the Manoir most important member of this family is born on December 6th 1847 in Mont√©limar, Charles-Louis-Marie-Joseph, shortly Charles Rousset. The young man is sergeant of the 32nd Infantry regiment, fights for the Metz army during the war and is held hostage. Back in France; he marries Marguerite-√âmilie-Marie de Pina de Saint-Didier in 1889. After several promotions he is appointed brigadier general in 1905. 1909 he returns to the Manoir le Roure and undertakes large architectural changes. In 1959 Alfred-Hector Baillieux buys the Manoir from the Rousset family. After his death it sold to the eleven-person Deloye family who keeps it until 2001. On sale, it is in 2002 that the estate is bought by Mr and Mrs Lhopital who transform it into a four-star hotel.  Construction  Since 1385 the estate contains vast agricultural buildings that border on the road and further in the south a wall that opens to a bog gate. Originally, the estate included a manor and a farm built out of Rh√¥ne pebbles. In the 17th century a cubic annex in an austere proven√ßale style was added. At the end of the 18th century great changes for embellishment were undertaken. A further floor was built, the roof heightened and the direction of the pitch of the roof changed. The result was a belle epoque manor, almost a castle with its tower and colonnades, a peristyle and an orangery that opens to the park. The Ch√¢teau de Grignan (made known by the Marquise de Sevigne who resided there many years) certainly influenced the architectural choices for the Manoir le Roure. The stained glass windows as well as the frescoes in warm coloring, dominated by ochre and saffron evoke an African reminiscence. Orangery of the Manoir le Roure The building was built to protect the terraces and the main building from the strong winds (Mistral). The most frequently used entrances are therefore found on the south side, whereas the few entrances on the north side are just enough to provide the lightning of the interior. The orangery and the terraces benefit from an orientation towards south southwest. The park Since 2002 the property stretches over a terrain of four hectare that comprises besides other tree species approximately 40 planes of more than 40 height. They line the route d√©partementale and the north entrance of the manoir. Lebanon cedars (more than 200 years old), a sequoia, seven chestnuts, linden, pines, poplars and oaks can also be found on the property. The park with its tall trees differs significantly from the surrounding vegetation. An explanation is maybe the fact that the property is served by three different sources. Until 1975 it was self-sufficient concerning the water supply.

App. NY July 1, 2014) was the first case in which a US court weighed the constitutionality of criminalizing cyberbullying. In People v. Marquan M., the New York Court of Appeals struck down an Albany County law that criminalized cyberbullying, declaring its restrictions overly broad and thus in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. __TOC__  Background  =Historical context= As access to the internet and other information technology has become widespread, there has been a rise in the use of these technologies to bully others, particularly among children and teenagers. This online bullying has been termed cyberbullying, defined as \\"using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person\\" by the National Crime Prevention Council. Following several cyberbullying cases where the victim committed suicide, states have pursued both educational and legislative approaches to combating the phenomenon.For example, after the suicide of Megan Meier, a 13-year-old girl that committed suicide in 2006 after suffering ongoing bullying on MySpace, both state and federal laws were proposed A rallying cry against cyberbullying. CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008 By 2011, over forty-five US states had implemented laws against digital harassment, although many of these were focused on school policies for dealing with bullying and harassment, rather than criminalizing cyberbullying.Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006‚Äì2010 Legislation by State, NCSL However, in 2010, the Albany County legislature introduced a law that criminalized cyberbullying to fight the growing problem. =Facts of the case= In 2010, the Albany County Legislature introduced the offense of cyberbullying to address \\"non-physical bullying behaviors transmitted by electronic means[.]\\"Albany County Local Law No. 11 of 2010. The law defined cyberbullying as > any act of communicating or causing a communication to be sent by mechanical > or electronic means, including posting statements on the internet or through > a computer or email network, disseminating embarrassing or sexually explicit > photographs; disseminating private, personal, false or sexual information, > or sending hate mail, with no legitimate private, personal, or public > purpose, with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, > intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional > harm on another person[.] The law made cyberbullying a misdemeanor offense punishable by up to one year in jail with a $1000 fine. One month after the law went into effect, the defendant Marquan M., a 16-year-old high school student, created a Facebook page under a pseudonym where he posted photos of classmates accompanied by descriptions of their alleged sexual practices, partners, and other personal information.People v. Marquan M., 2014 WL 2931482 (Ct. App. NY July 1, 2014) After a police investigation determined that the defendant was the one responsible for the content, he was charged with cyberbullying under the Albany County law. = Procedural history = At trial, Marquan M. filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the law violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment because it was overbroad and unlawfully vague. Specifically, the defendant contended that the law was overbroad because it proscribed protected expression and unlawfully vague because it failed to give fair notice to the public. Following the City Court's denial of his motion to dismiss, the defendant pleaded guilty, but raised constitutional arguments on appeal. The County Court affirmed the City Court‚Äôs denial of the motion to dismiss and held that the law did not violate the defendant's First Amendment rights. The county found that while parts of law are invalid, they are nonetheless severable, rendering the remainder of the law constitutional if interpreted in a restrictive manner. The New York Court of Appeals granted the defendant leave to appeal.  Court of Appeals  In a 5-2 decision, the court concluded that the law, as drafted, was \\"overbroad and facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\\" Basing its decision on the breadth and vagueness doctrines, the court concluded that the law is of \\"alarming breadth\\" as it criminalized a broad spectrum of protected communications \\"far beyond the cyberbullying of children.\\" While recognizing that a court should strive to save a statute, the court found it could not employ the severance doctrine in a way that would \\"cure all of the law's constitutional ills.\\" They concluded that it would require an excessive judicial revision, which could result in an unlawful rewriting of a legislative enactment. Under the First Amendment, free speech is generally protected and may not be restricted by the government except in limited categories and specific types of communication. A law is considered to be overbroad if it \\"prohibits a real and substantial amount of expression.\\" Because the law criminalizes \\"any act of communicating ... by mechanical or electronic means ... with no legitimate ... personal ... purpose, with the intent to harass [or] annoy... another person,\\" the court decided the law was overbroad because it includes communications with a much broader scope than bullying minors, such as those communications containing information meant to annoy or embarrass. However, the court stated that \\"the First Amendment permits the prohibition of cyberbullying directed at children, depending on how that activity is defined,\\" and suggested that a more narrowly drafted law against cyberbullying may be constitutional. =Dissent= The dissent argued that the provisions found by the court to be unconstitutional could be \\"severed from the rest of the legislation and that what remains...be interpreted in a way that renders it constitutionally valid.\\" Specifically, Judge Smith argued that the majority opinion was overly concerned with two aspects of the definition of cyberbullying provided by the law. The law forbids communications that have no legitimate purpose and whose intent is \\"to harass, annoy, threaten, abuse, taunt, intimidate, torment, humiliate, or otherwise inflict significant emotional harm.\\" While the majority opinion argued that the definition was overbroad by criminalizing communications with the intent to annoy, the dissent argued that this language should be interpreted as a \\"non-exhaustive list of ways\\" that significant emotional harm could be inflicted, and that it only forbids communications whose intent is to annoy in order to inflict significant emotional harm. The dissent concluded that despite \\"flaws in the draftmanship of the... law,\\" Albany County had a constitutional right to prohibit communications that have no legitimate purpose, are of private concern, and are intended to inflict significant emotional harm on children.

Her sculptures were carved primarily from natural materials such as soapstone (steatite), bone, and antler reflecting the hunting habits and daily life of her family and the Inuit people at large. Born in 1928 to carver Apollina Nobvak (1906-1965), she married fellow carver Nicholas Kringayark in 1942. Their daughters, Martha Ulliyak Milortok born 1944 and Simona Kringayark are also practicing carvers. A pioneering carver in the Repulse Bay, Northwest Territories (now Naujaat, Nunavut) community, Isserkut's work has been featured in at least 25 different exhibitions at a variety of institutions including the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Hamilton Art Gallery, and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development also known as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada among others. In 1979 one of her soapstone sculptures was featured in the third Canada Post Inuit series of stamps.

The film was adapted from Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre novel Paul et Virginie and features Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming as the title characters. The film follows two young lovers who grew up living on an island in the Indies. When Virginia is 16, her wealthy aunt in Paris offers to make Virginia her heir and educate her. With her mother's pleading, Virginia accepts and goes to France. Her aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, but Virginia refuses, is disowned and sent back home. The ship returns home in a hurricane and she drowns, with Paul nearly dying in a vain attempt to save her. Released on November 15, 1910, the film received mixed reviews in trade publications. The film was advertised with Pierre Auguste Cot's The Storm painting, said to have been inspired by the original novel. The title characters' costumes also appear to be based on Cot's painting. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: \\"Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from babyhood. Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on an island in the Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her.\\"  Cast  *Violet Heming as Virginia *Frank H. Crane as Paul  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The scenario was adapted from Jacques- Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierres novel Paul et Virginie and the title is directly derived from the title. It was translated into English in 1795 and it became very popular, but some editions rewrote the tragic ending into a happy one. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited as the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known cast credits are for the title roles. The other credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The New York Dramatic Mirror review contained specific details about the costumes and the production of the film, allowing for a view into the lost film. Apparently, Frank H. Crane wore white tights that were bagged at the knees and elbows. Violet Heming wore white gauzy robes, likened to those of fictional fairy princess'. The French gentleman sported a \\"Prince Albert\\", referring to the double-breasted Frock coat, and a silk hat. This contrast in gown was unusual, and the other characters wore colonial clothing. The scene containing the tempest which shipwrecks Virginia was described as being ineffective, but reviews in the Mirror were known to be strongly slanted towards Edison Trust companies. This included acting as a spoiler for Ten Nights in a Bar Room to bolster another Licensed company. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 15, 1910. Thanhouser advertised the film with Pierre Auguste Cot's The Storm which is believed to have been inspired by Paul et Virginie. The film had a wide national release, with theaters advertising the film in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Maryland, and Wisconsin. Reviews were mixed in trade publications, with Paul's garb being cited as the weakest aspect by two different reviewers. Walton of The Moving Picture News, praised the film as a success, but did not provide any details as to why it was successful. The Moving Picture World provided a detailed review which praised the adaptation of the novel and found the staging and the acting to be clear and strong. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was negative, criticizing the garb, tempest scene, and describing the acting as lacking in feeling. The Nickelodeon, an uncommon source for Thanhouser reviews, was not fooled by Crane's outfit. The reviewer said, \\"It is usually good advice to tell a man to 'keep his shirt on,' but we decidedly advise the actor who played the part of Paul in this piece to take his shirt off the next time he essays the role of a child of nature whose costume consists principally of his own skin plus a few trimmings. Baggy underwear, where his skin ought to be, looks like the arch-fiend. ... The production was adequate up to the point of the tempest and shipwreck, which fell down deplorably. Better to have left it out all together. From here onward the photoplay adapters have departed from the original story, and maybe they were wise. Paul in his nude underwear would have spoiled Virginia's funeral.\\" The film is presumed lost.

He is the lead turn announcer for MRN and has worked for the radio network on and off since 1983. He moved to MRN full-time in 1997 and became the lead turn announcer in 2001. Since 2003, Moody has been the host of the radio show SiriusXM Speedway on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. Early years Born in Montpelier, Vermont, Moody discovered auto racing when his uncle, Doug MacDonald, took him to the local Thunder Road Speedbowl. The track was owned by MRN co-founder Ken Squier. After being hired by CBS Sports to serve as their NASCAR anchorman, Squier selected Moody to replace him as the track's public address announcer. \\"I still don‚Äôt know how he picked me,\\" said Moody. \\"He may have read some of my newspaper columns and thought I had a workable vocabulary. More likely, I was just standing there with my finger in my nose and he figured, 'this is a kid with time on his hands.'\\" David used to announce for high school basketball, hockey, and football games from the time he was young. All of his classmates knew that this was what he was going to do when he grew up. We were right. Motor Racing Network =Beginning= With Squier's endorsement, Moody debuted for MRN in the 1983 Daytona 500 as a garage reporter. \\"I think it was one of the only Daytona 500s in history where nobody blew up, nobody crashed and nobody even spun,\\" he recalled. \\"I sat down there all day long, praying for someone to talk to. I eventually got a couple minutes of airtime, but that was about it.\\" Moody worked as a turn announcer for the first time in 1987, during the Gatorade 125's at Daytona International Speedway. Later, he called Darrell Waltrip through Turns three and four, en route to Victory Lane in the Daytona 500. =Present= Moody worked part-time for MRN until 1997, when he was hired to work weekly as a turn announcer. He took over the lead turn announcer's position in 2001, when Joe Moore moved to the anchor booth when Allen Bestwick transitioned to television with NBC. Moody has also worked in the anchor booth with Moore, replacing veteran Barney Hall. =Role= Moody is the lead turn announcer for MRN, calling the first and second turns for the network's broadcasts of NASCAR Cup Series, XFINITY and Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series race events. He is known for his high-energy, play-by-play commentary and his distinctive call, \\"Trouble in Turn Two!\\" Moody does not work the west coast races, due to travel concerns impacting his ability to host the Friday \\"SiriusXM Speedway\\" program. He is usually replaced on those race broadcasts by California native Dan Hubbard. Moody also serves as booth anchor for selected XFINITY and Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series companion events. SiriusXM Since 2003, Moody has hosted the nationally syndicated Sirius XM show Sirius XM Speedway on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. \\"Our first show was the day after Matt Kenseth won the championship. You couldn‚Äôt have picked a worse time to start a racing show. It was the end of the season. All of the drivers were either on an island or a boat somewhere. The race fans didn‚Äôt know we existed. We were brand new, and in the middle of a stick-and-ball sports channel. We would come on, do our three hours and lead into \\"World Soccer Daily.\\" There was zero listener transfer from our show to the next. Somehow, we made a go of it and soldiered on. It's been 11 years, now, and it doesn‚Äôt seem possible.\\" Moody has had a pair of \\"sidekicks\\" over the years, beginning with Suzy Q. Armstrong (wife of former MRN turn announcer Fred Armstrong) from the show's 2003 debut until 2011, when she left to pursue other projects. For the next four years, he co-hosted the show with Angie Skinner, wife of former Sprint Cup Series driver Mike Skinner. When Skinner left to co-host her own weekend show, Skinner Round-Up, Moody continued as sole anchor. In January 2015. Armstrong returned to the channel to deliver news updates at the bottom of the hour. Moody is known for his no-nonsense style of hosting, humor and outspoken opinions. He's a vocal advocate of free speech because \\"it puts the ‚Äòtalk‚Äô in ‚Äòtalk radio.‚Äô\\" However, when callers go off the beaten path, he's known to fight back and straighten those callers out. Moody and many of his callers state that the occasional back and forth is where the show is at its best. ‚ÄúIf everybody on the air agreed with everybody else, it would just be stultifyingly dull,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRush Limbaugh makes a billion dollars for every penny I make, so he must be doing something right. The only people that get on the air to talk to Rush Limbaugh are people that agree with Rush Limbaugh. It‚Äôs always, ‚ÄòMega dittos, Rush. I agree with everything you‚Äôve ever said in your life! [And Rush says] Well, of course you do because I‚Äôm the smartest‚Äô ‚Äì and that‚Äôs great, he‚Äôs doing a wonderful job and he‚Äôs very successful. I couldn‚Äôt do that.

The FDA's \\"breakthrough therapy\\" designation is not intended to imply that a drug is actually a \\"breakthrough\\" or that there is high- quality evidence of treatment efficacy for a particular condition; rather, it allows the FDA to grant priority review to drug candidates if preliminary clinical trials indicate that the therapy may offer substantial treatment advantages over existing options for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases. The FDA has other mechanisms for expediting the review and approval process for promising drugs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, and priority review.  Requirements  A breakthrough therapy designation can be assigned to a drug if \\"it is a drug which is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition\\" and if the preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.\\" Requests are reviewed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CDER receives approximately 100 requests per year for breakthrough designation. Historically, about one third were approved. CBER receives 15‚Äì30 requests per year. Sponsors must apply for breakthrough status separately for each indication they intend to label the drug for. Breakthrough designation applications are submitted as an amendment to the IND applications, usually prior to end of Phase II meeting.  Incentives  Drugs that have been granted breakthrough status are given priority review. The FDA works with the sponsor of the drug application to expedite the approval process. This expedited process can include rolling reviews, smaller clinical trials, and alternative trial designs.  Issues  Critics have said that the name is misleading and provides companies that obtain a breakthrough designation for a drug candidate with a marketing advantage that may be undeserved. The FDA acknowledges that the name \\"breakthrough therapy\\" may be misleading. It was never meant to imply that these drugs are actually ‚Äúbreakthroughs,‚Äù and it does not ensure that they will provide clinical benefit, but still critics complain that they are based on preliminary evidence, including changes in surrogate markers such as laboratory measurements, that often don't reflect \\"meaningful clinical benefit.\\" The FDA guidance states: \\"Not all products designated as breakthrough therapies ultimately will be shown to have the substantial improvement over available therapies suggested by the preliminary clinical evidence at the time of designation. If the designation is no longer supported by subsequent data, FDA may rescind the designation.\\"  Devices  As of August 2020, the FDA had granted breakthrough therapy to 298 devices in total since its inception, including 50 for the year 2020.

Born in Tennessee, she married Joe Thomas in 1816, and the couple had one son, Finice. The Thomases separated early, and many years later Caruthers and her son re-located to Portland, settling near the Willamette River in 1847. Filing claims under the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, the mother and son acquired each and built a house in what later became known as the South Portland neighborhood. In 1855, Caruthers, her son, and James Terwilliger deeded of land to the City for a cemetery. A stream flowing down Marquam Gulch through the Caruthers' property and into the river came to be known as Caruthers Creek. In 1856, Finice Caruthers and Stephen Coffin, doing business as the Pioneer Water Works, began providing water from the creek to lower downtown Portland through rudimentary pipes made from fir logs. This was the first formal water system in the city, otherwise supplied only by private wells, which were becoming increasingly endangered by pollution as the city grew. Questions about ownership of the Caruthers' land arose soon after Finice Caruthers died in 1860. Elizabeth Thomas Caruthers, who had generally relied on her maiden name after her split with Joe Thomas, had nevertheless filed her land claim as Elizabeth Thomas. She told people that although married to Thomas, she believed he had died in 1821. In 1857, when Elizabeth died, Finice inherited her claim. When he died three years later, he left no will, and he had no immediate family. Subsequent legal proceedings led to various claims on the Caruthers' land. One of them involved the assertion that women had no legal right to property acquired via the Donation Land Claim Act. However, in 1868, the U.S. Supreme Court resolved the issue, ruling that under the Land Claim Act a woman, whether married or not, had the same property rights as a man. Others who wanted to acquire the Caruthers' properties looked for the supposedly dead Joe Thomas, and in 1872 they persuaded a court that they had found him. During legal proceedings that followed, the parties involved agreed to a compromise. An entity called the South Portland Real Estate Association acquired all the claims to the land and eventually sold the property to financier Henry Villard.

His father was an African American playwright, actor, director and producer whose family emigrated from Nassau, Bahamas, to Miami.Robert Earl Sawyer's website His mother, an African American-Cherokee Indian originally from Bainbridge, Georgia, was head of the Intensive Care Unit of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in The Bronx, New York City, for 25 years. She had a passion for theatre.http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi- bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=20071206-161604 In 1950, Sawyer moved with his mother and sister Wanda from Miami to Harlem, New York City, and three years later to The Bronx. In 1961, he graduated from James Monroe High School. From 1962 to 1966, he studied history and political science at New York University. Nearby Greenwich Village exposed him to another world of art and culture, and to chess, which has remained a passion for him. According to Sawyer, the Woodstock Festival, in 1969, had a big impact on his career path. He was in the 1960s a regular at Mickey Ruskin's club Max's Kansas City, where he met Jimi Hendrix, Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Diane Arbus. Arbus would later make a portrait of him in her studio. Career In 1968, Sawyer found his vocation as a photographer while traveling in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. His first camera was a Kowa. His first professional job came in 1971 in London. Sawyer has cited photographers James Moore, Bill Silano, Richard Avedon, and Gosta Peterson as influences. In the early 1970s, Sawyer lived and worked in Paris and London. His photographs were published in magazines such as D√©p√™che Mode, Elle, and French Vogue. He photographed the African-American painter Beauford Delaney and the American actresses Patti D'Arbanville, Jessica Lange, and Maria Schneider in Paris. In 1973, he discovered the American model Christie Brinkley, took her first modeling photos and convinced John Casablancas to accept her at Elite Model Management in Paris.Gross, Michael. Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. New York: William Morrow, 1995, pp 317‚Äì18. In 1978, Sawyer returned to New York and worked for magazines such as New York Magazine, Working Women and US Vogue. He did beauty campaigns for Avon, Germaine Monteil and Max Factor. At the same time he continued his street photography. Since 1984, Sawyer has worked on commercial assignments and has done multicultural beauty projects for L'Or√©al and Vis-A-Vis Magazine. However, most of his time is spent on documentary and fine art photography, primarily black and white photographs in the streets of New York, Paris, and Amsterdam. His fine art pictures have been published in The Sun, ZoneZero of Pedro Meyer, PF Magazine, and Filosofie Magazine in the Netherlands. From 2006 until 2010, Sawyer was a guest professor of photography at Technical University Delft in the Netherlands. In 2010, his photo book City Mosaic was published.City Mosaic. Errol Sawyer Foundation, Amsterdam, 2010, The book contains 64 black & white images divided into three chapters: \\"Graffiti,\\" \\"Portraits & City Scenes\\" and \\"Perspectives.\\" Writing the book's introduction, photography critic A. D. Coleman describes the work as \\"close to four decades worth of engagement with the classic mode of mainstream-modernist street photography. Consistent in quality, in terms of both craft and content, it speaks in its own voice, aware of the tradition on which it builds but not noticeably beholden to any predecessor therein.\\"http://www.nearbycafe.com/artandphoto/photocritic/about- a-d-coleman/adc-in-print-and-pixels/recent-publications/ Style According to Sawyer, \\"a picture is good when it leaves room for you to imagine.\\"Fischer, Mathilde. Interview of Errol Sawyer at his website He aims to provoke the viewer to look more closely at everyday situations that may otherwise be overlooked. He photographs people, graffiti, and perspectives in public and semi-public space, such as parks, streets, and underground stations. Writing for PF Magazine, critic Herman Hoeneveld remarked \\"Errol Sawyer could be justifiably called a cultural philosopher who seems to press for consciousness and contemplation. He calls on our common sense to not allow our feelings to be crushed by the unbridled rush for consumption.\\" Art critic and former museum director Julian Spalding described Sawyer as \\"a classical black and white photographer in the Henri Cartier-Bresson tradition, using the camera at its simplest and most challenging, as a trap for catching time.\\"http://www.julianspalding.net/JS/Errol_Sawyer.html Writing for the World Socialist Web Site, Richard Phillips remarked \\"Errol Sawyer is a rare figure in contemporary photography: someone who worked in the often faddish and superficial world of high-end commercial photography but still retains his artistic integrity and creative spirit.\\" Exhibitions Sawyer has held solo exhibitions at: *4th Street Gallery, New York City, 1989.

The 2012 St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council election took place on 3 May 2012 to elect members of St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council in Merseyside, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Labour party stayed in overall control of the council. At the end of the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 40 *Liberal Democrats 5 *Conservative 3 Background Before the start of the election, Labour ran the council with 35 seats, while the Liberal Democrats had 9 seats and the Conservatives had 4 seats. 16 seats were contested in 2012, with Labour defending 9, Liberal Democrats 5 and the Conservatives 2. Five councillors stood down at the election, two Conservatives, Betty Lowe and the former leader of the Conservative group Wally Ashcroft, two Labour members Leon McGuire and Eric Smith, and one Liberal Democrat, John Beirne. Meanwhile, a former Liberal Democrat cabinet member, Carole Kavanagh, resigned her membership of the party over the policies of the national coalition government and defended her seat as an independent candidate. While the Conservative, Labour and the Green parties contested every seat, the Liberal Democrats only put up candidates in 9 of the 16 wards. Election result Labour gained 5 seats at the election to have 40 of the 48 councillors on St Helens council. The Liberal Democrats lost 4 seats to Labour to be reduced to 5 councillors, while the Conservatives lost 1 seat to have 3 councillors. The Labour gains included defeating both the Liberal Democrat group leader and councillor for 27 years, Brian Spencer, in Sutton and the Liberal Democrat deputy leader Suzanne Knight in Newton. The Liberal Democrats held only one seat at the 2012 election in Eccleston, while the Conservatives held one seat in Rainford. Meanwhile, after contesting every seat at the election, the Greens failed to win any seats, but did come second in Blackbrook, Thatto Heath and West Park wards. Brian Spencer, the former Liberal Democrat leader of St Helens council, was involved in an altercation with an Labour candidate, Mark Johnson, at the election count and would later in 2012 be convicted and fined for assault over the incident. Ward results By-elections between 2012 and 2014 =Windle= A by-election was held in Windle on 2 May 2013 after the death of Labour councillor Pat Martinez- Williams. The seat was held for Labour by David Baines with a majority of 717 votes over Conservative Robert Reynolds. =Billinge and Seneley Green= A by-election was held in Billinge and Seneley Green on 28 November 2013 after the resignation of Labour councillor Alison Bacon. The seat was held for Labour by Dennis McDonnell with a majority of 494 votes over UK Independence Party candidate Laurence Allen.

Her current projects also include for Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in Banff, Alberta and an expansion and renovation of historic Massey Hall in Toronto In 2010 she was named one of Canada‚Äôs Top 100 Most Powerful Women and in 2014 she was named one of Toronto‚Äôs top 50 Powerful People by MacLean‚Äôs Magazine. Education and early career McKenna was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1950. She graduated from The Study, a Canadian private education all-girls school in Westmount, Quebec in 1968 and was honoured by The Study in 2008 with the Judy Elder Alumna Award. To the students of The Study, she explained her choice to pursue architecture as follows: \\"I originally saw the profession as a balance between creative and business skills. I found out quite early that it is much more than that. It is a creative profession but requires the leadership skills of innovator, arbitrator, negotiator, communicator, along with strong design talent and business acumen. The pleasure of architecture is in the range of challenges that only increase from day to day.\\" McKenna is an alumnus of Swarthmore College (B.A. 1972) and has a Master of Architecture from Yale University (M.A., 1976), where she studied under architects Harry Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and Charles Moore. At Yale University, she also met and became lifelong friends with then aspiring actress Meryl Streep. Streep shared insights on Marianne‚Äôs career as an architect in the 2014 documentary \\"Making Space: 5 Women Changing the Face of Architecture\\". Upon graduation from Yale, McKenna worked for Bobrow & Fieldman, Architects in Montreal from 1976‚Äì78 and Denys, Lasdun, Redhouse & Softely in London from 1978-1979. In 1980 she joined Barton Myers Associates (BMA) in Toronto and was made an associate the following year. At BMA she met her future partners, also associates of Myers: Bruce Kuwabara, Thomas Payne and Shirley Blumberg. Notable projects she worked on in this period include the Hasbro Inc. New York showrooms and 35 East Wacker Drive in Chicago. Practice When Barton Myers relocated his office to Los Angeles in 1987, McKenna formed Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB Architects) with Bruce Kuwabara, Thomas Payne and Shirley Blumberg. Early in the practice, the Editorial Director of Progressive Architecture, Thomas R. Fisher, wrote: \\"...KPMB is particularly noteworthy because it has developed a more open, hybrid form of architecture and has taken the much more unusual step of structuring its practice along the same lines. The partnership, for example, is a mix of people of different genders, religious beliefs, ethnic backgrounds and political inclinations...theirs, in other words, is neither the autonomous individualism of the ‚Äòstar‚Äô design firm nor the rather anonymous specialization of corporate-type firms, but a more diverse and less structured hybridization of those older models.\\" With her partners, McKenna developed an approach where each of the four partners is either in charge of their respective projects or collaborates strategically to combine strengths in leadership and design on large-scale, complex initiatives, leading teams through all phases from design concept to delivery. Simultaneous to the project work, the partnership shares responsibility for directing the strategy and management of all four core areas of practice: business development, design, finance, marketing and administration. In 2012, the name of the partnership changed to KPMB Architects. KPMB Architects is today recognized as a leading Canadian practice. Projects and contributions McKenna is responsible for the transformation and expansion of The Royal Conservatory into a cultural destination. Her work began with the 1990 Master Plan, continued for over a decade with phased and various projects including Ettore Mazzoleni Concert Hall and culminated in 2009 with the TELUS Performance and Learning Centre and the Michael and Sonja Koerner Hall. The design achieved numerous awards, including the Governor General‚Äôs Medal in 2012. For her outstanding contribution and commitment, Marianne was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Conservatory in 2011. Reflecting on her work at the Conservatory, McKenna says, \\"The wonderful part of this project is the opportunity to overlay so many aspects of music, from the teaching and practicing of the students, to the performance of faculty and musicians from across the city and around the world. The buildings, both the historic stone fabric and the more contemporary fabric stretched across the site, become a crucible for amazing musical variations.\\" As partner-in-charge, McKenna has directed many of KPMB‚Äôs projects including the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto (2014 Governor General‚Äôs Award and Architectural Record \\"Good Design is Good Business Award\\"), the Jackson-Triggs Niagara Estate Winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake (Canada‚Äôs selection at the 2002 Green Building Challenge in Oslo, Norway); the Master Plan for Ryerson University (2010 American Institute of Architects Honor Award) and the Grand Valley Institution for Women (1997 Governor General's Award). McKenna also developed and implemented the professional practice course at the University of Toronto‚Äôs John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design. In the fall of 2016, she was the Lord Norman R. Foster Visiting Professor at Yale University and she currently serves on the Advisory Board for The McEwen School of Architecture at Laurentian University. In June 2017, Marianne received her Honorary Doctorate of Laws (honoris causa) degree from Laurentian University.

Severus of Menorca: Letter on the Conversion of the Jews. Clarendon Press. According to the Epistula Severi (Letter on the Conversion of the Jews written by Severus of Menorca) Severus was at the forefront of a mass conversion where most of the Jewish population on the island converted to Christianity in 418 C.E. The Epistula Severi explains that the relationship between the Jews and the Christians on the island grew tense when relics of St. Stephen arrived on the island approximately a year before the conversion began. It took eight days to convert the Jewish population to ChristianitySeverus of Menorca. Letter on the Conversion of the Jews. trans. and ed. Scott Bradbury. Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, 1996. and, in that time, the synagogue on the island was burnt to the ground and 540 Jews were converted.  Authenticity of the Epistula Severi  Cardinal Baronius initially published the letter in 1594. However, it was not until 1752 that it underwent its first scrutiny by R. P. Ludovici Du Mesnil. He, like many scholars after him, was skeptical of the paper's authenticity. Some scholars of the era claimed the letter was a \\"willful distortion or even an outright forgery\\". Even today, some scholars doubt the letter's authenticity. A more recent scholar who believes the text is a forgery is Bernhard Blumenkranz. Blumenkranz believes the text was written in the 7th century, arguing that the \\"atmosphere of physical intimidation\\" towards the Jews was common in 7th century Spain. Furthermore, Blumenkranz mentions that the 7th century was an era notorious for the production of forgeries. On the other hand, Scott Bradbury argues against Blumenkranz, claiming that Bishop Severus of Menorca wrote the letter in 418 C.E. Bradbury explains that the person who wrote the letter was exceptionally accurate when giving dates. For example, Severus claims he arrived in Magona on Saturday the 2nd of February. It turns out that the 2nd of February was indeed a Saturday and this detail is too accurate for someone from the 7th century. Moreover, Bradbury discusses that other texts written in the 5th century allude to the Severus' letter. One of which is the De Miraculis Sancti Stephani, a \\"collection of [St.] Stephen's miracles\\" written in around 425 C.E. This document mentions the conversion of the Jews on the island of Menorca in 418 C.E., and the fact that St. Stephen's relics were monumental in the conversion. Another document supporting this theory is a letter written to St. Augustine by Consentius, which also alludes to the events on Menorca. Other scholars have given more evidence that the text was indeed written by a 7th-century Bishop. One such piece of evidence is that the anti-Semitic rhetoric Blumenkranz alludes to is \\"mild\\" in comparison to that of 7th-century writings.  Forced conversions  In the 5th century, Jews in the Roman Empire were protected from violence as well as from forced conversions by the law. However, in the Epistula Severi, it seems that this is not the case as the synagogue was burned to the ground. Furthermore, one of the Jews on the island of Menorca, Galilaeus, converts to Christianity out of fear of being killed by his Christian neighbours. Severus explains that Galilaeus is not really afraid of his Christian neighbours, rather he is afraid of being sentenced to ‚Äúeternal damnation‚Äù (i.e. hell) if he does not convert to Christianity. Regardless of what Severus writes, it is clear that Galilaeus felt forced to convert, which is exactly what the law tried to prevent.

Portrait by Carl Steffeck (1850) Ferdinand Konrad Bellermann (14 March 1814, Erfurt ‚Äì 11 August 1889, Berlin) was a German painter and naturalist, who specialized in scenes of Venezuela.Hern√°ndez Caballero, Seraf√≠n (Editor). (1998): Gran Enciclopedia de Venezuela. Editorial Globe, C.A. Caracas. 10 volumes, ,  Biography  His father, a tanner, died prematurely, leaving the family in financial straits. As the eldest child, he was especially responsible for their care. Although they received help from his uncle Johann, a successful businessman, he took a job herding sheep. His talent was discovered, however and, in 1828, at the age of fourteen, he was able to attend the Weimar Princely Free Drawing School, where he studied to be a porcelain painter. The intention was that, upon graduating, he would work at the Volkstedt porcelain manufactory, which was owned by relatives. Apparently, however, he developed vision problems,Brief biography @ Miradas Alemanas. so he returned to Erfurt and stayed there until 1833, when he went to study in Berlin with Wilhelm Schirmer and Carl Blechen. While there, he travelled extensively throughout Thuringia and visited R√ºgen to make sketches. During these excursions, he also developed an interest in botany and acquired considerable knowledge on the subject. A Street in La Guaira In 1840, he took a trip to Norway, via Belgium and the Netherlands, with Friedrich Preller (one of his teachers from Weimar) and two other students. It was a hazardous trip, over back roads with primitive accommodations but, on their return, he painted a large canvas that drew attention to his ability for accurately representing nature, including geological formations. It is currently lost, but was purchased by King Frederick William IV. That led to Bellermann being recommended by Alexander von Humboldt to accompany an expedition to South America, initiated by a merchant from Hamburg, to make scientifically accurate representations of the plants and landscapes. He arrived in Venezuela in July 1842, and stayed until September 1845. The expedition began at the port of La Guaira, where he sketched the local inhabitants and the ruins that still remained from the 1812 Caracas earthquake. He toured most of the country, visiting sites suggested by Humboldt, amassing a huge collection of pastel, pen and pencil sketches as well as some oil paintings, depicting urban life and customs in addition to the landscapes. While there, he witnessed the return of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's remains from Santa Marta in November 1842. He arrived back in Germany in November 1845, but continued to paint canvases relating to Venezuela for the rest of his life. In 1849, he became a Professor of drawing at the Prussian Academy of Arts, and then in 1866, took over the landscape painting professorship from his former teacher, Wilhelm Schirmer. During his tenure, he was an advocate for Humboldt's ideas regarding the potential use of tropical vegetation in Europe. From October 2014 to January 2015, a major centennial retrospective of his work was held at the Angermuseum in Erfurt.

The Oude Kwaremont, contrary to popular belief, is not the name of a hill, but the name of one of the cobbled roads leading up the Kluisberg hill. The Kluisberg is one of several hill formations in the Flemish Ardennes in the south of East-Flanders, close to the border with Wallonia. The climbing road is best known for its presence in many Flemish professional cycling races, such as the Tour of Flanders, E3 Harelbeke and Dwars door Vlaanderen. Characteristics The lower 600 m of the climb consist of a narrow asphalt road, the upper 1600 m are paved with cobblestones. The first 500 m of cobbled section are particularly difficult, it is the steepest and narrowest part of the climb with a bad, very uneven cobbled surface. Halfway up the climb, near the church of Kwaremont village, the gradient gradually levels out from 11% to just 2%, but with still a cobbled kilometer to go to the top. The top is situated just after the cobbled section, at 111 m, after a 93 m altitude gain. Despite its iconic status in Flemish cycling, the climb was only first included in the Tour of Flanders in 1974. Before, the hill was climbed via a parallel street, since 1974 called New Kwaremont, whose cobbled surface was replaced in the late 1960s by an asphalt road. The cobbles of the Oude Kwaremont have been classified as monuments by Flemish decree since 1993.

Kerry, 576 U.S. 1059 (2015), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the President has the exclusive power to recognize (or not recognize) foreign nations, and, therefore, Congress may not require the State Department to indicate in passports that Jerusalem is part of Israel. Background =Foreign Relations Authorization Act= On September 26, 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. Section 214 of the Act, entitled \\"United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel,\\" included various statutes regarding the status of Jerusalem, including invoking the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 to urge the President to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, cutting budget authorizations for the publication of official documents \\"which lists countries and their capital cities unless the publication identifies Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\\" and authorizing American citizens born in Jerusalem to name \\"Israel\\" as their birthplace on official government documents. Specifically, section 214(d) states: '''' The section was seen by the Executive as conflicting with the long-standing U.S. policy that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. President George W. Bush signed the act into law on September 30, but issued a signing statement asserting that \\"U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed\\" and section 214 \\"would, if construed as mandatory rather than advisory, impermissibly interfere with the President's constitutional authority to formulate the position of the United States, speak for the Nation in international affairs, and determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states.\\" =Zivotofsky v. Clinton= Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after the enactment of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. When both requests to list Israel as the birthplace on Menachem's passport were denied (first as \\"Jerusalem, Israel,\\" then as simply \\"Israel\\"), parents Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky filed suit against the State Department (then headed by Hillary Clinton). The petitioners' case was ruled by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be unqualified for judicial review as it seemingly posed a nonjusticiable \\"political question\\" and would \\"necessarily require the Court to decide the political status of Jerusalem.\\" On May 2, 2011, the Supreme Court granted the case (Zivotofsky v. Clinton) certiorari. It was argued on November 11 of that year, with attorney Nathan Lewin representing the petitioner and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. representing the respondent. On March 26, 2012, the Court reversed the lower court decisions in an 8-1 decision (with Justices Alito and Sotomayor writing separate concurrences, and Justice Breyer writing the dissent). In writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts stated: '''' Opinion of the Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the Court, striking down the 2002 law and holding that the president has the exclusive power to recognize foreign nations, and that the power to determine what a passport says is part of this power.https://news.yahoo.com/court-strikes-down-born- jerusalem-passport-law-140857993--politics.html \\"Recognition is a matter on which the nation must speak with one voice. That voice is the president's.\\" Justice Stephen Breyer filed a short concurrence, reiterating his dissenting opinion from Zivotofsky v. Clinton. He wrote that the \\"case presents a political question inappropriate for judicial resolution.\\" Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He backed the majority's view on the unconstitutionality of the section 214(d) passport provision but claimed such Presidential powers over passports do not extend to consular reports. He wrote the \\"regulation of these reports does not fall within the President's foreign affairs powers, but within Congress' enumerated powers under the Naturalization and Necessary and Proper Clauses.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion and was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts argued that the Constitution neither conclusively nor preclusively grants the President such power to recognize foreign nations. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion and was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Scalia argued that the Constitution also grants Congress power to recognize foreign nations by way of the power to regulate commerce with foreign states. Furthermore, Scalia wrote that the 2002 law merely accommodates a \\"geographic description\\" similar to other descriptions that the State Department offers.

However, the species is even more marked for its ability to live on more diverse prey than possibly any other comparably sized raptorial bird, which, given its considerable size, is almost fully restricted to eagles. This species can adapt to surprisingly small prey where it is the only kind available and to large prey where it is abundant. Eurasian eagle-owls feed most commonly on small mammals weighing or more, although nearly 45% of the prey species recorded have an average adult body mass of less than .

The same basic hunting and killing methods are used by all owls in the genus Bubo, except that the snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) and fish owls regularly watch for prey from a ground position (on a bank in the case of fish owls).Jaksiƒá, F. M., & Carothers, J. H. (1985). Ecological, morphological, and bioenergetic correlates of hunting mode in hawks and owls. Ornis Scandinavica, 165-172. Most hunting occurs in wood-cloaked openings, often those carved out by wetlands or watersheds. While they can and do hunt within woodlands, they are not well suited to hunting in areas with dense understories, thick foliage or tree thickets, as they seem to hunt firstly by vision and only secondarily by sounds, unlike some other owls. Eurasian eagle- owls are too heavy with relatively modest wing areas to hunt extensively on the wing although this species‚Äô relatively short, broad wings allow it low- speed maneuverability in the moments are it takes off after they spot a prey item. Because of the limits of its flying abilities, the Eurasian eagle-owl requires ample, elevated perches from which to watch for prey activity and thus in most areas it will not hunt extensively in open, treeless areas, unlike smaller owls like the barn owl (Tyto alba). Tree branches are often the main hunting perches used but they will also use rock formations, rubble with large rocks, hills with tall grasses or even a building, tall pole or other elevated manmade perch.Mart√≠nez, J. A., Serrano, D., & Zuberogoitia, I. (2003). Predictive models of habitat preferences for the Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo: a multiscale approach. Ecography, 26(1), 21-28.Martinez, J. A., Martinez, J. E., Manosa, S., Zuberogoitia, I., & Calvo, J. F. (2006). How to manage human-induced mortality in the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo. Bird Conservation International, 16(03), 265-278.Owls of the World: A Photographic Guide by Mikkola, H. Firefly Books (2012), Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, including nocturnal migrants, taking advantage of their distraction and diminished visual acuity to intercept them in mid-flight. They seem to hunt mostly by opportunity, taking whatever detectable prey item that is available, preferably those that are active. Most prey, even up to the size of small rabbits, are swallowed whole.Sergio, F. (2002). Biases associated with diet study methods in the Eurasian Eagle-Owl. J. Raptor Res, 36(1), 11-16. While a small rodent can easily be swallowed in an instant, if the prey item is large, the swallowing process can appear grueling and grotesque and in some cases eagle-owl nestlings have choked to death while attempting to swallow overly large prey (i.e. moorhens). Small prey is often swallowed immediately after capture, although occasionally it is carried in the bill to the nest for the young or to a roost for quick consumption. Larger prey is normally carried in the owl's feet and is more likely than smallish prey to be brought to the nest due to its nutritional value. Exceptionally large prey (probably any over ) is consumed on the ground where it is killed, possibly being torn apart into manageable pieces. This leaves the owl vulnerable to loss of their prey to scavengers or to confrontations with heavier predators. The undigestable portions of prey are regurgitated in the form of pellets as in all owls. Pellets of the Eurasian eagle-owl average around , thus they are around the same size as those of most other large Bubo owls, even the notably smaller great horned owl (B. virginianus). In some cases, pellets of Bubo owls can range up to in length. Eagle-owl pellets average slightly larger (about 10%) than those of great grey owls (Strix nebulosa).Cramp, S. 1985. Handbook of the birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Vol. 4. Oxford Univ. Press. Oxford. As is the case with all owls, pellets are indisputably the best method to examine the main diversity of prey consumed by an owl. However, it is also important to examine the prey remains left around a roost or nest when available. Larger prey, which may be torn apart before the eating of portions or fleshy parts of the prey item, is frequently determined solely by remains rather pellets as are birds, in which the wings, feet and some feathers may be removed before consumption.Laroulandie, V. (2002). Damage to pigeon long bones in pellets of the eagle owl Bubo bubo and food remains of peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus: zooarchaeological implications. In ZM Bochenski, Z. Bochenski, JR Stewart (Eds.), Proceedings of the 4th Meeting of the ICAZ Bird Working Group, Krak√≥w, Poland, 11‚Äì15 September 2001. Acta Zoologica cracoviensia (Vol. 45, pp. 331-339). As in the great horned owl, after capturing larger prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl often beheads it. In part, this may be due to making prey easier to carry off and, in both large owl species, it is considered a signature indicator for predator identification.De Cupere, B., Thys, S., Van Neer, W., Ervynck, A., Corremans, M., & Waelkens, M.

A captive Eurasian eagle-owl catches its food in mid-air. Summary of general diet The diet is generally more diverse than any other co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making up the majority of the diet.Hume, R. (1991). Owls of the world. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order of extent of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the common vole (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe;Delattre, P., Giraudoux, P., Baudry, J., Qu√©r√©, J. P., & Fichet, E. (1996). Effect of landscape structure on Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) distribution and abundance at several space scales. Landscape Ecology, 11(5), 279-288. the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle- owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France.Don√°zar, J. A., Hiraldo, F., Delibes, M., & Estrella, R. R. (1989). Comparative food habits of the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo and the Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus in six Palearctic and Nearctic biomes. Ornis Scandinavica, 298-306.J√°nossy, D., & Schmidt, E. (1970). Die Nahrung des Uhus (Bubo bubo). Regionale und erdzeitliche √Ñnderungen. Bonner zool. Beitr, 21, 25-31. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and hares and rabbits. A very large balance of the prey range can also be comprised by birds and other prey including reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects and other invertebrates are seemingly taken whenever they are available. All told, well more than 600 different species have been identified as prey of Eurasian eagle-owls. Their diet includes basically all the same prey as all sympatric diurnal raptors in the genera Buteo, Aquila and Haliaeetus. The total number of prey species may even surpass that of the great horned owl and may well be the greatest of any raptorial bird on the Eurasian continent. Among five segments of Europe the average prey diversity per region was 63 species, a higher number than any of the other 40 raptorial bird species studied there.Marti, C. D., Korpim√§ki, E., & Jaksiƒá, F. M. (1993). Trophic structure of raptor communities: a three-continent comparison and synthesis. In Current ornithology (pp. 47-137). Springer US. The mean mass of prey per study has varied from as little as , near the now former Aral Sea in Turkmenistan with the Turkmen jerboa (Jaculus turkmenicus) being the primary prey species, to , in Spain with the European rabbit being the primary prey species.Jaksiƒá, F. M., & Marti, C. D. (1984). Comparative food habits of Bubo owls in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Condor, 288-296. Remarkably, in northern Spain, where the rabbit is now extirpated (as was the eagle-owl for a time in the 20th century), the average weight of prey can dip as low as .Serrano, D.

Pages 35-46. In comparison, the lightest mean prey mass in dietary studies of the great horned owl was while the highest was .Don√°zar, J. A., Travaini, A., Ceballos, O., Delibes, M., & Hiraldo, F. (1997). Food habits of the great horned owl in northwestern Argentine Patagonia: the role of introduced lagomorphs. Journal of Raptor Research, 31(4), 364-369. Most dietary studies place the average weight of Eurasian eagle-owl prey in the zone of , thus the species fits well within the rule of thumb that most prey weigh no more than 20% of the raptorial bird's own weight.Simeonov, S., Milchev, B., & Boev, Z. (1998). Study of the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo (L.))(Aves: Strigiformes) in the Strandzha mountain (Southeast Bulgaria). II. Food spectrum and trophic specialization. Acta zool. bulg, 50(2/3), 87-100.Olsen, Jerry. Australian high country owls. CSIRO PUBLISHING, 2011. The average prey weight in comparison to the eagle- owl's body mass is reportedly average and unremarkable for both owls and raptors in general, the average prey per one study was 7.2% of the eagle-owls‚Äô body mass. The European raptorial birds most likely to attack prey of a relatively large size compared to themselves were the black kite (Milvus migrans), whose average prey was 35.7% of its own weight, and the Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), whose average prey was 31.7% of its own weight. On the other hand, when rabbit numbers were at their peak, the average prey mass in Spain may range up to at least 55% of the eagle-owls‚Äô own body mass in that population.Penteriani, V., Delgado, M. M. (2010) B√∫ho real ‚Äì Bubo bubo. En: Enciclopedia Virtual de los Vertebrados Espa√±oles. Salvador, A., Bautista, L. M. (Eds.). Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid. A raptorial prey comparison estimated that the mean prey weight for eagle-owls in Europe was as a mean among 5 main regions, the highest of any owl but similar or slightly lighter than the European average for northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and considerably lower only than two widespread European eagles. Per that study the average prey weight of the great horned owl in 4 North American regions was much lower (averaging only ). In Mediterranean scrub, the average mammalian prey of the Eurasian eagle-owl was nearly five times heavier than those of great horned owls from similar habitats in Chile, California and Colorado, where in combination the horned owl's mammalian food averaged . However, a comparison between eagle- and horned owls based upon six comparable biomes in the Americas and Eurasia found the great horned owl's prey averaged , improbably slightly higher than the eagle-owl at . If known Asian studies are mixed with European ones, the average prey weight for the Eurasian eagle-owl overall may also roughly be . Among sympatric owls in Europe, the mean prey weight of long-eared owls (Asio otus) was found to be , the tawny owl (Strix aluco) took prey weighing a mean of (though locally can be as high as ) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) mean prey weigh was . A study in Finland seeking to distinguish the differences in prey taken by females and smaller male eagle-owls found that the two sexes prey averaged and , respectively. The species taken as food by the two sexes there were largely the same but the female simply often caught the larger prey individuals.Mikkola, H., & Tornberg, R. (2014). Sex-specific diet analysis of the Eurasian Eagle Owl in Finland. Ornis Fennica, 91, 195-200. Prey types = Rodents = The brown rat is now arguably the most significant prey species for eagle-owls in Europe. In terms of sheer quantitative abundance, rodents are by far the most dominant prey group in the diet of the Eurasian eagle-owl. Roughly 130 species of rodent are known to have been taken by these owls. Due to their small sizes, however, rodent prey often comprise a relatively small portion of the prey biomass, excepting relatively large rodents such as mice, rats and hamsters, some of which weigh at least . In many parts of Europe, the most numerous prey in dietary studies are the brown rat and the common vole, followed by the nearly as widespread field vole (Microtus agrestis). Among the areas where the common vole was the leading prey species included southern Sweden, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.Geidel, C. (2012). Entwicklung neuartiger Schutzkonzepte f√ºr den Uhu (Bubo bubo) -Abschlussbericht 2012. Gutachten (DBU-Projekt).Schaefer, H. (1971). Beutetiere des uhus Bubo bubo aus Karpaten und Lappland.

In areas that have undergone more heavy development, the brown rat predominates, being the leading prey item in several parts of France including C√¥te-d'Or, Loz√®re and even the remote Pyrenees, Belgium, the Italian Alps, and Bra»ôov, Romania.Marchesi, L., Sergio, F., & Pedrini, P.

The brown rat is even the primary prey in Lebanon despite it being tied solely to human habitations as the environment is often too arid to allow it to survive further afield.Bayle, P., & Prior, R. (2006). Prey species of Eagle Owl Bubo bubo in Lebanon. SANDGROUSE, 28(2), 167. Black rats (Rattus rattus), at , are also hunted but rarely in equal number to the generally more successful brown rats. In Norway and Finland, field voles were the most numerous prey species, per one study in the latter country it made up 30.1% of the food but only provided 3.3% of the prey biomass. The European water vole, averaging at , was the main prey species in Styria, Austria, although considerably secondary in biomass to hedgehogs, as well as in central Sweden. The water vole often the second or third most regularly found prey species in several other European studies.Sackl, P., & D√∂ltlmayer, G. (1996).

E., Mikkola, H., Mummery, L., & Westerhoff, G. (1972). Prey found in eagle owls' nest in central Sweden. British Birds, 65(11), 482-483. In Samara, Russia, the diet is dominated by the European water vole, although other species such as European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) and European hares (Lepus europaeus) (both also significant prey there) probably outweigh them in biomass contribution. The common vole and European water vole together made up roughly 80% of the prey by number in the High Tatras of Slovakia and more than 60% of the diet in bordering Poland. The common vole is one of the most important foods for Eurasian eagle-owls. In the northern extremes of their range, Eurasian eagle-owls tend to have a less varied diet than those to the south and the need to catch significant numbers of rodents rises as they are often the only regularly accessible prey in sparse sub-Arctic environments. In northern Sweden, more than 60% of the food was made up of microtine rodents, i.e. the Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus), the field vole, the European water vole and the grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus).Schaefer, J.H. (1970). Womit ern√§hrt der uhu (Bubo bubo) in Lappland seine Jungen. Bonner zoologische Beitr√§ge, 21, 52-62. In one study from western Russia, rodents comprised more than 90% of the diet of the eagle-owls, led by the steppe lemming (Lagurus lagurus) at 24% by number, the narrow-headed vole (Microtus gregalis) at 21% and the European water vole at 17.9%.Emikov, E.V. Trophic remains from the Eagle-Owl (BUBO BUBO L) in forest-steppe landscapes of Middle Siberia. Similarly in high altitude tundra of the East Austrian Alps, nearly 90% of the food was found to be comprised by microtine rodents, the European snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) being the most frequently identified species in the diet. In Spain, the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus), at up to 41.8% of the prey by number, and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), at up to 10.5% by number, are often regularly taken, especially in regions where rabbit numbers have declined.Don√°zar, J. A. (1989). Variaciones geograficas y estacionales en la alimentacion del Buho real. Ardeola, 36, 25-39.Donazar, D. 1998. Interhabitat differences in the diet of the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) in the mid Ebro river valley (NE Spain): effect of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) availability. 45 (1): 35-46. In Romania, the Romanian hamster (Mesocricetus newtoni) and European hamster are the most prominent species found in the eagle-owl's diet, alongside the brown rat.Sandor, A. D. & Bugariu, S. (2008). Food habits of the Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) in Cheile Dobrogei Gorge. Sc. Annals of DDI, 16: 69-74. The Romanian hamster is also dominated the prey list per a study in Bulgaria, only the European water vole follows distantly in number.Simeonov, S., & Boev, Z. (1988). A study of the nutritive spectrum of the eagle owl (Bubo bubo L.) in Bulgaria. Ecology, 21, 47-56. Dormice are readily taken when available in Europe, especially the edible dormouse from central Europe to the eastern countries.Lebl, K., Bieber, C., Adam√≠k, P., Fietz, J., Morris, P., Pilastro, A., & Ruf, T. (2011). Survival rates in a small hibernator, the edible dormouse: a comparison across Europe. Ecography, 34(4), 683-692. In Slovenia, the edible dormouse was the most regularly- recorded prey species, making up 20.2% of the food but it comprised 9.4% of the biomass.Milehic, T. (2002). Diet of the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo in southwestern Slovenia. Acrocephalus 23 (112): 81-86. The edible dormouse was also the most regular prey species in Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol, Italy, making up 22.5% of the diet.Toffoli, R., Beraudo, P., Caula, B., & Pavia, M. (1999). L'alimentazione di una coppia di Gufo reale Bubo bubo sulle Alpi Marittime. AVOCETTA-PARMA-, 23, 102-102. The smaller garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) and considerably smaller hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) are also occasionally predated in Europe, plus at least a half dozen other dormouse species in eastern Europe, Asia Minor and several points to the east. Jirds, jerboas, gerbils and hamsters, particular the genera Allactaga, Ellobius, Gerbillus, Meriones, and Pygeretmus, start to become noticeable in the diet in the more arid portions of this species‚Äô range, i.e. from Asia Minor to the Middle East and Central Asia. Relatively large species such as Tristram's jird (Meriones tristrami) and the Euphrates jerboa (Allactaga euphratica) are often amongst the more prominent species to be hunted.Obuch, J. (1994). On the food of eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) and tawny owl (Strix aluco) in the eastern part of Turkey. Tichodroma, 7, 7-16. In western Kazakhstan, the primary foods are the great jerboa (Allactaga major) and northern mole vole (Ellobius talpinus) while on the Buzachi and Mangyshlak Peninsulas of the Kazakh Caspian Sea, the primary foods were the Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) and small five-toed jerboa (Allactaga elater). All told, in the peninsular Kazakh regions of the Caspian Sea, jirds, jerboas and gerbils made up about 92% of the food. In the Tibetan Plateau of China, the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus) is the leading prey species, making up 53.1% of the prey. In Mongolia, two rather small rodents, the Mongolian five- toed jerboa (Allactaga sibirica), at 23.6% of the prey, and the Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli), at 14.5% of the prey, make up a majority of the prey by number.Tumurbat, J., Sundev, G., & Yosef, R. (2009). Nest site and food composition of the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo in Mongolia. Ardea, 97(4), 519-523. In the Transbaikal, the Chinese striped hamster (Cricetulus barabensis) was the main prey species, making up 43.8% of the diet. The alpine marmot is a seldom-caught but sizeable and nutritious prey item for an eagle- owl. What all primary rodent prey species share is that they are either nocturnal or crepuscular and are often common to abundant in openings of woods and rocky environments. The reason Eurasian eagle-owls take rats, which associate rather closely with humans, much more regularly than they take house mice (Mus musculus) is not their larger size (many other rodents regularly taken by eagle-owls are as small or smaller than a house mouse) but the rat's ability to flourish along the edges of crop fields, refuse dumps, roadsides and abandoned buildings and fields, whereas the mice are more closely tied to active human habitations. A single refuse dump can host several thousand rats and eagle-owl territories that include dumps can locally expect higher productivity due to the abundance of this food source.Penteriani, V., Gallardo, M., & Roche, P. (2002). Landscape structure and food supply affect eagle owl (Bubo bubo) density and breeding performance: a case of intra- population heterogeneity.

Journal of Parasitology 91: 210-213. Squirrels are readily predated but, being diurnal, are largely unavailable to this and other owls. When they are captured, it is presumably around dawn or dusk from their tree hole, in species such as the widespread red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), or burrow entrance, in the case of ground squirrels, most regularly recorded as prey in Asia Minor and the Central Asia. A few specimens of the woolly flying squirrels (Eupetaurus cinereus), the largest of the world's flying squirrels and one of the rarest, were the only identified foods for Eurasian eagle-owls in northern Pakistan alongside some European hares.Zahler, P., & Dietemann, C. (1999). A note on the food habits of Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo in northern Pakistan. Forktail, 98-99. Although not common in the diet, a few species of marmot have been taken and may be an important aspect of the prey biomass. In Europe, adult-sized alpine marmots, (Marmota marmota) have been killed. However, the average weight of Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) taken in Mongolia was only and that of alpine marmots in Engadin, Switzerland was only . These obviously comprising young marmots as adults have average weights from , from spring low weights to pre-hibernation weights during autumn hypophagia.Wagner, G., & Springer, M. (1970). Zur Ern√§hrung des uhus Bubo bubo im Oberengadin. Orn. Beob, 67, 77-94. Other than marmots, the largest rodent known to be hunted by Eurasian eagle- owls is the introduced aquatic rodents, the muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), which in one study estimated to average when taken, and the nutria (Myocastor coypus), equal in size to the large marmots.Leditznig, C., Leditznig, W., & Gossow, H.

Enemies and Competitors of the Nutria in USSR. Journal of Mammalogy, 353-355. = Lagomorphs = A young European rabbit, the primary food for western European eagle-owls. Throughout the western Mediterranean region, the Eurasian Eagle-Owl is something of a specialist on a single prey species: the European rabbit. The rabbit historically reached extremely high densities in Iberian scrub, i.e. more than 40 per every 1 square hectare (2471 square acres). In central Spain, up to 73.1% of the recorded prey for Eurasian eagle- owls, by number, are rabbits.Serrano, D. (2000). Relationship between raptors and rabbits in the diet of eagle owls in southwestern Europe: competition removal or food stress? Journal of Raptor Research, 34(4), 305-310. Where still available, they are also the main prey in Portugal and central France.Lourenco, R. (2006). The food habits of Eurasian eagle-owls in Southern Portugal. Journal of Raptor Research, 40(4), 297-300.Orsini, P. (1985). The diet of the eagle owl Bubo bubo in Provence, southern France. Alauda, 53(1), 11-28. However, following the devastation of the wild rabbit due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease, the local eagle-owls have frequently had to adapt to other, often smaller, prey. On the other hand, given the now much reduced numbers of rabbits, the eagle-owls still regularly select rabbits, seemingly out of proportion to their commonality.Antonio Mart√≠nez, J., & Zuberogoitia, I. (2001). The response of the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) to an outbreak of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease. Journal f√ºr Ornithologie, 142(2), 204-211. Although large mature wild rabbits commonly weigh , the eagle-owls usually hunt smaller specimens, often with an average weight around , with young rabbits usually selected in spring and summer and subadults selected in the autumn and winter.Don√°zar, J., & Ceballos, O. (1989). Selective predation by eagle owls Bubo bubo on rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus: age and sex preferences. Ornis Scandinavica, 117-122. This is largely due to the behaviour of rabbits, with younger rabbits being forced to distribute following weaning, being less cautious in behaviour and occupying less primary habitat, thus being forced out of the confines of their burrows more regularly than mature adults.Penteriani, V., Del Mar Delgado, M., Bartolommei, P., Maggio, C., Alonso‚ÄêAlvarez, C., & J Holloway, G. (2008). Owls and rabbits: predation against substandard individuals of an easy prey. Journal of Avian Biology, 39(2), 215-221. However, the estimated average weight of rabbits taken can be variable, reported from as little as in a study from Spain to as much as in the Netherlands. Three other lagomorphs extensively overlap in range with Eurasian eagle-owls in Europe, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) in the northern portions, the European hare (Lepus europaeus) in the central and eastern portions and the Granada hare (Lepus granatensis) in the western Mediterranean portions. These species are all larger on average than a rabbit, averaging in the Granada hare, roughly twice that in the European hare and the mountain hare being intermediate between the two. Hares are often considerably secondary in prey remains in most European biomes by number but often are a significant contributor of prey biomass for eagle-owls. For example, in Finland, the mountain hare made up only 5.3% of prey by number but made up 56.2% of the prey biomass as the hare specimens were all large, with an estimated mean mass of . On the contrary, the mountain hare was the numerous prey species in one study from the Swiss Alps, making up 28.3% of the prey by number. Another area near Europe where hares were numerically important was in southwestern Turkey, with the European hare being the second most common prey species by number. There it consisted of 18.1% of the quantity and presumably a huge portion of the biomass. In lower Austria, the European hare was also the second most abundant species in the diet but the estimated average weight of hares taken was rather low, at , indicating young hares of probably less than a month old are most often taken there. On the other hand, in Slovenia, Netherlands and Bavaria, the European hares taken were estimated to average , and , respectively.Schweiger, A., & Lipp, L. (2011). W√ºhlm√§use (Arvicolinae) als bevorzugte Beute des Uhus Bubo bubo w√§hrend der Jungenaufzucht in Bayern. Zeitschrift bayerischer und baden-w√ºrttembergischer Ornithologen, 50(1): 1-25. The European hare was also the second most common prey species in a study from the Czech Republic. Outside of southwestern Europe, the next closest association between lagomorphs and this species is in the arid steppe of southern Russia, hares are apparently the primary prey of the local eagle- owls. Little has been published in recent ornithological review, but old studies have indicated that the eagle-owls in this region are so dependent on hares, primarily again the mountain hare species, that cyclical reductions in numbers of the hares are followed immediately by a reduction of the local eagle-owls.Dementiev, G. P., Gladkov, N. A., Ptushenko, E. S., Spangenberg, E. P., & Sudilovskaya, A. M. (1951). Birds of the Soviet Union, vol. 1. Jerusalem: Israel Program for Scientific Translation. A similar phenomenon has been noted in the great horned owl in its association with the snowshoe hare in the American boreal forest.Adamcik, R. S., Todd, A. W., & Keith, L. B. (1978). Demographic and dietary responses of great horned owls during a snowshoe hare cycle. Canadian Field-Naturalist, 92(2), 156-166. The same prey, the mountain hare, was the most important along the Pechora River in Russia, making up 34.1% of prey numbers, although the general habitat is distinctly different from the steppe, as it consists of mountainous sub-taiga dense forests. Together with sizeable numbers of Eurasian red squirrels and large forest grouse which are the next most significant prey types by number, the mean prey size along the Pechora is presumably extremely large. Although in surrounding arid lowlands the food is almost totally dominated by gerbils, jirds and their kin, in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the cape hare (Lepus capensis) was the leading prey species, making up 44% of the prey numbers. In Mongolia, tolai hare (Lepus tolai), of similar size to the cape and Granada hare, were the most significant contributor of prey biomass, making up 30.6% of biomass but only contributed 4% of the prey by number Other than the prior mentioned species, at least five other species of hare have been found as occasional contributors to the eagle-owl's diet.Qinghu, C., Jianping, S. & Zhigang, J. (2008). Summer diet of two sympatric species of raptors upland buzzard (Buteo hemilasius) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in Alpine meadow: Problem of coexistence. Pol. J.

The only other family in the lagomorph order, the pikas, have been found to factor regularly into the diet of Eurasian eagle-owls as well, mainly in the mountainous regions of Asia. Pikas are much smaller than rabbits and hares, averaging amongst the know prey species. One study in Mongolia found that Daurian pikas (Ochotona dauurica) made up 73% by number of the remains.Smith, A. T., Formozov, N. A., Hoffmann, R. S., Chapman, J. A., & Flux, J. E. (Eds.). (1990). Rabbits, hares and pikas: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN. In the Tibetan Plateau, the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) and gansu pika (Ochotona cansus) were the second and third most numerous prey species. The more sizeable large-eared pika (Ochotona macrotis) was the second most regular prey species in the Pamir Mountains, comprising 10.8% of the remains. = Other mammals = The Eurasian eagle-owl is perhaps the only predator to prefer European hedgehogs as food, as one of the few predators not foiled by its prickly defenses. Hedgehogs often comprise a fairly significant portion of the prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls, both in numbers and biomass. At least eight species of hedgehog have been predated. The European hedgehog is often one of the most prominent prey species in eagle-owl diet studies from Europe, and was recorded as the most numerous prey species per researchers in parts of Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and south Germany. With an average weight of , the European hedgehog can comprise a very large portion of the biomass.Laursen, J. T. (1999). F√∏devalg hos Stor Hornugle Bubo bubo i Danmark. Dansk Orn. Foren. Tidsskr, 93, 141-144. A study of the Bavarian region of Germany, the European hedgehog (the main prey species) made up 41.7% of the prey by number and 52.1% of the biomass, the maximum representation of hedgehogs known in Europe.F√∂rstel, V. A. (1995). Der Uhu Bubo bubo L. in Nordbayern. Zeitschrift bayerischer und baden-w√ºrttembergischer Ornithologen, 34(2/3): 77-93. Other members of the genus Erinaceus are also locally regularly taken, as is the Daurian hedgehog (Mesechinus dauuricus) in Mongolia. Studies from Greece and the Czech Republic found that the northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) was the leading prey species.Papageorgiou, N. K., Vlachos, C. G., & Bakaloudis, D. E. (1993). Diet and nest site characteristics of Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) breeding in two different habitats in north-eastern Greece. Avocetta, 17(1), 49-54.Zemanov√°, K. (2009). Potrava v√Ωra velk√©ho na st≈ôedn√≠ Moravƒõ. Unidentified Erinaceus hedgehogs almost totally dominated the diet of eagle- owls in Stavropol, Russia, making up 70.9% of the food, only the European rabbit has been found as more significant at the genera level by number in a given dietary study.Malovichko, I.L., Gavrilov, –ê, I., & Fedosov, V.N. (2007). Characteristics of distribution, breeding and diet of the Eagle Owl in the steppes of Stavropol Territory. Committee on birds of prey in the dynamic environment of the Third Millennium. Studies from both Syria and Kazakhstan showed that the long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) was the most significant prey, making up 25.3% and 33.6% of the prey remains, respectively.Shehab, A. H. (2004). Diet of the Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo, in Syria. Zoology in the Middle East, 33(1), 21-26.Karyakin, I., Kovalenko, A., Levin, A., & Pazhenkova, A. (2009). Eagle Owl in the Aral-Caspian Region, Kazakhstan. Raptors Conservation, (17). After killing hedgehogs, the Eurasian eagle-owls peel the prickly skin off their backs before consumption, frequently resulting in up to dozens of hedgehog backs being found around nests. Moles and shrews are readily hunted but are usually only a secondary portion of the diet. Eurasian eagle-owls have been recorded hunting the smallest mammal on earth (by weight) the Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), as well as the largest mole on earth, the Russian desman (Desmana moschata). From the smallest shrew to the heaviest hedgehog, the Eurasian eagle-owl has been verified to hunt the full size range of insectivores. They've also attacked bats of every size available, from the smallest European bat, the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), to the largest species there, the greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). In the Sikhote-Alin range of the Russian Far East, bats were found to comprise 5.9% of the remains and, of five local owl species, the Eurasian eagle-owl was the most regular predator of bats in the area.Rosina, V. V., & Shokhrin, V. P. (2011). Bats in the diet of owls from the Russian far East, southern Sikhote Alin. Hystrix It. J. Mammal., 22, 205-213. Larger and more dangerous mammalian prey is not infrequently tackled by Eurasian eagle-owl. Nearly thirty species of mammalian carnivores have been reported in their diet. Many of these are mustelids, which are the smallest type of carnivore but can defend themselves viciously, even the tiny least weasel (Mustela nivalis).Lourenco, R., & Rabaca, J. (2006) Intraguild predation by Eagle Owls in Europe. Airo 16: 63-68. Nonetheless, unlike some smaller birds of prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl seems to have no problem subduing various weasels and even martens, some of the latter can nearly equal to their own weight, and will kill the young of much larger species such as European otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles).Korpim√§ki, E., & Norrdahl, K.

Escape tactics and alarm responses in badgers Meles meles: a field experiment. Ethology, 99(4), 313-322. However, the single most widely reported carnivore is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as they've been recorded in the diet from Denmark and Spain to the Russian Far East. Many fox specimens taken by eagle-owls are young individuals or subadults. Some studies posited that the average fox taken as weighing about , about equal to the eagle-owl's own weight, but another noted fox specimens killed that were estimated to weigh , much larger than the eagle-owls. At least four other species of foxes have been verified as prey in the Middle East and Asia.Geffen, E. (1994). Vulpes cana. Mammalian Species, 1-4.Larivi√®re, S., & Seddon, P. J. (2001). Vulpes rueppelli. Mammalian Species, 1-5. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), averaging , have been preyed on in Asia as well.Ward, O. G., & Wurster-Hill, D. H. (1990). Nyctereutes procyonoides. Mammalian Species, 1-5. Other relatively large carnivores have been hunted as well, including invasive Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in Spain and masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in China, both being roughly cat-sized at averages of , respectively.Dahmer, T. D. Feral/stray dogs and civet mortality on Kau Sai Chau. Domestic carnivores including cats (Felis silvestris catus) of all sizes and small dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) or puppies may on occasion become prey for Eurasian eagle- owls. Cats killed have been estimated to weigh from . The dogs killed by Bavarian eagle-owls were estimated to average . Non-native carnivores such as American mink (Neovison vison) and raccoon (Procyon lotor) have also been preyed on by eagle-owls, which is presumed to incidentally benefit the prey taken in considerably numbers by these rarely checked invasive fur- bearers.Sidorovich, V. E. (2011). Analysis of vertebrate predator-prey community. Tesey, Minsk, Ukraine.Aliev, F. F., & Sanderson, G. C. (1966). Distribution and status of the raccoon in the Soviet Union. The Journal of Wildlife Management, 497-502. The roe deer may be the largest prey taken by any living owl, some specimens taken are at least six times as heavy as the eagle-owl itself. The Eurasian eagle-owl is perhaps the only living owl widely reported (if not commonly) to kill the young of ungulates. At least nine species have been identified as their food. It is possible that some ungulates are eaten as carrion but this species, like most owls, normally kills its own food, unlike many eagles many of which consume carrion regularly. Among the ungulate prey recorded are three species of deer and five species of goat- antelopes, in addition to piglets of wild boar (Sus scrofa).Frey, H., & Walter, W. (1984).

Serie B f√ºr Botanik und Zoologie, 91-99. Only the weight of the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has been widely approximated when taken and specimens killed have included: a deer, a specimenCurry-Lindahl, K.

In studies from Bavaria and Austria, the average weight of roe deer caught was only , indicating very young deer being typically taken. Even if taken as newborn kids, fawns or calves, the young of other ungulates taken would weigh at least , from the birth weight of ibex (Capra ibex) to that of red deer (Cervus elaphus).Levy, N., & Bernadsky, G.

The Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) diet in the Orava Region (N Slovakia) . Slovak Raptor Journal, 4, 83-98. Perhaps even larger, the rare domestic sheep (Ovis aries) taken by eagle-owls can reportedly include ‚Äúhalf-grown‚Äù individuals. = Birds = In some areas, common wood pigeon are more important prey for Eurasian eagle-owls than any mammal. The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt at least 300 species of bird. In Europe, the most common avian prey species are the normally feral or domestic rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon is the most important prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number.Bayle, P., & Schauls, R. (2011). Biologie de quatre couples de grand-duc d‚ÄôEurope Bubo bubo au Luxembourg. Bull. Soc. Nat. luxemb, 112, 51. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids and all available species have been targeted. The carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of hooded crow (Corvus cornix), western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), common ravens (Corvus corax), rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl's diet. In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including no less than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall).Rockenbach, D. (2005). Der Uhu Bubo bubo in Baden- W√ºrttemberg- Wie Ph√∂nix aus der Asche! Ornithol. Anz. 44: 117-122. Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl.Penteriani, V., Sergio, F., del Mar Delgado, M., Gallardo, M., & Ferrer, M. (2005). Biases in population diet studies due to sampling in heterogeneous environments: a case study with the Eagle Owl. Journal of Field Ornithology, 76(3), 237-244. More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl's diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle- owls in Europe.Frey, V.H. (1973). Zur √ñkologie nieder√∂sterreichischer Uhupopulationen. Egretta, 16: 1-68. One study of a ‚Äúprimeval‚Äù forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone.Vondr√°cek, J. (1983). PU√çSPEVEK –ö POTRAVitfEKOL√ìGH A SLOZENf POTRAVY VYRA VELK√âHO NA SEVEROCES√åCYCH LOKALIT√ÇCH. Sylvia, 22: 39-54. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass.Choi, C. (2007). Y.; Nam, H.‚ÄìY.; Lee, W.‚ÄìS. Diets and foraging tactics of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in two different habitat types. Kor. J. Env. Eco, 21, 30-37. Other birds of prey are perhaps second only to pigeons and corvids amongst avian contributors to the diet (their ecological relationships with eagle-owls are explored in more detail below). Here, carrion crows mob a Eurasian eagle-owl. It is with good cause as many are taken by night by the eagle-owl. Among coastal and some wetland areas, various water birds can come to contribute a large portion of both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from the one of the smallest sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, more than 10 species of herons, more than 8 species of rails and any grebes, cormorants or other water birds that are available. The most regularly reported water bird prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands.Vidal, P. & Bayle, P. (1997). Le Grand- Duc d'Europe bubo bubo : Une nouvelle esp√®ce d'oiseau nicheuse sur les √Æles de Marseille (Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne). Faune de Provence, 18: 55-57. The diet of eagle- owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the mew gull (Larus canus), common puffin (Fratercula arctica) and common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle- owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the crested auklet (Aethia cristatella ) (26.9%).Kolomiytsev, N.P, & Poddubnaya, N.Y. (2007). The biology of the eagle owl Bubo bubo in the Lazo Nature Reserve (South Primorye) . Russian Ornithological Journal 2007, Volume 16, Issue Express 364: 835-840. In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion's share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole.Volkov, S.V., Sharikov, A.V. & Morozov, V.V. (2009) Owls in Northern Eurasia. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot- billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl's diet includes all type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the hoopoe (Upupa epops), the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the European roller (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls. As thrushes are relatively small, at among the species known to be predated, pairs in the Italian Alps who depended more so on thrushes usually showed lower productivity during nesting attempts. Wild birds found in their diet have ranged in size from the Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) to about 15 species weighing over . One of the largest wild adult bird verified as prey was the greylag goose (Anser anser). Other large species have been hunted, some may be cases of nest robbery rather than large adults but none are heavier than the largest mammalian prey that eagle-owls have taken including greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis) and demoiselle crane (Anthropoides virgo), all averaging around , the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), the common crane (Grus grus) and the (between the dimorphic sexes) great bustard (Otis tarda).Vazhov, S.

Eurasian eagle-owls have also hunted adult male western capercaillie, which average about , although usually the much smaller females, at , are more regularly taken. Although they rarely take domestic birds, the range of sizes killed is just as dramatic, from loose budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), weighing only , to domestic turkeys, which may easily weigh over . = Other prey = The common frog, perhaps the only amphibian taken in large numbers by Eurasian eagle-owls. Reptiles and amphibians are only an occasionally contributor to the diet in many regions. Most of the 30 or so species recorded have been taken as supplemental prey in Spain, i.e. several lizards (including geckos), frogs and toads, snakes and, to a lesser degree, turtles. One species widely and commonly reported in Europe outside of the Iberian region is the common frog (Rana temporaria). It was the leading prey, making up 45% of the prey found at nests in Rogaland, Norway.Hagen, Y. (1950). Noen iakttagelser over hubro (Bubo bubo L.) i Rogaland. Stav. Mus. Arbok, 93-110. Also, the common frog was the second most abundant prey species in studies from southern Sweden, Valais and Engadin in Switzerland, Verbano-Cusi-Ossola, Italy and an enormous study from Slovakia, in the latter 10,476 frogs recorded making up 28.2% of the prey.Arlettaz, R.

There are no records of vicious fights between snakes and Eurasian eagle-owls as there are with the great horned owl, with the horned owl sometimes losing its life after attacking a snake. Perhaps with their larger size and greater power, the eagle-owl can more easily overpower any snakes they encounter, although most snakes in Europe and temperate Asia are not particularly large.Olalla‚ÄêT√°rraga, M. √Å., Rodr√≠guez, M. √Å., & Hawkins, B. A. (2006). Broad‚Äêscale patterns of body size in squamate reptiles of Europe and North America. Journal of Biogeography, 33(5), 781-793.Bent, A. C. 1938. Life histories of North American birds of prey, Part 2. U.S. National Museum Bulletin 170:295-357. Like the golden eagle, the eagle-owl may attack spur- thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca). In Lebanon, a ‚Äúlarge adult‚Äù tortoise, which would be at least as heavy as the eagle-owl itself, was among their food items, although how they handle and eat this large, hard-shelled prey is not clear. Eurasian eagle-owls also opportunistically prey on fish, although never in large numbers, as fish are likely to be taken while encountered incidentally during hunts for other prey such as water birds. This species is known to take a greater diversity of fish (more than 30 species verified) and is more widely reported to hunt them than the great horned owl. Most of the fish recorded are medium-sized, with at least 10 each of various kinds of carp or cod, but several species averaging more than in mature mass have been taken, including common barbell (Barbus barbus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), northern pike (Esox lucius) and a few species of trout, even bigger marine predators like the anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and European conger (Conger conger). However, in many cases small, young specimens may be caught of these large fish species rather than full-grown adults.Russ, H. 2010. The Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo): a fish bone accumulator on Pleistocene cave sites? Journal of Taphonomy 8(4): 281-290. Several species of insect and invertebrate have been identified in eagle-owl pellets. In some cases, these may be undigested insects in the stomachs of birds eaten by the eagle-owl but Eurasian eagle-owls have been verified as actively hunting insects and aquatic invertebrates such as snails and crabs before. Especially diverse in the diet are ground-based beetles, at least 20 species have been identified mainly those in the Carabus (ground beetle) genus.  Interspecies predatory relationships  The common buzzard, although near the top of the avian food chain, is often a victim to predation by Eurasian eagle-owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl is a very formidable bird of prey but its diet broadly overlaps with other European owls. All species of owl in the Europe and northern Asia hunt rodents, as does the eagle-owl, and in many the very same microtine rodents such as voles and lemmings will be favored.Mikkola, H. (1983). Owls of Europe. T & AD Poyser Books.Herrera, C. M., & Hiraldo, F. (1976). Food-niche and trophic relationships among European owls. Ornis Scandinavica, 29-41. Even the Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), at a whooping one-fortieth of the weight of an eagle-owl, will take much the same rodent prey as eagle-owls in adjacent habitats. The only European owls to favor non-rodent prey are the European scops owl (Otus scops) and little owl (Athene noctua), both of which most regularly consume invertebrates. However, little owls also take rodents and small mammals, especially in the winter months (while scops owl migrate to Africa for the winter). The European owls with the most similar diets to eagle-owls are tawny (Strix aluco) and Ural owls (Strix uralensis), although both are considerably smaller and less powerful and more specialized to hunt in wooded environments. These two Strix species are highly territorial and sedentary like the eagle-owl and capable of taking a broad range of prey, including good numbers of birds and larger prey such as rabbits (for the tawny owl) and hares (for the Ural owl) of up to at least twice their own weight. Studies have indicated that even while selected similar prey species as the eagle-owl, smaller owls including the long-eared, tawny and Ural owls select smaller individual prey items, being more likely to take small, juveniles rather than optimal, large adults as does the eagle-owl.Nilsson, I. N. (1984). Prey weight, food overlap, and reproductive output of potentially competing Long-eared and Tawny Owls. Ornis Scandinavica, 176-182.Korpim√§ki, E., & Sulkava, S. (1987). Diet and breeding performance of Ural owls Strix uralensis. Ornis Fennica, 64, 57-66. Similar rodent prey is also often taken by many diurnal birds of prey, especially buzzards, harriers and small falcons.Clark, W. S., & Porter, R. (1999). A field guide to the raptors of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Oxford: Oxford University Press. However, due its greater size and power than overlapping owls and smaller diurnal raptors, it generally takes more diverse and larger prey than most overlapping raptorial birds. In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl is part of a complex guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were recorded per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli's eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators.Gil-Sanchez, J. M., Valenzuela, G., & Sanchez, J. F. (1999). Iberian wild cat Felis silvestris tartessia predation on rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus: functional response and age selection.

All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands.Moreno, S., Beltr√°n, J. F., Cotilla, I., Kuffner, B., Laffite, R., Jord√°n, G., & Villafuerte, R. (2008). Long-term decline of the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in south-western Spain. Wildlife Research, 34(8), 652-658. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.Delibes, M., Rodr√≠guez, A., & Ferreras, P. (2000). Action plan for the conservation of the Iberian lynx in Europe (Lynx pardinus) (No. 111-115) . Council of Europe.Real, R., Barbosa, A. M., Rodr√≠guez, A., Garc√≠a, F. J., Vargas, J.

Equally or even more so than the great horned owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl is a threat to any smaller type of raptor it encounters, whether other owls or diurnal birds of prey. All told, more than 20 species of accipitrid, 15 species of owl and 9 species of falcon have been found amongst their prey. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the primary predator of other birds of prey throughout Eurasia, not even the prolific raptor-killing northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) equals the sheer number of raptors taken.Mikkola, H. (1976). Owls killing and killed by other owls and raptors in Europe. British Birds, 69, 144-154.Louren√ßo, R., Santos, S. M., Raba√ßa, J. E., & Penteriani, V. (2011). Superpredation patterns in four large European raptors. Population ecology, 53(1), 175-185. Up to 6% of the overall food by number and 36% by prey biomass for Eurasian eagle-owls can be comprised by other raptorial birds. The primary raptorial prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls in Europe are two species: the long-eared owl and the common buzzard. Both are taken in such large numbers that they rank in the top five most regularly hunted bird species in Europe. In Luxembourg, the long-eared owl and common buzzard were the fourth and fifth most regularly hunted prey species. Other high rankings have included the long-eared owl being the fourth most regular prey species in Bavaria and the buzzard being the third most regular prey species in a study from the Czech Republic.F√∂rstel, A. (1983) Bestandsaufstockung des Uhus Bubo bubo in Bayern. Anzeiger der Ornithologischen Gesellschaft in Bayern, 22, 145‚Äì167. While migrating, long-eared owls appear to select areas to move through partially based on whether or not eagle-owls are detected, thus eagle-owls have a very serious influence on the behaviour of this prey. Despite the large numbers taken of both of these, the more scarce eagle-owl does not seem to have a serious deleterious effect on their overall population, especially compared to anthropogenic factors. The long-eared owl is the most regularly taken as prey of any raptorial bird by Eurasian eagle-owls. Other than these two species, a large share of the raptorial prey for eagle-owls is made up of other owls. Given that all European owls are to some extent nocturnal, they may be encountered and killed upon detection by the Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, it has killed every other species of owl, from the tiny pygmy owl and scops owl to the large great grey owl and the snowy owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the only raptor that has been known to prey on snowy owl on multiple occasions. However, the threat Eurasian eagle-owls poses to other raptors can be exaggerated.Solonen, T. (2011). Impact of dominant predators on territory occupancy and reproduction of subdominant ones within a guild of birds of prey. Open Ornithology Journal, 4, 23-29. Occasionally, with adequate mammal prey populations, they can nest as close as a few dozen meters of other raptors and never harass them. When nesting in the same groves as the long- legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus) in southeastern Bulgaria, Eurasian eagle-owls did not predate the buzzards at any point.Milchev, B. (2009). Breeding biology of the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus in SE Bulgaria, nesting also in quarries. Avocetta, 33, 25-32. Long-legged buzzards have been killed however in Kazakhstan. Even in those occasional cases where they pick off one or several raptors, they do not effect the overall population, unless the raptorial prey is already heavily diminished due to some other (often human- based) cause. For example, despite both being a known predator of both, they did not significantly depress numbers of either northern goshawks or tawny owls in southern Finland. One study showed that many raptors engage in spatial avoidance during potential encounters with Eurasian eagle-owls and while the predation by eagle-owls did decrease raptor population densities, they seldom caused declines in breeding success or altered habitat occupancy.Sergio, F., & Hiraldo, F. (2008). Intraguild predation in raptor assemblages: a review. Ibis, 150(s1), 132-145. Discreet habitat preferences may coincidentally spare many owls, as owls from the genera Strix, Glaucidium, Aegolius and the northern hawk-owl (Surnia ulula) tend to restrict both nesting and their hunting forays to more enclosed areas of woodland than habitats inhabited by the eagle-owls.Hakkarainen, H., & Korpim√§ki, E. (1996). Competitive and predatory interactions among raptors: an observational and experimental study. Ecology, 1134‚Äì1142. Meanwhile, Asio, Otus, Athene and barn owls owls tend to hunt in more open habitats than the edges favored by eagle-owls. However, habitat preferences are never enough to spare any of these genera from predation by the great eagle-owl. In the Italian Alps, despite differing habitat preferences and partially overlapping prey, several tawny owls were killed by eagle-owls.Sergio, F., Marchesi, L., Pedrini, P., & Penteriani, V. (2007). Coexistence of a generalist owl with its intraguild predator: distance-sensitive or habitat-mediated avoidance? Animal Behaviour, 74(6), 1607‚Äì1616. Woodland nesting owl species tend to nest in tree hollows, many of which are too small for an eagle-owl to access, so are somewhat less likely to be picked off at their nests. Open-country owls that tend to nest in open- access nesting sites like short-eared owls and little owls may be somewhat more vulnerable at the nest. The great numbers of long-eared owls taken, since it often nest in dense, protective thickets, are probably adult or immature owls attempting to hunt. In Europe, Eurasian eagle-owls are generally the only owls to regularly nest in rocky habitats. This is not the case in arid desert- like regions, where limited nesting options frequently force diverse owls to use rocky areas as nesting sites. However, the cliffs and other rocky areas preferred by Eurasian eagle-owls are also utilized by several species of diurnal raptor in Eurasia. In Spain, golden eagles, Bonelli's eagles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) most often nest on cliffs. Large scavenging birds such as cinereous vultures (Aegypius monachus), bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), Eurasian griffons (Gyps fulvus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and common ravens also often nests on the same Iberian cliffs. While the two eagles nested at great distances from one another (they are known to be territorial towards each other), the eagle-owl nesting within of the other species. In these cliff nests, the only considerable predatory interaction was the eagle-owls appearing to predate the peregrine falcons.Mart√≠nez, J. E., Mart√≠nez, J. A., Zuberogoitia, I., Zabala, J., Redpath, S. M., & Calvo, J. F. (2008). The effect of intra-and interspecific interactions on the large-scale distribution of cliff-nesting raptors. Ornis Fennica, 85(1), 13. In the Tibetan Plateau, upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius) also seem to favor similar habitats and both the eagle-owl and buzzard take similar prey there. In general, the eagle-owl can nest closer to diurnal raptors because, as a nocturnal animal, it will not actively compete for territories as it would with other members of its own species. The remains of a common buzzard that was preyed on by an Eurasian eagle-owl. While owls are apparently often killed by Eurasian eagle-owls while actively hunting, diurnal raptors are often ambushed at night at their large, conspicuous nests since they are easily located during hunting forays and the raptors are nearly defenseless in nocturnal conditions. The eagle-owl has been specified as the primary predator of common buzzards, peregrine falcons, common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and black kites.Sergio, F., Marchesi, L., & Pedrini, P. (2003). Spatial refugia and the coexistence of a diurnal raptor with its intraguild owl predator. Journal of Animal Ecology, 72(2), 232-245.Sergio, F., Scandolara, C., Marchesi, L., Pedrini, P., & Penteriani, V. (2005). Effect of agro‚Äêforestry and landscape changes on Common Buzzards (Buteo buteo) in the Alps: implications for conservation. Animal Conservation, 8(1), 17-25. The common buzzard and common kestrel are probably the most often selected diurnal raptors because they inhabit the edges most often hunted by the eagle-owls. Studies have shown that peregrine falcon experience lower productivity in areas where they nest closely to eagle-owls, as the eagle-owls pick off both nestlings and adults by night. However, peregrine populations were not hugely effected except in cases where small reintroductions were attempted of falcons or falcon populations were already rare due to other causes.Brambilla, M., Rubolini, D., & Guidali, F. (2006). Eagle Owl Bubo bubo proximity can lower productivity of cliff-nesting Peregrines Falco peregrinus. Ornis Fennica, 83(1), 20. The northern goshawk is itself a serious predator of other raptors. The eagle-owl is the goshawk's only major predator, although goshawks are not as intensely hunted as are buzzards due to their more deeply wooded preferred nesting habitat.Kenward, R. (2006) The Goshawk. Poyser Monographs, Poyser T & AD: London. Generally speaking, there appears to be rather strictly adhered size hierarchy among birds of prey and the very largest raptorial prey attacked by Eurasian eagle-owl tend to roughly equal to their own size. Larger raptors, such as eagles and vultures, seem to be largely invulnerable to eagle-owls. However, in Scandinavia, there are two cases of eagle-owls preying on ‚Äúfairly large‚Äù nestlings of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla). Given the size, average adult weight of , and formidable character of this eagle, it is possible that the young of other raptors larger than themselves may too be attacked. Eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), which are nearly as large as the white-tailed eagle at an average weight of , have been killed by eagle-owls in Kazakhstan.Watson, J. (2010). The golden eagle. Poyser Monographs; A&C; Black. Remarkably, considering the greater threat that the eagle normally poses to the eagle-owl than vice versa, it appeared a golden eagle was amongst the prey remains found around a nest in the French Pyrenees.Cantegrel-Gassiot, L., Pagoaga, A., R. & C., & Rieu, L.

Le Casseur d‚Äôos vol. 14 ‚Äì 2014, pp. 71-87. Cases in Spain where large, formidable birds of prey, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and Bonelli's eagle, that are roughly equal in size to the eagle-owls, both weighing just over , have been predated, these seem to be taken from the nest or shortly after independence and rare occurrences.Tella, J. L., & Ma√±osa, S. (1993). Eagle owl predation Egyptian Vulture and Northern Goshawk-Possible effect of a decrease in European Rabbit availability. Journal of Raptor Research, 27(2), 111-112. However, in Turkey, the eagle-owl is apparently a regular and serious predator of Bonelli's eagles.Vaassen, E. W. Status and occurrence of Bonelli‚Äôs Eagle, Hieraaetus fasciatus, in Turkey and Eastern Mediterranean‚ÄìA Population Estimate. Raptor Research & Rehabilitation Center Turkey. The Eurasian eagle-owl predates the largest members of the most species-rich diurnal raptor genera: the northern goshawks from the genus Accipiter, the upland buzzards from the genus Buteo and the gyrfalcons (F. rusticolus) of the genus Falco. Additional large raptors, i.e. those that can average or more in body mass, taken as prey include osprey (Pandion haliaetus), the red kites (Milvus milvus), short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), the greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), the lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina), and the rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus) and saker falcons (Falco cherrug), in both of which females average more than .Louren√ßo, R., Penteriani, V., del Mar Delgado, M., Marchi-Bartolozzi, M., & Raba√ßa, J.

The taking of rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls must be confined to full-grown victims, since they nest further north than Eurasian eagle-owls. Eurasian eagle-owls also hunt the smallest raptors available, including those such as lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and Japanese sparrowhawks (Accipiter gularis) that weigh less than . Some of these are cases of eagle-owls killing nestlings or fledglings but they can easily overtake adult buzzards, goshawks and falcons of any size. = Predation = In rare cases, other predators may kill a Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, there is one case of a white-tailed eagle killing an eagle-owl and there are at least four known incidents of eagle-owls being killed by golden eagles. Also, an eagle-owl was found among the prey remains at a golden eagle eyrie in Mongolia.Ellis, D. H., Tsengeg, P., Whitlock, P., & Ellis, M. H. (2000). Predators as prey at a Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos eyrie in Mongolia. Ibis, 142(1), 139-142. An eagle-owl was also found amongst the prey in the nest of steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) in Altai Krai, Russia.Vazhov, S. V., Bachtin, R. F., Barashkova, A. N., & Smelansky, I. E. (2013). On the Study of the Steppe Eagle in the Altai Kray, Russia. Raptors Conservation, (27). In 2016, a large female subadult Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) apparently preyed upon a three-year-old male Eurasian eagle-owl in Spain.L√≥pez-L√≥pez, P., Garc√≠a-Ripoll√©s, C., Gim√©nez, J., & Urios, V. (2016). A Case of Predation of a Eurasian Eagle-Owl by a Bonelli's Eagle. Journal of Raptor Research, 50(4), 422-424. Reportedly, in another case of interspecies predation, a mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis) killed an eagle-owl in the Himalayas.Osman S.M. (1975). The Mountain Hawk-Eagle. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 72 (2): 256-270. Pine martens (Martes martes) and stone martens (Martes foina) are opportunistic nest predators. Although martens could probably reach most eagle-owl nests due to their agility and climbing abilities, they probably will attack nests when disturbance or low food supply result in lower nest attendance by the parent owls. Cases where nests have atypically been accessible on foot (for both humans and wild predators) have resulted in Eurasian eagle-owl nests being predated. Eurasian badgers, wild boars and raccoon dogs and raccoons, the latter two both where non-native in Germany, have also reportedly preyed on nests that they can access. In coastal areas of Spain, red foxes were reported to have preyed on four eagle-owls, including one unsexed brooding adult, at nests found to be reachable on foot by researchers. Cases of red foxes killing Eurasian eagle-owls at nests have reported elsewhere albeit very rarely, normally the eagle-owl is a greater danger to the foxes (and many of its other nest predators) than vice versa.Jaume, S. (2000). Depredaciones de Zorro Vulpes vulpes sobre B√∫ho Real Bubo bubo en un √°rea del litoral Ib√©rico. Ardeola, 47(1), 97-99.G√∂rner, M. (2005).

All four occupants aboard the training flight were killed. The crash was determined to be caused by the aircraft flying through wake turbulence, and led to sweeping changes in procedures for maintaining minimum safe distance behind aircraft that generate substantial wake turbulence. Aircraft and crew Delta Air Lines Flight 9570 was a training flight operated using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-14 (registration (registration '). The aircraft was manufactured in 1965, and had operated for 18,998 hours at the time of the accident. The purpose of the flight was to flight check three Delta pilots. Flight 9570 had a total of four occupants, including the two-man flight crew actually flying the aircraft, an additional pilot awaiting his flight check, who would have been riding in the rear, and an FAA air carrier operations inspector, who was on board for proficiency checking, and was riding in the ‚Äújump seat‚Äù, a fold down seat between the pilot and co- pilot. Also involved in the accident was American Airlines Flight 1114, a training flight conducted using a McDonnell Douglas McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Flight 1114 was not damaged or affected by the accident. Accident On May 30, 1972, Flight 9570 departed Dallas Love Field in Dallas, Texas at 06:48 Central Daylight Time, and proceeded to GSW to perform training approaches and landings. Flight 9570 requested an ILS approach to GSW's Runway 13. The clearance was granted, and Flight 9570 was advised that the American Airlines DC-10 was already in the traffic pattern to perform \\"touch-and-go landings\\" at GSW. Flight 9570 landed without incident. After landing at GSW, Flight 9570 received new takeoff and climb-out clearances, made training maneuvers including an ILS missed approach. Flight 9570 then requested approval for landing on Runway 13, behind the American DC-10 which was also inbound for a landing on the same runway. The air traffic controller gave Flight 9570 clearance to land on Runway 13 with an advisory \\"caution, turbulence.\\" The controller did not advise the DC-9 that they were following a \\"heavy,\\" though the controller did advise that they were following a DC-10 which experienced pilots should have known was a \\"heavy\\" aircraft. On approach to the runway, the DC-9 began to oscillate about the roll axis, then rolled rapidly to the right. After rolling 90 degrees to the right, the right wingtip struck the runway. The airplane continued to roll to the right, until the fuselage struck the runway in a nearly inverted position. The aircraft was damaged by impact forces, and destroyed by a subsequent fire. All four occupants were killed. Investigation Wake turbulence seen after an aircraft passes through colored smoke, similar to tests performed by the NTSB. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident. The manner of the crash suggested to the NTSB that the accident was caused by wake turbulence from the DC-10 it had followed. Prior to the Flight 9570 accident, the Federal Aviation Administration had no specific wake turbulence based aircraft separation standards in place. Instead, separation was determined by air traffic control radar resolution limits and, in some cases, runway occupancy restrictions. However, the rapidly increasing use of large jets that cause substantial wake turbulence, such as the Boeing 747, DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar in recent years had increased the risk of wake turbulence related accidents. However, prior to Flight 9570, most accidents involving wake turbulence involved smaller aircraft than the DC-9. Recognizing wake turbulence as a potential cause, the NTSB performed test and research activities to confirm their hypothesis. The NTSB performed wake vortex testing at the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center at Atlantic City Airport in New Jersey, initially using a Lockheed L-1011 (a trijet similar in size to the DC-10) and then later using a DC-10 loaned to the NTSB. Colored smoke was emitted from the airport control tower, and observations of the smoke as a L-1011 or DC-10 aircraft flew by the tower provided information about the length of time a vortex would remain after the aircraft was clear. The NTSB's tests demonstrated that the wake turbulence caused by an aircraft the size of the DC-10 was sufficient to upset the flight of a following DC-9 to the magnitude experienced by Flight 9570. Following these tests, the probable cause of the accident was determined to be: Impact While the risk to small aircraft was already known, the crash of Flight 9570 demonstrated that medium-sized aircraft such as the DC-9 were also vulnerable to wake turbulence. As a result, the investigation into Flight 9570 prompted changes to the minimum distance that all small and medium sized aircraft must maintain when following \\"heavy\\" aircraft, and the procedures for maintaining those distances. The NTSB recommended that the FAA develop new minimum aircraft separation standards that take into account wake separation effects of larger aircraft on following aircraft. In response, the FAA developed mandatory minimum separation requirements based on maximum takeoff weight. All aircraft weighing more than 300,000 pounds would be classified as \\"heavy\\". Under the new rules, any plane lighter than a \\"heavy\\" must maintain at least five miles of separation behind a \\"heavy\\" aircraft; a \\"heavy\\" behind another \\"heavy\\" must maintain four miles of separation. These regulations became the standard for maintaining minimum safe distance between aircraft; the definition of \\"heavy\\" was revised downward to aircraft weighing at least 255,000 pounds in 1994.

It follows actress and filmmaker Marianna Palka as she pursues testing to learn whether she inherited the genetic mutation that causes Huntington's disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease. Directed by documentarian Lucy Walker, the film premiered in a 14-minute version at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Later recut into 28-minute version, it was broadcast on HBO on 1 June 2015. The Lion's Mouth Opens was shortlisted for Best Documentary Short at the 87th Academy Awards.  Development  Filmmaker and actress Marianna Palka knew she was at risk for fatal and untreatable neurodegenerative illness Huntington's disease as her father has the disease; his illness, which became symptomatic when she was eight years old, meant his children had a 50% risk of inheriting the disease. She reached out to director Lucy Walker, whom Palka knew from the Sundance Film Festival, with the idea of making the film about her decision to be tested (approximately 90% of at-risk patients do not choose to be tested). Walker, frequently solicited for documentary projects, expected to turn down the pitch, but was persuaded by Palka's compelling on-screen presence as well as the worthy cause--both bringing public attention to the disease and helping Palka bring meaning to her personal experience. In an interview, Walker said, \\"When [Palka] told me what it was about, I must confess I was very moved. What a worthy cause that is. And she‚Äôs so good on camera, she‚Äôd be really good at raising awareness. And also I just wanted to give her a sense of purpose in this moment. Having a camera around can give a real sense of comfort when times are really trying. Some people can be comforted by the fact that their suffering might be helping somebody else in the future.\\"  Premiere  The film was broadcast on June 1, 2015 on HBO.  Plot  The film begins at a dinner party. Filmmaker and actress Marianna Palka, 33 years old, is joined by friends in anticipation of the genetic testing results she will receive the next day, revealing whether or not she has inherited the fatal and untreatable neurodegenerative illness, Huntington's disease, from her father, who has the illness. Palka recounts how she has always felt she does not have the disease, and the film intercuts with home movie scenes from her childhood, as her father's disease develops, as well as with interviews with Palka, her mother, and Palka's close friend Jason Ritter. The film finishes with Palka making the trip to the hospital with her friends to get the results. She tests positive for the mutation that results in Huntington's.  Cast  * Marianna Palka * Jason Ritter * Bryce Dallas Howard * Seth Gabel * Christian Williams  Style  Reviewing the film for RogerEbert.com, Collin Souter notes, \\"Walker and editor Joe Peeler wisely forgo any scoring or any other overly manipulative tactics to conjure up any emotions in the viewer.\\" Walker has said she made a choice in the film's second, longer cut to show more of the disease's impact, encouraged by the community of patients and families who wanted to improve the public's understanding of the disease. > \\"My main note to myself after the short version was ‚Äòthis is great, but > people don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs such a difficult disease. We have to show it.‚Äô > [...] We tend to be quite shy and I think sometimes your first instinct is > to not show it and that is a good instinct in the sense that it feels > respectful, but actually when you get into that community, they really want > people to understand it and they really want people to recognize it. Because > a lot of challenges they face have to do with when people don‚Äôt recognize > the symptoms when they come across them. \\"There‚Äôs a horrible story about a > cop beating up a guy with symptoms and arrested him because they told him to > stop moving and they thought he was resisting arrest, but his movements got > more out of control the more agitated he got. And he couldn‚Äôt explain > himself and they thought he was just some resistant drug addict. So, the > community wants this stuff to be seen, so I had to swallow that kind of > shyness and try to find a way to accomplish that.\\" Walker ultimately reached out to other families with requests to film so they could expand the footage showing the disease's effects. Writing for PBS's POV Blog, Tom Roston notes the discomfiting narrative structure of the film, which resists preparing viewer's expectations for what kind of the ending they should anticipate, in contrast to the experience of \\"see[ing] Michael Moore films to rage against 'the man,' or [watching] a doc about a beloved musical legend with the hope of being moved and inspired.\\" Instead, Roston noticed himself feeling uncertain about what the film was building toward: \\"I couldn‚Äôt help but begin thinking, well, if she has [Huntington's], then it‚Äôs going to be one kind of movie (tragic, melancholy). If she doesn‚Äôt have it, it‚Äôs a very different movie (happy, sense of relief).\\" Roston notes that this puts the viewer in an experience of difficult uncertainty that parallels Palka's as she approaches the testing: \\"It‚Äôs not comfortable. But neither is she.\\" The film takes its title from a line in the Bob Dylan poem, \\"Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie\\". Guthrie, a long-time inspiration to Dylan, died of Huntington's at 55.  Reception  The Los Angeles Times wrote \\"an espresso shot to the heart\\". \\"The most emotionally devastating film at the Sundance Film Festival this year was a short\\" ‚Äì Filmmaker Magazine.

Ascent  It is a challenging climb and therefore receives only a modest number of visitors. The normal route starts in the middle of the Hermannskar cirque, where climbers leave the path linking the Kemptner Hut and the Hermann von Barth Hut and painstakingly and, in places, tracklessly make their way up a steep rubble slope to the Spiehlerscharte (2,395 m) notch. At the col the route switches to the north side of the mountain and approaches it up a prominent gully, through which the western ar√™te is reached after another gully (UIAA grade II). The route continues along and below the knife-edge, exposed in places and with several grade I climbing sections, to the summit. The route is marked occasionally with cairns. The journey time from the Hermann von Barth Hut is three hours. A more difficult route (up to grade II) runs up the southern ar√™te to the top.

Early life Berry, the daughter of Ben Selling and Mathilda Hess, grew up in Portland, Oregon. In 1899, she went on a world tour. She married Alfred Berry, a contractor who became the superintendent of the Portland International Airport. Career For more than thirty years, the couple and their three children lived in northeast Portland's Irvington neighborhood, where Berry developed an interest in plants. Reading about plant expeditions to Europe and Asia, she began to provide financial support for the expeditions and through them to obtain seeds. By the mid-1930s, Berry had run out of room for her plants in Irvington, and the couple moved to \\"a bowl- shaped site nestled near the top of a hill\\". The property, Berry Botanic Garden, just north of Lake Oswego, included a variety of habitats and terrain, and was partly covered with second-growth Douglas fir. In developing the garden, Berry focused on \\"exceptional plants\\", particularly rhododendrons, primulas, and alpines. In 1964, the Garden Club of America awarded her the Florens de Bevoise Medal for her knowledge of plants. In 1965, she won the American Rhododendron Society's first Award of Excellence given to a woman, and she was honored for her work by the American Rock Garden Society.

Early life and family Leakey was born in Kenya, where his father (Arundell) Gray Leakey was a farmer. Through his great-grandfather James Shirley Leakey, one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey, he is related to the missionary Rev Henry Leakey, and so to his son and grandson the paleoanthropologists Louis Leakey and Richard Leakey. His older brother Nigel Leakey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in 1945, for his actions in Ethiopia in 1941. Another relative Joshua Leakey was awarded the Victoria Cross in 2015, for his actions in Afghanistan in 2013. His younger brother Rea Leakey survived service in the Second World War, and became a major-general in the British Army. His sister Agnes Leakey (later Agnes Hofmeyr) worked for reconciliation in Kenya. He was educated in Kenya and then at Weymouth College. He then studied at the Chelsea College of Aeronautical Engineering, and worked for Vickers. Second World War While working as an aircraft designer in the Second World War, a reserved occupation, he discovered the long Mossdale Caverns north of Grassington in the Yorkshire Dales. He was called up for military service in 1942, the year after his brother Nigel was killed in action, and served as a paratrooper in India and Burma. He failed in two attempts to become the first person to climb the Bandarpunch in the Himalayas. Later life After the war, Leakey lived in Settle and then Giggleswick in North Yorkshire. He married his wife Barbara (n√©e Fidoe) in 1947. They had two sons and two daughters. He became an inventor, securing 20 patents, including one for a folding lobster pot. He also sold fishing equipment, including so-called \\"Leakey boats\\". He also served as a magistrate in Settle, and as a governor at Bentham Grammar School. He continued caving and potholing into the 1960s, and he explored Bar Pot and Disappointment Pot in the Gaping Gill cave system. He was noted for his ability to survive with little or no protective gear, occasionally diving naked into sumps deep underground, and has been described as \\"seemingly oblivious to the cold\\". Political career Leakey wrote many letters of complaint to different politicians and government departments, but denied that he was eccentric. He founded a political party, the Virtue Currency Cognitive Appraisal Party. He stood as a candidate in local council elections, and stood for Parliament in Skipton and Ripon in the 2005 and 2010 UK general elections.

The film follows the routines of those employed at Studio Ghibli, including filmmakers Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki as they work to release two films simultaneously, The Wind Rises and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.  Synopsis  The documentary delves into the life of Hayao Miyazaki and the productions of the animated films The Wind Rises and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, including various footage of said productions. The footage shown includes the choosing of Hideaki Anno as the voice actor for the character Jiro Horikoshi in The Wind Rises as well as the extensive and detailed amount of storyboarding sketched, inked, and painted by Miyazaki. It notes Miyazaki's opinions on subjects such as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and Zero planes, and shows his tensions with some of the other staff, including Isao Takahata, and his memories of his father. The film illustrates the importance of Miyazaki, Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki's works altogether to help Studio Ghibli be successful, and concludes with mention of Miyazaki's supposed official retirement.  Release and reception  On 1 November 2014, the documentary was screened at the Hawaii International Film Festival. In March 2015, it was added to the Netflix streaming service.

It was built of tarred brick in 1818 to a design known as a tower mill, a tapering circular building 8 storeys high with brickwork 30 inches (76 cm) thick at the base. Each floor has 4 windows to the four cardinal points of the compass although many are blocked up on the inside, especially on the north face. It is topped by a weatherboarded boat-shaped cap with a petticoat and fan cradle. The mill was used for grinding wheat for flour and by the 1860s also included a bakery. Production ceased in 1904, at which time the sails and fantail were removed. After several changes of ownership the mill in 1934 came into the ownership of the Forbes family, who carried out major cap renovation in 1989. Otherwise Hickling Mill is one of the few windmills in the country to have been preserved in a largely unrestored condition. It still contains almost a complete set of main machinery and many of the original timber fittings and three sets of millstones. Technical Details The tower has a height of 60 feet (18.2m) to the top of the brickwork and an overall height of 71 feet (21.6m) to the ridge of the cap. The cap is a Norfolk boat shaped type which had an 8 bladed fan and a gallery. The sails consisted of four double shuttered sails, each with 9 bays, controlled by a 9 feet (2.75m) diameter brake wheel. They powered 3 pairs of French burr stones, 2 flour mills, a cylinder and a jumper. 3 dressing machines and an oat crusher could also be driven.

Snezhnika's size varies in length from 70 to 100 metres (west to east) and in width from 40 to 90 metres (north to south). Its firn is 8‚Äì11 m thick at the base and its snow cover, which is mostly fed by avalanche snow, can be as deep as 20 metres in March and April.Gachev (2011), p. 51. Snezhnika's latitude of 41¬∞46‚Ä≤09‚Ä≥ N makes it the southernmost glacial mass in Europe ; the nearby Banski Suhodol Glacier below Koncheto, although larger, is slightly to the north. Snezhnika in July 2007 Snezhnika lies in an east-facing hollow adjacent to the almost vertical north wall of Vihren and is surrounded on three sides by a moraine or moraine- like rock debris. The north wall of Vihren supplies Snezhnika with avalanche snow. The strong shade of the high vertical wall and the high albedo of its white marble as well as the karstified bottom of the hollow provide suitable conditions for glaciation.Gachev (2011), pp. 50‚Äì51.

League Formation and Early History In the Spring of 1936, an agent working for Clarence Gamble met with social workers and activists from Berea, KY at the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers. Gamble had funded birth control projects through the United States in an effort to discover the effectiveness rate of inexpensive contraceptive methods among rural populations. Activists in Berea decided to form a league with funding from Gamble. Using Gamble‚Äôs work in Logan, West Virginia as a model, Gamble agreed to provide a vehicle, a salary for a nurse, and contraceptive supplies for the league to operate. The league was initially called the Kentucky Maternal Health League and they hired Lena Gilliam as their first nurse. Lena Gilliam was from Rockcastle County, Kentucky and league members felt that her familiarity with rural populations would aid in approaching patients and communicating contraceptive information. During the 1930s, a number of clinics has opened across the United States as national organizations such as the American Birth Control League and Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau as well as activists like Margaret Sanger promoted the expansion of birth control services. Since the service area around Berea was rural and isolated, the Kentucky Maternal Health League decided against using a typical clinic-based operation. Using the Gamble- financed vehicle, Gilliam would travel to clients in rural areas and visit them in their homes. Gilliam would visit the homes and conduct interviews and evaluations with potential clients. If they were interested in contraceptives, Gilliam would answer questions regarding the contraceptive jelly and nozzles she would distribute. Because Gamble wanted to test low-cost contraceptives and their effectiveness in rural populations, the diaphragm was deemed too expensive to distribute. In addition, diaphragms had to be fitted and required frequent follow up visits - a difficult task for rural women due to transportation difficulties. Kentucky Maternal Health clients paid for the supplies if able and additional supplies were sent to a central location where they could pick them up. During this time, the league distributed contraceptive supplies to Appalachian doctors for distribution among their patients and they began coordinating clinic locations in Harlan, KY and Sevierville, TN. In 1938, satisfied with the results of his study, Gamble began to withdraw his funding. Final results of his tests showed the contraceptive jelly method to be 85% effective. Also in 1938, Lena Gilliam married and left her work with the league. These events would lead to changes within the league which had changed its name to the Mountain Maternal Health League in 1937. 1940s-1950s By 1939, Louise Gilman Hutchins had joined the Mountain Maternal Health League and continued to influence it throughout its history. She would serve as medical director and board president for the league for 47 years. Other changes to the Mountain Maternal organization occurred during this period. After Lena Gilliam left her position as the league nurse, Sylvia Gilliam, her sister, took up the role. In 1940, S. Gilliam conducted more work for Mountain Maternal's branch clinic in Harlan, KY as well as working outside of the state. During 1940, she received a request from the Michigan Maternal Health League. Newly arrived migrant workers in Michigan were seen as a population in need of contraceptive methods and the Michigan league requested that Gilliam institute these measures. Gilliam traveled to Michigan in July and August 1941 to conduct this work. Soon after, Sylvia would leave the MMHL to work with Gamble in Watauga County, North Carolina. During this period, the work of the Mountain Maternal expanded into new areas of Kentucky as well. A new nurse hired in 1943 began to conduct a clinic amongst African American populations in Richmond, KY. In 1944, Hutchins was instrumental in the establishment of a hospital based clinic in Berea, Kentucky at what was then the Berea College Hospital. Volunteer physicians saw patients who traveled across county lines from rural communities to attend the clinic. In 1945, the Mountain Maternal would affiliate with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. It was also during this year that they associated with the Frontier Nursing Service by supporting three graduate nurse midwives in Knott and Knox County, Kentucky. New services were created and others expanded in 1947 when a new nurse, Gretchen James began work in Garrard, Estill, Jackson, Breathitt Counties. 1960s to 2006 Throughout the 1960s, the League expanded their services and fulfilled their goals of incorporating contraception into public health programs. In 1960, under the leadership of Hutchins, the League purchased foaming contraceptive tablets to distribute to rural women without access to plumbing. Soon after, Hutchins convinced the Madison County Board of Health to allow county nurses to distribute those tablets to patients. In 1961, ten more counties were persuaded to provide tablets through their county Health Department nurses. 1962 was a successful year for the League. The State Health Commissioner wrote letters authorizing state Health Departments to include family planning in their work. Throughout the 1960s, the League continued to expand services. They conducted a birth control pill trial with Mead Johnson in 1963 and were able to distribute supplies to 403 women. The League continued to expand their services by beginning to offer intrauterine devices to women in the 1970s. By this time, the number of patients being served by Mountain Maternal was in the thousands. In 2006, the organization closed due to lack of funding.

Her artistic practice uses a number of traditional mediums that include installation, sculpture and printmaking, but it also expands to encapsulate a diverse array of craft techniques. Central to her practice is a sustained exploration of materials and space. \\"While there is always a concept behind the work its actual form comes out of the 'play' with materials and my response to them\\" Early life and education Claire Barclay received a Master of Fine Arts from the Glasgow School of Art, where she focused on environmental art. She graduated in 1993 with an MA. Career Barclay's first solo exhibition was at Transmission Gallery, Glasgow in 1994. In 2003, Barclay represented Scotland in the Venice Biennale. Her work was the focus of a solo exhibition at the Tate Britain in 2004. In 2009 she had a solo exhibition at the Fruitmarket Gallery, which documented significant works created by Barclay over the previous 12 years, alongside newly-commissioned installations. In 2017 she showed new large scale sculptural work at Tramway Gallery in Glasgow, and the work made here amongst others were reworked and adapted at Mission Gallery, Swansea, in 2018 = Themes = Situated within realms of the domestic, Barclay's work juxtaposes the reified space of the gallery with that of the everyday. The objects present within her installations allude to dichotomies between function and dysfunction; subsequently, this imbues them with qualities of both the familiar and strange, simultaneously imparting them with an elusory nature. = Style = Barclay creates large-scale installations, often made in situ and in response to the spaces in which they are shown. Her practice is also deeply rooted in process and craftsmanship; accordingly, her installations include an array of materials that oscillate between those associated with mechanization and those associated with the domestic: steel, cast-concrete, machined aluminium, rubber, brass mesh, ceramic, leather, canvas and printed fabric. These dualities further position her artistic process between the handcrafted and industrially produced, as well as the natural and man-made.

An anime television series adaptation was announced and aired from July 3 to September 18, 2015. Characters =Toy Gun Gun= ; : Hotaru is the Student Council President of her high school and is known for her brute strength, good reflexes, and a strong sense of justice. She claims to not let \\"evil doers\\" get away with their evil deeds, and is often noted to enjoy picking fights for the sake of what's right. Early examples include her beating up a student who was extorting money from a helpless classmate, and desiring revenge after learning that her best friend, Kanae, was conned by a Host (later going after said host on her quest for justice). She is often mistaken as male due to her appearance. She is next door neighbors with Masamune. Hotaru uses illeism, referring to herself as \\"Tachibana\\". ; : Masamune works as a Host, and is responsible for introducing Hotaru to the world of \\"Survival Games\\". He, together with his childhood friend, Tooru, form an alliance called the \\"Toy ‚òÜ Gun Gun Team\\". He is unaware of the fact that Hotaru is actually female. To repay the damages caused by Hotaru to the club at which he works at, he offers her the chance to become a member of his team. Because of his past, he has abandonment issues, which later cause him to kick Hotaru out of the team, fearing she will leave him like his former friends/teammates and mother did. However, after Hotaru helps him face his past through a one-on-one challenge, he lets her rejoin. After Hotaru rejoins the team he develops feelings for her, but struggles with them as he does not know that Hotaru is female. There was a moment in his past where, after being abandoned by his mother, he grew suicidal. Nagamasa introduced him to survival games to convince him to live on. ; : Tooru is a manga artist who specializes in erotic comics. He is Masamune's childhood friend, both of them having shared the same dream of pursuing soccer as a career when they were young. He lives in the same apartment block as his teammates. Due to his past, when he was betrayed by friends he trusted, he has low self-confidence and often worries that Masamune might abandon him. He is also the most sensitive to others, being the first one to notice changes in the member's moods. ; Haruki was the third member of Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru, who blamed Masamune for making him hate survival games. In truth, Haruki was overwhelmed by his younger twin brother Haruka during TGC and left the team because he felt that he wasn't strong enough. He intended to return to the team after he had trained significantly, but was surprised to hear that Hotaru had filled his spot. Although first antagonistic towards Hotaru, he eventually warms up to her and was brought back into the team as their fourth member. Haruki is also the first one of the team to find out that Hotaru is female. He wears a gas mask during his games. =Hoshishiro= ; : Nagamasa is the leader of the survival game team Hoshishiro, which is the name of the hospital he works as a doctor at along with his teammates Fujimon and Ichi. He initially appears to be a very kind man, but he is the object of Tooru and Masamune's resentment due to what took place in the past. It is revealed that he beat up two former Toy Gun Gun players, but it was all within the rules of TGC. He and Masamune used to be close partners, but after being told by another survival game player that Masamune was also a strong vanguard, Nagamasa was convinced to end their partnership. Although brutal during survival games, Nagamasa is known to show kindness outside of it. He knows that Hotaru is a girl but kept a secret though it ended being a blackmail for Hotaru. ; : Nicknamed Fujimon, he is a member of Hoshishiro and works at hospital alongside the rest of his teammates. He fights using a minigun and can move fast despite the weight of his weapon. Due to his earnest and easy- going personality, he gets along well with Hotaru and often expresses concern for the Toy Gun Gun members. ; : Ichi is Hoshishiro's sniper. She appears to work as a nurse in the same hospital with Nagamasa and Takatora. She is the newest member of the team, brought in after Haruka's departure. As such she is unaware of the team's history, nor of Nagamasa's past with Masamune. ; Haruka is Haruki's younger twin brother, who was the original third member of Hoshishiro until Haruki stopped playing survival games. Haruka has an obsession with his brother, and feels guilty for being the reason why Haruki quit survival games. He eventually returns to Hoshishiro, but unlike the other members of the team he expresses distrust for Nagamasa, finding it difficult to tell what he's planning. He hates when other people call his brother 'Haruharu'. =Others= ; : Hanako is a close friend of Masamune. During a practice match, Hotaru temporarily becomes a member of her team and she instructs her to observe how the game is played. ; : Kanae is Hotaru's friend, and is the only one who knows of Hotaru being a girl (besides Haruki and Nagamasa, who find out later). Media =Manga= Aoharu √ó Kikanj≈´ is written and illustrated by NAOE. It started serialization in Square Enix's sh≈çnen manga magazine Monthly GFantasy as a one-shot, on June 18, 2012, and later as a full-fledged series, on January 18, 2013. The manga ended on August 18, 2019. As of September 27, 2019, eighteen tank≈çbon volumes have been released in Japan. =Anime= An anime television series adaptation produced by Brain's Base and directed by Hideaki Nakano premiered on July 2, 2015 at TBS. It also aired at CBC at the same date and at MBS, TUT, and BS-TBS at later dates. The anime is licensed by AnimeLab in Australia and New Zealand and streamed it on their website as it airs in Japan. The anime has also been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks. Reception Anime News Network had three editors review the first episode of the anime: Theron Martin found interest in the relationship dynamic between Hotaru and Masamune, a potential exploration of gender identity, and gave credit to the show's technical aesthetics despite lacking in palpable comedic moments; Nick Creamer was drawn in by the characterization of Hotaru but found criticism in the direction of both the plot and animation as feeling mediocre and typical of its given genre. The third reviewer, Rebecca Silverman, found the episode to be one of weakest debuts of its given season, criticizing the character of Hotaru and the storytelling she's placed in, and the middling production that's accessory to the delivery. Silverman said that, \\"If you're really into survival game shows and find mistaken gender hilarious, there might be more here for you than I found, but I'm also sure that there are better versions of both stories to be found elsewhere.\\" Fellow ANN editor Gabriella Ekens reviewed the complete anime series in 2016. She commended the \\"fairly realistic depiction\\" of airsoft towards a female demographic and the initial character setup of Hotaru and Midori but found the series overall unspectacular with its half-hearted delivery of both sh≈çnen-ai and sh≈çjo elements simultaneously, unfinished plot and an \\"irritating and hyperactive\\" English dub with only Greg Ayres' portrayal of Midori as the highlight, concluding that \\"Although it contains some sparks of promise with a few characters who aren't entirely stereotypes, Aoharu x Machinegun is ultimately my least favorite type of show ‚Äì boring, incomplete, and made for practically nobody. Skip.\\" Notes References External links * * Anime official website * Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Manga adapted into television series Category:Sentai Filmworks Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Square Enix manga Category:Yen Press titles Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming ","title":"Aoharu √ó Machinegun"},{"id":"45598005","text":"Lucien Mathys (9 April 1924 - 19 December 2010) was a Belgian racing cyclist.

In 1533 it was transferred to the newly created Eyalet of the Archipelago. In 1841, it was transferred to the H√ºdavendig√¢r Eyalet, where it remained until 1867, when it became the capital (pasha-sanjak) of the Vilayet of the Archipelago (formed from the former eyalet of the same name).

After the latter's dissolution, Biga became an independent sanjak, roughly equivalent to the modern √áanakkale Province, except for the Gallipoli peninsula, which was a separate sanjak.

He was a quarterback and guard who led the Texas Longhorns to their first bowl game; and ‚Äì north of Austin, in Georgetown, during his military service ‚Äì he led the Southwestern University Pirates to the 1944 Sun Bowl where he was the game's MVP. Collins played one year of professional football for the NFL's Boston Yanks in 1947 and was head football coach at Southwestern in 1948‚Äì49. He is one of only 14 NFL players to serve in both World War II and the Korean War. Early life William Harold Collins was a star in football, baseball and basketball at Breckenridge High School, which he attended from 1936 to 1940. He led the football team to a district championship in his senior year and was 2nd Team All-State the same year. When the season was over, he played in the annual Texas High School Football Coaches Association All-Star game. College football He first attended the University of Texas in 1940 where, in his freshman year, he was captain of the \\"Shorthorn\\" football team ‚Äì the freshman team. They went undefeated and won the unofficial conference championship. In 1941 he played guard on the varsity and earned a letter despite missing the end of the season with a knee injury. That season marked the first time that a Texas team would ever be ranked No. 1 in the polls, if only for a week before tying Baylor and losing to TCU in back to back weeks. The Longhorns finished 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 and ranked No. 4 in the country. It was the first time Texas ever finished the season ranked. In 1942 Collins was moved to quarterback, which in the single-wing formation was also known as the \\"blocking back\\". The quarterback did not pass or handle the ball as much as they do in modern offenses, but did call the plays. On defense, he played linebacker. After starting slowly to allow his knee to heal, Collins took over the starting job from Joe Magliolo because he was seen as the better pass defender and the Longhorns started to play against more pass-oriented offenses in the Southwest Conference. He helped lead Texas to the conference title, a No. 11 ranking and their first bowl game, the 1943 Cotton Bowl. He was recognized as an All- Southwest Conference 2nd Team player as a back. Following the 1942 season, he joined the Marine Corps and, along with eight other Longhorns, was sent to Southwestern University as part of the V-12 program. There he was captain of the most successful Pirates football team in school history, a team that beat Texas in Austin, was ranked as high as No. 11, and won the 1943 Sun Bowl, in which Collins was named MVP. Though the Texas Conference was officially disbanded during the war, the school considers themselves Texas Conference Champions that year. He left college and football to go into service during World War II. He was a first lieutenant with the Sixth Marines at Okinawa and China. In 1946 he returned to the University of Texas, but with Texas' transition to the t-formation a blocking back was no longer needed, so he was moved back to offensive guard. Despite his years away from Austin, he was named co-captain of the football team as the Longhorns went 8‚Äì2. He was again recognized as an All-Southwest Conference 2nd Team player this time as a guard. Following the season, he played in the 1947 East-West all star game in San Francisco and the College All-Star game in Chicago. Professional football In 1947, after getting a degree, he was selected in the third round of the 1947 AAFC Draft by the New York Yankees, but never played for them. Instead he spent the 1947 season in the NFL with the Boston Yanks for whom he played guard. Coaching and later life With his professional football career over, Collins was hired as head football coach at Southwestern University in the spring of 1948. He coached the Pirates for two years, for a combined 8‚Äì10‚Äì2 record, before leaving for the military again in 1951. He served in the Korean War, where he earned the Bronze Star Medal. He was one of only 14 NFL players to serve in both World War II and the Korean War. After returning from the war, Collins was hired as the head coach at Vernon High School from 1952 to 1954, where his teams posted a combined record of 14‚Äì13‚Äì3. He earned a master's degree in education from Texas in 1954 and then entered the insurance industry in Austin in 1956 where he worked until his retirement. Collins died on March 26, 1996, in Temple, Texas, and was buried at Austin Memorial Park Cemetery. He was inducted into the Southwestern University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1997.

She is known for her participation in the Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) and other Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects. Biography Born in 1907 in Plumstead, England while her parents were on vacation, Ginno was raised as a third generation resident of Berkeley, California. She attended Mills College in Oakland, California where she majored in art and drama. While at Mills, Ginno met two of her greatest influences, photographer Imogen Cunningham and her husband Roi Partridge, a famous printmaker. Ginno also met future husband Carol Aronovici while at Mills College. The two became engaged in 1928 and later married. Together they co-founded Stagecraft Studios, a theatrical supply business, before divorcing in 1934. While at Stagecraft studios, Ginno honed her skills in costume design, set design, and makeup. After her divorce, Ginno met Austrian artist and etcher John Winkler, who trained her in drawing and etching. Ginno's friendships as well as her continued artistic education led to greater artistic exposure, including exhibits at galleries and venues in Williamstown, Massachusetts, San Francisco, California, and New York City, New York. In 1949 John Winkler and Ginno married. Ginno joined the California Society of Etchers (CSE) and later served as the president for 15 years. Her work was later shown at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Chicago Art Institute, and the Boston Printmakers Gallery. Called one of the \\"most culturally significant, pre-World War II events to affect the public perception of west coast art\\", the 1940 Golden Gate International Exposition (GGIE) World's Fair was held on Treasure Island outside of San Francisco. While there, she joined sixty other artists in an Art in Action exhibit, showcasing the active creation of their art, including Diego Rivera, who created his mural, Pan-American Unity while in attendance. Ginno's costume design experience joined with her experience at the World's Fair cumulated in the creation of seventy-five sketches of \\"depicting men, women, and children of various cultures in traditional dress\\". Her etchings include depictions of Russia, Portugal, Finland, Alsatia, Croatia, Scotland, Romania, Finland and France, with relatively few from Africa, and none of Asian groups. Ginnos work \\"appears to have focused on countries impacted by the war in Europe\\". Elizabeth died in 1991 in El Cerrito, California after having worked for more than thirty five years at the Engineering Department at the University of California, Berkeley as a draftsman and illustrator.

As a professional photo retoucher for fashion magazines, Grove became familiar with airbrushing and photo manipulation techniques in that industry. Her work uses those skills to remove subjects from iconic works, or to alter their appearance. Grove wrote that this practice is intended to \\"portray women as they have been regarded throughout history, invisible and inaudible.\\"[2] Her photo series, The Other Series, includes reproductions of canonical paintings in Western art with the feminine subjects removed. Early life and education Kathy Grove was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to two graduates of the Carnegie Tech Architecture School. Her mother graduated first in her class, Phi Beta Kappa, as only the second female ever to attend the Carnegie Architecture School. Kathy learned mechanical and architectural drawing working in the Pittsburgh office of her father. From 1966 to 1970, Grove studied painting, printmaking and photography at the Rhode Island School of Design and its Honors program in Rome, Italy. Upon graduation, she spent a year at Stanley William Hayter‚Äôs Atelier 17 in Paris studying color viscosity printing, intaglio techniques, and bookbinding. She then worked at Boston‚Äôs Experimental Etching Studio for a year before attending graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While in Boston, she supported herself doing mechanical drafting at M.I.T. At Wisconsin, from 1974 ‚Äì 1976, she experimented further with printmaking and photography, as well as paper-making and commercial photo-mechanics. She also did coursework in the Women‚Äôs Studies Department. She began \\"drawing\\" with a sewing machine and paper punches, producing eccentrically undulating, abstract paper and plastic wall reliefs, with components grommetted together; and 3-D \\"rayograms\\" on large sheets of Estar plastic photo paper. She then re-photographed these, printed multiples of the images photo-lithographically, and used them to create subsequent generations of new paper and plastic wall reliefs that were large 3 dimensional abstract photomontage works.  Style and career  Upon moving to New York in 1978, Grove initially supported herself by teaching, and doing cartographic drafting and photo-darkroom work. She continued to create topographic wall reliefs of paper, photo montage materials, Masonite, and aluminum painted with acrylic and encaustic, slowly introducing silhouettes of recognizable images. She became involved with the Heresies Women‚Äôs Collective, exhibited in group shows, and in 1984, had her first solo show at P.P.OW. Gallery, at its original location in the East Village. Her knowledge of darkroom techniques, photography, graphics, and airbrush enabled her to work as a photo retoucher of fashion and products for advertising firms. Seeing that every photo of every model or product was retouched to \\"perfection\\" led Grove to turn her retouching talents to do fashion \\"makeovers\\" of such female icons as Dorothea Lange‚Äôs Migrant Mother for shows like Inherent Vice at the Woodstock Center for Photography. Grove reworked an original image, photographer Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California. The subject, Florence Owens Thompson, had her wrinkles and moles removed, and has makeup and nail polish added. Jo-Anna Isaak writes that the result is a transformation into a woman \\"of Calvin Klein ads.\\" Migrant Mother (LOC fsa.8b29516), Lange's original, prior to Grove's modification Grove wrote that this practice is intended to \\"portray women as they have been regarded throughout history, invisible and inaudible.\\" Grove curated her own show, Selling Us Ourselves, about the conceits of advertising, for the store front vitrines of the non-profit venue 10-on-8. Working at Oya DeMerli‚Äôs SiteOne Digital Studio, Grove collaborated in 1994 with the COLORS magazine graphic designer Tibor Kalman to create \\"Reagan With Aids,\\" a protest poster, and \\"What If‚Ä¶\\", racial-facial makeovers in which celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Jackson, the Pope, Spike Lee and others had their races changed. The Other Series Sympathetic with the research of the Guerilla Girls about how few women were in museum collections and reproduced in art survey books, Grove embarked upon a lifelong project, The Other Series, wherein, using her retouching skills, she removed images of women from iconic paintings and photographs by male artists from Cimabue to Andy Warhol. The first group of these works were altered using professional techniques involving bleach, dyes, and other airbrushing tools. Her color photo prints were shown as a solo exhibition at Pace-MacGill Gallery in 1989. In The Other Series: After Matisse, Grove removes nude model Henriette Darricarr√®re from a 1926 Henri Matisse painting, leaving nothing but an empty chair. The Other Series: After Janson: Masaccio, an excerpt of the text of H.W. Janson‚Äôs History of Art pages about Masaccio, with retouched reproductions of the paintings tipped in by Grove, was reproduced in an April 1990 issue of Artforum as a special artist‚Äôs project. Expanded versions of The Other Series, done digitally, were the subject of a 1992 show at P.P.O.W., and at the California State University Gallery at Long Beach later the same year. A near- complete presentation of the series was held at the Musee d Elysee, Lausaune, Switzerland, but then traveled to FotoForum, Frankfort in 2002. These works were presented in the form of archival color digital prints that were a cross between original drawings, fine color chromolithographs, and deluxe art history \\"tipped-in\\" book plates. Grove continues to add works to The Other Series and they continue to impact different audiences. In May 2015, The Civilians, the first theater group in residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, used Grove‚Äôs image treatment and verbatim discussion of John Singer Sargent‚Äôs Madame X painting as the basis for one act of The Way They Live, their drama based art works in the museum‚Äôs American Wing. Later work Tired from the pioneering years of her work neither being readily accepted as a new development in orthodox \\"photography\\" nor a variant form of \\"appropriation art,\\" Grove has increasingly heeded Duchamp‚Äôs admonition that the avant-garde artist‚Äôs only true recourse was to \\"go underground.\\" It has been intimated that she has been pursuing certain significant projects that, again like Duchamp, may only come to light with her passing. In recent years she has agreed to show only when her work had been carefully researched and sought out, as in the case of Mia Fineman‚Äôs Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before PhotoShop 2012 exhibition and book produced for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Gallery of Art. Likewise, she has been very selective in accepting public teaching or lecture invitations. Her work has been discussed in select journals, such as Lawrence Weschler‚Äôs Omnivore, or in art history or theory courses taught by photo or feminist scholars such as Anna Chave, of the CUNY Graduate Center and Joanna Isaak of Fordham University. In addition to the ongoing Other Series, in recent years Grove has undertaken other known groups of work addressing the themes of imperfection, evanescence/transience, absence, loss, and mortality. In her OutTakes series, Grove made cryptic abstract photo compositions entirely from the detail images of wrinkles, pimples, and other skin imperfections she removed from her digital fashion and beauty retouching projects. The collection of these details has been called the \\"calligraphy of human imperfections.\\" In the Flotsam and Jetsam series of manipulated photo images, Grove offers up tangible visual manifestations of the ephemeral nature of mental images. She overlays black and white views of archetypical family activities from the turn of the 20th c., a now by-gone age, with small, nearly incoherent bit-streamed fragments, shards, and pixelizations of contemporary life. Presented as large velvety dark digital prints or ephemeral wall-sized projections, they contrast the fixity of the past with the near dictatorship of movement in the present. As if viewed through the lenses of memory, some details resonate in crystal-clear sharp focus, while others remain forever out of reach, shrouded in a resolute, but enigmatic fog, riveting viewer attention while denying perceptual closure. As photography has become highly monetized in recent years, Grove has been increasingly sought after to produce entire shows of work for other contemporary artists - doing all of the actual digital retouching, manipulation, and compositing work. Grove was among the first to receive an Anonymous Was a Woman Foundation Fellowship and has also received awards from the Leon Levy Foundation, Art Matters, the New York State Council on the Arts and others. She has had residency fellowships at Yaddo, the Seaside Institute, MacDowell Colony, Dora Maar House and the Bogliasco Foundation. In introducing Grove at her 1997 guest lecture at the International Center for Photography, Phil Block, the Director of Programs, stated that \\"few people can radically alter the history of photography or the history of art but, in her work, Kathy Grove is the rare person who has done both.\\"Phil Block quotation is from his introductory remarks for Kathy Grove‚Äôs October 1997 Guest Lecture at the International Center for Photography, New York City. Among other projects related to Grove‚Äôs work, scholars Anna Chave, of the CUNY Graduate Center and Joanna Isaak of Fordham University did a videotaped dialogue, Kathy Grove: An Interview About The Other Series.

Osborn was born in Brooklyn in 1911. She received a B.A. in art history from Wellesley College in 1933. In 1933 Osborn joined MoMA's newly founded Department of Circulating Exhibitions as a volunteer. She became the program secretary in 1935 and was named Director in 1939, a position she held to 1947. Osborn almost single-handedly developed the program‚Äôs domestic agenda and was involved in all its aspects, from overall direction to budget to curatorial negotiations to copy editing. Between 1932 and the apex of the program in 1954, MoMA circulated 461 exhibitions among 3,700 venues including K-12 schools, technical colleges, clubs, military installations, and department stores. In Osborn's era, exhibitions circulated internationally but the majority were designed for U.S. use. A notable example of Osborn's efforts is Elements of Design, a 24-panel poster set packaged to travel by mail for installation virtually anywhere, with graphics by designer and artist Robert Wolff. In the late 1940s and 1950s, Osborn was involved with the American Federation of Arts as an Exhibition Committee advisor and International Exhibitions Committee vice chairman. In 1953, Osborn authored the UNESCO Manual of Traveling Exhibitions, which received several scholarly reviews. Osborn was also interested in film. She established the Salisbury Film Society (1951), served as an officer of the Robert Flaherty International Film Seminar (1968‚Äì1979), and as a MacDowell Colony board member (beginning in 1969) helped to make filmmakers eligible for fellowships.

There has been a church on the site since the 11th century, but the current building dates from 1836. It is situated on the Kirkgate near Southgate in the centre of the town. It is a Grade II* listed building.Nostalgia: With gallery - A glimpse inside Huddersfield Parish Church St Peter‚Äôs history from Huddersfield Daily Examiner, 19 September 2012, retrieved 6 March 2015 History In legend, the first church on the site was built in the eleventh century by Walter de Lacy, the second son of Ilbert de Lacy. Walter decided to build the church after he survived being thrown from his horse and landing in a swamp. The church was rebuilt in the sixteenth century. From 1759 to 1771, Henry Venn was vicar at the church. By the early 19th century the town of Huddersfield was growing rapidly as a result of the industrial revolution and the parish church was too small to cope. In order to address this, Holy Trinity Church was opened in 1819 as a chapel of ease within the parish of St Peter's, before becoming a parish church in its own right in 1857. By the 1830s the 16th-century parish church needed urgent repairs, and it was therefore decided to rebuild it again, so the congregation constructed the current church. The architect for the church was James Pigott Pritchett and construction was carried out from 1834 to 1836. To keep costs down during construction the bricks used were from the previous church on the site, this meant that repairs were needed overcome the deficient materials. In 1851, two vestries were added at the eastern and northern ends of the church. In 1852, windows designed by Thomas Willement were installed in the church. In 1866, it was realised that the stonework of the church needed repairing. In 1873, new pews and a pulpit were installed. In 1879, a choir vestry was added. In 1908 an organ was installed by local builder Conacher and Co. It was restored in 1984 by Philip Wood of Huddersfield. From 1921 to 1923, the sanctuary was reordered. A baldachin and the east window, designed by Ninian Comper, as part of a war memorial was also installed in the church. In the 1940s, the south transept was redesigned with a screen by Robert Thompson being added. In the 1980s, a new altar and dais were also installed. Around 2012, the roof, ceiling and tower were repaired. Other essential repairs were also made, helped by a grant from English Heritage.Big grant for Huddersfield Parish Church from Huddersfield Daily Examiner, 20 March 2012, retrieved 7 March 2015Church of St Peter, Kirkgate, Huddersfield - Kirklees from English Heritage, retrieved 7 March 2015 On 17 February 2017, the church was the location of the funeral of Gorden Kaye, the Huddersfield-born television actor and star of 'Allo 'Allo!.

She was born in Glasgow on 12 March 1945. She died in Amsterdam in 2004. Early years Elsa Alexandra Stansfield was born on 12 March 1945 in Glasgow of Canadian-Scottish and Swiss parentage. After what could be called a difficult start to life, a harmony was found in the home of a Glasgow family, the Stansfields. At 16 she was awarded a place as a full- time student in the Glasgow School of Art (1962-1965). After 3 years of study in drawing and painting she decided to specialise in photography and film. With the help of a grant she moved to London, where she continued her studies at the Ealing School of Photography (1965-1967). In this college she made her first film, an interpretation on the Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper, a 15 min. colour and monochrome experimental film of the fable in today's city. Advised by Peter Montagnon (then Head of BBC Open University) and with the support of Professor Thorold Dickinson, Stansfield studied film at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, from 1967 to 1969. In the last year of college she worked as assistant in film production and editing. Also during the same year Elsa was curating film programmes and running the Arts Lab. cinema in Drury Lane London, the first experimental laboratory for film and theatre in England. At the age of 24, Stansfield worked as producer for an American backed film ‚ÄòJourney to the East‚Äô, spending 3 months in India setting the production and later co-ordinating it back to London. On returning to London (1970) she established the ‚ÄòEight, Nine and Ten‚Äô Studio with the film director and editor Patricia Holland, and Electrophon Music with Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson. The Studio meant to be a place for film editing with post-production facilities. This project involved the gradual conversion of a Covent Garden warehouse at 8, 9 and 10 Neal's Yard. In this studio some of Stansfield's works were produced. These include: * ‚ÄòThe Yak‚Äô, a series of animated children's films for television: Camera and sound for nos. 1 to 6 * ‚ÄòSpace‚Äô, a 20 min. colour documentary on the problems of studio spaces for artists: production, sound and editing * ‚ÄòRed, Red, Red‚Äô, a 20 min. film on commune life in Devon, B.F.I. Production: production and sound * ‚ÄòBridget Riley‚Äô, a 35 mm colour film on the artist's retrospective at the Hayward Gallery: production and direction * ‚ÄòBehind the veil\\" by Eve Arnold, a 50 min. colour documentary on women in the Middle East, B.B.C. production: sound * ‚ÄòCircle of Light‚Äô by Antony Roland, a 30 min. colour documentary on the work of Pamela Bone: soundtrack in collaboration with Delia Derbyshire.  Collaboration with Madelon Hooykaas  In 1972 Stansfield also started an intensive collaboration in the field of film with the Dutch photographer and filmmaker Madelon Hooykaas in London and Amsterdam. Their first movie, ‚ÄòEen van die dagen‚Äô (One of Those Days) was broadcast by Dutch public TV in 1973. It was also shown at festivals in London, Toronto and New York. After that followed ‚ÄòOverbruggen‚Äô (About Bridges) (1975), which was shown in several festivals including Cork, Rotterdam, and Grenoble. Under the name Stansfield/Hooykaas they made their first video installations from 1975 onwards including ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs It to You?‚Äô (1975), Journeys (1976), Just Like That (1977) and ‚ÄòSplit Seconds‚Äô (1979). Stansfield and Hooykaas are regarded as European video pioneers. In 1975 Stansfield moved her studio from Covent Garden to Wapping in East London. In 1978 she was awarded the first video Bursary of the Arts Council of Britain at Maidstone College of Art, Kent, which was established by David Hall, ‚Äòthe Godfather of British video art‚Äô. Moving to the Netherlands in 1980 In 1980 Stansfield was asked to create a Time Based Media Department at the Jan van Eyck Academy, Maastricht. This was the first media department in a postgraduate academy in the Netherlands. She also started to build a video collection for the Academy. For this reason she moved from London to Maastricht, in the South of the Netherlands. International participants included David Garcia, Annie Wright, Paul Landon en Roos Theeuws. She organized several seminal symposiums including ‚ÄòVideo Maart‚Äô (1981), and the symposium for the exhibition ‚ÄòThe Luminous Image‚Äô (1984), which included videotapes and installations by Marina Abramovic and Ulay, Vito Acconci, Max Almy, Dara Birnbaum, Michel Cardena, Brian Eno, Kees de Groot, Nan Hoover, Michael Klier, Shigeko Kubota, Thierry Kuntzel, Marie-Jo Lafontaine, Mary Lucier, Marcel Odenbach, Tony Oursler, Nam June Paik, Al Robbins, Lydia Shouten, Elsa Stanfield and Madelon Hooykaas, Francesc Torres, Bill Viola, and Robert Wilson, in collaboration with the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. In 1986 Stansfield moved to Amsterdam while she worked as a Professor at the Jan van Eyck Academy until 1991. Stansfield and Hooykaas‚Äô work deals with the relation between nature and spirituality and explores scientific principles and natural forces such as radio waves and magnetic fields. They make use of contemporary technology such as film, audio and video in combination with organic materials such as sand, glass and copper. In their work they show that everything that exists is animated by movement and change. For thirty-two years Stansfield and Hooykaas worked together and produced over hundred and fifty works, until Elsa Stansfield died unexpectedly in 2004. British video art pioneer David Hall commented on Stansfield's death: \\"Elsa was the first artist to be awarded an Arts Council bursary to work with video in my department at Maidstone College of Art in the mid-seventies. Later, from 1980, as head of time-based media at the Jan van Eyck Academy, Maastricht, Holland, she enthusiastically organised international seminars and exhibitions. Her work in association with Madelon Hooykaas will be remembered as of profound importance in the developing European video art scene\\".

Niati specializes in mixed media installations that criticize Western representations and objectification of north African and Middle Eastern women. Her installations notably have live performances most commonly traditional Algerian music such as Ra√Ø, as a key visual representation of Niati's homeland and culture. Salah M. Hassan further details her performances, \\"She uses synthesizers, sound recordings, and special light effects to create a theatrical atmosphere and a vibrant magical environment of sound, body movement, and color.\\" The installations and exhibitions join together paintings, sculptures, drawings, photos, soundtracks, and performances.  Early life and career  Niati grew up in French-occupied Algeria, where over one million Algerians were killed for resisting occupation. When Niati was twelve years old, she demonstrated against French colonialism with her anti-colonial graffiti, which landed her in jail. Niati's experiences with the French occupation and eventual revolution of her people greatly influenced her art later in life. Niati moved to London in the late 1970s, where she observed Western art that depicted Algerian people, especially women, in a fictionalized and exotic way. This influenced her own depictions of post-colonial cultures, nations, and people. She attended Camden Arts Centre and Croydon College of Art, and later went on to get an MA in Fine Arts at Middlesex University.

History  Kocaeli derives its name from Ak√ßa Khodja, an Ottoman Turkish warleader who began the conquest of the region from the Byzantine Empire. His domain (in Turkish Koca-ili or Koca-eli, \\"land of the Khodja\\") was recognized as a sanjak, already during the reign of Orhan I, sometime between 1327‚Äì1338, making it one of the earliest sanjaks of the Ottoman Empire. Its capital was Iznikmid (Nicomedia, modern Izmit), which was conquered by the Ottomans sometime between 1331 an 1338. With the establishment of the Anatolia Eyalet it became part of it until 1533, when it was added to the newly created Eyalet of the Archipelago. The woods of the province allowed the city to become the site of a major naval arsenal, especially during the K√∂pr√ºl√º era. It remained part of the Eyalet of the Archipelago until the Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century; by 1846, it had been transferred to the Kastamonu Eyalet.

(¬£0.5m).Stanley Chapman: \\"The Rise of Merchant Banking\\", Routledge, London/ New York 2006, p.131, The company later expanded its operations to the Persian Gulf ports, Baghdad and Japan. From 1879In 1879 E.D. Sassoon & Co. moved from just trading in cotton into the cotton mill business by purchasing the bankrupt Alexandra Mills, which had been founded in 1869 by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata (1839-1904). onwards it also bought up poorly performing cotton mills in Bombay and turned them into successful operations. After the death of Elias David Sassoon in 1880, his eldest son Sir Jacob Elias Sassoon (1844‚Äì1916) took over the business and further branches were opened in Calcutta and Karachi. The firm also purchased property in Shanghai. But in 1907 the United Kingdom signed a treaty agreeing to gradually eliminate the opium exports to China over the next decade while China agreed to eliminate domestic production over that period. Following this treaty E.D. Sassoon & Co. retreated from the opium trade, eventually stopping it completely.David Faure (Editor): \\"Society - A Documentary History of Hong Kong\\", Hong Kong University Press, Hong Kong 1997, p.125, Instead the company invested further in its cotton mill business in Bombay. By the First World War E.D. Sassoon & Co. had grown into India's single largest textile group and was renowned for their advanced production technology. In 1909 Sir Jacob Elias Sassoon also played a very prominent role in forming the \\"Eastern Bank\\", taking advantage of the banks facilities to make themselves less vulnerable to fluctuations of the Indian rupee. On 1 January 1921, E.D. Sassoon & Co. Ltd was incorporated as a private trading and banking company, giving up its old partnership structure.Stanley Jackson: ‚Ä≥The Sassoons - Portrait of a Dynasty‚Ä≥, Secon Edition, William Heinemann Ltd., London 1989, p.200, After the death of Sir Edward Elias Sasoon (1853‚Äì1924) and his younger brother Meyer Harry Sassoon (1875‚Äì1924) within a year, Sir Edward Elias Sassoons son Sir Victor Sassoon (1881‚Äì1961) and Meyer Harry Sassoon's widow Mozelle Gubbay (1872‚Äì1964) became the main owners of the company with combined business assets of ¬£15 million. Sir Victor Sassoon became the chairman of the company and Meyer Harry Sassoon's son-in-law, Derek Fitzgerald (1892‚Äì1967), was appointed manager of the London and Manchester branches. In 1927, E.D. Sassoon & Co. Ltd was already the largest cotton mill owner in Bombay, where it was still headquartered. When the Great Depression in 1929-30 drove E.D. Sassoons biggest competitors into bankruptcy, the company took them over. By the time the Second World War broke out in Europe, E.D. Sassoon & Co. owned 15 cotton mills and was with over 30,000 employees Bombays largest private employer. The profits generated in Bombay were reinvested in luxury real estate and hotels in Shanghai. In 1923 E.D. Sassoon & Co. had bought the majority of shares of the established produce firm \\"Arnhold & Co.\\"Arnhold & Co., based in Shanghai, had branches in Hankow, Tientsin, Canton and London.

Although the war boosted production rates, thanks to the soaring demand of the allied armies, the firm decided to dispose of the cotton mills in Bombay in 1943,E.D. Sassoon & Co.'s cotton mills were sold in 1943 to the Indian trading company \\"Messrs Aggarwal & Co.\\", which integrated them into their \\"The India United Mills Limited\\".

The term is applied to, for example, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, methane, hydrogen, ethylene, etc. Many, but not all, gaseous signaling molecules are called gasotransmitters. The biological roles of each of the gaseous signaling molecules are in short outlined below. Gaseous signaling molecules as gasotransmitters Gasotransmitters is a subfamily of endogenous molecules of gases or gaseous signaling molecules, including NO, CO, . These particular gases share many common features in their production and function but carry on their tasks in unique ways, which differ from classical signaling molecules, in the human body. In 1981, it was first suggested from clinical work with nitrous oxide that a gas had a direct action at pharmacological receptors and thereby acted as a neurotransmitter. In vitro experiments confirmed these observations which were replicated at NIDA later. The terminology and characterization criteria of ‚Äúgasotransmitter‚Äù were firstly introduced in 2002. For one gas molecule to be categorized as a gasotransmitters, all of the following criteria should be met.Wang R (ed) (2004) Signal Transduction and the Gasotransmitters: NO, CO and H2S in Biology and Medicine. Humana Press, New Jersey, USA. # It is a small molecule of gas; # It is freely permeable to membranes. As such, its effects do not rely on the cognate membrane receptors. It can have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects. In their endocrine mode of action, for example, gasotransmitters can enter the blood stream; be carried to remote targets by scavengers and released there, and modulate functions of remote target cells; # It is endogenously and enzymatically generated and its production is regulated; # It has well defined and specific functions at physiologically relevant concentrations. Thus, manipulating the endogenous levels of this gas evokes specific physiological changes; # Functions of this endogenous gas can be mimicked by its exogenously applied counterpart; # Its cellular effects may or may not be mediated by second messengers, but should have specific cellular and molecular targets. In 2011, a European Network on Gasotransmitters (ENOG) was formed. The aim of the network is to promote research on NO, CO and in order to better understand the biology of gasotransmitters and to unravel the role of each mediator in health and disease. Moreover, the network aims to contribute to the translation of basic science knowledge in this area of research into therapeutic or diagnostic tools. Oxygen Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply. If its levels are high, the capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue. Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation, which can cause respiratory alkalosis. Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO2 pressure of 40 mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10‚Äì20 mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving. Nitric oxide NO is one of the few gaseous signalling molecules known and is additionally exceptional due to the fact that it is a radical gas. It is a key vertebrate biological messenger, playing a role in a variety of biological processes.Weller, Richard, Could the Sun be good for your heart? TedxGlasgow. Filmed March 2012, posted January 2013 It is a known bioproduct in almost all types of organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants, fungi, and animal cells.Roszer, T (2012) The Biology of Subcellular Nitric Oxide. Nitric oxide, known as the 'endothelium-derived relaxing factor', or 'EDRF', is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and autocrine (within a single cell) signaling molecule. Independent of nitric oxide synthase, an alternative pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant- based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, have been shown to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet. The production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission, modulation of the hair cycle, production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis. Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Humans with atherosclerosis, diabetes, or hypertension often show impaired NO pathways. A high salt intake was demonstrated to attenuate NO production in patients with essential hypertension, although bioavailability remains unregulated. Nitric oxide is also generated by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) as part of the human immune response. Phagocytes are armed with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-Œ≥) as a single signal or by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) along with a second signal.Gorczyniski and Stanely, Clinical Immunology. Landes Bioscience; Austin, TX. On the other hand, transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-Œ≤) provides a strong inhibitory signal to iNOS, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 provide weak inhibitory signals. In this way, the immune system may regulate the resources of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune responses. Nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites, including Leishmania and malaria; the mechanism for this includes DNA damage Free text. free text and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron-nitrosyl compounds. In response, many bacterial pathogens have evolved mechanisms for nitric oxide resistance. Because nitric oxide might have proinflammatory actions in conditions like asthma, there has been increasing interest in the use of exhaled nitric oxide as a breath test in diseases with airway inflammation. Reduced levels of exhaled NO have been associated with exposure to air pollution in cyclists and smokers, but, in general, increased levels of exhaled NO are associated with exposure to air pollution. Nitric oxide can contribute to reperfusion injury when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of ischemia) reacts with superoxide to produce the damaging oxidant peroxynitrite. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from paraquat poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism. In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine- dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also plays a role in plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before wilting. Two important biological reaction mechanisms of nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is a mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein.van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (eds.) (2007) Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO is referred to as a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (2004) \\"Nitric Oxide\\", in Encyclopedia of Analytical Science, 2nd ed., Elsevier, . There are several mechanisms by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase, activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation, and iron regulatory factor activation. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-Œ∫B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation. It was found that NO acts through the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic- GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates protein kinase G, which causes reuptake of Ca2+ and the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca2+ ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell. Nitrous oxide Nitrous oxide in biological systems can be formed by an enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitric oxide. In vitro studies have shown that endogenous nitrous oxide can be formed by the reaction between nitric oxide and thiol. Some authors have shown that this process of NO reduction to N2O takes place in hepatocytes, specifically in their cytoplasm and mitochondria, and suggested that the N2O can possibly be produced in mammalian cells. It is well known that N2O is produced by some bacteria during process called denitrification. Apart from its direct and indirect actions at opioid receptors,Finck, A. D., Samaniego, E., Ngai, S.H. [1995]. Nitrous oxide selectively releases met5-enkephalin and met5-enkephalin-arg6-phe7 into canine third ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. Anesthesia and Analgesia 80: 664-70 it was also shown that N2O inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated activity and ionic currents and diminishes NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Nitrous oxide also inhibits methionine synthase and slows the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, increases homocysteine concentration and decreases methionine concentration. This effect was shown in lymphocyte cell cultures and in human liver biopsy samples. Nitrous oxide does not bind as a ligand to the heme and does not react with thiol-containing proteins. Nevertheless, studies have shown that nitrous oxide can reversibly and non-covalently \\"insert\\" itself into the inner structures of some heme-containing proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome oxidase and alter their structure and function. The ability of nitrous oxide to alter the structure and function of these proteins was demonstrated by shifts in infrared spectra of cysteine thiols of hemoglobin and by partial and reversible inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Endogenous nitrous oxide can possibly play a role in modulating endogenous opioid and NMDA systems. Carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a signaling molecule. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a neurotransmitter or a blood vessel relaxant. Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and inflammation. Summary of function: *CO functions as an endogenous signaling molecule. *CO modulates functions of the cardiovascular system. *CO inhibits blood platelet aggregation and adhesion. *CO may play a role as potential therapeutic agent. In mammals, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase 1 and 2 on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and encouragers of neovascular growth. However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from wet macular degeneration, a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times. There is a theory that, in some nerve cell synapses, when long-term memories are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain guanylate cyclase, an enzyme that is activated by carbon monoxide. Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released. Carbon suboxide Those are 6- or 8-ring macrocyclic polymers of carbon suboxide that were found in living organisms. They are acting as an endogenous digoxin-like Na+/K+-ATP- ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase inhibitors, endogenous natriuretics, antioxidants and antihypertensives Carbon suboxide, C3O2, can be produced in small amounts in any biochemical process that normally produces carbon monoxide, CO, for example, during heme oxidation by heme oxygenase-1. It can also be formed from malonic acid. It has been shown that carbon suboxide in an organism can quickly polymerize into macrocyclic polycarbon structures with the common formula (C3O2)n (mostly (C3O2)6 and (C3O2)8), and that those macrocyclic compounds are potent inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase, and have digoxin-like physiological properties and natriuretic and antihypertensive actions. Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer protective mechanisms, for example in the retina. Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen sulfide is produced in small amounts by some cells of the mammalian body and has a number of biological signaling functions. (Only two other such gases are currently known: nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO).) The gas is produced from cysteine by the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma- lyase. It acts as a relaxant of smooth muscle and as a vasodilator and is also active in the brain, where it increases the response of the NMDA receptor and facilitates long term potentiation, which is involved in the formation of memory. Eventually the gas is converted to sulfite in the mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase, and the sulfite is further oxidized to thiosulfate and sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The sulfates are excreted in the urine. Due to its effects similar to nitric oxide (without its potential to form peroxides by interacting with superoxide), hydrogen sulfide is now recognized as potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective role effect of garlic is caused by catabolism of the polysulfide group in allicin to , a reaction that could depend on reduction mediated by glutathione. Though both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide have been shown to relax blood vessels, their mechanisms of action are different: while NO activates the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels in smooth muscle cells. Researchers are not clear how the vessel- relaxing responsibilities are shared between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. However, there exists some evidence to suggest that nitric oxide does most of the vessel-relaxing work in large vessels and hydrogen sulfide is responsible for similar action in smaller blood vessels.\\"Toxic Gas, Lifesaver\\", Scientific American, March 2010 Recent findings suggest strong cellular crosstalk of NO and , demonstrating that the vasodilatatory effects of these two gases are mutually dependent. Additionally, reacts with intracellular S-nitrosothiols to form the smallest S-nitrosothiol (HSNO), and a role of hydrogen sulfide in controlling the intracellular S-nitrosothiol pool has been suggested. Like nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide is involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle that causes erection of the penis, presenting possible new therapy opportunities for erectile dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide () deficiency can be detrimental to the vascular function after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMIs can lead to cardiac dysfunction through two distinct changes; increased oxidative stress via free radical accumulation and decreased NO bioavailability. Free radical accumulation occurs due to increased electron transport uncoupling at the active site of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme involved in converting L-arginine to NO. During an AMI, oxidative degradation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor in NO production, limits BH4 availability and limits NO productionby eNOS. Instead, eNOS reacts with oxygen, another cosubstrates involved in NO production. The products of eNOS are reduced to superoxides, increasing free radical production and oxidative stress within the cells. A deficiency impairs eNOS activity by limiting Akt activation and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site. Instead, Akt activity is increased to phosphorylate the eNOST495 inhibition site, downregulating eNOS production of NO. therapy uses a donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to increase the supply of to an AMI patient. donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for . pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess and eNOS to increase NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3‚Äô,5‚Äô-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial infarct size. In Alzheimer's disease the brain's hydrogen sulfide concentration is severely decreased. In a certain rat model of Parkinson's disease, the brain's hydrogen sulfide concentration was found to be reduced, and administering hydrogen sulfide alleviated the condition. In trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) the body produces an excess of hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is also involved in the disease process of type 1 diabetes. The beta cells of the pancreas in type 1 diabetes produce an excess of the gas, leading to the death of these cells and to a reduced production of insulin by those that remain. In 2005, it was shown that mice can be put into a state of suspended animation-like hypothermia by applying a low dosage of hydrogen sulfide (81 ppm ) in the air. The breathing rate of the animals sank from 120 to 10 breaths per minute and their temperature fell from 37 ¬∞C to just 2 ¬∞C above ambient temperature (in effect, they had become cold-blooded). The mice survived this procedure for 6 hours and afterwards showed no negative health consequences.Mice put in 'suspended animation', BBC News, 21 April 2005 In 2006 it was shown that the blood pressure of mice treated in this fashion with hydrogen sulfide did not significantly decrease.Gas induces 'suspended animation', BBC News, 9 October 2006 A similar process known as hibernation occurs naturally in many mammals and also in toads, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called clinical torpor when food shortage occurs). If the -induced hibernation can be made to work in humans, it could be useful in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental stroke in rats. As mentioned above, hydrogen sulfide binds to cytochrome oxidase and thereby prevents oxygen from binding, which leads to the dramatic slowdown of metabolism. Animals and humans naturally produce some hydrogen sulfide in their body; researchers have proposed that the gas is used to regulate metabolic activity and body temperature, which would explain the above findings.Mark B. Roth and Todd Nystul. Buying Time in Suspended Animation. Scientific American, 1 June 2005 Two recent studies cast doubt that the effect can be achieved in larger mammals. A 2008 study failed to reproduce the effect in pigs, concluding that the effects seen in mice were not present in larger mammals. Likewise a paper by Haouzi et al. noted that there is no induction of hypometabolism in sheep, either. At the February 2010 TED conference, Mark Roth announced that hydrogen sulfide induced hypothermia in humans had completed Phase I clinical trials. The clinical trials commissioned by the company he helped found, Ikaria, were however withdrawn or terminated by August 2011. Sulfur dioxide The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood. Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the pulmonary stretch receptors and abolishes the Hering‚ÄìBreuer inflation reflex. It was shown that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a role in diminishing an experimental lung damage caused by oleic acid. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces endogenous SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding acetylcysteine or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO2 produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating cardiac and blood vessel function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, stenocardia. It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of homocysteine is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients. Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the proliferation rate of endothelial smooth muscle cells in blood vessels, via lowering the MAPK activity and activating adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their stenosis, so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis. Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent calcium channels and L-type (\\"dihydropyridine\\") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism. Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by isoproterenol adrenergic hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve. Hydrogen cyanide Some authors have shown that neurons can produce hydrogen cyanide upon activation of their opioid receptors by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates NMDA receptors and plays a role in signal transduction between neuronal cells (neurotransmission). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid analgesia, as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator. It was also shown that, while stimulating muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cultured pheochromocytoma cells increases HCN production, in a living organism (in vivo) muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually decreases HCN production. Leukocytes generate HCN during phagocytosis. The vasodilatation, caused by sodium nitroprusside, has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to nitroglycerine and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise. Ammonia Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal physiology. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and coma of hepatic encephalopathy, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias. Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from glutamine, Œ±-ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two molecules of bicarbonate, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion. Methane Some authors have shown that endogenous methane is produced not only by the intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial hypoxia, for example, sodium azide intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress. Other authors have shown that cellular methane production also rises during sepsis or bacterial endotoxemia, including an experimental imitation of endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Some other researchers have shown that methane, produced by the intestinal flora, is not fully \\"biologically neutral\\" to the intestine, and it participates in the normal physiologic regulation of peristalsis. And its excess causes not only belching, flatulence and belly pain, but also functional constipation. Ethylene An ethylene signal transduction pathway. Ethylene permeates the membrane and binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum. The receptor releases the repressed EIN2. This then activates a signal transduction pathway which activates a regulatory genes that eventually trigger an Ethylene response. The activated DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a functional enzyme that is used for ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene serves as a hormone in plants. It acts at trace levels throughout the life of the plant by stimulating or regulating the ripening of fruit, the opening of flowers, and the abscission (or shedding) of leaves. Commercial ripening rooms use \\"catalytic generators\\" to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening () has been seen to produce CO2 levels of 10% in 24 hours.External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control . ne-postharvest.com Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn incense in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems. In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene. Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated abscission in 1917. It wasn't until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene. In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening as well as senescence of vegetative tissues.Crocker W, Hitchcock AE, Zimmerman PW. (1935) \\"Similarities in the effects of ethlyene and the plant auxins\\". Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst. 7. 231-48. Auxins Cytokinins IAA Growth substances, Ethylene The Yang cycle Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds. Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as germination, ripening of fruits, abscission of leaves, and senescence of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators. Ethylene is biosynthesized from the amino acid methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme ACC synthase (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this enzyme is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme ACC-oxidase (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of auxins, especially indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins. Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding an ethylene receptor has been cloned in Arabidopsis thaliana and then in tomato. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in the Arabidopsis and tomato genomes. Mutations in any of the gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can lead to insensitivity to ethylene. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria. Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or anoxia, which leads to the synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes nastic movements (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.Explaining Epinasty. planthormones.inf Ethylene in plant induces such responses: *Seedling triple response, thickening and shortening of hypocotyl with pronounced apical hook. *In pollination, when the pollen reaches the stigma, the precursor of the ethene, ACC, is secreted to the petal, the ACC releases ethylene with ACC oxidase. *Stimulates leaf and flower senescence *Stimulates senescence of mature xylem cells in preparation for plant use *Induces leaf abscission *Induces seed germination *Induces root hair growth ‚Äî increasing the efficiency of water and mineral absorption through rhizosheath formation *Induces the growth of adventitious roots during flooding * Stimulates survival under low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in submerged plant tissues van Veen et al., , Plant Cell, 2013 *Stimulates epinasty ‚Äî leaf petiole grows out, leaf hangs down and curls into itself *Stimulates fruit ripening *Induces a climacteric rise in respiration in some fruit which causes a release of additional ethylene. *Affects gravitropism *Stimulates nutational bending *Inhibits stem growth and stimulates stem and cell broadening and lateral branch growth outside of seedling stage (see Hyponastic response) *Interference with auxin transport (with high auxin concentrations) *Inhibits shoot growth and stomatal closing except in some water plants or habitually flooded ones such as some rice varieties, where the opposite occurs (conserving and ) *Induces flowering in pineapples *Inhibits short day induced flower initiation in Pharbitus nil and Chrysanthemum morifolium Small amounts of endogenous ethylene are also produced in mammals, including humans, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of endogenous ethylene is then oxidized to ethylene oxide, which is able to alkylate DNA and proteins, including hemoglobin (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal valine, N-hydroxyethyl-valine). Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate guanine in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk. It is also mutagenic.

The film focuses on Ella Brown, who is sent to live with her aunt who living in a boarding house when her father heads to Alaska to prospect for gold. Ella's life at her aunt's home is miserable and she dreams of going to New York City. She dreams that she is in the city and has all money to buy anything which she fancies. Then she receives word that her father has returned from Alaska with a fortune and wants to give her everything she wants. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film includes scenes of New York City. The film was released on November 18, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: \\"Ella Brown is the only child of a poor widower. Their home is in a small town in the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to start there. He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing for her to do except submit. Sitting in her room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, she looks at her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The plot of the film focuses on the father who leaves during the Alaska gold rush, possibly referring to the Klondike Gold Rush or the Nome Gold Rush, both of which had concluded by the time the film was produced. The dreams of Ella were shot in New York City. Bowers states, \\"It is evident that Edwin Thanhouser loved New York City, for over the years he used it as a background for numerous films in scenarios which often played upon its faults, but which on balance depicted the city as the ultimate destination for those seeking culture and entertainment. Indeed, Edwin himself was to spend the final years of his life there - in an apartment on Fifth Avenue. By using a scenic background such as New York City - or Coney Island, or Niagara Falls - Thanhouser created films which had two appeals, that of a travelogue in addition to whatever merits the plot might have had.\\" Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World and it is a positive one. The reviewer states, \\"A clear presentation of the visions of a child who wanted to go to the city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening was rude, but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality.\\" Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.

The \\"enclos paroissial\\" or parish close comprises the √âglise Saint-Suliau, a sacristy, an ossuary or funeral chapel and a \\"porte triomphale\\" giving access to the enclosure. The enclosure is a listed historical monument since 1943. Eglise Saint-Suliau The entrance to the enclosure The elaborate entrance to the Sizun enclosure Access to the Sizun \\"enclos paroissial\\" is through an \\"Arc de Triomphe\\" like structure with a total length of 15 metres, built between 1585 and 1590. A life size reproduction of the Sizun entrance was shown at the 1989 \\"Comm√©moration du Bicentenaire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise\\" held in Paris' Jardins des Tuileries. The structure has three arches separated by fluted columns with Corinthian capitals and is surmounted by a double stone balustrade from which emerge the three crosses of a Calvary. At each corner of the balustrade is a \\"Lanteron\\" (a lantern-lke structure). The upper gallery of the \\"Arc de Triomphe\\" was accessed by a stone stairway so priests would have been able to preach from there in the open air but this was removed several years ago to assist the flow of traffic. The Piet√† of the √âglise Saint-Suliau The Piet√† on the lawn outside the √âglise Saint-Suliau The enclosure was thought to have had the usual elaborate calvary in earlier times and a Piet√†, as shown here, is thought to be what is left of that calvary apart from a head of a \\"bad\\" robber found in the ossuary. In the cemetery is an empty granite pedestal thought to have supported a Calvary, this inscribed \\"LAN MIL.V:XXXX:R.P.LA MISSION 1858\\". In the piet√†, John the Evangelist puts one hand on Jesus' head and with his other hand wipes the tears from his cheek. Mary Magdalene is shown lifting the top from her pot of ointment. There is also a small statue of Saint-Suliau outside the church. One of the many statues of Saint Suliau, this located on the lawn outside the church The ossuary The Sizun ossuary The ossuary chapel is located in the western part of the cemetery, and was built between 1585 and 1588. The ossuary door has decorated, fluted columns topped with Corinthian capitals on either side, and over this door is an entablature with the Rohan coat of arms in a triangular pediment and a small statue of Saint Suliau. Outside of the pediment are 1588 depictions of the Franciscans, Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony of Padua. Saint Francis shows his stigmata and Saint Anthony holds a chalice or ciborium. There are inscriptions by the Rohan coat of arms. One reads \\"Memento Mori\\", and the others in French remind visitors that they are in the presence of the dead (\\"Souviens-toi qu'il faut mourir\\" ‚Äì Remember that you will die), and (\\"Vous nos enfants qui par ici pass√©s, souvenez-vous que nous sommes tr√©pass√©s\\" ‚Äì You, our children who pass through here, remember that we are dead). The lower level of the building is built with yellow granite honeycomb stone and has arched windows separated by pilasters, some with caryatids depicting women who are naked apart from the scrolls they hold. Along the upper level of the building are twelve niches with fluted Doric pilasters between them and in these niches are statues of the twelve apostles, Saint Peter is depicted with a key, Saint Andrew with a cross, Saint James the Greater with a seashell, Saint John with a chalice, Saint James the Lesser with a stick, Saint Mathias with a pastoral staff, Saint Phillip with a cross, Saint Bartholomew with knife, Saint Matthew with some scales, Saint Simon with a saw, Judas Iscariot with a sword and Saint Thomas with a set-square. The ossuary is now used as a museum devoted to Breton Art and Culture. On a buttress on the south east corner there is a statue of Saint Suliau holding a cup. This sculpture decorates the ossuary. The demon has the bust of a woman and the body of a serpent and is shown plucking the apple from the tree of the Temptation The church The √âglise St Suliau was constructed in stages between the 16th and 17th centuries. The church's best feature is the 16th century southern porch built in the flamboyant gothic style in 1514. The church boasts five altarpieces, a Thomas Dallam organ dating to 1683 and some exquisite furnishings and there is a showcase in the north transept containing many artifacts including the solid silver bust of Saint Suliau shown in the gallery of images at the end of the article. The main altar has twisted pink columns on either side and includes images of the Virgin Mary and Joseph with the baby Jesus and statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul on either side of the tabernacle. There are also depictions of the four Evangelists with their attributes of a bull, a lion, a child and an eagle. Above Joseph and the baby Jesus is a statue of Saint Suliau. One of the altarpieces is dedicated to Saint Augustine and at the top of this altarpiece Jesus holds a terrestrial globe and turns his head to the main altar nearby. This altarpiece is carved from Lava limestone whilst all the other altarpieces in the church are carved from oak. Another of the altarpieces deals with Jesus' baptism and nearby are statues of Saint Yves, Saint Peter, Saint Guillaume and Saint Maudetz. The sabli√©res, the beams that sit below the ceiling and above the stone walls of churches, are partly made of wood and richly decorated. In the corners angels are depicted holding some of the instruments of the passion, a traditional embellishment in the art of the area around the Elorn River. The altarpiece of the Rosary in the south transept is the work of the sculptor Jean Berthouloux and features statues of Saint Dominique and Saint Catherine of Siena. There is a depiction of the Virgin Mary and child in the upper part of the altarpiece surrounded by two angels. Opposite this altarpiece is the oldest statue of Saint Suliau in the church. The altarpiece known as the \\"Agonisants\\" in the north transept depicts the death of a believer in the presence of Dom Michel le Nobletz, the Breton missionary. The composition includes statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and is topped with a statue of Joseph. The Sacristy View of sacristy The 17th century sacristy is located on the south side of the choir and is connected to the choir by a stone arch. The sacristy is octagonal in shape with a classical facade decorated with pilasters. The roofing slates are from the Monts d'Arr√©.

United States, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), was a United States Supreme Court that concerned whether the forced accompaniment statute under applies when a bank, credit union, or savings/loan association robber, or attempted robber, forces someone to accompany them for any distance. Defense attorney Joshua B. Carpenter argued on behalf of the Petitioner, and Assistant to the Solicitor General Brian H. Fletcher argued on behalf of the Department of Justice. Background On September 26, 2008, Larry Whitfield and Quanterrious McCoy attempted to rob a branch of the Fort Financial Credit Union in Gastonia, North Carolina, but were foiled when a metal detector at the entrance went off. The two would-be robbers fled the scene, first by a getaway vehicle that crashed, then by foot. The two ditched their weapons in a wooded area before McCoy hid under a nearby van and Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell, a 79-year-old grandmother with a history of heart disease and high blood pressure. Whitfield tried to assure Parnell he did not intend to hurt her, but asked her to come with him to another area of the house - a room where they could not be seen by the police. When Whitfield tried to call a friend for a new getaway vehicle, Parnell panicked, had a heart attack, and died. Whitfield was indicted on multiple counts related to the attempted robbery, including under section 2113(e) for forcing Parnell to \\"accompany\\" him from one part of her house to another. At his trial, the jury instructions mentioned that \\"the term 'forced accompaniment' includes... forcing a person to move from one part of a building to another against her will\\" and \\"does not require ... that the defendant crossed a property line, moved a person a particular number of feet, held a person for a particular period of time, or placed the person at a certain level of danger.\\" Whitfield plead \\"not guilty\\" to force accompaniment but a jury convicted him for the offense. On appeal, Whitfield's legal team argued the word \\"accompany\\" pursuant to section 2113(e) requires a \\"substantial\\" amount of forced movement, and because Whitfield had only forced Parnell to accompany him from one room to another (a distance of less than 10 feet) the evidence in this case did not qualify. The Fourth Circuit heard the appeal but affirmed the initial judgement on the offense. In writing for the Court, Judge King stated, \\"[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to accompany him for only a short distance within her own home, and for a brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced accompaniment occurred.\\" Opinion In a 9-0 decision, Justice Scalia delivered the unanimous opinion on January 13, 2015. In writing for the Court, Scalia argued the word \\"accompany\\" has always described any movement in which one \\"goes with\\" another over any distance - not just circumstances that could be described as kidnapping - and he specifically cited David Copperfield where Uriah \\"accompanied me into Mr. Wickfield's room\\" and Pride and Prejudice where Elizabeth \\"accompanied her out of the room.\\" Scalia further noted that while bank robbers may always assert some level of control over others, forced accompaniment (such as using a hostage as human shield or forcing a bank employee to walk with the robber to the vault) is distinct from other movement control (such as forcing hostages to lay on the ground or demanding a bank teller to put their hands behind their head), and the danger to the victim posed by forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the distance traversed.

Education  Reihana began attending Elam School of Fine Arts at Auckland University in 1983, graduating in 1987 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. She graduated with a Masters in Design from Unitec Institute of Technology Department of Design and Contemporary Arts in 2014. Career In 1991, Reihana was included in Pleasures and Dangers: Artists of the '90s, a publication and documentary of the same name produced by the Moet & Chandon New Zealand Art Foundation showcasing \\"the work of eight exciting younger artists, most just now making their mark nationally and overseas\\". In 2006, Reihana was one of fifteen New Zealand artists, most of MƒÅori and Pacific Island descent, who were invited to take part in the Pasifika Styles exhibition by making site-specific works throughout the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge that responded to objects in the museum's collection. For her work He Tautoko (2006) Reihana responded to the museum's Oceania collection, making an iwi connection by selecting a NgƒÅpuhi tekoteko (carved gable figure) to work with. Using footage of collection items filmed on an earlier visit to the museum, Reihana made a video of 'multi- layered images and animated tukutuku patterns' that she played on a screen mounted behind the teketeko. Next to the cabinet holding the tekoteko three handsets made audio recordings available for visitors to listen to: the tracks included a recording of songs sung by the Manukau Institute of Technology's MƒÅori choir, the sound of carver Lyonel Grant chiselling a pattern similar to that found on the tekoteko, and recordings of voices reading information about the tekoteko's provenance. A pair of 1960s headphones were positioned on the tekoteko's head. Underneath the cabinet holding the tekoteko Reihana placed another work, fluffy fings, as a playful counterpoint, a collection of 'furry and feathery horn works with titles such as thingymybobs and plush tusks.' Reihana wrote of this display 'The colourful nature of this work appeals to adults and children alike. So that parents could spend more time with he tautoko, fluffy fings was placed at a child's eye level.' Art historian Peter Brunt observes of Reihana's work in Pasifika Styles: > Reihana's work exemplifies two preoccupations of contemporary Pacific art. > One is the desire to re-examine colonial history, to excavate, remember and > re-present countless micro-histories and counter-memories in formally > experimental ways. The second is the desire to draw inspiration from the > 'life-worlds' of cultural communities in the present. In 2008 Reihana completed a major commission for the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Installed along Te Ara a Hine (one of the two entrances to the marae in the museum) the work, Mai i te aroha, ko te aroha ('From love, comes love'), was made up of seven components, including video, digital photography and textile design. In the same year Reihana was one of three New Zealand artists selected for the Liverpool Biennale. In 2014 Reihana received an Arts Laureate Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. In March 2016 Reihana was named as a nominee in the biennial Walters Prize for her work in Pursuit of Venus [infected] In Pursuit of Venus [infected] Reihana's major multi- channel video work In Pursuit of Venus [Infected] (2015) went on display at the Auckland Art Gallery in May 2015. Six years in the making, the work is based on a large 19th-century scenic wallpaper, Les Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique, created by French firm Joseph Dufour et Cie which depicts a romanticised view of the landscapes and people of the Pacific. Using the landscape forms of the wallpaper as a backdrop, Reihana added live action scenes recorded in front of green screens, showing interactions between Europeans and Polynesians. Reihana worked with theatre director Rachel House, actors and students from the Pacific Institute of Performing Arts to create this 32-minute film installation. Reihana's script re-examines the first encounters between Polynesians and Europeans with scenes that depict the intricacies of cultural identity and colonisation. Instead of Dufour's romanticized depictions of Europeans interacting with native people, Reihana shows the realities of these interactions, including scenes of violence and exchanges of goods for sexual favors. In a review of the work, John Hurell writes: > In this eagerly anticipated, but not hyped up, narrative packed panorama by > Lisa Reihana (it is as good as the advance publicity claimed), its loop of > thirty-two minutes duration holds its audience enthralled, being the very > best kind of spectacle. Not only is this seamlessly blended array of five > video projections sensual - with its sweeping landscape, figure groupings, > body movement, leafy textures and dramatic music - but it is thoroughly > researched, being packed with much detailed historical information. An earlier version of the work, Pursuit of Venus, was a finalist in the Singapore Art Museum's Signature Art Prize in 2014. The exhibition was the most-visited solo exhibition by a New Zealand artist at the Auckland Art Gallery since 1997, with 49,000 visitors. A version of the work will be shown at the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts in Guam in 2016. The work will also be shown at the National Gallery of Victoria from June to September 2016. Watch In Pursuit of Venus [infected] on Reihana's website here. Venice Biennale 2017 In October 2015, it was announced that Reihana will represent New Zealand at the 2017 Venice Biennale.

He was suspended from office after a court clerk who had lost his job when Hoover came onto the bench began a campaign to remove the new justice. Background Hoover was born to Elizabeth (Morrison) and David Hoover in Iowa during 1849. Details of his early life have been lost. Hoover was admitted to the California bar on January 14, 1873. He lived for a time in San Jose, California before moving to Gilroy, California in early 1874. 1880 census records show he was working as a lawyer. Hoover and his wife, Mary, had a son, Floyd, on April 3, 1874. The boy died before reaching two months of age. The couple had a second son, Harold. President Chester A. Arthur nominated Hoover to replace William Henry Stilwell as an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on July 20, 1882. Senate confirmation came on August 7 and Hoover arrived in Tucson, Arizona to take the oath of office on September 2. As Hoover had been in Washington during the confirmation process he returned to California to settle some personal matters, returning to the territory to begin a district court session on September 25, 1882. At the end of the session he reported to the United States Attorney General that he had tried 23 civil cases and reached a final verdict in 44 criminal trials. During his confirmation hearings, Hoover had provided testimony in prosecutions related to the Star route scandal. As a favor to the Justice Department, he returned to Washington D.C. in mid-November 1882 to provide additional testimony. Hoover arrived in Prescott, Arizona Territory on January 4, 1883 for the session of the supreme court that had begun three days earlier. The session adjourned on January 8 before reconvening in Tucson on February 23 and ending on March 6, 1883. No opinions written by Hoover from the session survive, but the territorial press were impressed by his demeanor and legal ability. While Hoover was traveling, Captain W. H. Seamans began efforts to have the new judge removed from the bench. Seamans had lost his job as Justice Stilwell's court clerk when Hoover took office. In addition to charges of misconduct while in office, Hoover was accused of being an associate of a \\"professional confidence man\\". Upon learning of the efforts, Hoover and his friend began a defense against the charges. In response to various letters to Washington and circulated petitions, the territorial bar discussed the issue during their January 1883 meeting and reported there was no basis for the charges leveled against Hoover. A vote during the bar's March 1883 meeting likewise rejected the accusations against the judge. Following the usual practice of the day, the United States Justice Department sent an agent to investigate the accusations against the judge. The investigation resulted in Hoover being suspended on March 23, 1883. After leaving office, Hoover remained in Arizona Territory and practiced law in Tucson and Tombstone. During the mid-1880s, Arizona experienced an economic downturn, resulting in a glut of practicing attorneys. During early 1886, Hoover's wife and son moved east and the former Justice dissolved his legal practice by the end of the year. He settled in Brooklyn and opening the legal firm of Hoover & Sparrow in Manhattan. Hoover died in New York City on February 22, 1926. He was buried Hancock, New York's Riverview Cemetery.

She stood out for her mathematical thinking and work with numbers and made significant contributions to arithmetic, which at the time was considered the exclusive domain of men. She is one of the few 18th century Spanish women scientists and mathematicians whose work has been preserved, including Mar√≠a Pascuala Caro Sureda.  Family  Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma was born on November 30 (Saint Andrew's Day), 1720. She was baptized the next day in the Church of El Pilar (Spanish: Iglesia del Pilar) and given the name of Maria Juana Rosa Andresa. Born into a wealthy family of textile merchants, Maria Andresa spent her childhood in a house on Pilar Street (Spanish: Calle del Pilar). Her father was the French merchant Juan Joseph Casamayor born in Oloron (France), son of Maria Abales and Juan Casamayor. Her mother was a Saragossan, Juana Rosa de La Coma, daughter of merchant Juan de La Coma and of Maria Alexandre, both of French origins. At the time, the French community was made up of a large number of individuals who maintained tight trade connections and dominated the trade in Saragossa. Her parents married on April 13, 1705, and Maria Andresa was the seventh of nine children.  Works  She published two books on arithmetic: * Her first published book is entitled Tyrocinio aritm√©tico (1738), From a mathematical point of view, the book is eminently practical and written in a fresh and supple language. A great number or examples based on real cases are given to the reader. Thus, one can learn directly the four rules of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition, the examples covered in this book indicate that she had precise knowledge of length, weight, and currency units that were used to perform the daily trade activities in the 18th century. As the Dominican priest Pedro Mart√≠nez, a friend and collaborator of Maria Andresa, revealed in the review of the book, \\"her aim, in this brief piece of work, is to bring the education to the many who have no means to achieve it\\". Thus, according to her professional profile, Maria Andresa Casamayor is to be commended for her unusually great arithmetic ability and deep concern for education. * El para s√≠ solo, her second book, is a 109-page unpublished manuscript on advanced arithmetic. She wrote under a male pseudonym, her nom de plume being Casandro Mam√©s de La Marca y Araioa. This name was a perfect anagram formed by rearranging all the letters that compose her own name, Maria Andresa Casamayor de La Coma. Oddly enough, there is a name spelling mistake in the source of this information, a quotation from the ‚ÄúNew Bibliography of Aragonese Writers‚Äù, (Spanish: Biblioteca nueva de los escritores aragoneses) by F√©lix Latassa. In Latassa's catalogue, Maria Andresa is listed under the name of ‚ÄúMaria Andrea‚Äù. Following Latassa, the name Maria Andrea is still used today. However, according to the baptismal certificate, she was named Maria Andresa. In the Tyrocinio, Casandro claimed to be a \\"disciple of the Piarist School\\" (Spanish: Escuela P√≠a) and dedicated the book to the same school, ‚ÄúEscuela P√≠a del Colegio de Santo Tom√°s de Zaragoza‚Äù. Girls' school teacher With the death of her father in 1738, and that of the friend and collaborator, Pedro Mart√≠nez, in 1739, the young Maria Andresa Casamayor had lost her main support. Maria Andresa never married or entered a religious order, as expected from women in the Aragonese society of that time. She had to work to support herself financially. For the greater part of her life, she taught at a girls‚Äô school, working as a teacher of primary education in the public schools of the city. She lived in a house that had been given to her as part of her payment. The building still exists today and is located on Palomar street (Spanish: Calle Palomar) in Saragossa.  Honors  In 2009, the City Council of Saragossa renamed a street in her honor (originally \\"Grupo Jose Antonio Gir√≥n\\"). A street named after Saragossa's famous woman scientist can also be found in Gijon. In 2018, she was included in the periodic table of women scientists (Spanish: La Tabla Peri√≥dica de las Cient√≠ficas), which represents women in science from around the world.

Knickerbocker Beskind (born 1924) is an American inventor and designer. Early education and career Barbara Beskind is a designer and internationally recognized pioneer in the field of occupational therapy. Beskind graduated in 1945 from the College of Home Economics at Syracuse University with a BS in Applied Arts and Design. At the end of World War II, she trained as an occupational therapist through the U.S. Army‚Äôs War Emergency Course and served for 20 years, retiring as a major in 1966. She went on to found the Princeton Center for Learning Disorders, the first independent private practice in occupational therapy in the U.S. She authored a clinical text published in 1980 on the treatment of children with learning disorders and holds a patent for inflatable equipment that helps learning-disordered children improve their balance. The American Occupational Therapy Association honored Beskind as a Charter Fellow in recognition of her innovative therapeutic techniques. In 1989 she retired after a 44-year career in occupational therapy. Following her retirement, she studied creative and non- fiction writing at Bennington College (three summer courses) and six semesters at Lebanon College. As a result, she has published three more books authored also under her maiden name Barbara Knickerbocker: an historical family autobiography, Powderkeg; a book of her art and poetry, Touches of Life in Time and Space; and an historical fiction, Flax to Freedom. Beskind studied abstract art at Sharon Arts Center in Sharon, New Hampshire, with a focus on its early roots in the Russian avant-garde. After three trips to Russia to study these artists, she taught a non-credit course at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. IDEO In January 2013, Beskind saw IDEO founder David Kelley speak on 60 Minutes about the importance of cultivating a diversity of experience among team members developing new products and services. Beskind wrote to the company, offering to help IDEO design for aging and low-vision populations. Then at age 89, she began working for IDEO in their Bay Area offices and has been directly involved with client projects related to contact lenses, health care delivery, and retirement home services. As a conceptual designer, she has developed specific ideas for a pair of glasses for those with macular degeneration such as she has. She is developing an alternative walker called the ‚ÄúTrekker‚Äù with vertical grips to promote good posture and to maintain alternative arm-leg movements. She has adapted ski poles to preserve good balance and gait patterns for those with vision and mobility problems.

In 1984 he was second in the Italian championship Formula 2000 at the wheel of the Alba-Alfa Romeo of Formula 3 with a record of four winnings in sequence. In 1985 and 1986 he joined the Italian Formula 3 championship on a Dallara 385 and still in 1986 he made his debut in the last two races of the European championship of Formula 3000, in Le Mans (France) and Jarama (Spain), driving the team Coloni's March Ford Cosworth. The following year, in 1987, he joined the official team Maserati Proteam as a tester and a racer in the WTCC tourism world championship, driving the Maserati Biturbo Once he gave up the competitive activity at the end of 1987, he became a tester and a journalist for some Italian car magazines.

E. Schwabach (1914) was a German Baroque painter, who is known primarily through his works done for the House of Lippe.  Life  The first known documents relating to Rundt's life are letters that he sent from Amsterdam in 1684. Based on those letters, he appears to have been a student of Gerard de Lairesse. In May 1687, Susanne Catharina Rundt was baptized in St. Nicholas' Church, Hamburg and, in December 1688, Gottfried Nicolaus Rundt was baptized in St. James' Church. They are presumed to be his children. In November 1692, Rundt applied to become a citizen of Hamburg and paid his fee in installments through August 1700. His involvement with the House of Lippe can be dated from 1698 to 1720, on the basis of 112 letters, mostly addressed to Christoph Leineweber, the \\"Landrezeptor\\" (estate manager) for Count Frederick Adolphus. He began working in Lippe and commuted between Hamburg and Detmold, doing errands as well as painting. After Leineweber's death in 1713, Rundt communicated more directly with the count, complaining about his low wages. Nevertheless, he continued to work for the family, even after the count's death, and became a Master Builder in 1720. Apparently, he never exercised his new duties and, after 1720, there is no further record of contacts with the family. After 1724, there is no more documentation at all. His death at a hospital in Hamburg is believed to have occurred around 1750.Barbara Hammann, Hans Hinrich Rundt, ein deutscher Maler an der Wende vom 17. zum 18. Jahrhundert, Munich, Ludwig Maximilian University (1974) The earliest works reliably attributed to him are engravings for the Thesauros Exoticorum by Eberhard Werner Happel (known as \\"Happelius\\") and for Viel vermehrte Moscowitische und Persianische Reisebeschreibungen by Adam Olearius, both in 1688. His first oil painting appears to have been his self- portrait. He also produced murals for the in 1705 and Saint James' Church. His last known painting was a portrait of someone named Johann Hanker for St. Peter's Church. Much of his work has been lost or destroyed.

Designed by Boston architecture firm Allen & Vance and built 1902, it was the fourth dorm built on Vassar's residential quadrangle. It houses 191 students of any grade or gender and it became Vassar's first disabled-accessible dorm following a 2008‚Äì2009 renovation. History Davison House was the fourth residential quadrangle (quad) dormitory to be built on the campus Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. Construction of Davison came during a period of rapid dorm-building spanning 1893‚Äì1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing‚Äîa single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building‚Äîwas quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897, Lathrop House in 1901, and finally Davison in 1902. Davison House was built with funds provided by magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, then a trustee at the college. Named in honor of his mother as the Eliza Davison House, it was the third structure at Vassar that Rockefeller paid for, after Strong House and Rockefeller Hall. Roofers replaced Davison's roof in 1960 and new windows were installed in 1980. A new staircase on the side of the dorm facing away from the quad was built in 2005. The dorm underwent a major renovation during the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, reopening at the beginning of the 2009‚Äì2010 academic year. The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility, including an elevator and disabled-accessible bathrooms and doors, making it Vassar's first dorm to offer those features. Architecture and features alt=A long five-story brown brick building stands before a broad green lawn. Davison was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Francis Richmond Allen and J. McArthur Vance who were also responsible for the design of its neighbor, Lathrop House, in 1901. Formulating a design for these two buildings was not difficult as a template had already been set by way of the preexisting Strong and Raymond Houses. Frederick Law Olmsted, a consultant of design for the college, recommended that any new dorms in the area be built in an \\"echelon formation\\" in order to provide for a greater sense of openness. Allen disregarded this advice, instead opting to place the dorm, along with Lathrop, in \\"two long unbroken rows of buildings on the bias\\". Davison was ultimately placed north of Raymond, across the quad to the west of Lathrop, and diagonally across from Strong. Standing a total of five stories tall with an additional basement level, Davison is an Elizabethan brick building. It is capped with a pitched Pennsylvania slate roof and five chimneys, each multiple wythes thick. Several cupolas also jut from the roof, each fitted with louvers. The dorm features elements of brownstone trim and brownstone-capped brick parapets. Inside the building, dorm room floors are made of wood paneling. Walls are painted cream and fifth floor rooms feature sloped ceilings and inlaid skylights. Bathrooms have tile floors and marble sinks, while communal spaces utilize motion-sensing lighting technology. The house is co-ed and currently has a capacity of 191 students. Residents of Davison, which houses students of all grades, may live in either single rooms, one-room doubles, or three-room triples with bathrooms being shared by all members of a hall. The dorm has a kitchen, a parlor abutting the quad, and, as of 2011, its basement was a frequent practice space for student bands. In a 2005 guide to the school published by College Prowler, Davison was named one of the three best dorms at Vassar, along with Main and Jewett.

He returned in 1907, when he began working as an assistant in the inorganic chemistry laboratory of Neculai CostƒÉchescu, and was promoted to head of operations in 1916. That year, he received a doctorate in chemistry, having submitted a thesis on iron compounds. After CostƒÉchescu, he was the second individual to receive a doctorate in chemistry from a Romanian university. Subsequently, he was named associate professor at Ia»ôi University.ScƒÉe»õeanu, Pele, p. 348 In 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania and the establishment of the University of Cluj, he was invited to teach as associate professor of inorganic and analytic chemistry. He was promoted to full professor in 1922. While at Cluj, he put together a school of chemistry, founding and supplying laboratories for students and researches and advising sixteen doctoral students. Among those he trained were Raluca Ripan, Ilie G. Murgulescu, Petru Spacu and Coriolan DrƒÉgulescu. Petru, his only son, worked in his father's department after obtaining a doctorate, later moving to Bucharest. Of Gheorghe Spacu's 274 scientific articles, around two-thirds were written while he was at Cluj. These were generally published in the bulletin of the local scientific society, of which he was a founding member in 1921.

As before, he focused on establishing laboratories and training chemists. Maria Brezeanu was one of his doctoral students. During his Bucharest period, his work appeared in the bulletin of the Academy's scientific section. He received three awards from the communist authorities: the state prize (1952 and 1954) and the order of labor (1953). He continued working until his death in 1955.

While there is scholarly debate about the defining features of post- neoliberalism, it is often associated with economic policies of nationalization and wealth redistribution, opposition to deregulation, financialization, free trade, and the weakening of labour relations, and left- wing politics more generally. The movement has had particular influence in Latin America, where the \\"Pink Tide\\" brought about a substantial shift towards left-wing wing governments in the 2000s. According to Roger Merino, examples of post-neoliberal governments include the former governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.Merino, Roger (2011). What is ‚ÄòPost‚Äô in Post-Neoliberal Economic Policy? Extractive Industry Dependence and Indigenous Land Rights in Bolivia and Ecuador History Evo Morales, the former President of Bolivia, is often associated with post-neoliberalism. The idea of post-neoliberalism arose during the Pink Tide of the 1990s and 2000s, in which left-wing Latin American critics of neoliberalism like Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales were thrust into power. According to researchers, the election of Hugo Chavez as President of Venezuela in 1999 marked a definite start to the Pink Tide and post-neoliberal movement. Following his election, Evo Morales, N√©stor Kirchner, Rafael Correa, and numerous other leaders associated with the post-neoliberal movement were elected in Latin America.

Early life Gardiner was the daughter of John Arden, a scholar and lecturer, who is best known as one of Mary Wollstonecraft‚Äôs early teachers. His interests centred on natural philosophy (science) and belles lettres (literature); he taught his daughter in moments of leisure. Gardiner herself was friends with Wollstonecraft: they lived near one another in Beverley for several years, and when the Wollstonecraft family moved away in 1774, the girls wrote letters to one another throughout their teens and early twenties. Career Gardiner began teaching early, leaving home in her mid-teens to take up a position as governess to the daughters of Lady Martin in north Norfolk. In 1780 she moved across England to the household of Lord Ilchester of Redlynch, Somerset. She was succeeded as governess to the Fox-Strangeways family by Agnes Porter, whose memoirs were reprinted in 1998. Gardiner opened a boarding school for girls in Beverley in 1784, which she directed by herself for thirteen years. This establishment provided a home for her aging parents and invalid younger sister. By this point she had reconciled herself to her fate: \\"I own that the life of a governess would not have been my choice, but I am content.\\" Not all governesses were oppressed and isolated; she says on a return visit that the Martin family treated her \\"more as a daughter than as an humble 'gouvernante'\\". She went with the Martins to Houghton Hall, then in the possession of Horace Walpole, admiring the famous collection of paintings there. She became acquainted with Nelson, and asked him to help improve her understanding of art. Her father died in 1791. She married a friend of her younger brother in 1797, and in 1800 they moved, with her pupils, to Elsham Hall, a country house near Elsham, North Lincolnshire. She continued managing her school for thirty more years after that. She accumulated a library for the benefit of her pupils, totalling 2800 volumes in English, French, and Italian. In 1814 the family and school moved to Ashby Hall. In 1836, its owner wanted to take occupancy of the house, so aged 78, Gardiner gave up her school, and died four years later. Writing Gardiner was the author of several educational texts. In 1799 she published her Young Ladies‚Äô Grammar, an unusual grammar that used French as a model for English grammar. (for context, see History of English grammars.) In 1801 she published two accompanying volumes called English Exercises. She followed these with a travelogue entitled An Excursion from London to Dover, in Two Volumes (1806), and another grammar called An Easy French Grammar (1808). Personal life Gardiner was a devout Christian. She read the Bible daily, in tandem with Scott's Commentary, and the Golden Treasury by Karl Heinrich von Bogatzky. Most of the diary entries reprinted by her daughter are taken up with religious reflections. One of her former pupils claimed that \\"out of no school was there ever sent forth a greater number of solidly educated christian women\\" This would have been about 600 young women, over the course of half a century. Gardiner named her daughter Everilda, the given name of her first employer, Lady Martin. This daughter wrote a somewhat hagiographic memoir of her mother, which this article draws on. It quotes extensively from letters received and diary entries, as well as giving a biographical sketch and an extended description of her last illness and deathbed. The book was funded by subscription publishing, an C18 and C19 version of crowdfunding, and Everilda expressed surprise that almost 700 individuals had \\"subscribed\\" (pre-purchased) about 1400 copies.the \\"advertisement\\" (a one-page preface) References Category:1758 births Category:1840 deaths Category:English governesses Category:Linguists of English Category:18th-century English writers Category:18th-century British women writers Category:English women writers Category:People from Beverley Category:People from Elsham, North Lincolnshire Category:19th-century English writers Category:19th-century English women writers Category:English educators ","title":"Jane Gardiner"},{"id":"45599966","text":"Walidah Imarisha is an American writer, activist, educator and spoken word artist.

She studied art in California earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts from California State University, Long Beach and a Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2000, she returned to Vietnam to establish her art practice and contribute to the growing community of contemporary artists.

Her ancestral home was in Chittagong. She studied in Calcutta and Comilla. In 1955 she was awarded a diploma in Design in the Modeling and Sculpture course from Camberwell College of Arts in London. At Camberwell, she studied under the British sculptor Jacob Epstein and Karel Vogel of Czechoslovakia. In 1966, she met Danish artist Asger Jorn in Paris. She studied European sculpture under the sculptor Venturino Venturi in Florence and later in Vienna. She was influenced by many western modern sculptors such as Henry Moore. Career Ahmed jointly worked with Hamidur Rahman on the original design of the Shaheed Minar, Dhaka. During 1956‚Äì1960, she had done about 100 sculptures in Dhaka. Out of her 100 sculptures, 33 sculptures are currently in Bangladesh National Museum. Ahmed's first exhibition was held in University of Dhaka in 1960. Another exhibition of her works was held in Lahore in 1961. Her last exhibition was also held in Paris in July 1973. Style and technique Ahmed's early works resembled geometrical forms made by stones and concrete and anthropomorphic forms - mixing the human figure and animals. Then she used iron and steel and later bronze. She began sprays paintings, using plane crash remains from the US army (1964‚Äì1969). After her bad accident, her drawings included shapes and figures of a meditative character: space, island, birds in the sky, phoenix, flowers, water, sunshine and the moon, minimalist landscapes, human figures turned toward a new horizon and others. Personal life Ahmed was married to a police officer in mid 1954 in Calcutta. The couple got divorced in late 1954. She started living in France in the 1970s. She married Gregoire de Brouhns in 1984.

He was Chair of the Dept. of Chemical and Systems Biology from its inception in 2006 until 2011. Education Ferrell was an undergraduate at Williams College, majoring in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and graduated in 1976. He received his Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from Stanford University in 1984 for work in the laboratory of Wray H. Huestis on the control of red cell shape, and received his M.D. degree from Stanford in 1986. He carried out postdoctoral work on signal transduction in the laboratory of G. Steven Martin at UC Berkeley. Research Through studies of Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation, Ferrell showed how graded changes in the inductive stimulus progesterone are converted into irreversible, all-or-none changes in MAP kinase activity, cyclin- dependent kinase activity, and cell fate. These studies helped demonstrate how ultrasensitivity, positive feedback, and bistability can allow cells to switch between discrete states. Subsequent work from the Ferrell lab and others demonstrated that the cell cycle transition between interphase and mitosis is regulated by a bistable switch, and that the Xenopus early embryonic cell cycle operates like a relaxation oscillator. These findings helped validate earlier theoretical predictions and modeling studies. Recently the Ferrell lab showed that the mitotic state can propagate through Xenopus cytoplasm via trigger waves, waves of Cdk1 activity that spread faster and farther than the Cdk1 protein molecules can diffuse. They also showed that apoptosis propagates through cytoplasm by trigger waves; the \\"speed of death\\" is about 2 mm per hour.

It is authored by Paul the Apostle for the churches in Galatia, written between 49‚Äì58 CE. This chapter contains Paul's significant exposition concerning the significance of God's revelation of Jesus Christ.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 24 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 46 (~AD 200) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Papyrus 51 (~400; extant verses 2-10, 13, 16-20) *Papyrus 99 (~400; extant verses 4-11, 18-24) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 21-24) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 1-3, 11-13, 22-24) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) Opening Greetings (1:1‚Äì5) The form of the opening words follows the custom in the era 'writer to addresses; greetings' found in other New Testament and early Christian letters. Only elaborates the greetings at a greater length than in this epistle. =Verse 1= : Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), NKJV *\\"Apostle\\": translated from Greek word ·ºÄœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ, apostolos, which generally means 'one who is sent' (as in ), but in the New Testament is more specifically applied to those specially commissioned by Jesus Christ. Paul's striking comment on his apostleship (\\"not from men\\" etc.) emphasizes his ministry in Galatia under the commission by Jesus Christ and God the Father. =Verse 2= : and all the brethren who are with me, ::To the churches of Galatia: NKJV *\\"All the brethren\\" (NRSV: \\"all the members of God‚Äôs family\\"): Unlike the other epistles that name individual co-workers (such as Sosthenes in 1 Corinthians 1:1, Timothy in 2 Corinthians 1:1), Paul alludes to 'God's family' consisting of men and women, using the word adelphoi, literally 'brothers' (or 'brethren'), which can also include 'sisters'. Rebuke (1:6‚Äì9) Instead of the usual note of thanksgiving following the greetings, Paul criticizes the Galatians for deserting his teaching of God's grace and turning to a different gospel, while there is no other gospel, and calls those who spread the fake gospel as anathema. Proclamation of the Gospel (1:10‚Äì12) Paul claims that his proclamation of the gospel is not of human origin but directly from the revelation of Jesus Christ. Paul's Pre-Christian Life and Conversion (1:13‚Äì17) The clarifying account of Paul's pre-Christian life may be a response to an effort by his opponents to use it to undermine his authority. The word 'Judaism' in verses 13 and 14 are the only two references in the whole New Testament, and not until half a century later in the writings of Ignatius, 'Judaism' and 'Christianity' are considered two 'religions'. Contacts at Jerusalem (1:18‚Äì24) In this part, Paul recounts his interaction with the leaders in Jerusalem, but maintains his independence of the Jerusalem authorities. =Verse 18= : Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. NKJV *\\"After three years\\": This is after Paul's conversion, not after his return to Damascus. Paul wanted to join the church in Jerusalem, but the members doubted and avoided him, until Barnabas brought him to Simon Peter and James (the brother of Jesus), informing the conversion and his eagerness to preach the Gospel in Damascus. *\\"Peter\\": Several Alexandrian and Ethiopia copies read \\"Cephas\\", which is another name of the same Simon Peter.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, - Galatians 1:18 =Verse 19= : But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. KJV * \\"James the Lord's brother\\" refers to \\"James the brother of Jesus Christ\\", a distinguished member of the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:17; 1 Corinthians 9:5), although not one of the Twelve Apostles, but is named an apostle in the wider sense (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:7; 1 Corinthians 9:5);Meyer, Heinrich August Wilhelm (1880).

Since the start of the war in 1793 the French fleet had suffered a series of damaging defeats and was restricted to limited operations off the French Mediterranean Coast in the face of a determined allied blockade. The French fleet, commanded by Pierre Martin, had sought to test the blockade during 1795, and in March had been caught by the British, under William Hotham, in the Gulf of Genoa. At the ensuing Battle of Genoa two French ships were captured before Martin was able to retreat to a safe anchorage. During the spring Martin and Hotham both received reinforcements from their respective Atlantic Fleets, the British admiral sailing off Minorca while Martin was forced to put down a mutiny among his sailors. By June Hotham had returned to the Ligurian Sea, anchored in San Fiorenzo Bay, when the French fleet sailed once more. In early July Martin's fleet was discovered off Cap Corse by a British flying squadron under Captain Horatio Nelson and, with some delay, Hotham set off in pursuit. Martin retreated towards the safe anchorage of the √éles d'Hy√®res, but on 13 July his straggling ships were caught by the British vanguard. In a short battle the British cut off the rearmost ship and forced it to surrender. Alcide had caught fire during the action and blew up shortly afterwards with heavy loss of life. Hotham was in a position to attack the surviving French fleet but declined, to the frustration of his officers and the criticism of later historians. The British retained their blockade, and Martin did not contest it again for the remainder of the year. This was the last fleet action in the Mediterranean before the British fleet was forced to withdraw in late 1796 ‚Äì the next major engagement in the region was the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Background Early in the French Revolutionary Wars the British Mediterranean Fleet seized the entire French Mediterranean Fleet at the start of the Siege of Toulon in August 1793.Ireland, p.178 Shortly before French forces recaptured the city in December, boarding parties attempted to burn the French fleet, but due to failures by Spanish forces only half of the French ships were destroyed.Gardiner, p.105 In 1794, as the French repaired their ships, the British invaded and captured the island of Corsica, subsequently using San Fiorenzo Bay as an anchorage from which they could blockade Toulon.Ireland, p.145 Although the French fleet, under the command of Contre- amiral Pierre Martin, made a brief sally from port in June 1794, it was not until March 1795 that it had the strength necessary for a large scale cruise.James, p.254 Sailing from Toulon on 3 March, the fleet encountered and captured the British ship HMS Berwick off Cap Corse,Clowes, p.267 but was then pursued by a joint British-Neapolitan fleet in the Gulf of Genoa. Retreating towards Toulon, the French were unable to evade the British fleet, under Vice- Admiral William Hotham, and on 13 March at the Battle of Genoa the rearmost ship was cut off and badly damaged.Bennett, p.89 The following day this ship, the , and its companion , were forced to surrender as Martin and the remainder of his ships escaped to the west.Forester, p.75 Hotham sailed to an anchorage off La Spezia, where one ship was wrecked, before returning to San Fiorenzo for refit.Clowes, p.273 In April he took the fleet to Leghorn, where he learned of his promotion to Admiral of the Blue, and he then sailed on an extended cruise to Cape Mola off Mah√≥n on Minorca. There he met on 14 June with a large reinforcement sent from Britain, comprising nine ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Robert Mann. Hotham was concerned that in his absence the French fleet might have sailed once more, and sent a small frigate squadron under Captain George Henry Towry back into the Ligurian Sea to search for Martin. This squadron instead encountered a squadron of French frigates on the same mission and in the ensuing Action of 24 June 1795 the French frigate Minerve was captured.James, p.289 The French had been unable to sail for most of the spring; Martin was initially preoccupied with gathering his ships and conducting repairs in his anchorage at the √éles d'Hy√®res off the French coast.James, p.265 He sent his most damaged ships back to Toulon, and they were joined there on 4 April by a reinforcement of six ships of the line under Contre-amiral Jean Fran√ßois Renaudin, sent from Brest on 22 February. Martin joined this force soon afterwards, but in May his fleet was struck by a significant mutiny. The sailors of Martin's fleet, although not of Renaudin's recently arrived squadron, refused further service, and it was only the efforts of Repr√©sentant en mission Joseph Niou which persuaded the rebellious seamen to return to duty, Niou making them promise \\"to wash their crime in the blood of the enemies of the [French] republic.\\"James, p.266 Pursuit At Niou's urging Martin took his fleet to sea once more on 7 June, his force comprising 17 ships of the line and six frigates. Hotham remained off Minorca until 24 June, before sailing up the eastern coast of Corsica and Sardinia, arriving at San Fiorenzo on 29 June. En route messages sent by Towry on the cutter Fox reached Hotham, warning that prisoners taken from Minerve reported that Martin was at sea. Hotham decided that the French were on a sailing exercise rather than an offensive operation and decided not to intervene, ordering his ships to refit and resupply. He did not post guard frigates or send scouts in search of Martin's force.Mostert, p.163 On 4 July Hotham detached a small squadron led by Captain Horatio Nelson in HMS Agamemnon, with the frigate HMS Meleager and the smaller ships HMS Ariadne, HMS Moselle and . Nelson's orders were to liaise with Austrian general Joseph Nikolaus De Vins for operations against French Army of Italy positions in Northwestern Italy, as well as patrol off Genoa and then to pass along the French coast to the west. At 16:00 on 7 July off Cape del Melle, Nelson's force discovered the French fleet. Martin had visited Genoa, where Ferdinand III the Grand Duke of Tuscany had recently signed peace terms with France, and then sent Mercure and Guerrier back to Toulon.Troude, p.434 On sighting Nelson, Martin recognised the small size of the British force and led his fleet in pursuit, Nelson retreating towards San Fiorenzo with Moselle trailing behind the rest of the squadron.Clowes, p.274 At 07:20 the following morning, Agamemnon began firing signal guns in the hope of alerting Hotham to the presence of the French, and at 09:30 the leading French ships saw the British fleet at anchor.James, p.267 Although the British were unprepared and vulnerable to attack, Martin immediately ordered his fleet to turn away to the west, towards Toulon. The winds were blowing from the west and both Martin and Hotham were hampered. The British fleet was in a state of unreadiness, and it was not until 21:00 that Hotham was able to lead 23 ships of the line, including Agamemnon and two allied Neapolitan ships, out of the bay in pursuit of the French, who had used the delay to escape to the north.Bennett, p.45 For four days Hotham searched for the French against the wind coming from the southwest. Late on 12 July, approximately east of √éle du Levant, the small frigate HMS Cyclops learned from passing vessels that the French had recently passed by to the south. Hotham gave the signal to \\"prepare for battle\\" and led his fleet to the southwest in the expectation of meeting the French. During the night a gale from the northwest caused damage to the sails of a number of ships, but at dawn on 13 July the French were seen just to leeward, scattered widely. At 03:45 Hotham gave orders to form his ships up and sailed to larboard in an effort to cut the French off from land. Martin used the time to organise his fleet and by 08:00 the French were sailing in line of battle back towards the √éles d'Hy√®res.Clowes, p.275 Battle Recognising that the French might now escape, Hotham gave orders for a general chase, allowing his fastest ships the opportunity to come up with the French to the best of their ability. By noon the French were ahead of the British to the northeast, with Hotham's fleet scattered across of sea.James, p.268 At 12:30 a wind shift from southwest to the north brought the French about so that the broadsides of the last three French ships could bear on the approaching British. The leading British ships, HMS Culloden, HMS Cumberland and HMS Victory all came under fire. The shift in wind favoured the British, allowing them to gain rapidly on the French. The British ships were soon able to return fire, targeting the slowest French ship, . Although Culloden was forced back after losing a topmast, Alcide was soon badly damaged and isolated. At 14:00, in danger of being overwhelmed, Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire struck his colours and surrendered his ship to Cumberland. Captain Bartholomew Rowley did not acknowledge the surrender, passing on to attack the next French ship in line, and the French frigates Alceste and Justice attempted to pass a tow rope to Alcide and drag it away from the British fleet.Clowes, p.276 The ship's boat carrying the rope was sunk by fire from Victory, and the frigates sheered off under heavy fire.James, p.269 An attempt by Aquilon to reach Alcide was abandoned when it became clear that the surrendered ship was on fire. By 14:42 more British ships, including Agamemnon, HMS Blenheim, HMS Captain and HMS Defence were now within long range and trading fire with the rearmost French ships G√©n√©reux, Berwick, Tyrannicide and Aquilon,Troude, p.435 with which Cumberland was now heavily engaged. Hotham then suddenly issued flag signals instructing his captains to discontinue the action and return to the flagship HMS Britannia. Hotham was at this point from the action and unable to see that his ships were poised to attack the main French fleet, concerned that his dispersed ships were vulnerable to the fire from the French fleet and shore batteries. Admiral Mann on Victory had to repeat the order twice before Rowley acknowledged and retired from combat. At this point the battling ships were approximately southeast of Cape Roux, towards which the French, having gained the weather gage by a shift in wind to the east were now sailing. Fire had taken hold on the surrendered Alcide in the foretop, probably due to the detonation of a grenade. By 14:15 it had spread out of control, sweeping the ship from end to end.James, p.271 The crew threw themselves into the sea to escape the flames and approximately 300 were collected by boats from the passing British ships, but at least 300 are believed to have been killed when the ship's magazines detonated at 15:45.Clowes, p.277 Captain Leblond Saint-Hylaire was among the dead. Aftermath Aside from the heavy loss of life on Alcide, French losses are not reported, although few other French ships were heavily engaged. British losses were mild, with 11 killed and 28 wounded across five ships. Cumberland, the most heavily engaged of the British fleet, suffered no casualties at all. Victory, Cumberland and Culloden had all been damaged in the sails and rigging, but none seriously. Martin led his surviving ships into the bay off Fr√©jus, anchoring there by 19:00. The French fleet was later able to return to Toulon along the coast without interference from Hotham, and remained in harbour until 14 September when orders from the National Convention arrived instructing Martin to send six ships of the line and three frigates back to the Atlantic fleet at Brest to replace losses incurred at the Battle of Groix in June. This force was commanded by Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery and on 7 October it encountered and attacked an escorted British convoy off Cape St. Vincent, capturing a ship of the line and 30 merchant ships.James, p.273 Hotham returned to San Fiorenzo and then to Leghorn. In August he briefly cruised off Toulon before retiring once more, although Nelson was detached with a squadron to operate against French Army movements on the Mediterranean Coast, attacking coastal positions near Alassio.Bennett, p.46 In September Hotham sent a detachment in pursuit of Richery, but this force was far too late to prevent the destruction of the convoy in October. Later in the year another French squadron was sent on a mission to Smyrna, escaped Toulon under Captain Honor√© Ganteaume, and caused severe damage to British merchant shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean.James, p.275 Hotham retired from his post at Leghorn on 1 November, passing command of the Mediterranean Fleet to Admiral Sir John Jervis.Mostert, p.173 Martin did not lead a fleet to sea again during the Mediterranean campaign, but in late 1796 French victories on land in Italy eliminated British allies from the war, making the maintenance of a fleet off Toulon impractical. The Mediterranean Fleet was forced to withdraw to the Tagus, ceding the Mediterranean theatre to France.Mostert, p.188 Hotham was heavily criticised at the time for his conduct during the battle, a series of delays and hesitations allowing the French to escape when they might easily have been destroyed. His second-in- command Samuel Goodall was said to have kicked his hat across the deck in fury at Hotham's order to withdraw.Rodger, p.434 Nelson wrote of the decision to withdraw that \\"In the forenoon we had every prospect of taking every Ship in the Fleet; and at noon it was almost certain we should have the six near ships.\\" He was critical of Martin too, writing \\"The French Admiral, I am sure, is not a wise man, nor an Officer: he was undetermined whether to fight or run away.\\"Bradford, p.118 Later historians have been scathing of Hotham's failure to bring Martin to action earlier and more vigorously; C. S. Forester wrote in reference to the sea battles of 1795 that \\"Once more a French fleet had got away through a lack of energy and diligence on the part of a British Admiral.\\"Forester, p.78 Historian Noel Mostert describes Hotham's indecision as \\"a disastrous failure\\" and links the missed opportunity to inflict a major defeat on the French directly to the British withdrawal from the Mediterranean the following year.Mostert, p.164 No major British naval force returned to the Mediterranean until the Mediterranean campaign of 1798.Mostert, p.245  References   Bibliography     * Category:Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Conflicts in 1795 Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Naval battles involving the Kingdom of Naples Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Battle ","title":"Battle of the Hy√®res Islands"},{"id":"45600036","text":"Tom Koƒçevar-De≈°man (born 10 July 1990) is a Slovenian tennis player.

Origins In 1951, a group of 14 African American women leaders issued \\"a call to Negro women to convene in Washington, D.C. for a Sojourn for Truth and Justice\\" to protest government attacks on sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author and editor W.

In less than two weeks, more than 132 women from 14 states responded to the call. * Louise Thompson Patterson was an American social activist throughout the Harlem Renaissance and college professor. * Shirley Graham Du Bois, was an American author, playwright, composer, and activist for African-American women. * Charlotta Bass, was an American educator, newspaper publisher-editor, and civil rights activist. The Sojourners for Truth and Justice held their inaugural meeting in Washington, D.C. from September 29 - October 1, 1951.

Although the Indian Ocean was separated by vast distance from the principal theatre of the conflict in Western Europe, it played a significant role due to the economic importance of the region to Great Britain, France's most constant opponent, of its colonies in India and the Far Eastern trade. Protection of British interests in the region fell primarily to the Royal Navy, supported by the military forces of the East India Company. Naval strategy sought to eliminate enemy forces in the region and provide convoy protection to the large East Indiamen merchant ships and smaller company ships which transported goods and wealth between Britain and its Asian colonies and trade partners. The French Navy maintained commerce raiding operations in the region throughout the war; particularly light frigate squadrons and privateers deployed in an effort to disrupt British trade, supported as the conflict developed by the allies the French accrued in the course of the war, particularly the Batavian Republic and Spain. At the declaration of war on Britain by the newly formed French Republic on 1 February 1793, British forces in the Indian Ocean held a considerably stronger military position, which was immediately utilised to seize the French territories in India. The remaining French forces continued operating from their base on the remote island of √éle de France, privateers in particular conducting a highly disruptive campaign against British commerce. Attempts by the Royal Navy, commanded by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, to limit their effectiveness resulted in a number of inconsequential clashes and a partial blockade of the French islands. In 1795 the declaration of war on Britain by the newly formed Batavian Republic led to successful invasions of the Batavian colonies of Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and operations against the Dutch East Indies. In 1796 British control of the region was challenged by a large and powerful French frigate squadron sent to the Indian Ocean under Contre-amiral Pierre C√©sar Charles de Sercey. Sercey's squadron operated against British trade for two years with little success; attempts to raid the China trade and coordinate with a Spanish Navy squadron at Manila in the Philippines all ending in failure. Growing resentment on √éle de France at the cost of maintaining the squadron eventually required most of the ships to return to France. The survivors, forced to operate independently, were subsequently defeated and captured by the Royal Navy in a series of individual engagements in 1799. By 1800 British control of the Indian Ocean was again assured, Rainier deploying his ships in trade protection duties and in the Red Sea to support the invasion of Egypt in 1801. At the end of the war in 1802 the Peace of Amiens reverted the situation in the region to its pre-war state, Britain returning all seized colonies except for Ceylon. Background On 1 February 1793, amid mounting tensions following the French Revolution of 1789, the recently formed French Republic, already at war with the Austrian Empire and Prussia, declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic.Chandler, p. 373. This act spread the French Revolutionary Wars beyond Europe to encompass the British, French and Dutch colonies in the Americas and the East Indies. Britain and France were already rivals in the East Indies, having fought campaigns in the Indian Ocean during both the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763) and the American War of Independence (1775‚Äì1783).Rodger, p. 275.Rodger, p. 357. More recently British and French naval forces had fought the Battle of Tellicherry in 1791 as part of the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a conflict between the East India Company (EIC), which controlled British mercantile interests in the East Indies, and the French-supported Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India.James, Vol. 1, p. 118. The battle was a French defeat, but it had little impact on either the war itself, which saw the EIC extract significant concessions from Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, or the worsening political climate in Europe.Chandler, p. 442. Britain, through the EIC, controlled large stretches of the Indian coast, including the three significant ports of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, when the war began. On the northern coast of the Bay of Bengal, Calcutta was a highly lucrative port but remote and lacking in naval facilities; Madras on the Coromandel Coast was an open harbour with little in the way of defences; while Bombay, on the western coast, was the point of communication with Europe and the strongest naval base in the region.Parkinson, p. 12. To the east, British merchants operated from the small harbours of Penang and Bencoolen, which linked directly to the great mercantile centre at Canton in Qing Dynasty China.Parkinson, p. 13. This linkage was the principal cause of British interest in the East Indies: the connection to and dominance of a lucrative network of intercontinental trade and exploration.Mostert, p. 98. France controlled a number of trading harbours along the Indian coast including Mah√© and Chandernagore, all governed from the larger port of Pondicherry. However, the strongest French position in the region was the isolated island of √éle de France, later known as Mauritius, with its subordinate bases of R√©union and small settlements on Madagascar in the Seychelles and on Rodrigues.Parkinson, p. 15. √éle de France, centred on the capital Port Louis, had important commercial agricultural features and an economy dominated by African slave labour. The islands were only commercially viable when left ungarrisoned, and if any troops had to be supported or the islands came under blockade there were corresponding economic difficulties and food shortages.Parkinson, p. 19. The island was most valuable as a naval base, situated in an ideal position for raiders to intercept British trade between Europe and the East Indies.Woodman, p. 49. The upheavals of the French Revolution had reached √éle de France, with accusations against senior officials leading to arrests in 1792. The arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery in August 1794 almost plunged the island into civil war, and only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented conflict.Parkinson, p. 72. The Dutch Empire held the Dutch Cape Colony, Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies. The latter, now Indonesia, was governed by the Dutch East India Company from the highly lucrative port of Batavia. Batavia was the centre of East Asian trade, reaching as far as Nagasaki in Edo period Japan, supported by other towns and ports including Sourabaya and Griessie.Parkinson, p. 30. The Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa was far less significant, acting principally as a resupply harbour with little commercial activity or penetration into the surrounding countryside.Parkinson, p. 34. The commercially significant harbours of Trincomalee and Colombo on the island of Ceylon were of strategic importance, but weakly garrisoned against attack.Parkinson, p. 35. These colonies were defended by a Dutch naval squadron, sent to the region in 1782 in the aftermath of the American War of Independence.Rodger, p. 364. The Spanish Philippines, somewhat distant to the other European colonies in the region, was a commercial backwater which survived through large subsidies from New Spain. The only significant towns were Manila and Cavite, the latter hosting a powerful Spanish naval squadron.Parkinson, p. 40. A Portuguese mercantile presence existed in the Indian port of Goa, which was a source of concern to the British as it represented a weak point in the defenses of British India.Parkinson, p. 36. Portugal also controlled the Chinese port of Macau and a number of trading posts on the East African coast in Portuguese Mozambique.Parkinson, p. 37. Other European nations, including Denmark and Sweden traded in the East Indies, as increasingly did American merchant ships.Parkinson, p. 44. The East Indies were very important to the British war effort due to their pivotal position in maintaining British revenue through trade. The EIC controlled the shipment of large quantities of valuable commodities from India, China and other Asian markets to Europe with their fleet of large and well-armed merchant ships, known as East Indiamen, supplemented by smaller local trading vessels known as \\"country ships\\".Gardiner, Victory of Seapower, p. 102. The EIC maintained a standing army in India and their own small fleet, designed for the protection of commerce. The EIC navy was supplemented by Royal Navy forces, which had been depleted of forces shortly before the outbreak of war; Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis had only the ship of the line at Madras,Gardiner, Fleet Battle and Blockade, p. 72. and the frigate at Calcutta.Parkinson, p. 60. French forces in the region also comprised two frigates, Cyb√®le and Prudente under Commodore Saint-F√©lix, supported by a squadron of smaller vessels and a large but disorganised force of privateers, with orders to operate against British commerce.James, Vol. 1, p. 196. Campaigns News of the French declaration of war arrived by ship in Calcutta, having traveled from George Baldwin, British ambassador in Alexandria, on 1 June 1793.James, Vol. 1, p. 119. Cornwallis immediately sailed to Pondicherry, instituting a blockade and seizing an ammunition supply ship entering the port.Parkinson, p. 61. Plans to eliminate the French presence in India had already been drawn up. The British and EIC forces, commanded on land by Colonel John Braithwaite, moved rapidly, seizing Chandernagore, Karaikal, Yanam and Mah√© without resistance. Pondicherry proved stronger, and Braithwaite was forced to besiege the city for 22 days until the French commander, Colonel Prosper de Clermont, agreed to surrender.James, Vol. 1, p. 120. Cornwallis's blockade was augmented by several large East Indiamen, proving sufficient as a deterrent to drive off the French frigate Cyb√®le and accompanying storeships which sought to resupply the garrison on 14 August.Parkinson, p. 62. Cyb√®le and Prudente fighting and , by Durand Brager With the French firmly driven from India, Cornwallis returned to European waters with Minerva. Protection of EIC shipping from French forces was left to a small number of light EIC warships. The trade route through the Sunda Strait proved particularly vulnerable; on 27 September 1793 a squadron of large privateers captured the East Indiaman . In January 1794 a well armed squadron of East Indiamen under Commodore Charles Mitchell were sent to patrol the Sunda Strait by the EIC. During the ensuing Sunda Strait campaign, privateers attacked the East Indiaman Pigot on 17 January before Mitchell defeated the largest privateers, Vengeur and R√©solu, on 22 January and fought an inconclusive engagement with Prudente and Cyb√®le under Captain Jean-Marie Renaud on 24 January. Renaud subsequently captured the Pigot, while she was under repairs at Fort Marlborough. In late February both French and EIC squadrons returned to the Indian Ocean. The Dutch frigate Amazone subsequently captured two French corvettes at Sourabaya.James, Vol. 1, p. 198. In the early spring of 1794, during a major campaign in the Atlantic, a British force led by Captain Peter Rainier in the 74-gun ship of the line , also including , , and , was sent to the Indian Ocean.Parkinson, p. 68. This force diverged en route, with Orpheus, Resistance and Centurion cruising off √éle de France in May.James, Vol. 1, p. 203. On 5 May this force encountered the captured Princess Royal, now armed as a warship and renamed Duguay-Trouin, and the brig Vulcain. Duguay-Trouin sailed poorly and was intercepted and captured by Orpheus after a short battle.Clowes, p. 484. The blockade of √éle de France was maintained during the year and on 22 October Renaud attempted to eliminate it, attacking Centurion and Diomede off √éle Ronde. The ensuing battle was hard- fought, with a particularly ferocious duel between Centurion and Cyb√®le, but ultimately the British squadron was forced to withdraw to India.James, Vol. 1, p. 212. =Batavian campaigns= Peter Rainier Rainier decided not to renew the blockade of √éle de France in 1794, concerned by false rumours that a French battle squadron was sailing to the East Indies.Parkinson, p. 77. In July 1795 news arrived in India which significantly changed the strategic situation: during the winter of 1794‚Äì1795 the French Army had overrun the Dutch Republic, reforming the country into an allied client state named the Batavian Republic.Chandler, p. 44. Control of the Dutch colonies, whose loyalty was uncertain, became Rainier's main priority due principally to their strategic positions along intercontinental trade routes, and he immediately organised operations to seize them.Rodger, p. 435. The largest force, with Rainier in personal command, descended on Trincomalee, while a smaller force under Captain Edward Pakenham in Resistance sailed for Malacca.James, Vol. 1, p. 302. Rainier hoped that the Dutch commanders would peacefully transfer control of their colonies to the British after provision of the Kew Letters from Stadtholder William of Orange.Parkinson, p. 79. However at Trincomalee the governor resisted and an invasion of Ceylon went ahead.Clowes, p. 282. After a short bombardment, Trincomalee capitulated on 26 August, although Diomede was wrecked during the landing operation. With the principal fort taken, the remaining Batavian towns on Ceylon surrendered peaceably over the following month, as did the Batavian trading port of Cochin in India.James, Vol. 1, p. 304. Pakenham's force was able to seize Malacca without resistance on 17 August 1795.Parkinson, p. 80. Batavian control of the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British shipping rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled by the arrival of a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered.Clowes, p. 281. A much-delayed Batavian expeditionary force, sent to retake control of the Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.James, Vol. 1, p. 373. =British consolidation= Elphinstone's arrival at the Cape officially placed him in overall command of the East Indies squadron, but the great distances involved meant that immediate operational control remained with Rainier.Parkinson, p. 82. In July 1795 Prudente and Cyb√®le sailed from √éle de France and attacked shipping in the Sunda Strait, seizing a number of merchant ships. When reports of this attack reached Rainier he took most of his squadron eastwards to the Dutch East Indies, leaving only Gardner's squadron to watch Colombo.Parkinson, p. 83. Elphinstone assumed command of the Western Indian Ocean, sending and to restore the blockade of √éle de France and taking , and sloops and to Madras, where he arrived on 15 January 1796.Parkinson, p. 84. In France, an operation to reinforce the Indian Ocean with a squadron of razee frigates or ships of the line under Contre-amiral Kerguelen had been planned in 1794 but repeatedly delayed due to lack of suitable ships and commitments elsewhere. In the summer of 1795 these plans were abandoned completely following losses at the Battle of Groix and French intervention in the East Indies was not attempted until the spring of 1796.James, Vol. 1, p. 347. The renewed blockade of √éle de France was lifted in December 1795, and Elphinstone deployed most of his forces in the continued blockade of Colombo. In February a small squadron under Captain Alan Gardner attacked city and secured the total surrender of the remaining Batavian garrison on the island.James, Vol. 1, p. 371. In March word arrived at Madras of the Batavian attempt to recapture the Cape Colony and Elphinstone returned westwards with Monarch, followed by Stately, Echo and Rattlesnake.Parkinson, p. 86. In the east, Rainier's force had some success, seizing the considerable clove stores at Amboyna on 16 February 1796 and the nutmeg and mace supplies of Banda Neira on 8 March.James, Vol. 1, p. 372. The value of these captures was significant: the captains involved each received ¬£15,000.Clowes, p. 294. However, these successes were offset by the complicated political position Rainier discovered in the Dutch East Indies; he spent the entirety of the remainder of the year diffusing or defeating a series of uprisings by local rajahs and did not return to India until February 1797.Parkinson, p. 95. Alarmed at the distance Elphinstone had been forced to travel to defend the Cape, the Admiralty separated command of the Cape and the East Indies in Spring 1796.Parkinson, p. 89. In October 1796, Elphinstone was recalled to Britain, sending a squadron comprising , , , and to again renew the blockade of √éle de France and and sent to augment Rainier's squadron, which had been damaged by a storm in the Bay of Bengal. On 2 December a detachment from the blockade squadron, led by Captain John William Spranger in with Braave and Sphynx attacked and destroyed the French port at Foul Point on Madagascar, seizing five French merchant ships.James, Vol. 1, p. 374. =Sercey's squadron= Pierre C√©sar Charles de Sercey Until 1796 there had been no reaction from the French Convention to the operations in the East Indies, and they were eventually inspired to reinforce the region not by British actions but by French ones. In 1795 orders had arrived at √éle de France formally abolishing slavery. The Colonial Assembly on the island, whose wealth relied on slave labour, simply ignored the order. The matter was taken up by the Committee of Public Safety, who ordered two agents, Baco and Burnel, to enforce the ruling.Parkinson, p. 97. These agents were escorted by a squadron of frigates sailing from Rochefort on 4 March under the command of √éle de France-born Contre-amiral Pierre C√©sar Charles de Sercey, comprising R√©g√©n√©r√©e, Cocarde, Forte and with corvettes and . On board were 800 soldiers and two companies of artillery under General . Sercey's voyage started badly, losing Cocarde to an accident on the French coast and Bonne Citoyenne and Mutine to British frigate patrols in the Bay of Biscay. Once out of European waters, however, his passage was unchallenged, watering at La Palma, where Vertu joined the squadron, and capturing the whaler Lord Hawkesbury in the South Atlantic. Baco and Burnel proved a bigger problem: at one stage the squabbling pair attempted to kill one another and had to be pulled apart by Sercey.Parkinson, p. 98. The squadron took a Portuguese Indiaman off Cape Agulhas on 24 May and the following day encountered and unsuccessfully pursued HMS Sphynx. On 3 June Sercey seized a British Indiaman and his squadron arrived at √éle de France unopposed on 18 June, the blockade squadron having departed the coast a few days earlier.James, Vol. 1, p. 348. The Colonial Assembly had been forewarned of the arrival of the government agents, possibly by Sercey, and they were met with armed troops. The agents demanded Magallon attack the colonial troops, but he refused to do so, and Baco and Burnel were forced onto the corvette Moineau. Moineau was instructed to take the agents to Manila, but once at sea they overruled the captain and ordered him to take them back to France.Parkinson, p. 100. Sercey refitted his squadron at √éle de France, dividing it into two forces. The largest, comprising Forte, Prudente, Seine, R√©g√©n√©r√©e, Vertu and Cyb√®le was to sail eastwards under his command. The second, comprising the recently arrived Preneuse and the corvette Br√ªle- Gueule was ordered westwards to operate in the Mozambique Channel. Sercey sailed on 14 July 1796, reaching Ceylon by 14 August. He was unaware at this stage that the ports of eastern India were undefended, Rainier's prolonged stay in the East Indies leaving no warships to protect Madras and Calcutta, and Sercey consequently sent the privateer Alerte to scout the Bay of Bengal. Alerte was subsequently captured by the British frigate , and documents detailing Sercey's strength found aboard. This information was used to surreptitiously supply Sercey with false information that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Madras. Dissuaded from further operations in the region, Sercey raided Tranquebar and then sailed for the East Indies.James, Vol. 1, p. 349. After attacking Banda Aceh, Sercey sought to raid the British trading post of George Town at Penang, but on 9 September his squadron was intercepted off northwest Sumatra by two British ships of the line, and , which had been hastily detached from commerce protection duties at Penang.Clowes, p. 503. The forces fought an inconclusive action after which both retired with damage, the British to Madras and Sercey to Batavia, where he remained until January 1797.James, Vol. 1, p. 353. On emerging from Batavia, Sercey cruised in the Java Sea in search of the annual EIC convoy from Macau. Rainier had escorted half of the convoy safely through the Straits of Malacca during his return to India, but the other half sailed unescorted through the Bali Strait, where Sercey ambushed it on 28 January.Woodman, p. 114. Captain Charles Lennox saved his convoy by disguising his ships as a Royal Navy squadron and making aggressive moves towards Sercey's ships, intimidating the French admiral into withdrawing without combat. Sercey subsequently returned to √éle de France, where he learned of his error.Parkinson, p. 106. =French dispersal= Sercey's campaign had ended in failure, with little disruption to British trade or naval operations in the East Indies. The East India Company had however taken more serious losses from the depredations of privateers. Most active was Robert Surcouf, whose small ship Emilie captured the timber ship Penguin off Pegu in October 1795 and country ships Russell, Sambolasse and Diana off the mouth of the Hooghly River in January 1796. More seriously, he also captured the pilot boat Cartier, which he used to seize the large East Indiaman Triton.Parkinson, p. 108. No French reinforcements reached the East Indies in 1797. A complex strategy had been developed to land an army in Ireland and then use the invasion fleet to attack India as a secondary objective.Clowes, p. 297. This ambitious plan collapsed completely during the failed Exp√©dition d'Irlande in December 1796 in which thousands of French troops were drowned.James, Vol. 2, p. 3. The strategic situation in Europe had however shifted once more during 1796 when France and Spain signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso, transferring Spain from an ally of Britain to an ally of France.Henderson, p. 104. British attention in the East Indies therefore shifted from the French island territories to the Spanish Philippines, where the defence squadron had been badly damaged in a hurricane in April 1797 and was in dock for extensive repairs. British forces were once again in the ascendant, Rainier commanding five ships of the line, one fourth rate ship and six frigates.Parkinson, p. 112. Extensive plans were developed by Rainier in conjunction with Sir John Shore, Governor-General of India, and Colonel Arthur Wellesley for a major attack on Manila, to be led by Sir James Craig.Parkinson, p. 117. The Treaty of Campo Formio and the consequent end of the War of the First Coalition in Europe caused the cancellation of these plans; Britain now fought France and its allies alone and fears were raised that the Tipu Sultan of Mysore might once again attack British colonies in India.Parkinson, p. 119. To ensure the safety of the 1798 China Fleet from Spanish attack, in July 1797 Rainier deployed Centurion, and to escort a convoy of East Indiamen to Macau. After seeing his charges into harbour in December, Captain Edward Cooke investigated Manila himself in Sybille, accompanied by Fox. There he discovered the weak state of the Spanish squadron.Parkinson, p. 137. Other British ships were operating in the East Indies: in July 1797, Resistance and a force of EIC troops captured Kupang on Timor but were subsequently driven off by an armed uprising by the Malay citizens of the town. In the street fighting 13 British troops and 300 Malays were killed.Parkinson, p. 136. Resistance was subsequently lost on 24 July 1798, accidentally destroyed with more than 300 of its crew in an unexplained ammunition explosion in the Banca Strait. There were originally twelve survivors, but eight died of their injuries and the remaining sailors were captured by Sumatran pirates and sold into slavery. Mahmud Shah III, Sultan of Johor later released them, although only one, named Thomas Scott, was confirmed to have survived.Grocott, p. 59. Maintenance of the blockade of √éle de France was the responsibility of the substantial British squadron at the Cape Colony, which had suffered severely from unrest inspired by the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. The crews of and rose up and deposed their officers, but found the guns of Cape Town trained on their ships, Governor Lord Macartney threatening them with destruction. Intimidated the seamen surrendered, the incident followed by floggings and executions.Mostert, p. 213. Despite this paralysis, Sercey's squadron was in no position to contest control of the Indian Ocean: supplies and manpower were severely limited and the Colonial Committee, still resentful following the incident with the agents in 1796, was reluctant to offer support.Parkinson, p. 120. Sercey's only operations were limited cruises in the Seychelles and the supply of 300 reinforcements to Batavia during the summer of 1797, while Cyb√®le was sent back to France in the spring of 1797 and Vertu, R√©g√©ner√©e and Seine followed in early 1798. Vertu and R√©g√©ner√©e passed undetected into the Atlantic until they halted at the √éles de Los on 24 April. There they were discovered by the 32-gun frigate under Captain Samuel James Ballard. Sailing to investigate Ballard came under fire from the French ships and was forced to pass between them, firing broadsides in each direction as he did so. Chased by R√©g√©ner√©e, Pearl withdrew to Sierra Leone with damaged rigging and one man killed.James, Vol. 2, p. 219. Seine was also intercepted, by a squadron of frigates from the Brest blockade near the Penmarks. Fleeing south, the ship battled its pursuers in the Action of 30 June 1798, which ended with Seine and the British frigates and all ashore near La Rochelle. Jason and the captured Seine were refloated, but Pique was destroyed.Clowes, p. 511. =Red Sea and Mysore= In July 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte led a French expeditionary force across the Mediterranean to invade Egypt, then part of the Ottoman Empire. Initial landings were successful and the Battle of the Pyramids confirmed Bonaparte's control of the country.Chandler, p. 350. On 1 August however his fleet was destroyed by a British force under Sir Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August, isolating the French army in Egypt.Chandler, p. 315. The Admiralty initiated a major response, including dispatching a squadron under Commodore John Blankett to blockade the Egyptian Red Sea coast: there was concern in London that Bonaparte might proceed to attack India from Egypt, in conjunction with the Tipu Sultan and the armies of Mysore.Rodger, p. 460. Blankett's force arrived in December 1798, joined by a squadron sent by Rainier. Bonaparte had visited Suez early in the month, and plans had been drawn up for a small French Red Sea squadron, but Blankett's force and the regional supremacy it brought rendered these plans obsolete.Parkinson, p. 149. Attacks were made on commercial shipping at Suez in April,Clowes, p. 405. and the entrance to the Red Sea was effectively blockaded by British occupation of Perim and Mocha, and in July 1799 Blankett ordered the frigates and Fox to destroy the French- held castle at Qusayr. The town was heavily bombarded, although attempts to make amphibious landings were driven off.Clowes, p. 406. British attention elsewhere in the theatre was focused on Southern India. In January 1798, a French privateer brought envoys from Mysore to √éle de France with a request for support. Malartic supplied 86 volunteers, which were sent to India on Preneuse under Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte.Parkinson, p. 121. Lhermitte's mission was meant to be covert, but in April 1798 he attacked and captured two East Indiamen, and , at Tellicherry,Grocott, p. 57. and landed the volunteers at Mangalore on 24 April. This action caused a crisis in relations between the EIC and Mysore, which Tipu Sultan's obvious enthusiasm for French intervention in India inflamed. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War began in February 1799 when two British armies crossed into Mysorean territory. Forced back to his capital Seringapatam, the Tipu Sultan held out against a siege for several weeks until the city was taken by storm, with Tipu Sultan being killed during the ensuing street-fighting. =British dominance= Capture of La Forte, Feb 28th 1799, Thomas Whitcombe, 1816, National Maritime Museum During the summer of 1798, Forte and Prudente conducted a commerce raiding operation under Captain Ravanel in the Bay of Bengal and the Bali Strait which achieved moderate success but also saw the first of a number of mutinies among Sercey's crews.Parkinson, p. 123. The French admiral then planned a joint operation with the Spanish squadron at Manila, sailing to Batavia in Br√ªle-Gueule, to be joined by Preneuse. He had ordered Ravanel to join his force there, but the French captain instead returned to Port Louis where Prudente was seized by the Malartic and sold as a privateer and Forte sent on a commerce raid in the Bay of Bengal in defiance of Sercey's orders. Prudente was captured by Daedalus at the Action of 9 February 1799 off the coast of Natal, while Forte was captured by Sybille off the mouth of the Hooghly River at the Action of 28 February 1799.Clowes, p. 520. Sercey's fury at the seizure of his strongest frigates was compounded by the condition of Preneuse, which arrived at Batavia in a state of mutiny. Lhermitte had executed five crew on the journey and Sercey immediately sent the ship out again on a cruise off Borneo in an effort to contain the disaffection.Parkinson, p. 124. With his forces unexpectedly reduced, Sercey then sent his remaining ships to Manila for operations with the Spanish, but the condition of the Spanish ships was so poor that no operations could be undertaken in 1798. An attack on the China Fleet was eventually attempted in January 1799, but on arrival at Macau the combined Spanish squadron refused to engage the powerful British escort and the entire force withdrew, pursued by Captain William Hargood in .Gardiner, Nelson Against Napoleon, p. 160. Combat de la Confiance, command√©e par Robert Surcouf, et du Kent. Ambroise Louis Garneray Disappointed by the failure off Macau and weakened by losses to his squadron, Sercey withdrew to √éle de France in the spring of 1799. There he sent Preneuse on a raiding cruise in the Mozambique Channel. On 20 September, Lhermitte fought a brief and inconclusive night engagement with a small squadron of Royal Navy ships in Algoa Bay, which led three weeks later to an inconclusive clash on 9 October with the 50-gun .James, Vol. 2, p. 346. Returning to √éle de France with little to show for his three-month cruise, Lhermitte was intercepted off Port Louis by the blockade squadron of Adamant and at the Action of 11 December 1799 and Preneuse was driven onshore and destroyed.Clowes, p. 524. Sercey had already sent Br√ªle-Gueule back to France at the end of September with political prisoners from √éle de France and more than a million in specie, the corvette eventually being wrecked with the loss of 132 lives on the Pointe du Raz on the Breton coast.Parkinson, p. 130.Grocott, p. 89. Sercey, an admiral without a command, returned to France and retired from the Navy. He subsequently settled on √éle de France.Parkinson, p. 131. As the French naval presence in the Indian Ocean declined, the commerce raiding role was taken up by privateers. These fast vessels operated with considerable success against British merchant shipping, and protecting convoys from their depredations consumed a considerable proportion of Rainier's naval strength: gradually however they were intercepted and captured, including Adele in May 1800 and L'Uni in August 1800.Parkinson, p. 159. Among the more notorious privateers was Iphigenie, which seized a packet ship, Pearl, in the Persian Gulf in October 1799. Pursued by the sloop , the two fought a fierce engagement on 12 October at which both ships were destroyed and more than 200 men killed.James, Vol. 2, p. 355. Most dangerous among the privateersmen was Robert Surcouf, who sailed in Clarissa and then Confiance. In the latter he fought a significant battle off the Hooghly River on 9 October 1800 with the East Indiaman Kent.Woodman, p. 128. Eventually subdued by a boarding action, Kent lost 14 killed, including Captain Robert Rivington, and 44 wounded; Surcouf's men suffered 14 casualties.James, Vol. 3, p. 53.Grocott, p. 96. The privateer conflict continued to the end of the war, the large privateers Grand Hirondelle and Gloire remaining at sea into 1801 before being captured, and Courier and Surcouf's Confiance evading interception entirely. =Final Actions= Rainier's main priorities remained the protection of trade, but his command came under increasing interference from London, in particular the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas. Dundas was insistent throughout 1799 and 1800 that the priority for Rainier should be the invasion and capture of Java, thus eliminating the Dutch East Indies entirely. Contradictory orders came from Lord Mornington, who was instructing Rainier to plan an invasion of √éle de France, while Rainier himself wished to resurrect the abandoned operation against Manila.Parkinson, p. 158. So confused was the command structure that in September 1800 Rainier threatened to resign,Parkinson, p. 165. but in October 1800 a renewed threat from Egypt redirected the focus of his squadron to the Red Sea and only a handful of minor operations against Dutch posts on Java were carried out by a small force under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, capturing a few merchant ships but losing more than 200 men to disease in the process.Parkinson, p. 171. At the Cape of Good Hope, a gale on 5 December 1799 caused severe damage to shipping in Table Bay: among the wrecks were HMS Sceptre with 290 crew, the Danish ship of the line Oldenburg and several large American merchant ships.Grocott, p. 87. The Red Sea campaign of 1801 was intended to complement the British invasion of French-held Egypt from the Mediterranean, which went ahead in March 1801. Initial operations were trusted to Blankett at Jeddah, who was in poor health and struggling to negotiate with Ghalib Efendi bin Musa'ed, Sharif of Mecca. These problems were compounded when Forte was wrecked entering the port.Parkinson, p. 174. Blankett's forces landed unopposed at Suez on 22 March, the French having withdrawn their forces in Southern Egypt to oppose the Mediterranean landings. His mission complete, Blankett withdrew in June after sending 300 soldiers to join the conflict in Northern Egypt, and met with a large reinforcement squadron under Captain Sir Home Popham off Qusayr.Parkinson, p. 179. An army under General David Baird then took passage up the Nile, but did not arrive before the campaign ended with the Capitulation of Alexandria in August.Gardiner, Nelson Against Napoleon, p. 163. The French Navy played little part in opposing the British campaign in Egypt, but a frigate was sent to the Indian Ocean to interfere with the supply lines to the Red Sea. This ship, Chiffone was based at Mah√© in the Seychelles.Woodman, p. 151. The voyage had been eventful, Chiffone seizing a Brazilian frigate Andhorina in the Atlantic and the East Indiaman Bellona, as well as conveying 32 political prisoners sentenced to exile in the Indian Ocean. At the Battle of Mah√© on 19 August however, Chiffone was discovered at anchor by Sybille and captured.Gardiner, Nelson Against Napoleon, p. 168. The final operations in the Indian Ocean saw British forces consolidate further, landing troops at the Portuguese colonies in the region to prevent the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Badajoz, under which Portugal agreed to exclude British shipping from its ports, while the EIC attacked and captured the Dutch island of Ternate.James, Vol. 3, p. 160. Aftermath The Peace of Amiens came into effect on 1 October 1801, bringing the French Revolutionary Wars to an end.Chandler, p. 10. Confirmation of this armistice did not reach India until 1 February 1802, but it had been widely expected and neither side had undertaken significant naval operations during the interim. The terms of the treaty returned all territory captured by British forces in the East Indies to its original masters with the noted exception of Ceylon, which was officially named a British Crown Colony.Parkinson, p. 181. No one in the Indian Ocean believed that the Peace would last, each side building substantial forces in the region. As historian William James noted, \\"who then could doubt that, although the wax on the seals of the treaty concluding the last had scarcely cooled, a new war was on the eve of bursting forth?\\".James, Vol. 3, p. 162. The peace was short lived, the Napoleonic Wars erupting in May 1803, by which time Emperor Napoleon had sent substantial reinforcements to √éle de France and the other French territories in the East Indies.Woodman, p. 172. Although the campaign had personally benefited Rainier by around ¬£300,000 (the equivalent of ¬£ as of 2015),Rodger, p. 523. historian C. Northcote Parkinson wrote that \\"It cannot be said that the naval war in the Indian Ocean from 1794 to 1801 had been a brilliant success\\" for either side. The lack of French reinforcements and Sercey's ineffectiveness counterbalanced by confused British leadership and scattered priorities, with aborted operations against Manila and Batavia and a marginal campaign in the Red Sea consuming inordinate amounts of time and energy.

The song was subsequently played solo by Ant at a 1987 fan convention and as a duet with Will Crewdson on a 2010 internet radio session.

History =Formation and debut album= Great Cynics initially started out as a solo project for Brighton based singer-songwriter Giles Bidder under the name Cynics. After relocating to London in 2010 and supporting Against Me! and Paint It Black across several UK dates, Bidder decided that his songs would work better with a full band behind him and teamed up with drummer Bob Barrett. Bidder and Barrett then headed into the studio to record what would become Don't Need Much with producer Peter Miles handling bass duties. Iona Cairns joined the band just before their first tour. Shortly before the album's release, the band were forced to rename themselves after American garage rock revival band The Cynics threatened legal action, and they subsequently became Great Cynics. In June 2011, Great Cynics debut album Don't Need Much was released to positive acclaim. Following the success of Don't Need Much, the band released the In the Valley EP in late February 2012. =Like I Belong and I Feel Weird= Great Cynics released their second full- length album Like I Belong in April 2013. After the release of Like I Belong Great Cynics embarked on several national and international tours alongside the likes of Broadway Calls, We Are The Ocean, Joyce Manor, Cheap Girls, Apologies, I Have None, The Smith Street Band and Gnarwolves. Over the 2013 August Bank Holiday weekend, Great Cynics opened the Lock Up Stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In late 2014 the band announced plans for their third album that would be released in 2015. In February 2015 it was announced that the album, titled I Feel Weird, would be released through Specialist Subject Records in April 2015, with Lost In You being the lead single.

Biography  Beloff was born and brought up in London, and was from a Russian Jewish family. His parents were Semion (Simon) Beloff (born Semion Rubinowicz) and Maria (Marie) Katzin. He was the brother of the historian Max Beloff, the politician and educationalist Renee Soskin, the biochemist Anne Beloff-Chain, and the journalist Nora Beloff. He served in the British Army in the Second World War. He worked in an architect's office, then studied at London University, where he graduated in 1952. Shortly after graduation he married Halla Parker, a fellow student of psychology who was ten years younger. Together, they spent a year at the University of Illinois, and then enrolled to a doctorate program at Queen's University Belfast, defending their PhDs in 1956. In 1962 they both were offered jobs at the same department of University of Edinburgh and worked there until retirement.Autobiography. newdualism.org John and Halla had a daughter Zoe, who became an international artist.Biography. zoebeloff.com Beloff had been interested in parapsychology from an early age and served as president of the Society for Psychical Research from 1974-1976. He was an executor of Arthur Koestler's will in 1983 and was instrumental in setting up the first UK chair of parapsychology, the Koestler Parapsychology Unit at Edinburgh in 1985. Reception Beloff's belief in paranormal powers and parapsychological statements were heavily criticized by psychologist Nicholas Humphrey for being based on wishful thinking.Humphrey, Nicholas. (1995). Soul Searching: Human Nature and Supernatural Belief. Chatto & Windus. pp. 68-234. Science writer Martin Gardner dismissed Beloff as credulous and willing to believe. Beloff had endorsed some fraudulent mediums such as Helen Duncan. Gardner quoted Beloff as admitting \\"my own ignorance of conjuring techniques may have misled me\\", but Gardner noted despite this, he still went on believing. Beloff had endorsed levitations, psychic surgery, the \\"thoughtographs\\" of Ted Serios and various spiritualist mediums as genuine evidence for the paranormal.Gardner, Martin. (1992).

Kerr. She is the namesake for the Albertina Kerr Centers in Portland, Oregon, United States, which historically provided care for orphaned children, as well as daycare services for single mothers. Biography Albertina Sechtem was born in Portland to Louis and Christina Sechtem. Louis, who owned The Quelle Restaurant on Southwest Second Avenue and Stark Street, was from Germany, and Christina was from Sweden. Known to her family as \\"Tina\\", Albertina attended Couch Elementary School and Lincoln High School. Louis Sechtem died in 1894, so Albertina and her siblings went to work to support the family while in high school or shortly after. She dropped out of high school and went to work at the Kerr Glass Company at Northwest Fourth Avenue and Hoyt Street, where she met owner Alexander Kerr. In what was a scandal at the time, Kerr divorced his wife to marry Sechtem, who was 28 years his junior; an Oregonian front-page headline of the time declared: \\"Rich merchant divorces wife!\\" Sechtem and Kerr were wed on September 29, 1910. Albertina moved into Alexander's house at 129 14th Street, and their son John was born in June 1911. Shortly after John was born, the Kerrs traveled to Camp Rilea on the Oregon Coast and Long Beach, Washington, and Albertina contracted typhoid fever while on the trip, probably from one of the beach areas. She died on October 17, 1911. Her deathbed wish to her husband was: \\"Look after other motherless babies, too.\\" Legacy Alexander donated their home to the Pacific Coast Rescue Society for use as a home for orphans. The home, which provided adoption services and daycare for the children of single mothers, opened in 1913 and quickly became too small; Alexander and his third wife, Ruth, raised money for a larger building at Northeast 22nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard that opened in 1921 as the Albertina Kerr Nursery. The nursery operated until 1967, when the organization changed to a foster care approach. The original building on Sandy Boulevard was reopened in 1981 as Albertina's Restaurant and Shops. One of the restaurant's signature dishes is a cheesecake served in a 4-ounce Kerr canning jar. Today the Albertina Kerr Centers help people with developmental disabilities‚Äìa role the organization took on in the 1980s after the State of Oregon began to make plans to close the Fairview Training Center‚Äìand people with behavioral health needs.

R. Martin and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. Introduced in A Storm of Swords (2000), Daario is the leader of a mercenary group from the continent of Essos called the Stormcrows. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Dance with Dragons (2011). Daario was portrayed by the English actor Ed Skrein and then by the Dutch actor Michiel Huisman in the HBO television adaptation.  Character description  Daario is a confident and seductive warrior, and the commander of the Stormcrows, a company of sellswords comprising 500 mounted mercenaries. He is an efficient killer, bloody and ruthless, although entirely devoted to Daenerys Targaryen. Nothing has been revealed of Daario's background in the books, save for his Tyroshi heritage.  Overview  Daario Naharis is not a point of view character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, especially Daenerys Targaryen. Daario is mostly a background character in the novels.  Storylines  Coat of arms of House Targaryen =In the books= A Storm of Swords The Stormcrows are hired by Yunkai to defend the city against Daenerys Targaryen's forces. Daenerys offers the Stormcrows gold if they defect to her. While the Stormcrows deliberate this offer, Daario (having been won over by Daenerys) kills the Stormcrows' captains and pledges the company's support to Daenerys. The Stormcrows aid Daenerys in her subsequent conquests of Yunkai and Meereen. A Dance with Dragons Following Daenerys' conquest of Meereen, she sends Daario to Lhazar to reopen trade routes between the two regions. After his return, Daenerys takes Daario as a lover but marries the Meereenese nobleman Hizdahr zo Loraq. With Yunkai besieging Meereen, Daenerys offers an exchange of hostages between the two camps to ensure peace, and Daario is amongst those given to Yunkai. However, Daenerys flies away on Drogon, and the Yunkai'i refuse to release Daario until Daenerys' other two dragons are executed. =In the show= Ed Skrein as Daario Naharis in season 3 The television series develops the backstory that Daario's alcoholic mother sold him to the fighting pits when he was a young boy. Daario was trained as a pit fighter and performed so well that he was released from slavery when his master died. After winning his freedom, Daario joined the Second Sons sellsword company. Season 3 Under the leadership of Captain Mero and second in command Prendhal na Ghezn, the Second Sons are hired by the slaver city Yunkai to fight against Daenerys' army. Smitten with Daenerys, Daario refuses to obey his superiors when they decide to assassinate her; he instead kills them and presents their severed heads to Daenerys. With the Second Sons under his command, Daario and his men pledge their allegiance to Daenerys. He then assists Jorah Mormont and Grey Worm in opening the gates of Yunkai, allowing Daenerys' forces to conquer the city. Season 4 On the march to the neighbouring slaving city of Meereen, Daario unsuccessfully attempts to romance Daenerys. At the gates of Meereen, Daario volunteers to fight Meereen's champion in single combat and swiftly kills him before taunting the Meereenese by urinating in front of the city. After Daenerys conquers the city, Daario persuades her to take him as her lover. When Yunkai begins to rebel against Daenerys' rule, Daenerys sends Daario and the Meereenese nobleman Hizdahr zo Loraq to negotiate with the city's masters. Season 5 Daario and Hizdahr are successful in their negotiations with the Yunkish, although the Yunkish insist as part of the agreement upon reopening the city's fighting pits. Daenerys initially refuses, despite Daario's pointing out that his youth as a pit fighter gave him the skills necessary to join the Second Sons and meet her. Daenerys changes her mind after the Meereenese insurgents, the Sons of the Harpy, kill her advisor Ser Barristan Selmy. She takes Hizdahr as her husband but keeps Daario as her consort. After Daenerys flies off on her dragon Drogon during an attack by the Sons at the opening of the fighting pits, Daario and Jorah decide to leave Meereen to find her. Tyrion Lannister tries to join them, but Daario points out Tyrion is better suited to govern Meereen in Daenerys' absence. Season 6 Jorah and Daario discover that Daenerys has been captured by the Dothraki, and follow her to the sacred Dothraki city of Vaes Dothrak. They infiltrate the city and meet Daenerys, but she points out that they will be unable to escape the 100,000 Dothraki in the city. Daenerys instead sets fire to the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, killing the khals but emerges unscathed. Amazed, the Dothraki bow down to Daenerys, and Daario follows suit. While Jorah leaves to find a cure for his greyscale, Daenerys and Daario march on Meereen with the Dothraki. Daenerys flies ahead on Drogon, and Daario arrives at the gates of Meereen. There, he finds the Sons of the Harpy massacring freedmen and leads the Dothraki charge to kill the Sons. With slavery finally abolished in Slaver's Bay, Daenerys decides to return to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. However, she insists that Daario and the Second Sons remain to keep the peace. Daario is dismayed and declares his love for Daenerys, but ultimately agrees, realizing that Tyrion advised her to end their relationship.  TV adaptation  In his first three appearances in season 3 of the television adaptation of the books, Daario Naharis is portrayed by the English actor Ed Skrein. Throughout the remainder of the series, he is portrayed by the Dutch actor Michiel Huisman. The reason for the change of actor was initially said to be because Skrein took on a role in the film The Transporter Refueled. However Skrein subsequently stated that the change was due to \\"politics\\".

She primarily works collaboratively and collectively and was a founding member of Trade School, OurGoods, BFAMFAPhD and the New York City Real Estate Investment Cooperative. Woolard is currently an Assistant Professor of Sculpture at the University of Hartford and a mentor at the School of Visual Arts. Education Woolard earned a BFA in 2006 from Cooper Union, at the time a tuition-free art school in New York. Career and work Woolard's work explores solidarity economics, collaboration, barter, labor, and other forms of monetary and non-monetary exchange. She makes sculptural objects that facilitate communication and also co-creates systems of sharing and exchange. Woolard says that she became involved with social practice art not because she was against commercial or institutional art, but instead because she believes the art world is too isolated. Woolard hopes to promote interdependence between artists. Our Goods (founded in 2008) is an online platform for resource sharing within the creative community. OurGoods received numerous awards, including support from the Rockefeller Cultural innovation Fund (2012-2014), the Economic Revitalization for Performing Arts grant from The Field (2009-2012), and a prominent space in Creative Time‚Äôs exhibition, Living as Form (2011). In 2016 the independent platform shut down and moved on to Facebook. Trade School (founded in 2009) is an online platform that allows people to propose and sign up for classes which are paid for using barter. Trade School chapters popped up in over 50 cities internationally. Woolard feels that broadening art classes to those who would not traditionally be able to afford them will expand the world of art for the better. As of 2018 there are 26 schools still linked on the website. What is a Work of Art in the Age of $120,000 Art Degrees? from Statements by Caroline Woolard (2014) BFAMFAPhD (a mashed together acronym of BFA, MFA and PhD, founded 2014) is a research and advocacy project that uses US Census data to illuminate the ever-rising cost of getting a college art degree and its dubious relevance to the ability to make a living as an artist. In addition to these economic concerns, Woolard and the other collaborators highlight problems of ethnic, racial and gender diversity in the art world. The New York City Real Estate Investment Cooperative (founded 2015 with lawyer/organizer Paula Segal and others) aims to collectively buy and maintain permanently affordable space in New York for civic, cultural, and cooperative use. Other works of art that Woolard has created are public seating, urban campsites and swings for subways. In 2009, Woolard curated a \\"newspaper exhibition\\" which highlighted the many economic issues facing workers in the arts.

Cuningham modeled for and had relationships with fellow artists Bernard Meninsky and Matthew Smith. She lived and exhibited her works in London and Paris, where she fled with Smith at the beginning of their affair. Some of her works are in public collections in England. Early life and education Vera Irene Walpole Martin Cuningham was born in 1897 at Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire to Scottish parents. Cuningham attended Central School of Arts and Crafts, where she studied painting. In 1922, she began exhibiting her work with The London Group and became a member of the organization in 1927. Early career and love interests Cuningham modeled for and was in a relationship with Bernard Meninsky when she met Matthew Smith in 1922 or 1923. At the time, Smith was married to Gwen Salmond, but Cuningham and Matthew Smith left their partners and moved to Paris, where they lived at 6 bis Villa Brune. The British Museum states that they both exhibited in 1922 at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants and at the Amis de Montparnasse. Smith's paintings of her between 1923 and 1926 include Vera Cuningham, Head and Shoulders, Vera Cuningham in a Chair, Vera Reclining in a Pink Slip, and Vera in a Yellow Dress, all of which are in the Corporation of London Collection. The paintings of her generally fill the canvas, emphasizing her voluptuous figure. Malcolm Yorke described her in his book as \\"a guffawing, red-haired, rosy-cheeked, plump-bodied, highly sexed young woman who was determined to become a professional artist.\\" Her demeanor may have been in opposition to her family background. For instance, her mother had connections with aristocrats. She had given much of her time to modeling for Smith, but became singularly focused on her own paintings in 1925 and soon after their relationship ended. Career In 1929, she had her first solo exhibition at the Bloomsbury Gallery. She was with Smith in Woolhope, near Hereford, in 1932. In the late 1930s, Cuningham produced several theatre designs. She participated in Colling Galleries Civil Defence Artists' shows during World War II. Exhibitions were held in 1948, 1951, and 1954 by Raymond Creuze, her Paris dealer. She lived in Hampstead, London, and at the time of her death on 3 May 1955 she lived at Logs Cottage on Well Road. She had never married, but it has been reported that Cuningham died in the arms of Matthew Smith. A retrospective of her work was held in 1985 by the Barbican Art Gallery.

Much of his service in Arizona was spent as Acting Governor due to Governor John C. Fr√©mont's virtual abandonment of his post. Biography Gosper was born in the vicinity of Mount Vernon, Knox Co., Ohio to Adelia Freer and Nathan P. Gosper on April 8, 1842. The family moved to a farm close to Geneva, Illinois in 1845 and Gosper's father died in 1850. From the age of eleven to eighteen he was apprenticed to a local farmer, leaving his employer early due to poor treatment. With the coming of the American Civil War, Gosper enlisted in the 8th Illinois Cavalry and served in around 30 engagements during the next two years. Following his enlistment, Gosper was commissioned as quartermaster of the 29th Regiment, United States Colored Infantry. In his new role, Gosper served during the Siege of Petersburg. He was wounded on December 4, 1864 and lost his left leg. Gosper was hospitalized until March 1865 and was discharged from the military two months later. When he was 25, Gosper married Waitie E. Polley Graham, a widow with a 12-year-old son. During the war she had served as a nurse for the Union Army. After his discharge, Gosper returned to Illinois briefly before enrolling at Eastman Business College. Upon completing his education, he returned to Geneva where he farmed and raised hogs. In 1870, Gosper moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. There he became a member of the city council, rising to president of the council in 1872. From January 13, 1873 to January 11, 1875, Gosper was the Secretary of State of Nebraska. Gosper visited Arizona Territory in 1876. When the territorial secretary position became available the next year, he applied for the position. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Gosper to become Secretary of Arizona Territory on April 13, 1877. He took his oath of office in Yuma, Arizona Territory on May 24. He then proceeded on to Tucson, arriving there on May 30 only to learn the capital had been moved to Prescott. He was granted a divorce by the 10th Arizona Territorial Legislature which February 7, 1879. Sent a letter to President Garfield on March 17, 1881 asking to be appointed Governor of Arizona Territory. This request likened the appointment to a \\"civil service\\" promotion and dropped the names of former President Grant and others who would recognize his name from his service during the civil war. In report to the Secretary of Interior submitted on October 6, 1881, Gosper requested Governor Fr√©mont be required to either return to the territory or resign. \\"recommending either to you or to Congress that the regularly appointed governor of this territory be required to return to his post of duty, or be asked to step aside and permit some other gentleman to take his place and feel at liberty to act without restraint.\\" He recommended the problem of dealing with hostile Indians be transferred entirely to the War Department. He felt that some Indian agents aggravated the problems with the Indians through dishonesty and that Army officers would be more likely to act as honest brokers than individuals with short-term contracts. His second marriage was to Sarah Louise Watson in 1881. He requested Arizona Territory be granted a fourth judicial district, arguing that the then current three districts were too large and that the growing population justified an additional district. When Chester A. Arthur became President, Gosper wrote him requesting appointment as Governor, mentioning the loss of his leg during the war and the fact that he had served as Acting Governor for roughly 75% of the five years he had held the position of Territorial Secretary. He did not receive the desired appointment following Fr√©mont's resignation but instead saw his position given to H.M. Van Arman. Gosper served as territorial secretary under Governors Hoyt and Fr√©mont. Gosper County, Nebraska is named in his honor. Gosper died on May 14, 1913. After learning the former territorial secretary had died in poverty, the Arizona State Legislature passed a $200 appropriation to help defer Gosper's funeral expenses.

It is named after the 20th-century New Zealand painter Olivia Spencer Bower. About the residency The Olivia Spencer Bower Award was established in 1987. Art critic John Daly-Peoples notes that it was Spencer Bower's intention to \\"provide talented artists an opportunity to work for one year, free to pursue their own direction without the need to seek outside employment.\\" The award was initially intended to support women artists only. Final details for the charitable foundation were only finalised five days before the artist died in early July 1982. Bower left all her art works to the foundation, and these have been gradually realised by the trustees to form the capital which entirely funds the award. The award is directed at emerging painters and sculptors and bypasses well-known and established practitioners who may have already received recognition. While the initial instigation for the foundation was perceived inequity between male and female artists the award is open to both men and women artists. Selection is made by a committee which must include at least half females. Art critic Warren Feeney writes of the award: > Set up by a practising artist as an award for other practising artists its > success can be measured in the number of recipients who continue to maintain > a substantial presence in the arts. S√©raphine Pick, Jim Speers and Kristy > Gorman are only three of a very long list. Indeed, rather than her legacy as > a painter, the Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation Award has become the vehicle > by which the artist is now best-known. The residency is based in Christchurch, though it is open to artists from around the country. The recipient receives a stipend for the year ‚Äî currently around $NZ30,000 ‚Äî and a studio in Christchurch for the year of the residency. Up until 2011, this studio was within the complex of the Christchurch Arts Centre, but since the arts centre was damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch Earthquake other studio space has been found around the city.\\"Award terms\\", Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation.

Linguistic studies  As a linguist, Militarev is particularly known for his novel and disputable genealogical classification of the said linguistic entities relying on lexicostatistics; for the chronology of their branching relying on Sergei Starostin‚Äôs method in glottochronology; and for his endeavor to build up a comprehensive picture of the West Asian Early Neolithic society with its material and intellectual culture based on the reconstructed and dated common Afrasian lexicon. Militarev authors five books and around a hundred twenty publications on a wide range of linguistic, historical, Jewish and biblical subjects. He is a grandson of Solomon Maizel (1900-1952), a prominent Russian orientalist, linguist and polyglot, expert in comparative Semitic, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish and Iranian; Maizel‚Äôs working draft of his second dissertation ‚Äú–ü—É—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –∫–æ—Ä–Ω–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–æ–Ω–¥–∞ —Å–µ–º–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤‚Äù (‚ÄúWays of Root Derivation in Semitic‚Äù) was published in 1983 by Militarev with his introduction, supplements and glossary (in Russian). Militarev was a co-worker of outstanding Russian and international scholars Igor Diakonoff and Sergei Starostin and considers himself their continuator and informal disciple. Multiple research projects headed by Militarev have been supported by various Russian and US foundations. In 2006, he was nominated by a group of US, European and Russian professors for the Holberg International Memorial Prize. Full professor (since 2004) of the Institute of Oriental and Classic Studies, Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow, Militarev is now a consulting professor at the same Institute. In 2005-2008, professor at the Dept. of Jewish Studies, Institute of Asian and African Studies, Moscow State Lomonosov University. In 1994-2009, he was elected for four consecutive terms president of the Jewish University in Moscow (in 2002-2009, renamed into Shimon Dubnov Advanced School in the Humanities). Militarev has run the Afrasian section of the Evolution of Human Languages (EHL) project at the Santa Fe Institute. He has been a guest lecturer in top European, US, and Israeli universities and research centers. Militarev is a founding member of the International Association for Comparative Semitics (Barcelona). Militarev is the leading linguistic proponent of the Levantine origin for Afrasian (‚ÄúLevant theory‚Äù, opposed to Afroasiatic Urheimat in Northeast Africa theory proposed by Christopher Ehret, Roger Blench and others) linking the proto- Afrasian speakers to the Levantine Natufian culture. He co-authors with Leonid Kogan two volumes of the ground-breaking Semitic Etymological Dictionary, which received highly favorable reviews. Militarev also compiled the genealogical tree of world languages, including tentative dates of their branching obtained glottochronologically, based on research by the Moscow School of Comparative Linguistics including his own research on Afrasian dated by him to the 10th millennium B.C.E. He initiated interdisciplinary meetings of historical linguists, archaeologists, pre-historians, and anthropologists by convening in Moscow national and international conferences ‚ÄúLinguistic Reconstruction and Prehistory of the East‚Äù (1984 and 1989), which triggered a series of international conferences, more recently involving geneticists, targeting the problems of prehistoric chronology, human migrations, correlation of homelands of the speakers of proto-languages with certain archaeological cultures, and dispersal of cultural innovations. In the most recent studies, Militarev has obtained an earlier date for Proto-Afrasian, namely the mid-11th millennium B.C.E., which is supposed to be more grounded, as this time his lexicostatistical and glottochronological analysis of 100 most stable words of Swadesh list was applied to many more (170) languages representing all Afrasian branches, groups and subgroups, and consistently includes the etymological background of every item whenever possible. In Militarev's scenario, Proto-Afrasian split into South Afrasian, diverging in the 9th millennium into Cushitic and Omotic (with controversial Ongota a separate sub-branch of the latter) and North Afrasian splitting also in the 9th millennium into Semitic and North African Afrasian falling in the early 7th millennium into Egyptian and Chadic-Berber diverging into Chadic and Berber-Canarian in the late 6th millennium. His updated analysis of 100-word standard Swadesh list applied to over 30 Semitic languages mainly corroborated his previous unorthodox genealogical classification according to which Proto- Semitic split between 4,800-4,700 B.C.E. into South Semitic (represented by Modern South Arabian) and North Semitic falling about a thousand years later into Akkadian and West Semitic branching in early 3rd millennium B.C.E. into Proto-Ethiopian (dividing on the verge of 2nd and 1st millennia B.C.E. into North and South Ethiopian), Proto-Arabic, and Proto-Levantine falling between 2,400 and 2,300 B.C.E. into Ugaritic and South Levantine branching on the verge of 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C.E. into Aramaic, Epigraphic South Arabian (represented in the analysis by Sabaic) and Canaanite represented by Hebrew and Phoenician separated between 15th and 14th centuries B.C.E. Militarev conjectures that the dates obtained may be compatible with both the known historical events, archaeological dating and even internal biblical chronology.  Jewish studies  While Militarev‚Äôs works on linguistic subjects are widely quoted and discussed in both professional and amateur milieux, his book ‚ÄúThe Jewish Conundrum in World History‚Äù (Academic Studies Press. Boston, 2010) passed nearly unnoticed though, in the annotation, it received a high appraisal from two top American experts in Jewish studies: \\"This remarkable and thought-provoking work, by one of the leading figures in the scholarly revival of Jewish studies in the former Soviet Union is a sustained reflection on the course of Jewish history and of the impact of the Jews over the past millennia on wider developments. It is one of the most fascinating reflections on this vital topic to appear in recent times.\\" Antony Polonsky, Albert Abramson Professor of Holocaust Studies, Brandeis University and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \\"A Russian-educated linguist and cultural anthropologist, Alexander Militarev offers in this elegantly written study a novel approach to address the ‚Äúconundrum‚Äù posed by the prominence of the Jews in the unfolding of humanistic cosmopolitan culture. With prodigious erudition, yet with manifest humanity and no small measure of humor, he probes the deep structures of what he calls the ‚ÄúAdamic universalism‚Äù inscribed in the biblical lexicon and worldview and which, he argues, continue to inform the cognitive reflexes and ethical sensibilities of Jewish intellectuals.\\" Paul Mendes-Flohr, Professor of Modern Jewish Thought, Divinity School, The University of Chicago and Professor Emeritus, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  As writer  Apart from scholarly subjects, Militarev authors three books of poetry in Russian and translations of poetry from English and Spanish into Russian (by Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, Miguel Hernandez and other poets).

The song is about the Soweto uprising that occurred in 1976, following the decision by the apartheid government of South Africa to make Afrikaans a medium of instruction at school. The uprising was forcefully put down by the police, leading to the death of between 176 and 700 people. The song was released in 1977 as part of Masekela's album You Told Your Mama Not to Worry. The song became a staple at Makeba's live concerts, and is considered a notable example of music in the movement against apartheid. Background \\"Soweto Blues\\" became a staple of Miriam Makeba's live performances In 1976 the apartheid government of South Africa decided to implement the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students began a series of protests on the morning of 16 June that came to be known as the Soweto Uprising. Students from numerous Sowetan schools began to protest in the streets of Soweto in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in local schools. An estimated 15,000‚Äì20,000 students took part in the protests. The police were caught unawares by the protests. After initially asking the students to disperse, the police opened fire on the protesting children in order to quell the protest. The number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700, while several hundred more were injured. The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"Soweto Blues\\" refer to the children's protests and the resulting massacre in the 1976 Soweto uprising. A review in the magazine Musician said that the song had \\"searingly righteous lyrics\\" that \\"cut to the bone.\\" \\"Soweto Blues\\" was also one of many melancholic songs by Masekela that expressed his commitment to the anti- apartheid struggle, along with \\"Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela),\\" \\"Been Gone Far Too Long,\\" \\"Mama,\\" and \\"The Coal Train.\\" Musically, the song has a background of Mbaqanga guitar, bass, and multi-grooved percussion. Makeba uses this as a platform for vocals that are half-sung and half-spoken, similar to blues music. Performances The song became a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years after its release. It was also performed by Makeba on the tour for Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland, along with many other anti- apartheid songs. Makeba was unable to perform the song in her native South Africa until after her return to the country in June 1990, only a few months after Nelson Mandela was released from prison. She was given a strong welcome back to her home country and regained her South African citizenship in 1992, the same year that she starred in the film Sarafina! about the Soweto uprising.

They were founded in 1998 by Rick Meints and Colin Phillips in the UK. History In the 1990s, American expatriate Rick Meints was a member of the Reaching Moon Megacorp, the British fan publisher that was the center of Glorantha culture at the time. The Reaching Moon Megacorp published Meints' book on collecting Gloranthan publications, The Meints Index to Glorantha (1996, 1999), but by the time of the book's second edition, the Megacorp was on its way out as a decade of constant publication and convention organizing had burned out its main members. Meints and Colin Phillips thus created Moon Design Publications to reprint long out-of-print RuneQuest supplements. Over a six-year period, Moon Design published four compilations of old RuneQuest material under the title \\"Gloranthan Classics\\"; the first was Pavis & Big Rubble (1999) while the last was Borderlands & Beyond (2005). By the time of Borderlands' publication, Greg Stafford had returned from a one-year stay in Mexico and was looking for a new company to carry on the publications of Issaries, and chose Moon Design, by now done with the major Gloranthan books published by Chaosium. Though it got out its first book, Imperial Lunar Handbook Volume 2 (2006), fairly quickly, only two more HeroQuest books would come out by 2008 ‚Äì plus a few of Greg Stafford's \\"unfinished works\\", which Moon Design rebranded as the Stafford Library. In 2008 Jeff Richard came on board as both co-owner and principal Gloranthan author. Soon afterward the company published the second edition of HeroQuest (2009), revised by author Robin Laws. That same year also saw the publication of Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes (2009), a massive book that expanded on the Sartarite background of Hero Wars to create a comprehensive setting for the game, further expanded by Stafford's Book of Heortling Mythology (2009) and the Sartar Companion (2010).

Adventure Games was profitable, but Arneson found the workload to be excessive and finally sold the company to Flying Buffalo. (Alternative URL: .)

History Wizard's Attic was formed in order to act as a fulfillment house for Chaosium. Aldo Ghiozzi's Wingnut Games was one of Wizard's Attic's consolidation clients, and in 2002, Wizard's Attic's business was starting to falter and clients like Ghiozzi were starting to see their payments dry up. Just as Wizard's Attic was trying to get out of the consolidation business, Ghiozzi decided to move his small company Impressions Advertising & Marketing into the field. Impressions used Wizard's Attic as its original base of consolidation operations, so Eric Rowe set aside a corner of the Wizard's Attic warehouse for Ghiozzi and his first three clients ‚Äì Citizen Games, Troll Lord Games and Wingnut Games ‚Äì and shipped their products as required. By the end of 2002, when Wizard's Attic was shutting down all of its business except for fulfilment, Eric Rowe of Wizard's Attic gave 80 consolidation customers to Ghiozzi. However, by 2003 Wizard's Attic was about to get locked out of its remaining warehouse in Kentucky and the product of all of Ghiozzi's clients was there, so Ghiozzi flew to Kentucky to rescue nine palettes of merchandise, which were shipped to Chessex, who became Impressions' new shipper. In 2004 OtherWorld Creations's production came to a halt when both their distributor Wizard's Attic and the d20 market collapsed.

History In 1975, Ed Konstant and David Perez opened a game store in Rockville, Maryland called The Little Soldier. Konstant and Perez also founded publishing company Little Soldier Games to capitalize on a burgeoning interest in both J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons that had just been published by TSR the previous year. Their first product was a fantasy wargame called The Ringbearer, based on Lord of the Rings. Little Soldier quickly received a cease and desist letter from United Artists, at the time the owner of the American rights to LotR. Konstant and Perez then switched to Arthurian legend, publishing the role-playing game Knights of the Round Table in 1976. The same year, Little Soldier Games also began producing third-party material for Dungeons & Dragons, releasing the first fantasy role-playing bestiary, The Book of Monsters, a 40-page compendium of 100 monsters that predated TSR's Monster Manual by a year. Phil Edgren, who owned a bookstore around the corner from The Little Soldier and who had some knowledge of mythical creatures, wrote the text of the book. The illustrations and cover art were done by Bob Charrette. This was quickly followed by The Book of Demons (1976), The Book of Sorcery (1977), and The Book of Mystery (1978). In 1978, Phil Edgren and Dan Bress founded Phoenix Games, and brought Little Soldier Games under the company banner. Using the Little Soldier imprint, Phoenix produced The Book of Shamans (1978), and the Book of Treasure (1978). The new company also released a couple of new products, The Book of Fantasy Miniatures and Elementary, Watson. Gamescience paid for the printing costs of both products in exchange for the rights to the entire Little Soldier Games back-catalogue, and quickly republished condensed versions of all six books under their banner. Phoenix Games went out of business in 1981, and with it went the Little Soldier Game imprint. In 1990, Gamescience included the contents of all six The Book of... volumes in The Fantasy Gamers Compendium.

History Phoenix Games was a partnership between Dan Bress and Phil Edgren, and was a successor to the company Little Soldier Games, to which Bress and Edgren had both contributed before it was shut down. Ed Konstant of Little Soldier Games wrote a few products for Phoenix Games, including The Book of Fantasy Miniatures (1978) and the open-ended deduction game Elementary Watson (1978), whose printing was paid for by Gamescience in return for rights to the Little Soldier back catalog. Some transitional books between the companies, such as The Book of Shamans (1978) were published under the Little Soldier Games label, which was itself listed as a division of Phoenix Games. Phoenix Games continued on with Little Soldier's general fantasy role-playing game publications, but they also did broader work in the RPG field than Little Soldier had, supplementing their generic fantasy supplements with generic science-fiction supplements. Kerry Lloyd got his first book, a \\"generic fantasy\\" adventure called The Mines of Keridav (1979), published through Maryland game company Phoenix Games. Phoenix Games disappeared before the sequel, The Demon Pits of Caeldo, could be published, so Lloyd decided to start his own gaming company, Gamelords. Phoenix Games also published the fantasy role-playing game supplements The Book of Shamans by Ed Lipsett and The Book of Treasure by Phil Edgren in 1978, and the fantasy adventure The Lost Abbey of Calthonwey by R. Norman Carter in 1979. Phoenix Games also published Ed Lipsett's series of science-fiction role-playing game supplements Spacefarer's Guide to Planets: Sector One (1978), Spacefarer's Guide to Planets: Sector Two (1979), Spacefarer's Guide to Alien Monsters (1979), and Spacefarer's Guide to Alien Races (1979). Lipsett's books led to his Star Quest (1983) game, Japan's first entirely original RPG. The second edition of the role-playing game Bushido was published by Phoenix Games in 1980; Phoenix Games was also getting ready to publish Paul Hume and Bob Charrette's Aftermath! (1981), but as the company went defunct, Fantasy Games Unlimited reprinted Bushido in 1981, and stickered their logo over the Phoenix Games logo on the Aftermath! boxes. Phoenix Games had a booth at GenCon XII in 1979 to sell their science fiction and fantasy RPG products as well as create interest in their upcoming game Streets of Stalingrad, with a columnist from Dragon stating noting the game purported to be 12 separate games in one, \\"which would make the seemingly steep price much more reasonable\\".Dragon #31 (Nov 1979) Dana Lombardy's Streets of Stalingrad by Phoenix Games won the 1980 Charles S. Roberts Award for Best Initial Release Wargame. In the February 1981 issue of Dragon, another columnist noted that Phoenix Games \\"invested a very great deal in its massive Dana Lombardy-John Hill design Streets of Stalingrad\\", sparking rumors that the company would go out of business.Dragon #46 (Feb 1981) One of the publishers to whom freelance game designer Perry Moore sold, Phoenix Games of Rockville, Maryland, folded after its release of Streets of Stalingrad, and before any of Perry's designs for them could reach print.Dragon #49 (May 1981) Game reviewer Ian Chadwick called it \\"one of the most impressive games the industry has ever produced\\", noting that Streets of Stalingrad would quickly be gone from stores for good because the game suffered from low financing and the closing of \\"the short-lived Phoenix Games\\".Moves #59 (Oct/Nov 1981) References Category:Role-playing game publishing companies ","title":"Phoenix Games"},{"id":"45600497","text":"Eon Products was an American game company that produced board games and game supplements.

Daedalus Games was incorporated as Daedalus Entertainment in preparation for publishing the Hong Kong action game Laws had intended, but Garcia liked the setting that Laws was working on and decided to use it as a basis of a collectible card game to take advantage of the CCG market and Daedalus published this game as Shadowfist (1995). Daedalus Entertainment published the role-playing game Feng Shui (1996), designed by Laws using a variant of the Nexus game system; Laws also designed supplements for Feng Shui. When the CCG market crashed in 1997, the staff of Daedalus were laid off or quit, leaving Jose Garcia and his sister Maria as the only people working for the company. Daedalus filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and when the company sold off a few of its properties a few years later, Feng Shui went to Laws.

It is managed by the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital opened on Rendezvous Street in Folkestone as the Folkestone Dispensary in 1846. The name was expanded to Folkestone Dispensary and Infirmary and it relocated to a site on Dover Road in Folkestone in 1863. The current general hospital buildings were constructed on Radnor Park Avenue, and opened in 1890, when the name was again changed, this time to the Victoria Hospital. The prefix Royal was added in 1910. In the 1970s, services were scaled down, with the focusing of regional hospital care in East Kent on the town of Ashford, Kent. In 1973 maternity services were moved to Ashford's Willesborough Hospital. In 1979 the new William Harvey Hospital opened in Ashford (ironically, named after Folkestone's William Harvey), and many other services were transferred here over the following years. The accident and emergency department at Royal Victoria Hospital was closed at that time, leaving it with a minor injuries service. Current operation The hospital is the base for a large general practice and, although the accident and emergency department has closed, there is still an operational minor injuries unit. The hospital provides gynaecological, otorhinolaryngological and urological outpatient services, diagnostic services, mental health care, and general outpatient facilities.

She was a founding member of the artist-run centre the Western Front, where she supported the video and performance works of many artists while producing her own body of work. She is known for her performances as 'Lady Brute' and for her video works. Biography Catherine Shand Craig was born on September 15, 1947, in Victoria, British Columbia. She was the third child of Sidney Osborne Craig (n√©e Scott) and Charles Edward Craig. Her parents divorced in 1956. In 1960, her mother married Douglas Shadbolt, an architect and brother of the painter Jack Shadbolt. The family moved to Montreal and then to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Craig attended Dalhousie University (1961). Craig met artist Eric Metcalfe in Victoria and they married in 1969. They moved to Vancouver, where, along with friends and fellow artists Michael Morris, Vincent Trasov and Glenn Lewis, they bought the space that became the Western Front in the Mount Pleasant area of Vancouver. Craig and Metcalfe separated in 1973, but continued to work together on collaborative projects. That year, Craig met artist Hank Bull. As a couple they worked on projects with Metcalfe, Lewis, Patrick Ready, Margaret Dragu and many others. Craig established and curated the Western Front's Artist-in Residence video program from 1977 to 1993. In 1980 and 1981 Craig and Bull traveled through Indonesia, India, Africa, and Europe, performing Around The World in Over 365 Days. Craig married Bull in 1990. After retiring from her position as Curator of Media Arts at the Western Front in 1993, she spent the late 1990s preparing for a major retrospective of her work at the Vancouver Art Gallery, entitled Skin. Craig's \\"idea of performance was always informed by community and based on thinking life is an art project\\", even at end of her life. She died of cancer in Storm Bay, British Columbia, in 2002.  Performance art  = Lady Brute = Eric Metcalfe was a fine arts student at the University of Victoria and Craig was drawn to his circle of artists and performers. In 1969, he created a mail art persona called \\"Dr. Brute\\", and Craig became \\"Lady Brute\\". This collaborative project created the fictional world of \\"Brutopia.\\" Their collection of leopard material filled this world and the characters examined the foibles of western society. In 1972, Lady Brute appeared as the \\"Picture of the Week\\" in an issue of FILE magazine and marched in the Victoria Day parade in Victoria, B.C. Her performances were usually informal, happening in the real world rather than on stage. She would attend an opening or a dinner in her leopard regalia and that was the performance. In 1974 she performed \\"Flying Leopard\\" in Vancouver at Cates Park, and again on Hornby Island. In 1975 she produced her first video, \\"Skins: Lady Brute presents her Leopardskin Wardrobe\\".Bull, Hank and Sharla Sava. \\"Skin: A Conversation With Kate Craig,\\" Boo Magazine (Vancouver) 11, 1998: 8-13.

Weynerowska, born Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowska; (December 18, 1918 ‚Äì June 20, 1998) was a Polish-born American painter known for her stylized portraits. She has been described as one of the most important Polish female painters. She was a World War II veteran of the Polish Resistance Movement after Nazi Germany occupied Poland, when she used the nom de guerre Kali. After emigrating and marrying, she used many variants of name, including \\"Hanna Kali Weynerowski\\", \\"Hanna Weynerowski-Kali\\", \\"Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowski-Weynerowski\\", \\"Hanka Weynerowska\\", and \\"Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowski\\", but she signed her paintings Kali. Work The figures in her art resemble Old Masters in subject and positioning, but are painted in a simplified, flattened and more graphic manner. The paintings are brightly colored, often portraying the subject shown sitting at bust-length, with an elongated face, flattened body, a patterned element such as part of the clothing, and with the subject's hands positioned in a classical pose. Her work has been likened to a combination of Neo- mannerist and Surrealist. Life Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowska was born on 18 December 1918 in Warsaw, Poland. She attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, studying under Tadeusz Pruszkowski. Her education was interrupted by the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany. She joined the Polish resistance movement, the Home Army (Armia Krajowa), using the nom de guerre Kali; she was a member of a women's sabotage unit. In the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, she was wounded and taken prisoner of war to Germany. Her prison camp was eventually liberated by the Soviet Army. She escaped from communist-governed Poland, aided by the U.S. military, to West Germany. By 1945 she was living in Brussels, Belgium, and attending the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts (ARBA) in Brussels to complete her arts education. In Brussels she married Henryk \\"Henry\\" Weynerowski (1901‚Äì88) a fellow Polish refugee and resistance fighter. For the next five years, she lived in Europe and exhibited her art in various countries, including France, Britain, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland. She used many variants of her name after emigrating from Poland and marrying, including \\"Hanna Kali Weynerowski\\", \\"Hanna Weynerowski-Kali\\", \\"Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowski-Weynerowski\\", \\"Hanka Weynerowska\\", and \\"Hanna Gordzia≈Çkowski\\". Her paintings were simply signed Kali. In 1953 she moved with her husband to San Francisco, California, where they lived until their deaths. She died on 20 June 1998 in San Francisco. In her will, she requested that her 86 paintings be transferred to the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland.

Tuwai made his debut for at the 2014 Gold Coast Sevens. He was a part of the Fiji Sevens team that won the gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He won the 2019 World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year award. He was named player of the tournament at the 2014 World Club 7s where he played for the Davetalevu Club. He was also Player of the Final at the 2015 Dubai Sevens. Tuwai was also the stand out player at the 2015 Las Vegas Sevens final when beat 35-19.  Background  Tuwai was born in Newtown, a poor district in the outskirts of Suva, Fiji, to Poasa Vunisa and Seruwaia Vualiku. He was raised in a one-room house with corrugated iron walls. As a kid, he used to play rugby with plastic bottles and bundled-up T-shirts, since there was no money to afford rugby balls. Between the ages of 14 and 15, he used to join his father to fish and then sell the capture on the streets, which he defines as \\"a very hard job\\". Later, he would declare that he really regretted dropping out of school. Domestic rugby career Tuwai grew up playing rugby in his school, but only took to the sport seriously at 18, after dropping volleyball.At that age he joined Newtown Rugby Club, his local club, where he quickly excelled for his speed and side stepping, which set him apart from the other players, according to his coach at the time, Meli Nakalivadra. He was subsequently invited to join Marist Rugby Club's Sevens team, against whom he impressed during a match played in Suva. There he played well enough to get in the radar of the national sevens team's coaching staff and was subsequently invited to train with the national sevens squad, but only lasted one camp, before being discarded for being \\"too small to play international rugby\\".  International rugby career  After two years, then Fiji Sevens coach Ben Ryan saw him playing in the Marist sevens, the biggest annual club tournament in Fiji, and invited him to train with the national squad, letting him know that he had to work hard on his all-round rugby skills if he was to play for Fiji, citing his low work rate off the ball as an issue to address, while also noting his insufficient training foundations. As a consequence of his lack of fitness, Tuwai would often quit training when it got too hard, even getting to the point where he was hiding in the bushes during sprints in order to skip training. As Ryan recalls, \\"He was painfully shy. For a week I don‚Äôt think he uttered a word to anyone. And he was dreadfully unfit, with apparently minimal motivation to improve. He couldn‚Äôt get through a single training session without breaking down exhausted. A lot of the time he wouldn‚Äôt even turn up for a training session (...) He was full of excuses: I couldn‚Äôt get to training, I missed the bus; I was ill, I couldn‚Äôt move. When we did fitness drills in the sessions he did get to, his chin would always be on his chest as he ran. When he wasn‚Äôt running he was hiding in the bushes. He couldn‚Äôt understand the intensity of the work we were doing and he couldn‚Äôt connect it with the rugby that he loved to play. \\" Despite this, Ryan saw his potential and took him under his wing in order for him to thrive in the ultra- competitive environment of professional sport, from fitness to nutrition, rest and mental skills. Tuwai credits Ryan for changing his mindset and preparing him for the rigours of being a professional rugby player and helping him get to that next level mentally and physically. He made his debut for Fiji Sevens at the 2014 Gold Coast Sevens in Australia. His performance was praised by Ryan, saying that it was one of the best debuts that he had ever seen from a Sevens player. By the end of the season, he was named the best rookie of the sevens circuit season by World Rugby. Tuwai was an integral part of the Fiji Sevens squad that competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where they beat Brasil, the USA, Argentina, New Zealand and Japan to qualify for the Olympic Rugby Sevens final, where they beat Great Britain by 43-7. It was the first time Fiji had won an Olympic medal, and gave the whole country something to cheer on after the devastation caused by Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji in february of that same year.  Playing style  Tuwai is known for his agility, sharp decision-making and his ability to step defenders without losing speed. He's also notable for his commitment for the physical side of the game, being a force at the breakdown and making an impact with his defence, despite being small for an average professional rugby player. This has led Fiji Sevens legend Waisale Serevi to declare that Tuwai's even a better player than he was in his prime  __ Personal life  Tuwai credits his mom and dad for his achievements on the rugby field, and cites them as his main motivation to perform and achieve accolades in rugby. When he was young, Tuwai‚Äôs father and mother saved enough money to buy their son his first pair of rugby boots. As she handed them over Tuwai‚Äôs mother told him ‚Äú this is your knife and fork\\". Tuwai declared ‚ÄúI did not know my Mum was saving some money for my rugby boots. I couldn‚Äôt believe it because I knew they weren‚Äôt earning big money. They bought me these boots and my mum told me ‚Äúthis is your life ‚Äì this is your knife and your fork‚Äù. It really touched me and from that time until now I always write on my boots when I am about to play ‚Äì knife and fork. ‚ÄúWhen I get tired and want to give up I just picture our house and my parents and I am working for them. I just picture my Mum working and my Dad working hard on the farm. Tuwai has credited his parents for keeping him grounded and humble. He goes back regularly to Newtown, the place where he grew up.

He is an incarnation of Moorcock's character the Eternal Champion. Like many of those incarnations, he can remember flashes of alternative lives, something that frequently causes him great distress. Erekos√´ appears as a lead character in three Moorcock novels and a graphic novel: * The Eternal Champion (1970) - based on stories in Avillion and Science Fantasy * Phoenix in Obsidian, also known as The Silver Warriors (1970) * The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell (1979; graphic novel) * The Dragon in the Sword (1987) Another novel, The Sundered Worlds, appears in the White Wolf Publishing omnibus collection The Eternal Champion (with the novels The Eternal Champion and Phoenix in Obsidian, in between the two), but only as a bonus novel; it is not part of the Erekos√´ series. (The Dragon in the Sword appears in the following White Wolf omnibus, Von Bek.) In The Eternal Champion, Erekose is introduced as \\"John Daker\\", a seemingly average man of twentieth-century Earth, who is soon transported to another world and forced to deal with his true calling. He finds love with the woman Ermizhad, but he seems to be cursed to not be with her for very long. The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell Erekos√´ appears in a graphic novel by Moorcock and Howard Chaykin called The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell published in 1979. In this story he assumes the role of \\"Clen of Clen-Gar\\", who resembles actor Burt Lancaster, and is a noble of the land called the \\"Dream Marches\\", part of a greater land called \\"Heaven\\". He befriends a peaceful race of beings known as \\"Angels\\", who can best be described in one of their forms as flying manatees. In the day-time, they gracefully float through Heaven, absorbing water vapour from the air, and by night they release the stored water as acid rain upon a neighboring land coincidentally called \\"Hell\\", whose savage inhabitants live in poverty compared to the luxury of Heaven and the Dream Marches. The angels can also assume an insectoid form similar to human sized ant-men. Erekos√´ meets and has a brief affair with a Noble woman named \\"Lady Gradesmor\\", who looks like Sophia Loren, and whose husband was killed in one of the frequent battles between Heaven and Hell. The story takes place chronologically between Phoenix in Obsidian and The Dragon in the Sword and ends with Erekos√´ going to the Dark Ship, a ship that sails between worlds; some of which Erekos√´ recalls in the novel. In 2018, It was reprinted in hardcover by Titan Comics as part of the Michael Moorcock Library. The Dragon in the Sword John Daker's final appearance is in The Dragon in the Sword, in which he leaves Urlik Skarsol's world forever to assume the identity of Prince Flamadin in the Six Realms of the Wheel, where he befriends concentration camp escapee Count Ulric von Bek and Ermizhad look-alike Alisaard. They embark on a quest to free the cosmic dragon trapped in the Dragon Sword before the real Flamadin's sister, Princess Sharadim, uses it to free Archduke Balarizaaf and his army of Chaos. During the course of their adventure, they manage to reunite the Ursine Princes, find the Holy Grail, convince Adolf Hitler to lose World War II, summon the Warriors on the Edge of Time, defeat the Archduke's army of Chaos, and break the Dragon Sword in half, freeing the dragon within. Ulric, having fallen in love with Alisaard, decides to join her as the dragon leads her people, the Eldren Ghost Women, to the plane of their male counterparts. Jermays the Crooked then tells Daker that the people of Melnibon√© are their descendants, and the Dragon Sword's halves were reforged into Mournblade and Stormbringer, Elric's black sword. Then the Dark Ship takes Daker back to his home in modern-day London, where he has found a new appreciation for his urban life and is confident he will find Ermizhad there in some form or another. John Daker The character of John Daker remembers his other incarnations more frequently and more vividly that most other incarnations. Although the recollections are often mere fragments, they are sometimes sufficient to torment him. Another unique aspect of the Champion as Daker is that unlike other known aspects of the Champion, Daker maintains multiple cover identities. He is plucked from one world to another by the forces of Fate, where he assumes the identity of someone, frequently that of a long-dead champion. For example, in the novel The Eternal Champion, Daker lives a normal life in 20th century London, until sometime in his adulthood. He has a wife, a child, a career, and so forth, but is ultimately whisked from his world to another world, of medieval nature, where he is told that he is Lord Erekos√´, a long dead champion of that world returned to life. The exact relationship between the reborn Erekos√´, and the original Erekos√´ is left somewhat vague. It seems that Daker is not dead Erekos√´ resurrected, because dead Erekos√´'s ‚Äúdust‚Äù remains undisturbed. Furthermore, Daker lacks the memories of dead Erekos√´. The new Erekos√´ may be a reincarnation of dead Erekos√´. If this is correct, then Daker is not only an incarnation of the Eternal Champion, but a reincarnation of a previous champion of that world (but whether or not dead Erekos√´ was himself a true aspect of the Eternal Champion, or simply a great champion in his own right, is not revealed). In The Dragon in the Sword, the body of John Daker's final incarnation, Prince Flamadin, is revealed to be a duplicate of the original's, and he even encounters the original's body during the story. This would support the notion that Daker is a separate entity from the men he becomes. Appearances with Elric, Hawkmoon, and Corum In the next novel, Daker is summoned to a new world, where he takes on the identity of Count Urlik Skarsol. In the third novel he becomes Prince Flamadin. In the Elric novel The Sailor on the Seas of Fate, Erekos√´ makes an appearance, but seems to have reverted to his pre-Urlik aspect, the resurrected Erekos√´. This same story is expanded upon in the Hawkmoon novel The Quest for Tanelorn. This story would seem to be the last story concerning Erekos√´, yet he makes reference to it in the novel The Dragon in the Sword. In addition to the various identities that he becomes, Daker also has fleeting memories (often in the form of dreams) of other incarnations of the Eternal Champion, though it is neither stated how many other incarnations he has had memories of, nor of how many identities he has assumed. Another character named Erekos√´ makes an appearance in the Corum novel the King of the Swords and in the Elric novel The Vanishing Tower. This Erekos√´ is also an aspect of the Eternal Champion, and, like Daker, is also cursed with remembering his various other incarnations. He is described as a man with jet black skin wearing a bearskin. It is not implicitly stated, but it would seem that this Erekos√´ is not simply another identity thrust upon John Daker. The dialogue of both versions of the story suggests that, although he has memories of all the champions (like Daker), he does not seem to recall Daker‚Äôs own experiences as truly his own. He also alludes to the fact that he has a different name, but, possibly because he meets Elric and Corum on a world other than his own, he can‚Äôt recall it, and picks Erekos√´ as a temporary name. Lack of a Companion Another thing that sets Daker apart from the other champions is the fact that he lacks a \\"Companion to Champions\\". While he has many companions, most incarnations of the Eternal Champion have a principal companion, a sort of ‚ÄúCompanion to Champions‚Äù, who, like the Champion himself, share a soul. Daker meets some of the Companions, and is aided by them, but does not have one that seems to be uniquely his. This is no doubt a result of the fact that, unlike other Champions, Daker moved from plane to plane. There is, however, a Companion equivalent to Daker: Jhary-a-Conel is a Companion to Champions who remembers, if only fleetingly, all his other lives. In popular culture Erekos√´, along with various other aspects of the Champion, is mentioned briefly in the song \\"Damned for All Time\\" by German power metal band Blind Guardian on their Follow the Blind album. Italian metal band Domine have also recorded a song based on the Eternal Champion concept on their Champion Eternal album. No specific aspects of the Champion are named in this song, but the narrator is aware of what he is, a trait belonging only to Erekos√´. This song is titled \\"The Eternal Champion\\".

Family and early life  Born at Fort-Dauphin in Saint-Domingue, his father was Louis- Eustache d'Osmond (1718-1782), 3rd comte de Boitron, and his mother was Marie- √âlisabeth n√©e Cavelier de La Garenne. He was sent to France to join the Army and after being commissioned as Sous-lieutenant in the cavalry R√©giment de Chartres, in 1771 he was seconded to the R√©giment de Bourgogne, promoted 1776 as Mestre-de-camp lieutenant en second (Major) in the Duke of Orl√©ans' Dragoons, becoming Colonel en second of the regiment in 1780, and then Mestre- de-camp commandant (Colonel) of the R√©giment de Barrois (Infantry) from 1 January 1784. His uncle, Barnab√©, comte d'Osmond (1716-1792), was Chamberlain of the Royal Orleans household and introduced him to the court of Prince Louis-Philippe d'Orl√©ans (1725-1785). Ren√©-Eustache d'Osmond then became in regular attendance at the Castle of St Assisi, where the Royal Duke had taken up residence with his morganatic wife, Charlotte marquise de Montesson. On 15 March 1778, when stationed with his regiment at Blanquefort, he married H√©l√®ne-√âl√©onore Dillon (1753-1831), a creole beauty from the Martinique family de Tascher. They had two children: *Ad√©la√Øde-Charlotte-Louise-√âl√©onore, comtesse de Boigne (1781-1866), a celebrated diarist; *Charles-Eustache- Gabriel (1787-1862), 2nd (styled 5th) marquis d'Osmond.  Later career  In 1786 d'Osmond secured the purchase of the Armand-Joseph, duc de Charost's coal mining interests at Firminy and Roche-la-Moli√®re, near Saint-√âtienne, but his perceived business coup ran into difficulties from the outset since their smooth operation was hampered by local hostility. The French Revolutionaries supported the ransacking of mining businesses, and he tried in vain to obtain Constituent Assembly approval for his business concessions. Fortuitously, he had resigned as Governor of Rouen in 1788 and entered French diplomatic service. He was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to The Hague in 1789, then Ambassador to St Petersburg in 1790, where he replaced Louis-Philippe, comte de S√©gur. However, he resigned following the flight to Varennes without ever occupying the post, and joined his family, who already emigrated to Switzerland in 1792. His brother, Antoine-Eustache d'Osmond (Constitutional Bishop of Nancy), who had sided with the Emperor Napoleon, ensured that his name was removed from the list of emigrants enabling him to return to France during the r√©gime of the First French Empire. On 17 August 1815, King Louis XVIII appointed him a Lieutenant-General of the Army as well as a hereditary peer. He was then posted as French Ambassador to Turin (1814-1815) and then to London (November 1815-January 1819). He was created a marquis and peer of France by Royal decree, dated 31 August 1817 (in the title previously held by a senior branch of the d'Osmond family, extinct 1771). In 1814, he was restored to the rights of his coal mining interests, but short of working capital and know-how, he exchanged them for a percentage of shares in the new Compagnie des Mines de Roche-Firminy.www.patronsdefrance.fr  See also  * List of Ambassadors of France to the United Kingdom * Famille d'Osmond References Category:1751 births Category:1838 deaths Category:French Marquesses Category:Knights of Malta Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Louis Category:Ambassadors of France to Great Britain Category:Ambassadors of France to the Kingdom of Sardinia ","title":"Ren√©-Eustache, marquis d'Osmond"},{"id":"45600833","text":"Emery Park is a park in Erie County, in the U.S. state of New York.

The film stars Jack Reynor as a young man who tries to help his mother (Toni Collette) with her alcoholism. Plot John is a cash-strapped taxi driver in Dublin, who lives with his mother, Jean, who is drinking herself to death. He finds her comatose in her own vomit and drives her to the hospital where she recuperates until her next bout of drunkenness. John spends his time trying to get more work driving, hanging out with his one mate, arguing with his mother about alcohol, taxiing prostitutes, and palling with his younger brother, who has Down syndrome and lives in a home with other disabled kids. John rids his house of alcohol and tries to convince his mother to stop drinking but she screams at him and smashes the plates as he impassively videos her rampage. After searching the town for his mother, who he fears for, he finds her drunk on the doorstep. Not knowing what else to do with her, he invites her to party with him and watches emotionless as she drinks and dances in the kitchen. She confides in him that when John's younger brother was born disabled, the father left, and she always saw the child as less than human, and nothing but a drain on her. But she says that John was her precious child, who always came looking for her. After the father left, she felt destined to be utterly alone the rest of her life, until she found alcohol. John convinces her to enter a treatment centre, by screaming at her that she is breaking his heart and that he can't take it any more. He shows her the video of her raging for alcohol. The free centre can only keep her for one week, but the concerned director finds a place at a private clinic with a fee of 8,000 euros. Desperate, John calls his boss to ask for an advance, agreeing to do his bidding. John drives his mate to the airport to leave the country, but on the way has arranged for him to have cathartic meeting with his young son that he almost never gets to see. Then John and his mate say a tearful goodbye at the airport. John visits his mother at the new centre, along with his brother, and the mother makes an emotional connection with him. John's boss tells him to pick up something delicate for him. He drives to a desolate house where he finds a young Asian woman, abused and delirious in a bathtub. Disturbed and perplexed, he ends up driving her to the director of the treatment centre to get her help.

EOC 10 inch 40 caliber guns were the primary armament of armored cruisers, ironclads and pre-dreadnought battleships built or refit during the 1890s. These guns and their licensed derivatives armed ships of the Argentine Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy, Regia Marina and Spanish Navy. They served in the Russo-Japanese War, Italo-Turkish War and World War I.  History  Development of the 10 inch 40 caliber guns began in the early 1890s at the Elswick Ordnance Company located at Newcastle upon Tyne, England. They were developed for export customers and had the EOC designations of Pattern P, Pattern P1 and Pattern R. They were built-up guns with an A tube and reinforced with two rows of hoops. Originally they had a semi-automatic screw breech mechanism, which opened the breech as the gun recoiled. However, this was found unsatisfactory and was replaced by a hand worked breech. The Italian designation for the EOC 10 inch guns was Cannone da 254/40 A Modello 1893 and Cannone da 254/40 A Modello 1899. The Modello 1893 version was a trunnion-less gun, while the Modello 1899 had trunnions. Italian single gun mounts were electrically powered, while twin mounts were hydraulically powered. In addition to guns imported from England licensed versions were produced by the (Armstrong factory) at Pozzuoli, Italy. In 1908 the Japanese designated EOC 10 inch guns as 10 inch 40 caliber Type 41. Later in 1917, they were re- designated in centimeter as 25 cm 40 caliber Type 41. In addition to guns imported from England and Italy, four licensed versions were produced at the Kure Naval Arsenal beginning in 1908. The Kure guns differed from their English and Italian counterparts by using different rifling.  Naval use  = Argentine Navy = * Giuseppe Garibaldi-class cruisers - Three of the four ships of this class purchased by Argentina had a primary armament of two Pattern P guns in single gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. = Italian Navy = * Ammiraglio di Saint Bon-class battleships - The two ships of this class had a primary armament of four 254/40 A guns in twin turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. Both ships saw action during the Italo- Turkish War. * Giuseppe Garibaldi-class cruisers - The three ships of this class purchased by Italy had a mixed primary armament of one 254/40 A gun in a single turret fore and two EOC 8 inch 45 caliber guns in a twin turret aft of the superstructure. All three ships saw action during the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. * Italian ironclad Enrico Dandolo - This ship had a primary armament of four 254/40 A guns in twin turrets en echelon amidships after an 1895-1898 refit. = Japanese Navy = * Giuseppe Garibaldi-class cruisers - One of the two ships of this class purchased by Japan the Kasuga had a mixed primary armament of one Pattern R gun in a single turret fore and two EOC 8 inch 45 caliber guns in a twin turret aft of the superstructure. The other ship the Nisshin had two EOC 8 inch 45 caliber guns in twin turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. Both ships participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War. = Spanish Navy = * Giuseppe Garibaldi-class cruisers - The single ship of this class purchased by Spain the Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was designed to carry a single Pattern R gun in a turret fore and two 8-inch guns in a twin turret aft of the superstructure, but the Spanish Ministry of Marine rejected the 10-inch gun, so she had to rely on her two 8-inch guns and ten casemated 6-inch guns. Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was sunk at the battle of Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.  Army Use  As the First World War settled into trench warfare on the Italian Front, the light field guns that the combatants went to war with were beginning to show their limitations when facing an enemy who was now dug into prepared Alpine positions. Indirect fire, interdiction and counter-battery fire emphasized the importance of long-range heavy artillery. In order to address the Italian Army's lack of long-range heavy artillery, surplus 254B, 254/40, 305/17, 305/40, and 305/46 naval guns were converted to land use. These guns were mounted on the same \\"De Stefano\\" carriage for land use and the resulting guns were classified by their size in millimeters 254, their length in calibers 40 and lastly by their carriage type DS which stood for De Stefano or 254/40 DS. The De Stefano carriage was a clever, but strange looking monstrosity which looked something like a child's 4-wheeled toy-horse when the gun barrel was elevated. The carriage was a large 4-wheeled box-trail design with two non-steerable wheels on the front and two castering wheels at the rear. The wheels were fitted with detachable grousers designed by Major Crispino Bonagente for traction on soft ground and was towed in one piece by a Pavesi-Tolotti artillery tractor. When not on the move the grousers were removed and the steel wheels rode on an inclined set of steel rails when in firing position. The steel rails were mounted on a firing platform made of wooden beams which allowed the gun 360¬∞ of traverse. When the gun fired recoil which was not absorbed by the recoil mechanism was transmitted to the wheels and the carriage rolled up the inclined rails and then rolled back into firing position. The box trail carriage was tall and wide enough that the breech of the gun was accessible at high angles of elevation without a pit being dug and the gun crew had a bucket and hoist for ammunition handling.  Ammunition  Ammunition was of separate loading bagged charge and projectile type. The bagged ballistite charge weighed and projectiles weighed between . The gun was able to fire: * Armor Piercing * Armor Piercing capped * Common  Photo gallery  File:Garibaldi NH 88672.jpgARA Garibaldi File:St Bon 10 inch gun turret plan.jpgTop view of a twin 10-inch gun turret File:Erbeutete_Kanone_bei_Cervignano_22.11.17._(BildID_15611297).jpgA 254/40 gun on a De Stefano carriage.

It has egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves that are narrower at the base, white flowers usually arranged singly on short side shoots and fruit that remains on the plant until it dies. Description Leptospermum obovatum is a densely foliaged shrub that typically grows to a height of about with thin, firm bark on the older stems. It has aromatic, egg- shaped or lance-shaped leaves that are narrower at the base, long and or more wide on a very short petiole. The flowers are borne singly, sometimes in pairs on short side shoots. The flowers are white, wide with reddish brown bracts at the base of the flower bud but that fall before the flowers open. The floral cup is glabrous, long on a short pedicel. The sepals are triangular to broadly egg-shaped or almost round, long, the petals long and the stamens long. Flowering mainly occurs from November to January and the fruit is a broadly hemispherical capsule in diameter and that remains on the plant until it dies, the sepal remnants having fallen. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum obovatum was first formally described by in 1827 Robert Sweet in his book Flora Australasica. The specific epithet (obovatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"obovate\\". Distribution and habitat River teatree grows among rocks, near swift-flowing streams and often in swampy places. It is found on the Southern Tablelands and South Coast of New South Wales and is widespread in southern Victoria. Use in horticulture This species can be grown from seed or from cuttings and is hardy in cultivation. It will grow in heavy shade, is frost hardy, and a useful screening plant.

Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for on the eve of his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.  Plot  Though the films are presumed lost, the synopsis of both film survive in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. The plot of The Girls He Left Behind Him follows Jack Redfern, a young bachelor, who is soon to be married. Jack receives a letter in feminine handwriting from an \\"old sweetheart\\" of his, stating how glad she is to hear of his approaching marriage. Jack goes through visions, remembering the various girls of his life and his interactions with each of them. Betty, Kate, Tootsie, Elizabeth, Clara, Jeanette, and Helen. According to the synopsis, the last vision he has is of all the old sweethearts of his waving good luck to him as he marries Mary. Though a review states that he awakes and is obliged to hurry to his wedding. Bowers believes the synopsis to be in error and that the film actually concluded with all the girls present at the wedding, rather than it being a \\"vision\\". For the Iron Clad Lover: \\"Dick makes love to Bessie while Tom plays a game of chess with her father. Tom, naturally nervous, plays such a poor game that he and the old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house. Next day is Bessie's birthday. Tom brings a bouquet and a box of candy. But he is turned away from the house and has the gifts thrown at his head by Bessie's father. Dick arrives and is welcomed. Tom, in desperation, buys a suit of armor, puts it on and has himself delivered to the house as a present to Bessie. Dick finds out that Tom is inside the armor and makes life miserable for him, blowing cigar smoke through the visor and making love to Bessie. Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue. They were horrified to learn that the old man has sold the armor to a junk dealer; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded up, when it takes combined efforts of a policeman, locksmith, and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenarios are unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film directors are unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil and/or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits of both films are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.  Release and reception  The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were released together on a single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, which could have been about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912. The Girls He Left Behind Him received praise from the reviewer from The Moving Picture World who stated, \\"[It is a] comedy, not by any means original, but with a sentimental touch, ... this excellent film has placed in visible form these visions of the past which often haunt the middle aged or the younger person who about to take some important step. The mechanical work is well done and the audience follows the picture with interest.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror also gave it faint praise by stating that \\"The picture has some novelty and interest.\\" For The Iron Clad Lover received minor praise from both publications for being a novel even if the story was impossible.

This gives the Faroe Islands control over their own taxes. Income taxation All citizens of the Faroe Islands are subject to personal taxation. The government tax rate on incomes up to DKK 500,000 is 20%. Incomes higher than this pay a fixed amount, always resulting in a higher percentage. There are multiple tax deductions in the Faroes. This includes a 14% deduction for fishermen. However, this is limited to 14% of DKK 470,000 corresponding to a maximum annual deduction of DKK 65,800. A deduction for foreign workers also exists, and this deduction can be as high as 30%. Deductions are also available to students and parents. VAT and business taxes The VAT or Value Added Tax, is a tax on imports and sales paid to the Faroese treasury. The VAT is deductible for income purposes. Companies that don't pay a VAT must pay an employer's tax. The corporate tax rate in the Faroe Islands stands at 18%. Tax administration Citizens subject to taxation use the calendar year as the income tax/fiscal year. Generally, the income period for companies follows the accounting year, which has to be no longer than 12 months. However, the first accounting year can vary from 6 to 18 months.

The film portrays the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Background Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean Communist Party during the fight to liberate Korea from Japanese colonialism, was determined that cinema should play a central role in \\"ideological guidance\\" of his newly liberated country and eagerly accepted Soviet funding and technicians to set up the National Film Production Center. Their first production was My Home Village. The film was shot on 10 standard 35 mm film reels in black and white. Its running time is 101 minutes. Plot The film opens with a shot of Mount Paektu, the snow-capped volcano which is the holy mountain considered to be the origin of the Korean race, giving emotional basis for Kim's anti-Japanese guerrilla group. In fact, however, a scale-model of the mountain was used. The story concerns Gwan Pil, a poor farmer who is deprived of his land by an evil landlord and put in a Japanese prison. There he meets an agent of Kim Il-sung's Korean People's Revolutionary Army. The two stage a riot and break out of prison to join the guerrillas. The guerrillas blow up a Japanese train which crashes through a railway bridge. Kim's army liberates Gwan Pil's home village, and he leads the fight to create a new society there. In the presentation of the liberation of Korea in 1945, there was no mention of American defeat of Japan or of the Soviet invasion but showed the liberation of Korea as the work of Kim Il Sung's guerrilla fighters working on their own. Propaganda North Korean sources tell that Kim Il- sung's son, Kim Jong-il, the future leader of the country, attended a preview of the film. Even at the age of seven, the story goes, he handed critical notes to the filmmakers pointing out that although there was snow falling, none could be seen on the heads or shoulders of the characters, and that the snow was clearly cotton wool, not real snow.

Sdraulig was appointed chairman of the Adelaide Film Festival in 2015, replacing Cheryl Bart. Controversy During Sdraulig's time at Film Victoria, Victoria secured unprecedented levels of production. Sydney based companies and projects controversially moved to Melbourne with producers claiming that they were spurred by Victorian government funding and infrastructure which got behind its producers. The feature film The Tender Hook described as an iconic Sydney period drama, based on some of Sydney's more colourful identities, was shot entirely in Melbourne. Key Sydney based producers and businesses started relocating to Melbourne. Crews and facilities were stretched to a limit with some productions relying on interstate crews to meet demand. The boom was the result of Film Victoria's aggressive marketing of Melbourne as a film destination as well as extensive development work of local projects. Despite the fact that, during her leadership of Film Victoria, annual film production in that state increased from $90 million to over $260 million, the eight-year tenure ended in controversy when it was revealed that her send-off party, organised by the Board cost $45,000. Almost $30,000 went on food and wine, and over $10,000 on a surprise \\"Tribute DVD\\" by the industry for Ms Sdraulig. Sdraulig was not involved in the organisation of her farewell nor has that ever been claimed. Producer Robert Galinsky wrote that after having brought \\"millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs into the state during her tenure that to complain about a farewell party after a decade of tireless effort was a shameless act\\".

His three sons, with whom he has had a difficult, at times estranged, relationship, are all struggling with their lives and their roles in a post-feminist world. The eldest son, Martin is a fading former rock n roll star but he is still clinging to his musical dreams. The middle son, Alex, has a successful career and a middle-class lifestyle but his marriage is crumbling. Toby, the youngest and gentlest of the three, wants to have the perfect family and he alone is making an effort to stay connected with his own father. The dementia-stricken Cliff relives his past, first as a talented young musician who falls in love with the equally talented Margaret but their promising careers and love affair are both cut short by the advent of the Second World War. An army officer in Singapore during the Japanese invasion, Cliff is saved from death by a Welsh Sergeant named Sid who sacrifices his own life but the former then has to endure years of captivity. Returning to Australia, Cliff discovers Margaret, thinking he was lost, has married another man. Cliff becomes a school-teacher, marries a co-worker and they have three sons. However the marriage is a strained one as Cliff, traumatised by the war, feeling trapped by his obligations as a family man and unhappy over losing Margaret and his chances at a music career, begins to take out his resentment on his family. Alex's wife leaves him and the stress affects his performance at work. Martin's attempts to restart his music career fail whilst Toby and his wife struggle to start a family. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Margaret re-appeared in Cliff's life, offering to restart their relationship but Cliff gives up his last chance of true love by choosing to remain with his sons, a sacrifice that his sons will never know. Alex quits the firm he works for and goes solo, becoming much happier in the process, relishing the time he gets to spend with his own children. Martin accepts that his youth and his dreams are over and he instead embraces the present and a new relationship, managing to re-connect with his father also. Toby's wife manages to fall pregnant and in his utter joy, he realises he will be a far better parent to his child than his own father ever was. In the nursing home, Cliff is visited by a vision of Sid. Cliff apologises to Sid for not achieving his dreams but Sid points out that he managed to raise three fine boys. Cliff smiles for the first time. Imagining he is back on a sinking ship during the war, Cliff leaves his room and drowns himself in the nursing home's indoor swimming pool.

The organisation has initially focused on responding to developments in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, through peaceful protest and noncooperation. Lock the Gate Alliance's stated mission is \\"to protect Australia‚Äôs natural, environmental, cultural and agricultural resources from inappropriate mining and to educate and empower all Australians to demand sustainable solutions to food and energy production.\\" The Alliance claims to have over 40,000 members and 250 local groups constitute the alliance including farmers, traditional custodians, conservationists and urban residents. The organisation was incorporated in 2011 in New South Wales and became a registered company, limited by guarantee on 6 March 2012. The inaugural AGM was held in Murwillumbah on 11 June 2011 at which Drew Hutton was elected president. Another notable member is Dayne Pratzky, whose activism became the subject of the 2015 documentary film, Frackman. On 21 June 2017, Drew Hutton announced his resignation as the president of the Lock the Gate Alliance via Facebook. In the post Hutton noted that he \\"made this decision with great sadness but I have serious, chronic health issues that simply won't allow me to do what is needed in such a position\\". Hundreds of tributes to his work and dedication followed this announcement. Lock the Gate's supporter base includes notable individuals from across the political spectrum, including former Greens party leader Bob Brown and conservative 2GB radio personality, Alan Jones. Despite the diverse political backgrounds and regional distribution of its member base, the Lock the Gate Alliance's opponents have labelled them a \\"green\\" group and suggested that their membership is urban and anti-development. In 2015 an editorial in Queensland's Courier Mail said of the group: \\"The mindless demonisation of industries that offer the chance to ensure the continuing prosperity of Queensland ‚Äì and therefore Queenslanders ‚Äì does nobody any favours.\\" The organisation features in the media regularly and lobbies government for stronger protections for productive agricultural land, groundwater resources and catchment areas. The organisation claimed several successes in 2014, including the cancellation of of gas licence applications, the extension of a moratorium on drilling in the state of Victoria, the declaration of 280 mining-free communities across Australia and the perpetuation of the water trigger requirement in Federal environmental approvals under the EPBC Act. The alliance supported campaigners in Bentley (NSW), Broome (WA), Gloucester (NSW), Seaspray (VIC), Maules Creek (NSW), Borroloola (NT), Narribri (NSW) and Tara (QLD).  Funding  The Lock the Gate Alliance had an operational budget of $2,127,734 in 2018/19. It is funded by grants, donations and receives in-kind support. Notable donors include Kjerulf Ainsworth, who during the two years prior to October 2012 contributed approximately $200,000 towards fund legal, travel and other expenses for Drew Hutton, to screen the documentary film Gasland in over 80 country towns and to fund activist Dayne Pratzky. Another notable donor is the American-based political body ‚ÄúTides foundation‚Äù who declared funding of $160,000 in 2013 and $275,000 in 2012 to Lock the Gate. According to forms lodged to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), a large proportion of Lock the Gate‚Äôs funding has come from undisclosed sources. For instance, in 2015 Lock the Gate received $823,000 from an undisclosed source. In 2016 Lock the Gate received $2.1 million from undisclosed grants and donations. Membership subscriptions accounts for 0.2% of their income. The Lock the Gate Alliance is listed on the Australian Government's Register of Environmental Organisations which provides them with a range of tax concessions, including the ability to receive tax-deductible gifts and contributions. This has attracted criticism from industry groups and (particularly) Senator Canavan.http://www.mattcanavan.com.au/maiden_speech_to_the_senate_tn They claim this deduction should not be available to ‚Äúaggressive activist groups‚Äù. The mining industry in particular have claimed that Lock the Gate are collecting tax breaks and should be stripped of their charity donation status. Legal experts from the Adelaide University Law School, however, warned that any move to narrow the definition of what constitutes an \\"environmental organisation\\" ‚Äì and strip them of their charitable status as a result - would represent an \\"attack on Australian democracy\\".http://www.smh.com.au/federal- politics/political-news/preventing-political-advocacy-by-environment-groups- an-attack-on-democracy-20150518-gh4dak.html  Documentary films  The Lock the Gate Alliance regularly publishes videos via YouTube. It has produced two documentary films and has featured prominently in another. The organisation uses video to inform viewers of the implications of expanding gas and mining activities in sensitive areas, document and broadcast their activities, celebrate their achievements and to draw attention to their organisation and cause. = Undermining Australia (2013) = Undermining Australia - Coal vs. Communities (2013) was written directed and edited by David Lowe.
